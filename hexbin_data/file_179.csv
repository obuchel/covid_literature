419,Model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score greater than 23 predicts length of stay in the ICU but not mortality in liver transplant recipients,2010-06-15,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score on postoperative morbidity and mortality is still elusive, especially for high MELD. There are reports of poorer patient outcome in transplant candidates with high MELD score, others though report no influence of MELD score on outcome and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 144 consecutive liver transplant recipients over a 72-month period in our transplant unit, from January 2003 until December 2008 and performed uni- and multivariate analysis for morbidity and mortality, in particular to define the influence of MELD to these parameters. RESULTS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0) but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. Furthermore, we identified transfusion of more than 7 units of red blood cells as independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 7.6) and for prolonged ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 7.8) together with transfusion of more than 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (OR 11.6). Postoperative renal failure is a strong predictor of morbidity (OR 7.9) and postoperative renal replacement therapy was highly associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio 6.8), as was hepato renal syndrome prior to transplantation (hazard ratio 13.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by ICU stay longer than 10 days but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. This finding supports the transplantation of patients with high MELD score but only with knowledge of increased morbidity.","Oberkofler, Christian E; Dutkowski, Philipp; Stocker, Reto; Schuepbach, Reto A; Stover, John F; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Béchir, Markus",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2911764/,179
832,Chinese Medicine Shenfu Injection for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2012-04-24,"Objective. Heart failure (HF) is a global public health problem. Early literature studies manifested that Shenfu injection (SFI) is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese patent medicine for HF in China. This article intended to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of SFI for HF. Methods. An extensive search was performed within 6 English and Chinese electronic database up to November 2011. Ninety-nine randomized controlled trails (RCTs) were collected, irrespective of languages. Two authors extracted data and assessed the trial quality independently. RevMan 5.0.2 was used for data analysis. Results. Compared with routine treatment and/or device support, SFI combined with routine treatment and/or device support showed better effect on clinical effect rate, mortality, heart rate, NT-proBNP and 6-minute walk distance. Results in ultrasonic cardiography also showed that SFI combined with routine treatment improved heart function of HF patients. There were no significant difference in blood pressure between SFI and routine treatment groups. Adverse events were reported in thirteen trails with thirteen specific symptoms, while no serious adverse effect was reported. Conclusion. SFI appear to be effective for treating HF. However, further rigorously designed RCTs are warranted because of insufficient methodological rigor in the majority of included trials.","Wen-Ting, Song; Fa-Feng, Cheng; Li, Xu; Cheng-Ren, Lin; Jian-Xun, Liu",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348640/,179
1377,Epidemiology of Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms in a Teaching Hospital in Oman: A One-Year Hospital-Based Study,2014-01-14,"Background. Antimicrobial resistance is increasingly recognized as a global challenge. A few studies have emerged on epidemiology of multidrug resistant organisms in tertiary care settings in the Arabian Gulf. Aim. To describe the epidemiology of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Oman. Methods. A retrospective review of MDRO records has been conducted throughout the period from January 2012 till December 2012. Organisms were identified and tested by an automated identification and susceptibility system, and the antibiotic susceptibility testing was confirmed by the disk diffusion method. Results. Out of the total of 29,245 admissions, there have been 315 patients registered as MDRO patients giving an overall prevalence rate of 10.8 (95% CI 9.3, 12.4) MDRO cases per 1000 admissions. In addition, the prevalence rate of MDRO isolates was 11.2 (95% CI 9.7, 12.9) per 1000 admissions. Overall, increasing trends in prevalence rates of MDRO patients and MDRO isolates were observed throughout the study period. Conclusion. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging challenge in Oman. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility and strict adherence to infection prevention guidelines are essential to prevent proliferation of MDRO. Along such quest, stringent antibiotic prescription guidelines are needed in the country.","Balkhair, Abdullah; Al-Farsi, Yahya M.; Al-Muharrmi, Zakariya; Al-Rashdi, Raiya; Al-Jabri, Mansoor; Neilson, Fatma; Al-Adawi, Sara S.; El-Beeli, Marah; Al-Adawi, Samir",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3914445/,179
3223,Elevated plasma angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease,2018-06-13,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an endogenous regulator of the renin angiotensin system. Increased circulating ACE2 predicts adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), but it is unknown if elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with obstructive CAD (defined as ≥50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or ≥70% stenosis in ≥ 1 other major epicardial vessel on invasive coronary angiography) and measured plasma ACE2 activity. Patients were followed up to determine if circulating ACE2 activity levels predicted the primary endpoint of MACE (cardiovascular mortality, HF or myocardial infarction). RESULTS: We recruited 79 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. The median (IQR) plasma ACE2 activity was 29.3 pmol/ml/min [21.2–41.2]. Over a median follow up of 10.5 years [9.6–10.8years], MACE occurred in 46% of patients (36 events). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, above-median plasma ACE2 activity was associated with MACE (log-rank test, p = 0.035) and HF hospitalisation (p = 0.01). After Cox multivariable adjustment, log ACE2 activity remained an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–4.72, p = 0.009) and HF hospitalisation (HR: 4.03, 95% CI: 1.42–11.5, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma ACE2 activity independently increased the hazard of adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with obstructive CAD.","Ramchand, Jay; Patel, Sheila K.; Srivastava, Piyush M.; Farouque, Omar; Burrell, Louise M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5999069/,179
3538,Successful steroid treatment for acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia: A case report,2018-12-06,"BACKGROUND: Since the acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) was first described by Beasley in 2002, some case reports of patients aged from 38 d to 80 years have been published worldwide, but there is still no standard therapy for this disease and the treatment methods remain controversial. Both steroid and immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, have been reported to be effective in some studies, but with many side effects, especially in patients of advanced age. CASE SUMMARY: We herein report an 81-year-old female patient who was admitted to our hospital due to dry cough, and breathlessness for 1 mo. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-fungal therapy, but without improvement in both symptoms and radiological findings, and her respiratory status worsened, and she required bed rest almost the whole day. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy was performed and histopathology examination confirmed the diagnosis of AFOP. She was then successfully treated with a steroid monotherapy, which resulted in a satisfactory clinical outcome without serious complications. CONCLUSION: We conclude that complete remission of AFOP can be achieved by steroid monotherapy in patients of advanced age.","Ning, Ya-Jing; Ding, Pei-Shan; Ke, Zhang-Yan; Zhang, Yan-Bei; Liu, Rong-Yu",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288515/,179
6319,Rare cause of repeated pulmonary embolism: a case of primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma and literature review,2020-03-26,"Pandemic influenza preparedness plans strongly focus on efficient mitigation strategies including social distancing, logistics and medical response. These strategies are formed by multiple decision makers before a pandemic outbreak and during the pandemic in local communities, states and nation-wide. In this paper, we model the spread of pandemic influenza in a local community, a university, and evaluate the mitigation policies. Since the development of an appropriate vaccine requires a significant amount of time and available antiviral quantities can only cover a relatively small proportion of the population, university decision makers will first focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions. These interventions include social distancing and isolation. The disease spread is modelled as differential equations-based compartmental model. The system is simulated for multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing including suspending university operations, evacuating dorms and isolation of infected individuals on campus. Although the model is built based on the preparedness plan of one of the biggest universities in the world, Arizona State University, it can easily be generalized for other colleges and universities. The policies and the decisions are tested by several simulation runs and evaluations of the mitigation strategies are presented in the paper.","Araz, O M; Lant, T; Fowler, J W; Jehn, M",J Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099900/,179

11419,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura risk by live, inactivated and simultaneous vaccinations among Japanese adults, children and infants: a matched case–control study",2020-04-06,"To investigate the use of two-site regional oxygen saturations (rSO(2)) and end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) to assess the effectiveness of resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Eight mechanically ventilated juvenile swine underwent 28 ventricular fibrillatory arrests with open cardiac massage. Cardiac massage was administered to achieve target pulmonary blood flow (PBF) as a percentage of pre-cardiac arrest baseline. Non-invasive data, including, EtCO(2), cerebral rSO(2) (C-rSO(2)) and renal rSO(2) (R-rSO(2)) were collected continuously. Our data demonstrate the ability to measure both rSO(2) and EtCO(2) during CPR and after ROSC. During resuscitation EtCO(2) had a strong correlation with goal CO with r = 0.83 (p < 0.001) 95% CI [0.67–0.92]. Both C-rSO(2) and R-rSO(2) had moderate and statistically significant correlation with CO with r = 0.52 (p = 0.003) 95% CI (0.19–0.74) and 0.50 (p = 0.004) 95% CI [0.16–0.73]. The AUCs for sudden increase of EtCO(2), C-rSO(2), and R-rSO(2) at ROSC were 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.94], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.8–0.94], and 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96–1.00] respectively. Measurement of continuous EtCO(2) and rSO(2) may be used during CPR to ensure effective chest compressions. Moreover, both rSO(2) and EtCO(2) may be used to detect ROSC in a swine pediatric ventricular fibrillatory arrest model.","Al-Subu, Awni M.; Hacker, Timothy A.; Eickhoff, Jens C.; Ofori-Amanfo, George; Eldridge, Marlowe W.",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223879/,179
11478,Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular cannulation of the brachiocephalic vein may reduce central line–associated bloodstream infection in preterm infants,2020-05-07,"PURPOSE: Abusive head trauma (AHT) is the leading cause of fatal head injuries for children under 2 years. The objective was to evaluate, using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), whether children with AHT have a similar neurovascular response to injury compared with children without AHT. METHODS: Retrospective sub-analysis of previously prospectively acquired data in a pediatric intensive care unit in a level 1 trauma hospital. TCD was performed daily until hospital day 8, discharge, or death. Neurologic outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E Peds) at 1 month from initial injury. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children aged 1 day to 17 years with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury were enrolled. Fifteen children suffered AHT and 54 had no suspicion for AHT. Fifteen children with AHT underwent 80 serial TCD examinations; 54 children without AHT underwent 308 exams. After standardization for age and gender normative values, there was no statistically significant difference in mean cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (V(MCA)) between children with and without AHT. There was no difference in the incidence of extreme cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, greater or less than 2 standard deviations from normative value) between groups. Within the AHT group, there were no statistically significant differences in V(MCA) between children with a favorable (GOS-E Peds 1–4) versus unfavorable neurologic outcome (GOS-E Peds 5–8). CONCLUSION: Children with AHT have no significant differences in V(MCA) or percentage of extreme CBFV in the middle cerebral artery compared to with those without AHT.","Lovett, Marlina E.; Maa, Tensing; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; O’Brien, Nicole F.",Childs Nerv Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224000/,179

Past research has confirmed that relational mobility varies across nations, but no large-scale study has examined the degree to which relational mobility may vary within a single nation. We report two studies (Study 1, N = 647; Study 2, N = 7343) exploring within-country similarity or variability in relational mobility across all 27 states and five geo-socio-political regions in the continent-size country of Brazil. Results confirmed the measurement equivalence of the Relational Mobility Scale across respondents from all Brazilian states. Notably, relational mobility scores were uniform across Brazilian regions and states, indicating a common national culture regarding the amount of opportunities Brazilians have in selecting new relationship partners within their social context. Replicating existing findings, relational mobility was positively associated with pro-active tendencies that help people retain relationships—levels of intimacy and self-disclosure toward a close friend—indicating that friends tend to feel closer intimacy to their close friends, and reveal serious personal information to a larger degree in social contexts where opportunities to find and retain relationships with like-minded others are greater.","Milfont, Taciano L.; Thomson, Robert; Yuki, Masaki",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7332055/,179
12668,Clinical Trials for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Global Guidance During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-08-07,"INTRODUCTION: Only limited data are available regarding the long-term prognosis of patients with high-grade glioma discharged alive from the intensive care unit. We sought to quantify 1-year mortality and evaluate the association between mortality and (1) functional status, and (2) management of anticancer therapy in patients with high-grade glioma discharged alive from the intensive care unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients with high-grade glioma admitted to two intensive care units between January 2009 and June 2018. Functional status was assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Status. Anticancer therapy after discharge was classified as (1) continued (unchanged), (2) modified (changed or stopped), or (3) initiated (for newly diagnosed disease). RESULTS: Ninety-one high-grade glioma patients (73% of whom had glioblastoma) were included and 78 (86%) of these patients were discharged alive from the intensive care unit. Anticancer therapy was continued, modified, and initiated in 41%, 42%, and 17% of patients, respectively. Corticosteroid therapy at the time of ICU admission [odds ratio (OR) 0.07] and cancer progression (OR 0.09) was independently associated with continuation of anticancer therapy. The mortality rate 1 year after ICU admission was 73%. On multivariate analysis, continuation of anticancer therapy (OR 0.18) and Karnofsky performance status on admission (OR 0.90) were independently associated with lower 1-year mortality. CONCLUSION: The presence of high-grade glioma is not sufficient to justify refusal of intensive care unit admission. Performance status and continuation of anticancer therapy are associated with higher survival after intensive care unit discharge.

This study reports on a program evaluation of MomMoodBooster, a coach-supported internet-delivered CBT program for the treatment of maternal depression in veteran women. Repeated measures ANOVA, run with this sample of 326 women, demonstrated an overall positive effect size across outcome measures and engagement with no differences found between rural women and their urban counterparts. Some differences between urban and rural participants were found in total and average time spent with coaches as well as ratings of coach helpfulness, possibly indicating some cultural differences between coaches and rural women that need to be addressed.

13386,Echocardiography in Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Complications,2020-09-01,"Almost every kind of inflammation in the human body is accompanied by rising C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. This can include bacterial and viral infection, chronic inflammation and so-called sterile inflammation triggered by (internal) acute tissue injury. CRP is part of the ancient humoral immune response and secreted into the circulation by the liver upon respective stimuli. Its main immunological functions are the opsonization of biological particles (bacteria and dead or dying cells) for their clearance by macrophages and the activation of the classical complement pathway. This not only helps to eliminate pathogens and dead cells, which is very useful in any case, but unfortunately also to remove only slightly damaged or inactive human cells that may potentially regenerate with more CRP-free time. CRP action severely aggravates the extent of tissue damage during the acute phase response after an acute injury and therefore negatively affects clinical outcome. CRP is therefore a promising therapeutic target to rescue energy-deprived tissue either caused by ischemic injury (e.g., myocardial infarction and stroke) or by an overcompensating immune reaction occurring in acute inflammation (e.g., pancreatitis) or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; e.g., after transplantation or surgery). Selective CRP apheresis can remove circulating CRP safely and efficiently. We explain the pathophysiological reasoning behind therapeutic CRP apheresis and summarize the broad span of indications in which its application could be beneficial with a focus on ischemic stroke as well as the results of this therapeutic approach after myocardial infarction.","Kayser, Stefan; Brunner, Patrizia; Althaus, Katharina; Dorst, Johannes; Sheriff, Ahmed",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7564224/,179

However, little is known about African women’s experiences with vaginal pessary use. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences of vaginal pessary use among Tanzanian women who had received long-term pessary treatment for stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: 15 semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted over a 2-month period in 2019 with Tanzanian women living in the Kilimanjaro Region who suffered from stress urinary incontinence and who had been using a pessary for at least 18 months. The interview transcripts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The primary motivation for seeking treatment were discomfort from symptoms, social consequences and low quality of life. Perceived benefits from pessary use included improved quality of life with reacquired abilities to perform daily activities, participate in social gatherings, feeling symptom relief and improved sexual relations. Further, some women saw pessary treatment as superior to other locally available treatment options. Perceived barriers for pessary use included shame, husband’s disapproval, limited access to treatment and lack of knowledge among the women as well as healthcare personnel. CONCLUSION: Vaginal pessaries are well-perceived as a long-term treatment method among Tanzanian women suffering from stress urinary incontinence.

15464,Post‐traumatic cerebral fat embolism syndrome with a favourable outcome: a case report,2021-02-18,"BACKGROUND: The brain of chronically ventilated preterm human infants is vulnerable to collateral damage during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Damage is manifest, in part, by learning and memory impairments, which are hippocampal functions. A molecular regulator of hippocampal development is insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). A gentler ventilation strategy is noninvasive respiratory support (NRS). We tested the hypotheses that NRS leads to greater levels of IGF1 messenger RNA (mRNA) variants and distinct epigenetic profile along the IGF1 gene locus in the hippocampus compared to IMV. METHODS: Preterm lambs were managed by NRS or IMV for 3 or 21 days. Isolated hippocampi were analyzed for IGF1 mRNA levels and splice variants for promoter 1 (P1), P2, and IGF1A and 1B, DNA methylation in P1 region, and histone covalent modifications along the gene locus. RESULTS: NRS had significantly greater levels of IGF1 P1 (predominant transcript), and 1A and 1B mRNA variants compared to IMV at 3 or 21 days. NRS also led to more DNA methylation and greater occupancy of activating mark H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me(3)), repressive mark H3K27me(3), and elongation mark H3K36me(3) compared to IMV. CONCLUSIONS: NRS leads to distinct IGF1 mRNA variant levels and epigenetic profile in the hippocampus compared to IMV. IMPACT: Our study shows that 3 or 21 days of NRS of preterm lambs leads to distinct IGF1 mRNA variant levels and epigenetic profile in the hippocampus compared to IMV. Preterm infant studies suggest that NRS leads to better neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life versus IMV. Also, duration of IMV is directly related to hippocampal damage; however, molecular players remain unknown. NRS, as a gentler mode of respiratory management of preterm neonates, may reduce damage to the immature hippocampus through an epigenetic mechanism.","Ke, Xingrao; Xing, Bohan; Dahl, Mar Janna; Alvord, Jeremy; McKnight, Robert A.; Lane, Robert H.; Albertine, Kurt H.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7891485/,179
15491,Appearance of Acute Inflammatory State Indicates Improvement in Atopic Dermatitis Cases Under Classical Homeopathic Treatment: A Case Series,2021-02-11,"This study aimed to identify Brazilian dietary patterns and their associations with health, lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. Data from the Brazilian National Health Survey conducted in 2013 were used. A questionnaire was applied containing 22 items related to dietary consumption. Dietary patterns were determined through factor analysis (FA). Poisson regression models, with robust variance, were used to identify associations between dietary patterns and independents variables. Statistical significance was defined as p-value<0.05. Data were analysed for 60,202 adults (estimated population size: 146,308,458). FA identified three dietary patterns: healthy, protein, and western. The younger age group (18–24 years) had a lower adherence to the healthy pattern (PR:0.53; 95%CI:0.49–0.58) and greater adherence to the protein (PR:1.52; 95%CI:1.42–1.62) and western (PR:1.80; 95%CI:1.68–1.93) patterns compared to the elderly (≥60 years). Women had a greater association with the healthy pattern (PR:1.32; 95%CI:1.28–1.38) and lower association with the protein pattern (PR:0.80; 95%CI:0.77–0.82) compared to men. Illiterate participants showed lower adherence to the healthy (PR:0.58; 95%CI:0.53–0.63) and western (PR:0.54; 95%CI:0.48–0.62) patterns compared to those with higher educational levels. Smokers had lower adherence to the healthy (PR:0.76; 95%CI:0.71–0.81) and higher adherence to the protein (PR:1.14; 95%CI:1.11–1.19) patterns compared to non-smokers.

15599,Plasma mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with acute lung injury and mortality in septic patients,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Influenza places a significant burden on global health and economics. Individual case management and public health efforts to mitigate the spread of influenza are both strongly impacted by our ability to accurately and efficiently detect influenza viruses in clinical samples. Therefore, it is important to understand the performance characteristics of available assays to detect influenza in a variety of settings. We provide the first report of relative performance between two products marketed to streamline detection of influenza virus in the context of a highly controlled volunteer influenza challenge study. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected during a controlled A/California/2009/H1N1 influenza challenge study and analyzed for detection of virus shedding using a validated qRT-PCR (qPCR) assay, a sample-to-answer qRT-PCR device (BioMerieux BioFire FilmArray RP), and an immunoassay based rapid test kit (Quidel QuickVue Influenza A + B Test). RESULTS: Relative to qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the BioFire assay was 72.1% [63.7–79.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)] and 93.5% (89.3–96.4%, 95% CI) respectively. For the QuickVue rapid test the sensitivity was 8.5% (4.8–13.7%, 95% CI) and specificity was 99.2% (95.6–100%, 95% CI). CONCLUSION: Relative to qPCR, the BioFire assay had superior performance compared to rapid test in the context of a controlled influenza challenge study.

15735,Response to letter from Verdura et al,2021-01-23,"There is clear evidence to suggest that diabetes does not affect all populations equally. Among adults living with diabetes, those from ethnoracial minority communities—foreign-born, immigrant, refugee, and culturally marginalized—are at increased risk of poor health outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is actively being researched as a means of improving diabetes management and care; however, several factors may predispose AI to ethnoracial bias. To better understand whether diabetes AI interventions are being designed in an ethnoracially equitable manner, we conducted a secondary analysis of 141 articles included in a 2018 review by Contreras and Vehi entitled “Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management and Decision Support: Literature Review.” Two members of our research team independently reviewed each article and selected those reporting ethnoracial data for further analysis. Only 10 articles (7.1%) were ultimately selected for secondary analysis in our case study. Of the 131 excluded articles, 118 (90.1%) failed to mention participants’ ethnic or racial backgrounds. The included articles reported ethnoracial data under various categories, including race (n=6), ethnicity (n=2), race/ethnicity (n=3), and percentage of Caucasian participants (n=1). Among articles specifically reporting race, the average distribution was 69.5% White, 17.1% Black, and 3.7% Asian. Only 2 articles reported inclusion of Native American participants. Given the clear ethnic and racial differences in diabetes biomarkers, prevalence, and outcomes, the inclusion of ethnoracial training data is likely to improve the accuracy of predictive models. Such considerations are imperative in AI-based tools, which are predisposed to negative biases due to their black-box nature and proneness to distributional shift. Based on our findings, we propose a short questionnaire to assess ethnoracial equity in research describing AI-based diabetes interventions. At this unprecedented time in history, AI can either mitigate or exacerbate disparities in health care. Future accounts of the infancy of diabetes AI must reflect our early and decisive action to confront ethnoracial inequities before they are coded into our systems and perpetuate the very biases we aim to eliminate. If we take deliberate and meaningful steps now toward training our algorithms to be ethnoracially inclusive, we can architect innovations in diabetes care that are bound by the diverse fabric of our society.","Pham, Quynh; Gamble, Anissa; Hearn, Jason; Cafazzo, Joseph A",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7904401/,179

By interacting with heavy metals, gut and food-derived microbes can actively and/or passively modulate (by adsorption and/or sequestration) the bioavailability of these toxins inside the gut. This “intestinal bioremediation” involves the selection of safe microbes specifically able to immobilize metals. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to investigate the in vitro ability of 225 bacteria to remove the potentially harmful trace elements lead, cadmium, and aluminum. Interspecies and intraspecies comparisons were performed among the Firmicutes (mostly lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus spp., with some Lactococcus, Pediococcus, and Carnobacterium representatives), Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The removal of a mixture of lead and cadmium was also investigated. Although the objective of the study was not to elucidate the mechanisms of heavy metal removal for each strain and each metal, we nevertheless identified promising candidate bacteria as probiotics for the intestinal bioremediation of Pb(II) and Cd(II).","George, Fanny; Mahieux, Séverine; Daniel, Catherine; Titécat, Marie; Beauval, Nicolas; Houcke, Isabelle; Neut, Christel; Allorge, Delphine; Borges, Frédéric; Jan, Gwénaël; Foligné, Benoît; Garat, Anne",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926695/,179

In particular, very preterm (VP) infants display anomalies in controlling attention and gathering task-relevant information. Early interventions that support attention control may be pivotal in providing a secure base for VP children’s later attainments. The Attention Control Training (ACT) is a cognitive training intervention that targets infants’ abilities to select visual information according to varying task demands but had not been tested in VP infants. We conducted a feasibility study to test the processes we intend to use in a trial delivering the ACT to VP infants. METHODS AND DESIGN: We tested recruitment and retention of VP infants and their families in a randomised trial, as well as acceptability and completion of baseline and outcome measures. To evaluate these aims, we used descriptive quantitative statistics and qualitative methods to analyse feedback from infants’ caregivers. We also investigated the quality of eye-tracking data collected and indicators of infants’ engagement in the training, using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twelve VP infants were recruited, and 10 (83%) completed the study. Participants’ parents had high education attainment. The rate of completion of baseline and outcome measures was optimal. VP infants demonstrated engagement in the training, completing on average 84 min of training over three visits, and displaying improved performance during this training. Eye-tracking data quality was moderate, but this did not interfere with infants’ engagement in the training. DISCUSSION: The results suggest the ACT can be delivered to VP infants. However, challenges remain in recruitment of numerous and diverse samples. We discuss strategies to overcome these challenges informed by results of this study.

17025,MicroRNAs in Basolateral Amygdala Associated with Stress and Fear Memories Regulate Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Rats,2021-04-12,"Triazole-resistance has been reported increasingly in Aspergillus fumigatus. An international expert team proposed to avoid triazole monotherapy for the initial treatment of invasive aspergillosis in regions with >10% environmental-resistance, but this prevalence is largely unknown for most American and African countries. Here, we screened 584 environmental samples (soil) from urban and rural locations in Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru in Latin America and Benin and Nigeria in Africa for triazole-resistant A. fumigatus. Samples were screened using triazole-containing agars and confirmed as triazole-resistant by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) broth dilution reference method. Isolates were further characterized by cyp51A sequencing and short-tandem repeat typing. Fungicide presence in samples was likewise determined. Among A. fumigatus positive samples, triazole-resistance was detected in 6.9% (7/102) of samples in Mexico, 8.3% (3/36) in Paraguay, 9.8% (6/61) in Peru, 2.2% (1/46) in Nigeria, and none in Benin. Cyp51A gene mutations were present in most of the triazole-resistant isolates (88%; 15/17). The environmentally-associated mutations TR(34)/L98H and TR(46)/Y121F/T289A were prevalent in Mexico and Peru, and isolates harboring these mutations were closely related. For the first time, triazole-resistant A. fumigatus was found in environmental samples in Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Nigeria with a prevalence of 7–10% in the Latin American countries. Our findings emphasize the need to establish triazole-resistance surveillance programs in these countries.","Resendiz-Sharpe, Agustin; Dewaele, Klaas; Merckx, Rita; Bustamante, Beatriz; Vega-Gomez, Maria Celeste; Rolon, Miriam; Jacobs, Jan; Verweij, Paul E.; Maertens, Johan; Lagrou, Katrien",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070258/,179

Infectious pathogens, such as viruses known to cause respiratory tract infections, are common examples of being transmitted by fomites. However, the load of the particular pathogen on these inanimate surfaces is a crucial factor for the transmission. The current study aims at investigating the load of one such viral pathogen on the surfaces of commonly used materials. METHODS: Based on the cycle threshold (Ct) values in the diagnostic system using gene amplification for the considered viral pathogen, we categorized the positive samples for high (17 to < 24), moderate (24 to < 31), or mild (31 to < 38) viral load. Five randomly selected samples from each of these category were smeared on commonly used cardboard surface (absorbent surface) and stainless steel (non-absorbent surface). After an observation duration of 90 min, samples from the surfaces were analyzed again for gene amplification using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Viral load/titter positively correlated with the viral material on either of these investigated surfaces post-observation duration. Higher viral load (low Ct) samples exhibited higher probability of being detected on the surfaces than those samples with lower/moderate (high Ct) viral load. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Common inanimate surfaces are potential source of the viral transmission, however the viral load on these surfaces are key determinant of such transmission.","Singh, Dhirendra P.; Sahu, Mahesh C.; Pagdhune, Avinash; Viramgami, Ankit; Perumal, Sivaperumal; Balachandar, Rakesh; Sarkar, Kamalesh",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138384/,179

However, when administered orally, reduced absorption and bioavailability can occur due to chelation in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) with multivalent metal cations acquired from diet, coadministered compounds (sucralfate, didanosine), or drug formulation. Predicting the extent to which this interaction reduces in vivo antibiotic absorption and systemic exposure remains desirable yet challenging. In this study, we focus on quinolone interactions with magnesium, calcium and aluminum as found in dietary supplements, antacids (Maalox) orally administered therapies (sucralfate, didanosine). The effect of FQ–metal complexation on absorption rate was investigated through a combined molecular and pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling study. Quantum mechanical calculations elucidated FQ–metal binding energies, which were leveraged to predict the magnitude of reduced bioavailability via a quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR). This work will help inform clinical FQ formulation design, alert to possible dietary effects, and shed light on drug–drug interactions resulting from coadministration at an earlier stage in the drug development pipeline.","Walden, Daniel M.; Khotimchenko, Maksim; Hou, Hypatia; Chakravarty, Kaushik; Varshney, Jyotika",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8143323/,179
18167,The role of combination therapy in the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem resistant gram-negatives: a systematic review of clinical studies,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is characterized by the worst headache of life and associated with long-term opioid use. Discrete pain trajectories predict chronic opioid use following other etiologies of acute pain, but it is unknown whether they exist following SAH. If discrete pain trajectories following SAH exist, it is uncertain whether they predict long-term opioid use. We sought to characterize pain trajectories after SAH and determine whether they are associated with persistent opioid use. METHODS: We reviewed pain scores from patients admitted to a single tertiary care center for SAH from November 2015 to September 2019. Group-based trajectory modeling identified discrete pain trajectories during hospitalization. We compared outcomes across trajectory groups using χ(2) and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Multivariable regression determined whether trajectory group membership was an independent predictor of long-term opioid use, defined as continued use at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS: We identified five discrete pain trajectories among 305 patients. Group 1 remained pain free. Group 2 reported low scores with intermittent spikes and slight increase over time. Group 3 noted increasing pain severity through day 7 with mild improvement until day 14. Group 4 experienced maximum pain with steady decrement over time. Group 5 reported moderate pain with subtle improvement. In multivariable analysis, trajectory groups 3 (odds ratio [OR] 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–8.3) and 5 (OR 8.0; 95% CI 3.1–21.1), history of depression (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.3–10.0) and racial/ethnic minority (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.3–4.1) were associated with continued opioid use at follow-up (median 62 days following admission, interquartile range 48–96).

Paradoxically, health care provision is a significant driver of environmental pollution, with surgical and anesthetic services among the most resource-intensive components of the health system. OBJECTIVES: This analysis aimed to summarize the state of life cycle assessment (LCA) practice as applied to surgical and anesthetic care via review of extant literature assessing environmental impacts of related services, procedures, equipment, and pharmaceuticals. METHODS: A state-of-the-science review was undertaken following a registered protocol and a standardized, LCA-specific reporting framework. Three bibliographic databases (Scopus®, PubMed, and Embase®) and the gray literature were searched. Inclusion criteria were applied, eligible entries critically appraised, and key methodological data and results extracted. RESULTS: From 1,316 identified records, 44 studies were eligible for inclusion. The annual climate impact of operating surgical suites ranged between 3,200,000 and [Formula: see text]. The climate impact of individual surgical procedures varied considerably, with estimates ranging from [Formula: see text]. Anesthetic gases; single-use equipment; and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system operation were the main emissions hot spots identified among operating room- and procedure-specific analyses. Single-use equipment used in surgical settings was generally more harmful than equivalent reusable items across a range of environmental parameters. Life cycle inventories have been assembled and associated climate impacts calculated for three anesthetic gases ([Formula: see text]) and 20 injectable anesthetic drugs ([Formula: see text]). DISCUSSION: Despite the recent proliferation of surgical and anesthesiology-related LCAs, extant studies address a miniscule fraction of the numerous services, procedures, and products available today. Methodological heterogeneity, external validity, and a lack of background life cycle inventory data related to many essential surgical and anesthetic inputs are key limitations of the current evidence base.

19521,Is Perception Reality?: Mentorship in Cardiology,2021-04-21,"Introduction: A nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) is a singular professional environment, exposing personnel to isolation and confinement amidst sophisticated technology for the duration of a mission. Submariners see their mood and cognition deteriorate as their mission progresses. With regard to the benefits of physical activity (PA) on mental health, this study evaluates the impact of regular PA on the maintenance of thymia and sensory functioning during patrols. Method: This pragmatic exploratory cohort follow-up study included 29 volunteer submariners before, during and 1 month after return from patrol. PA practice was evaluated by a daily self-questionnaire. This allowed submariners to be classified into two groups according to the median of the total duration in minutes of a sport practiced during the patrol (PA practicing submariners and non-practicing). Changes in mood and psychological activation, health (including sleep), unipodal stability, and accommodation distances were compared between the two groups over the period of the patrol. Results: Overall thymic functioning deteriorated during the patrol. Submariners who practice PA maintain a stable level of activation unlike non-practicing PA submariners, but they exhibited both worse general health and sleep at recovery. For these personnel, postural control is better at the end of the patrol and far visual accommodation tends to be preserved. Conclusion: PA during patrol alone is not sufficient to compensate for the thymic dysregulation induced by the SSBN environment. Nevertheless, it seems to help in maintaining an exteroceptive functioning. This exploratory study suggests directions for possible future research on physical activity associated with sensory stimulation amongst submariners, and more generally amongst people working in isolated and confined environments.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Lefranc, Barbara; Moelo, Alan; Poupon, Charlotte; Pontis, Julien; Vannier, Alexandre; Trousselard, Marion",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310999/,179

The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable, personalized signature based on immune genes to predict the prognosis of GAC. Here, we identified two groups of patients with significantly different prognoses by performing unsupervised clustering analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database based on 881 immune genes. The immune signature was constructed with a training set composed of 350 GAC samples from the TCGA and subsequently validated with 431 samples from GSE84437, 432 samples from GSE26253, and 145 GAC samples from real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction data. This classification system can also be used to predict prognosis in different clinical subgroups. Further analysis suggested that high-risk patients were characterized by low immune scores, distinctive immune cell proportions, different immune checkpoint profiles, and a low tumor mutational burden. Ultimately, the signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor. In general, the signature can accurately predict recurrence and overall survival in patients with GAC and may serve as a powerful prognostic tool to further optimize cancer immunotherapy.","Mao, Rui; Liu, Kehao; Zhao, Nana; Guo, Pengsen; Wu, Yingxin; Wang, Zheng; Liu, Yanjun; Zhang, Tongtong",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8312416/,179

The need for a new paradigm of foreign investment and aid in agricultural production is becoming exigent in developing countries. Given the decline in per capita arable land, the rise in production costs, and the increase in population and urbanization, major changes in agriculture have been proposed to boost agricultural production. This present study endeavours to contribute to the existing literature by proving whether foreign capital and economic freedom could catapult food production into the much-anticipated growth. In that regard, we performed GLS with correlated disturbances, system GMM dynamic panel data estimators and D-H causality test. The study found that foreign capital as a whole plays a positive role in food production in developing and least developed countries, but FDI is insignificant in least-developed countries. Moreover, economic freedom plays a positive role in food production in least-developed countries but negative in developing countries.

In order to reduce the interference of human factors and the measurement error as much as possible, this experiment adopts the blind design and analyzes the digital format X-ray films by using the computer software ImageJ. Because the tangent line between the outer plates of the anterior and posterior margin of the foramen magnum was not accurately located on the X-ray film, the angle formed by the line between the saddle dorsal slope and the center point of the anterior and posterior nodule with a clear display was selected as the measurement method of the angle between the atlanto-occipital joints. The results showed that the lateral cervical curvature of the VCS group was 0.43 ± 0.51, and the lateral cervical curvature of the CSR group was 0.46 ± 0.49, both of which were significantly lower than the normal value (1.2 ± 0.5 cm). Patients in both groups had the characteristic of cervical curvature straightening. The changes of cervical curvature in overflexion and overextension positions can indirectly reflect the state of cervical motion. The anterior flexion neck curve of the VCS group was less than that of the CSR group (P < 0.05). Compared with the CSR group, VCS showed limited cervical anterior flexion movement. In this study, X-ray films of both CSR and VCS showed occipitocervical flexion and extension disorders, cervical curvature straightening, and lower cervical instability. In VCS, occipitocervical flexion and extension disorders were mainly manifested in atlantoaxial flexion disorders, while in CSR, atlanto-occipitocervical flexion and extension disorders were mainly manifested in atlantoaxial flexion disorders.","Chen, Xue; Xue, Pan; Shi, Yuanyuan; Chen, Si",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8384534/,179

PW from the produce industry was collected periodically from the washing tanks of commercial facilities. The analysis of coliphages was performed by plaque assay, while the occurrence of enteric viruses and crAssphage was determined by molecular techniques. Significant differences in the physicochemical composition of PW, mostly due to the different nature of fresh produce types and differences in the sanitizer used in commercial operation, were observed. Accumulation of crAssphage and coliphages was observed in PW, but correlation with human enteric viruses was not possible due to the low prevalence of these pathogens in the PW analyzed.

21674,Challenges in Diagnosing Occupational Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,2021-08-30,"Background: The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) is a commonly used self-reporting questionnaire used to measure adult attachment styles. The RQ has two parts. RQ1, a single item where individuals have to indicate their preferred relationship style, and RQ2, where individuals can rate their relationship style in more detail using four different scales. Agreement is expected between the highest levels selected and the style chosen in RQ1. An advantage of the RQ is its brevity, whereas a disadvantage is that it constitutes a single item. A validation of RQ has not been clearly demonstrated, even though it has convergent validity in relation to other measurements in this area. Methods: 168 patients completed the RQ, the short version of the Experience in Close Relationships (Revised) questionnaire (ECR-R), and scales of depression and interpersonal problems. Regression analysis was conducted to examine the congruity in regard to attachment theory. Results: ratings from 15.5% of the patients showed disagreement between RQ1 and RQ2. Each type of attachment measured by the RQ was predicted by the ECR-R scores, as hypothesized. In the predictive analysis of depression and interpersonal problems, both RQ dimensions and ECR-R scores were coherent. Conclusions: RQ is a valid self-reported measurement that can be applied clinically on the condition that the rater identifies an agreement between RQ1 and RQ2.","Wongpakaran, Nahathai; DeMaranville, Justin; Wongpakaran, Tinakon",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470855/,179

One reason for this is a lack of understanding of the complex interactions between bacteriophage, bacteria and eukaryotic hosts. These three-component interactions are complex, with non-linear or synergistic relationships, anatomical barriers and genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity all leading to disparity between performance and efficacy in in vivo versus in vitro environments. Realistic computer or mathematical models of these complex environments are a potential route to improve the predictive power of in vitro studies for the in vivo environment, and to streamline lab work. Here, we introduce and review the current status of mathematical modeling and highlight that data on genetic heterogeneity and mutational stochasticity, time delays and population densities could be critical in the development of realistic phage therapy models in the future. With this in mind, we aim to inform and encourage the collaboration and sharing of knowledge and expertise between microbiologists and theoretical modelers, synergising skills and smoothing the road to regulatory approval and widespread use of phage therapy.","Styles, Kathryn M.; Brown, Aidan T.; Sagona, Antonia P.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490754/,179

The amplified PCR products of TGEV HB06 were cloned, sequenced, and compared with other TGEV strains genes selected from the GenBank. Then, the recombinant fragment in pMD18-T was subcloned into corresponding sites of prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI to construct a recombinant fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-M. Then, the verified recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rossetta (DE3), and the expression of M fusion protein was induced by using isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) as inducer. The results showed that the gene fragment of M at a length of 789 bp was amplified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T successfully, and sequence comparison with that reported in GenBank revealed that the M gene complete sequence shares more than 94% homology in nucleotide. The result of SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant membrane protein had a molecular mass of approximately 56 kDa, which was the same as the expected results. It was proven by Western blotting that the recombinant membrane protein had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody. Therefore, the expressed fusion protein has a good antigenicity. This work established a good foundation for further studies on the production of anti-TGEV vaccines.","Zhang, Xiaobo; Zuo, Yuzhu; Fan, Jinghui; Liu, Yuan",Front Agric China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088581/,179

Once a relatively uncommon cause of human disease, cryptococcal infection can develop in apparently immunocompetent hosts and has emerged as an important opportunistic infection in humans over the past several decades as immunocompromised populations expand in the setting of HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, malignancies, and treatment for other conditions. Clinical manifestations are myriad but pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) infections are the most common. Improvements in diagnostic testing and standardized approaches to antifungal therapy, when available, have made considerable impact in the management of this infection. While the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the outcome of cryptococcosis in many HIV-infected patients, cryptococcosis remains an entity of considerable morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, and restoration of host immunity can present management challenges that require individualized management. As immunocompromised populations continue to expand, it is likely that cryptococcosis will remain an important opportunistic fungal infection of humans requiring ongoing investigation.","Maziarz, Eileen K.; Perfect, John R.",Diagnosis and Treatment of Fungal Infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122569/,179

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and respiratory viral infections are of particular concern, and the incidence, definition, and other features are reviewed. Currently, standard prevention guidelines exist for selected HAIs, and so the prevention approach for each infection must be considered separately. Prevention strategies have emerged through collaborative efforts, as well as measurement of both process and outcome data. Measurement includes surveillance of infection occurrence; identification and reporting of prevention methods, such as bundles; and the outcomes associated with these approaches. These prevention and measurement approaches are only successful when approached collaboratively with engagement across the entire healthcare team. Through continued measurement and process improvement based on the data collected, more sustainable approaches to infection prevention can be developed. With systematic effort, the occurrence of HAI should be reduced, and patient harm will be prevented.","Hoffman, James M.; Wong Quiles, Chris I.; Crumby, Ashley; Adderson, Elisabeth E.",Patient Safety and Quality in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122680/,179

The structural features of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot in different ion concentration, the unfolding process of the RNA pseudoknot, and the two hairpin helices that constitute the RNA pseudoknot were studied with all atom molecule dynamics simulation method in this paper. We found that the higher cation concentration can cause structure of the RNA molecules more stable, and ions played an indispensable role in keeping the structure of RNA molecules stable; the unfolding process of hairpin structure was corresponding to the antiprocess of its folding process. The main pathway of pseudoknot unfolding was that the inner base pair opened first, and then, the two helices, which formed the RNA pseudoknot opened decussately, while the folding pathway of the RNA pseudoknot was a helix folding after formation of the other helix. Therefore, the unfolding process of RNA pseudoknot is different from the antiprocess of its folding process, and the unfolding process of each helix in the RNA pseudoknot is similar to the hairpin structure’s unfolding process, which means that both are the unzipping process.","Guo, Yun; Zhang, Wenbing",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149040/,179

36144,Heart rupture repair during huge mediastinal mass resection – case report,2020-07-06,"In a learning situation, feedback is of great importance in order to help a student to correct a possible misconception. However, previous research shows that many students tend to avoid feedback regarding failures, including critical constructive feedback (CCF) that is intended to support and guide them. This is especially true for lower-achieving students, who might perceive feedback as an ego-threat, and therefore protect themselves by neglecting it. However, it has been shown that such neglect can be suppressed by using teachable agents (TA’s). Another, but less studied factor that influences feedback acceptance is the degree or extent of failure when trying to solve a task. The present study explores if and how momentary performance levels influence middle school students’ willingness to accept CCF when playing an educational game in history – with or without a TA. On the basis of teacher assessments of the students’ general skills, data logs and analyses of sequential patterns, we concluded that the willingness to accept CCF differs between students, but also between conditions and situations. One major finding is that a TA supports the students to more readily embrace CCF, even if the effect is larger for lower-achieving students. Another finding is that indications of being far from succeeding, such as low success rates or repeated trials and revisions, have a negative impact on feedback acceptance, even if a TA mitigates some of this influence. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to meta-cognitive aspects of learning and to educational software design.","Ternblad, Eva-Maria; Tärning, Betty",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334178/,179

A total of 137 fecal specimens from patients with severe HFMD were collected. Enterovirus (EV) types were determined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT nested PCR, and sequencing. Sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics programs. Of 137 specimens tested, 97 (70.8%), 12 (8.8%), and 10 (7.3%) were positive for EV-A71, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), and CVA16, respectively. Other pathogens detected included CVA2 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA10 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA5 (0.7%, 1/137), echovirus 6 (E6) (0.7%, 1/137) and E18 (0.7%, 1/137). The most frequent complication in patients with proven EV infections was myoclonic jerk, followed by aseptic encephalitis, tachypnea, and vomiting. The frequencies of vomiting and abnormal eye movements were higher in EV-A71-infected patients than that in CVA6-infected or CVA16-infected patients. Molecular phylogeny based on the complete VP1 gene revealed no association between the subgenotype of the virus and disease severity. Nevertheless, 12 significant mutations that were likely to be associated with virulence or the clinical phenotype were observed in the 5’UTR, 2A(pro), 2C, 3A, 3D(pol) and 3’UTR of CVA6. Eight significant mutations were observed in the 5’UTR, 2B, 3A, 3D(pol) and 3’UTR of CVA16, and 10 significant mutations were observed in the 5’UTR, VP1, 3A and 3C(pro) of CVA10. In conclusion, EV-A71 is still the main pathogen causing severe HFMD, although other EV types can also cause severe complications. Potential virulence or phenotype-associated sites were identified in the genomes of CVA6, CVA16, and CVA10.

There is an implicit assumption that the technological innovations of Tourism 4.0 work better for the benefits of tourists. However, even marvels of tourism information technology often come with a serious lack of human-centered design. The unprecedented speed of development and implementation of Tourism 4.0 technology further adds to this neglect. In addition, traditional approaches to designing the user experience of interactive systems are now seriously challenged by the disruption of traditional views on the goals of system use, more complex user roles, and the dynamic and hybrid context of the use. The powerful capabilities of Tourism 4.0 technologies allow for the enhancement of interaction with a system and enrichment of the tourist experience itself, providing new ways of assisting in behavior change and even in the long-lasting transformation of the users. However, this also means greater potential for harm. This viewpoint conceptualizes three different effects of interactive system use on technology-mediated tourist experiences—besides goal achievement that impacts satisfaction, effects can be goal-limiting (ranging from distracting to damaging) or goal-surpassing (ranging from enhancing to transforming). This conceptualization is then used to frame the importance of human-centered design for emerging Tourism 4.0 technologies.","Stankov, Uglješa; Gretzel, Ulrike",Inf Technol Tourism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381418/,179

38777,Prednisone: COVID-19 infection: case report,2020-09-05,"Repetitive intermittent hyperglycemia (RIH) is an independent risk factor for complications associated with type-2 diabetes (T2D). Glucose fluctuations commonly occur in T2D patients with poor glycemic control or following intensive therapy. Reducing blood glucose as well as glucose fluctuations is critical to the control of T2D and its macro-/microvascular complications. The interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 located downstream of the nutrient sensor toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, is emerging as a key metabolic regulator. It remains unclear how glucose fluctuations may alter the IRF5/TLR4 expression and inflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophages. To investigate this, first, we determined IRF5 gene expression by real-time qRT-PCR in the white adipose tissue samples from 39 T2D and 48 nondiabetic individuals. Next, we cultured THP-1 macrophages in hypo- and hyperglycemic conditions and compared, at the protein and transcription levels, the expressions of IRF5, TLR4, and M1/M2 polarization profile and inflammatory markers against control (normoglycemia). Protein expression was assessed using flow cytometry, ELISA, Western blotting, and/or confocal microscopy. IRF5 silencing was achieved by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. The data show that adipose IRF5 gene expression was higher in T2D than nondiabetic counterparts (p = 0.006), which correlated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r = 0.47/p < 0.001), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.23/p = 0.03), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (r = 0.56/p < 0.0001), interleukin (IL)-1β (r = 0.40/p = 0.0009), and C-C motif chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 (r = 0.49/p < 0.001) expression. IRF5 expression in macrophages was induced/upregulated (p < 0.05) by hypoglycemia (3 mM/L), persistent hyperglycemia (15 mM/L–25 mM/L), and RIH/glucose fluctuations (3–15 mM/L) as compared to normoglycemia (5 mM/L). RIH/glucose fluctuations also induced M1 polarization and an inflammatory profile (CD11c, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) in macrophages. RIH/glucose fluctuations also drove the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (p < 0.001), which is a known marker for cardiovascular complication in T2D patients. Notably, all these changes were counteracted by IRF5 silencing in macrophages. In conclusion, RIH/glucose fluctuations promote the M1 polarization and inflammatory responses in macrophages via the mechanism involving TLR4-IRF5 pathway, which may have significance for metabolic inflammation.","Al-Rashed, Fatema; Sindhu, Sardar; Arefanian, Hossein; Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Kochumon, Shihab; Thomas, Reeby; Al-Kandari, Sarah; Alghaith, Abdulwahab; Jacob, Texy; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Ahmad, Rasheed",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7463685/,179

39664,Pulmonary tuberculosis presenting secondary organizing pneumonia with organized polypoid granulation tissue: case series and review of the literature,2020-09-22,"The COVID-19 crisis has caused the greatest collapse in global economic activity since 1720. Some advanced countries have mounted a massive fiscal response, both to pay for disease-fighting action and to preserve the incomes of firms and workers until the economic recovery is under way. But there are many emerging market economies which have been prevented from doing what is needed by their high existing levels of public debt and—especially—by the external financial constraints which they face. We argue in the present paper that there is a need for international cooperation to allow such countries to undertake the kind of massive fiscal response that all countries now need, and that many advanced countries have been able to carry out. We show what such cooperation would involve. We use a global macroeconomic model to explore how extraordinarily beneficial such cooperation would be. Simulations of the model suggest that GDP in the countries in which extra fiscal support takes place would be around two and a half per cent higher in the first year, and that GDP in other countries in the world be more than one per cent higher. So far, such cooperation has been notably lacking, in striking contrast with what happened in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. The necessary cooperation needs to be led by the Group of Twenty (G20), just as happened in 2008–9, since the G20 brings together the leaders of the world’s largest economies. This cooperation must also necessarily involve a promise of international financial support from the International Monetary Fund, otherwise international financial markets might take fright at the large budget deficits and current account deficits which will emerge, creating fiscal crises and currency crises and so causing such expansionary policies which we advocate to be brought to an end.","McKibbin, Warwick; Vines, David",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499757/,179

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional design. All data were collected from NHANES 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was the primary variable used to index depressive symptoms. SAD was assessed using an abdominal caliper. We stratified participates into three groups according to SAD (trisection): T1: low (11.8-18.4 cm), T2: middle (18.5-22.8 cm), and T3: high (22.9-40.1 cm). Other data were collected following the NHANES protocols. We aimed to investigate the effects of obesity on the depression in the NHANES populations. RESULTS: A total of 4477 women were enrolled in the final study population. Participants with a high SAD had the highest risk of clinical depression symptoms (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4), which was, in particular, the case for moderate-severe depression (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and severe depression (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9).

CONCLUSIONS: SAD had a better correlation with clinical depression symptoms than BMI, especially regarding severe depression symptoms.","Zhou, Yang; Yang, Guifang; Peng, Wen; Zhang, Hongliang; Peng, Zhenyu; Ding, Ning; Guo, Tao; Cai, Yuzhong; Deng, Qijian; Chai, Xiangping",Behav Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7705436/,179

Neuro-oncology patients may not qualify for ITU if they deteriorate, but without oncological treatment, prognosis is poor. The pandemic has seen the introduction of new guidelines; including alternative treatment schedules which balance risks of contracting COVID-19, against safely delivering effective cancer treatment. We assess COVID-19 impact on neuro-oncology treatment at Guy’s Cancer Centre, London. METHODS: Notes of patients seen March-April 2020 were reviewed. Demographic data, tumour grade, treatment and changes due to COVID-19 recorded. RESULTS: 111 patients were identified (69 male: 42 female, median age 51years). 65 were WHO Grade 4, 24 Grade 3, 17 Grade 2, 2 Grade 1, 1 metastatic-neuroblastoma, 1 anaplastic-medulloblastoma and 1 radiological diagnosis of high-grade-glioma. 14% (32) of consultations were in person (16 new, 7 consents, 9 attending for treatment); 86% (198) were telephone. 8 had concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, 22 radiotherapy alone, 64 chemotherapy alone, 15 had active-surveillance and 2 best-supportive-care. To minimise COVID-19 risk, 22.5% (25) had treatment altered: - A 76-year-old had a radiological diagnosis; - 4 had hypofractionated radiotherapy (30Gy in 6#) to minimise hospital visits; - 7 had no chemotherapy (5 were unmethylated /age, 2 patient choice); - 4 switched from PCV to Lomustine; - 11 stopped chemotherapy early; - 50% (36) were given prophylactic GCS-F; - No patients were recruited for trials. 19 reported possible COVID-19 symptoms – 7 had delays and 3 stopped treatment. 4 tested COVID-19 positive (although not all tested). 1 died of COVID-19 (off treatment). Review of March-April 2020 service showed similar new patient referrals compared to the same time in 2019 (16 and 19 respectively). CONCLUSION: Despite concern about decreasing new referrals during the pandemic, this wasn’t the case for our service. 77.5% of patients had no treatment changes due to COVID-19 and all 22 patients on trial were able to continue treatment throughout this period.","Little, Jessica; Al-Salihi, Omar; Brazil, Lucy; Swampillai, Angela",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650407/,179
43144,Low-Dose Corticosteroid Treatment in Children With Mycoplasma pneumoniae Pneumonia: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2020-11-23,"INTRODUCTION: Covid 19 infections has been shown to be associated with a range of thromboembolic disease that has implications for the neuro-endovascular management of large vessel occlusions. METHODS: Five consecutive Covid-19 positive patients presented with large vessel occlusions to our institution. Covid-19 testing was performed using nasal swab. All thrombectomy cases was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia using a stent-aspiration combination as primary thrombectomy technique. The technical details of each case and the angiographic outcome are described. Routine labs including D-dimer, platelet count, coagulation panel (aPTT, INR), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated in all patients. Rotational thrombelastography (ROTEM) was performed on the patients' blood samples to assess real-time clot formation/dissolution properties. RESULTS: Four patients had anterior circulation large vessel occlusions and one patient had both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. Mean age was 52.8 years and 80% were males. TICI 3 revascularization was achieved in one patient, TICI 2B achieved in two patients andTICI 2A in two patients. In our cohort, patients were on average 52.8 years old and presented with a median NIHSS of 27. All our patients had very proximal occlusions. Three patients presented with intra-cranial ICA occlusions. Two patients presented with a tandem carotid bulb thrombus in conjunction with an intracranial vessel occlusion. One patient had an ICA terminus occlusion with a concomitant basilar occlusion. Second, the intravascular clots in all our patients were prone to fragment and migrate into both new vascular territories and into distal downstream vasculature. Distal emboli into a different territory (anterior cerebral artery occlusion) was seen in two two of our five patients (40%) and distal emboli into a downstream territory was seen in all five patients (100%). An average of 2.7 pstent-retriever passes was needed to achieve a final TICI revascularization of IIb or better. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 patients are predisposed to a hypercoagulable state. When presenting with large vessel occlusions, these patients present unique challenges that make successful revascularization difficult.","Wang, Arthur; Mandigo, Grace K; Meyers, Philip M; Lavine, Sean D",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717420/,179
43167,Full Issue PDF,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed lots of lives, posing a dire threat to global health. It was predicted that the coronavirus outbreak in the African population would be very lethal and result to economic devastation owing to the prevalence of immune-compromised population, poverty, low lifespan, fragile health care systems, poor economy, and lifestyle factors. Accumulation of mutations gives virus selective advantage for host invasion and adaptation, higher transmissibility of more virulent strains, and drug resistance. The present study determined the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomic variability and the contributory factors to the low COVID-19 fatality in Africa. To assess the SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape, 924 viral sequences from the Africa region with their sociobiological characteristics mined from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database were analyzed. RESULTS: Mutational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed highly recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein D614G (97.2%), concurrent R203K, and G204R (65.2%) in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and P4715L (97.2%) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase flagging these regions as SARS-CoV-2 mutational hotspots in the African population. COVID-19 is more severe in older people (> 65 years); Africa has a low percentage of people within this age group (4.36%). The average age of the infected patients observed in this study is 46 years with only 47 infected patients (5.1%) above 65 years in Africa in comparison to 13.12% in countries in other continents with the highest prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Africa’s young generation, the late incidence of the disease, and adherence to public health guidelines are important indicators that may have contributed to the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Africa. However, with the easing of lockdown and regulatory policies, daily increasing incidence in most countries, and low testing and sequencing rate, the epidemiology and the true impact of the pandemic in Africa remain to be unraveled.","Omotoso, Olabode E.",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7723464/,179

44258,Adalimumab/methotrexate/prednisone: Severe COVID-19 infection: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic therapy has no known benefit against COVID-19, but is often initiated out of concern for concomitant bacterial infection. We sought to determine how common early empiric antibiotic therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections are in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multi-center cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 discharged from 32 Michigan hospitals during the COVID-19 Michigan surge, we describe the use of early empiric antibiotic therapy (within the first two days) and prevalence of community-onset bacterial co-infection. Additionally, we assessed patient and hospital predictors of early empiric antibiotic using poison generalized estimating equation models. RESULTS: Between 3/10/2020 and 5/10/2020, data were collected on 951 COVID-19 PCR positive patients. Patient characteristics are described in Table 1. Nearly two thirds (62.4%, 593/951) of COVID-19 positive patients were prescribed early empiric antibiotic therapy, most of which (66.2%, 393/593) was directed at community-acquired pathogens. Across hospitals, the proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed early empiric antibiotics varied from 40% to 90% (Figure 1). On multivariable analysis, patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibiotic therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.01 [1.00–1.01] per year), required respiratory support (e.g., low flow oxygen, ARR: 1.16 [1.04–1.29]), had signs of a bacterial infection (e.g., lobar infiltrate, ARR: 1.17 [1.02–1.34]), or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.27 [1.11–1.45]); patients admitted later were less likely to receive empiric antibiotics (April vs. March, ARR: 0.72 [0.62–0.84], Table 2). Community-onset bacterial co-infections were identified in 4.5% (43/951) of COVID-19 positive patients (2.4% [23/951] positive blood culture; 1.9% [18/951] positive respiratory culture). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Despite low prevalence of community-onset bacterial co-infections, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 often received early empiric antibiotic therapy. Given the potential harms from unnecessary antibiotic use, including additional personal protective equipment to administer antibiotics, judicious antibiotic use is key in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Three of these cases had no prior history of any iatrogenic intervention, and the fourth person developing pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema after intubation.

This interest is situated within a global concern for the dignity of children as complex human beings, propelled by the articulation of their participatory rights in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). This turn to children and childhood in contemporary theology, I argue, points us to the need for an anthropology of relational belonging that holds out a space for children as agents. I mine the Lasallian tradition to critically retrieve such a communal anthropology that situates the agency of children as learners in a relation of vulnerable belonging to others as God’s children and siblings-in-Christ. An implication that arises from this is the importance for religious educators to consider more intentionally the communal dimension of their work in creating a more just world with and for children, promoting their human flourishing.","Pang, Alfred Kah Meng",j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847296/,179

46431,Immunosuppressants: COVID-19 infection: 4 case reports,2021-03-06,"Microvascular dysfunction plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of salivary gland disorders. Restoring and preserving microvascular integrity might therefore represent a promising strategy for the treatment of these pathologies. The mechanisms underlying microvascular dysfunction in salivary glands, however, are still obscure, partly due to the unavailability of adequate in vivo models. Here, we present a novel experimental approach that allows comprehensive in vivo analyses of the salivary gland microvasculature in mice. For this purpose, we employed different microscopy techniques including multi-photon in vivo microscopy to quantitatively analyze interactions of distinct immune cell subsets in the submandibular gland microvasculature required for their infiltration into the surrounding parenchyma and their effects on microvascular function. Confocal microscopy and multi-channel flow cytometry in tissue sections/homogenates complemented these real-time analyses by determining the molecular phenotype of the participating cells. To this end, we identified key adhesion and signaling molecules that regulate the subset- and tissue-specific trafficking of leukocytes into inflamed glands and control the associated microvascular leakage. Hence, we established an experimental approach that allows in vivo analyses of microvascular processes in healthy and diseased salivary glands. This enables us to delineate distinct pathogenetic factors as novel therapeutic targets in salivary gland diseases.","Uhl, Bernd; Braun, Constanze; Dominik, Julian; Luft, Joshua; Canis, Martin; Reichel, Christoph A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7925411/,179

The confirmation of the amorphous behavior and the presence of the various vibration modes and stretching modes have been analyzed using the XRD and FTIR techniques, respectively. The radiation shielding parameters of these glasses were reported using MCNP5 simulation. The effects of PbO on the MCNP5 parameters were investigated in detail. The mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) was simulated via MCNP5 code, and it was found that the MAC values from MCNP5 all follow the same trend as the XCOM data. The similarity means that the two simulations strongly agree with each other. The linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) was calculated for all the glasses. The glass sample with 55 mol% of the PbO has the greatest LAC at any energy, such as 0.317 at 10 MeV, the lowest investigated energy. From the LAC values, other parameters such as transmission factor (TF), lead equivalent thickness (d (lead)), and half-value layer (HVL) were reported. The results for the TF of the glasses revealed that the glass systems become more effective as their thickness increases. Glass sample with 35 mol % of the PbO recorded the highest TF at all energies due to its lack of PbO content, such as 15.533% for a thickness of 1 cm and 6.122% for 1.5-cm thickness at 0.3 MeV. The radiation protection efficiency (RPE) was also determined, and we found that the glasses with the greater PbO content and least MgO content have the highest RPE. Therefore, based on the RPE values, glasses with the greater PbO are the most effective radiation shield from the investigated glasses.","A.Al-Yousef, Haifa; Alotiby, Mohammed; Kumar, Ashok; Alotaibi, B.

However, long-term failure is still high and effective treatment for chronic ABMR, an important cause of graft failure, has not yet been identified. Chronic ABMR has a relatively different phenotype from active ABMR and is a slowly progressive disease in which graft injury is mainly caused by de novo donor specific antibodies (DSA). Since most trials of current immunosuppressive therapies for rejection have focused on active ABMR, treatment strategies based on those data might be less effective in chronic ABMR. A better understanding of chronic ABMR may serve as a bridge in establishing treatment strategies to improve graft outcomes. In this in-depth review, we focus on the pathophysiology and characteristics of chronic ABMR along with the newly revised Banff criteria in 2017. In addition, in terms of chronic ABMR, we identify the reasons for the resistance of current immunosuppressive therapies and look at ongoing research that could play a role in setting better treatment strategies in the future.

With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the prevalence of mental health issues in the general population appears to be increasing rapidly (1). Thus, we evaluated psychological heath in pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and caregivers during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to compare the levels of depression and anxiety in youth with T1D and their caregivers to those of healthy controls. We hypothesized that youth with T1D would experience higher levels of depression and anxiety than healthy controls during the COVID-19 pandemic (Aim 1). We also explored potential causes of increased depression/anxiety in T1D (Aim 2). We aimed to further understand psychosocial well-being in T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify mechanisms to support this population in global crises. Methods: A week after the start of Tennessee’s shelter-in-place order, we performed 15-minute phone surveys to screen for anxiety and depression in families with children with T1D (n=100, mean age of children=13.8 years, mean HbA1c=8.95%, Race=Caucasian (55%)/African American (43%)) and healthy children (mean age of children=5.7 years, Race=Caucasian (24%)/African American (69%)). Depression and anxiety were assessed by a standard assessment tool, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a 4-item inventory rated on a 4-point Likert scale that briefly assesses depression and anxiety. Anxiety/depression-related variables were compared based on T1D status using the Chi-square test or t-test, as appropriate. The association between T1D and risk of anxiety and depression was examined using logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. For families with T1D, additional questions were administered to identify specific concerns associated with T1D care. Results: Compared to controls, T1D was associated with a five times higher risk of anxiety in multivariable adjusted models, OR=5.02 (95% confidence interval: 1.83, 14.84), P=0.002. Additionally, 26/52 T1D families (50%) had significant concern for being at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection due to T1D and 14/52 T1D families (27%) were worried about obtaining insulin and diabetes supplies. Conclusions: Pediatric T1D is associated with an increased risk of anxiety but not depression in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Elevated anxiety in T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be, at least in part, due to fear of higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and uncertainty regarding access to insulin and diabetes supplies. Further studies to address mental health in T1D during global emergencies and advocacy to develop systems to ensure access to medical resources for pediatric T1D are warranted. 1. Stein MB.

52754,Fr504 PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY OUTCOMES OF CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTION IN THE UNITED STATES: RESULTS FROM NATIONAL INPATIENT SAMPLE DATABASE 2012 - 2017,2021-05-10,"Background: Sodium abnormalities (dysnatremia) are frequently observed in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and are associated with excess mortality. Data on the prevalence of hyponatremia and hypernatremia (serum sodium [Na] < 135 and > 145 mmol/L respectively) in patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are currently lacking. Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and etiology of hyponatremia and hypernatremia at several timepoints during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. This retrospective, longitudinal, observational study included all COVID-19 positive adult patients admitted to two London hospitals over an 8-week period (February to May 2020). Results: Clinic records were reviewed in 488 patients, 277 males (56.8%) and 211 females (43.2%), with a median age of 68 years. Comorbidities were documented in 79.6%, with the commonest being hypertension (45.7%), diabetes mellitus (25%), and chronic kidney disease (16.4%). Prior to admission, 25 patients (5.1%) had pre-existing chronic hyponatremia. At hospital presentation, median [Na] concentration was 137 mmol/L. Dysnatremia was present in 146 patients (29.9%), including 26 (5.3%) with hypernatremia and 120 (24.6%) with hyponatremia, of whom [Na] was 130-134 mmol/L in 90 (18.4%) and < 130 mmol/L in 30 (6.2%). Only 19% of patients with < 130 mmol/L underwent adequate laboratory assessment of the etiology of hyponatremia. Of those, based on a urinary sodium cut-off of 30 mmol/L, hyponatremia was classified as hypovolemia in 75% and non-hypovolemic in 25%. For the remaining hyponatremic cases, using 5 mmol/L as the cut-off value for plasma urea, 55.7% were classified as probable hypovolemic and 44.3% non-hypovolemic hyponatremia. There was an upward trajectory of [Na] values during hospital stay with a median increase of 2 mmol/L in the first 48 hours following admission. On the fifth day of hospitalization, the prevalence was similar for hypernatremia and hyponatremia (13.8% and 14.1%, respectively). On the tenth day, hypernatremia was more common than hyponatremia (14.2% vs 10.2% respectively). Analysis of [Na] throughout the hospital stay defined four subgroups; 185 patients (37.9%) remained normonatremic throughout hospitalization; 180 (36.9%) had exposure to hyponatremia; 53 (10.9%) were exposed to hypernatremia; and 70 (14.3%) experienced both hypernatremia and hyponatremia. Conclusions: Hyponatremia, usually mild, was common at admission in Covid-19 positive patients, while hypovolemic hyponatremia appeared to be the predominant etiology. During hospital stay, abnormal sodium concentration was recorded in more than two thirds of Covid-19 positive patients. The association of dysnatremia with the outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients warrants further exploration.","Tzoulis, Ploutarchos; Waung, Julian; Bagkeris, Emmanouil; Hussein, Ziad; Biddanda, Aiyappa; Cousins, John; Dewsnip, Alice; Falayi, Kanoyin; McCaughran, P W; Mullins, Chloe; Naeem, Ammara; Nwokolo, Munachiso; Quah, Helen; Bitat, Syed Rabha; Deyab, Eithar; Ponnampalam, Swarupini; Bouloux, Pierre-Marc Gilles; Montgomery, Hugh; Baldeweg, Stephanie",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090725/,179

Our aim was to demonstrate how a next-generation digital platform could be used to create a virtual MDT ecosystem in order to manipulate holographic 2D and 3D images in real-time. METHOD: This study involved setting up a mock virtual MDT using de-identified DICOM files from a patient who had been treated for colorectal cancer and then subsequently found to have a liver metastasis. The image file was segmented and converted into a 2D and 3D format for visualisation within Microsoft HoloLens 2 ® (smart glasses) using Holocare Solutions ® (Mixed Reality software). RESULTS: A seamless cross-border pipeline was developed that involved ""clinician"" training, DICOM segmentation and virtual connection. We successfully performed a virtual MDT with participants able to visualise and manipulate a virtual 3D organ in real-time. The digital network remotely connected sites in England and Norway. The streaming quality was stable and HIPAA compliant. Each participant could observe others as ""avatars"" interacting with images within the virtual ecosystem allowing image characteristics to be highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully conducted a virtual MDT using novel hardware and software. Our intention is to conduct a large-scale study to assess the platform's effectiveness in “Real World"" MDTs.","Vijayan, D; Malik, K; Natarajan, K; Berland, J; Morton, D; Beggs, A; Ashraf, S",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135803/,179
54222,P136 Management of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and their outcome during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemics,2021-05-27,"In this work we report structural and computational studies of favipiravir, which is now used as a drug for COVID-19 treatment. The molecule is completely flat and stabilized by an intramolecular O–H···O hydrogen bond, yielding a six-membered pseudo-aromatic ring. The aromaticity index of this pseudo-aromatic ring was found to be 0.748, while the same indix for the pyrazine ring in favipiravir was found to be 0.954. The crystal packing of favipiravir is mainly constructed through intermolecular N–H···O, N–H···N and C–H···O hydrogen bonds, yielding a 3D supramolecular framework with a zst topology defined by the point symbol of (6(5)·8). The crystal structure of favipiravir is further stabilized by weak C–F···F–C intermolecular type II dihalogen interactions, yielding a 1D supramolecular polymeric chain. More than 80% of the total Hirshfeld surface area for favipiravir is occupied by H···H/C/N/O/F and C···N/O contacts. Energy frameworks have been calculated to additionally analyze the overall crystal packing. It was established that the structure of favipiravir is mainly characterized by the dispersion energy framework followed by the less significant electrostatic energy framework contribution. Finally, by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, we have assigned the interaction energy of each hydrogen bond, which can be helpful to develop scoring functions to be used in force fields/docking calculations.","Babashkina, Maria G.; Frontera, Antonio; Kertman, Alexander V.; Saygideger, Yasemin; Murugavel, Swaminathan; Safin, Damir A.",J IRAN CHEM SOC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189275/,179

We propose, and empirically validate, an inclusive model to examine these relationships. The study then extends further by embedding two constituents of CSR integration into MCS: namely, management control technology and involvement of management accountants in CSR management. Our study is distinguished by validating, as a contribution, a single construct for each of these two constituents. Data were collected from 117 SMEs in an emerging economy, Abu Dhabi-UAE. PLS structural equation modeling was used in the data analysis. We find that CSR initiatives in SMEs influence organizational performance both directly and indirectly through MCS. Interestingly, the results show that only the involvement of management accountants in CSR management mediates the relationship between CSR initiatives and SME performance. This indicates that the role of human intervention prevails over technology intermediation in conveying the positive effect of CSR initiatives on organizational performance. Overall, the findings help to understand how MCS is an important driving mechanism whereby SMEs may derive performance outcomes from deploying CSR initiatives. The study concludes with implications for future research and policy-makers.","Cheffi, Walid; Abdel-Maksoud, Ahmed; Farooq, Muhammad Omer",J Manag Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191448/,179

54299,MO261 LUPUS NEPHRITIS AND COVID-19 INFECTION,2021-05-29,"Objective: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a widespread disease that is often associated with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is more frequent in women than in men, but detailed pathomechanisms remain unclear. We investigated HFpEF in women and men in a high-risk cohort with SDB monitoring. Methods and Results: Three hundred twenty-seven patients (84.4% men) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively subjected to SDB monitoring, and an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15/h defined SDB. HF was classified according to current guidelines. HFpEF was significantly more frequent in SDB patients compared to those without SDB (28 vs. 17%, P = 0.016). This distribution was driven by an increased frequency of HFpEF in female SDB patients (48% vs. only 25% in male, P = 0.022). In accordance, female patients with SDB exhibited significantly more impaired diastolic left ventricular filling compared to men (echocardiographic E/e′). In contrast to men, in women, minimum oxygen saturation (O(2min), measured by polygraphy, R(2) = 0.470, P < 0.001) and time of oxygen saturation <90% (R(2) = 0.165, P = 0.044) were significantly correlated with E/e′. Moreover, the correlation between O(2min) and E/e′ was significantly different in women compared to men (P < 0.001). Intriguingly, this association remained independent of clinical covariates in women [age, body mass index, systolic contractile dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), R(2) = 0.534, P = 0.042, multivariate regression analysis]. Since angiotensin II signaling has been mechanistically linked to HF, we measured protein expression of its cleavage enzyme ACE2 in human right atrial appendage biopsies (Western blot). Intriguingly, we found a significantly decreased ACE2 expression preferentially in women with SDB (2.66 ± 0.42 vs. 4.01 ± 2.47 in men with SDB, P = 0.005). In accordance, left ventricular mass index was significantly increased in women with SDB compared to women without SDB. Conclusion: In patients with SDB, HFpEF and diastolic dysfunction were more frequent in women compared to men. In contrast to men, the severity of SDB was associated with the degree of diastolic dysfunction in women. These insights might help to find sex-specific therapies for patients with sleep-disordered breathing and heart failure.

Bone Morphogenetic Protein2 (BMP2) is employed for the restoration and construction of bone tissues. Hydrophobin is a fungal based protein with high hydrophobic characteristics. Due to this specificity, it is suitable for the purification of chimer protein from complex solutions when is fused to a protein utilizing an aqueous two-phase (A2P) technique. The plant optimized mature human BMP2 gene was designed and evaluated by in silico method. This process involves simulating molecular dynamics using the RMSD, RMSF and Gyration radius indexes. The synthesized Hyd-BMP2 gene was cloned into a pTRAkc-ERH plasmid and Transferred into Agrobacterium (Gv3101). The Nicotiana benthamiana plant leaves were co-agroinfiltrated with HA-Hyd-BMP2 and P19-pCambia1304 containing silencing suppressor. After purification of plant extract utilizing the A2P method, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. By in silico study, the simulated fusion protein profitably shows reasonable protein compactness and the effect of amino acid substitution on protein–protein interaction is not remarkable. Western-blotting using anti HA tag has shown that the A2P technique partially purified the two 22 kDa and 44 kDa forms of Hydrophobin-BMP2. These results confirmed the presence of monomer and dimer forms of Hydrophobin-BMP2 proteins. Moreover, the expression level of the protein using P19 silencing suppressor increased six times and to 0.018% as shown by ELISA.

Here, using drug repositioning, we discovered that primaquine diphosphate (PD), previously known as an antimalarial drug, was a potential blocker of vascular leakage. PD inhibited the linear pattern of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-induced disruption at the cell boundaries, blocked the formation of VEGF-induced actin stress fibers, and stabilized the cortactin actin rings in endothelial cells. PD significantly reduced leakage in the Miles assay and mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy. Targeted prediction programs and deubiquitinating enzyme activity assays identified a potential mechanism of action for PD and demonstrated that this operates via ubiquitin specific protease 1 (USP1). USP1 inhibition demonstrated a conserved barrier function by inhibiting VEGF-induced leakage in endothelial permeability assays. Taken together, these findings suggest that PD could be used as a novel drug for vascular leakage by maintaining endothelial integrity.","Noh, Minyoung; Zhang, Haiying; Kim, Hyejeong; Park, Songyi; Kim, Young-Myeong; Kwon, Young-Guen",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211987/,179

Such structure yet may retain metabolic excrements and sebum secretions discharged from the human skin, which reproduce microorganisms harmful for human health. However, incorporating the antimicrobial coating into the cotton fabric can sufficiently resist the microorganism growth. In this work, a water-soluble antibacterial coating named N-(4-(allyloxy) benzylidene)-2-(piperazin-1-yl) ethanamine (NABPE) was synthesized to produce a rechargeable and fast sterilization cotton fiber fabric (M-cotton/NABPE). M-cotton/NABPE exhibited a high effective antibacterial activity, and the inhibition ratios against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were 94 % and 93 %, respectively. Chlorination was performed with sodium hypochlorite solution to form N-Cl bond on the M-cotton/NABPE fabrics, resulting in a high biocidal efficacy of up to 100 % via contact killing for a duration of 5 min. After 25 washing cycles, the antibacterial fabric still maintained an antibacterial rate of 91.95 % and 92.15 % against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Furthermore, the fabrics showed integrated properties of excellent UV stability, long-term stability, robust rechargeable biocidal activity (chlorine recharging >5000 ppm) and washing durability. This research provides fundamental insights into the synthesis of the NABPE and prolonged biocidal efficacy of the M-cotton/NABPE, and thereby pave a pathway to incorporate an economic and environmental-friendly antibacterial coating suitable for finishing cotton fabric.","Wen, Wen; Zhang, Zaixing; Jing, Lingxiao; Zhang, Tonghua",Fibers Polym,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294258/,179

The introduction of Zika and Chikungunya diseases in the Americas has exposed unforeseen medical and logistical challenges for public health systems. Moreover, the lack of preventive measures and vaccination against known and emerging mosquito-transmitted pathogens, and the occurrence of unanticipated clinical complications, has had an enormous social and economic impact on the affected populations. In this study, we aimed to measure the seroprevalence of endemic and emerging viral pathogens in military personnel stationed in Manaus, Amazonas state. METHODS: We measured the seropositivity of antibodies against 19 endemic and emerging viruses in a healthy military personnel group using a hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA). RESULTS: Overall, DENV positivity was 60.4%, and 30.9% of the individuals reacted against ZIKV. Also, 46.6%, 54.7%, 51.3% and 48.7% individuals reacted against West Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Ilheus virus (ILHV) and Rocio virus (ROCV), respectively. Individuals with high DENV HIA titer reacted more frequently with ZIKV or WNV compared to those with low HIA titers. Observed cross-reactivity between Flaviviruses varied depending on the virus serogroup. Additionally, 0.6% and 0.3% individuals were seropositive for Oropouche virus (OROV) and Catu virus (CATUV) from the family Peribunyaviridae, respectively. All samples were negative for Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western Equine Encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV), Mayaro virus (MAYV), Mucambo virus (MUCV) and CHIKV from the family Togaviridae. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of individuals in our high-risk population (~ 60%) lacked antibodies against major endemic and emerging viruses, which makes them susceptible for further infections.

These figures offer high potential for addressing climate change through targeted measures in urban areas. The construction or renovation of energy-efficient buildings, innovating mobility concepts, sustainable energy supply or concepts for incentivizing residents help to make cities more sustainable and climate-friendly. The services required in this regard can be supported and mapped digitally by so-called mobile district apps. Mobile district apps help residents of smart cities to shape their everyday behavior in a more climate-friendly and sustainable way, can digitally map classic services, and connect residents with each other. Existing mobile district apps are usually individually tailored to a smart city district and address a goal from one of the areas of sustainability, services, or community. This article brings all target areas of mobile district apps to a generic level and presents nine guidelines to support urban planners in the design and development of mobile district apps. The guidelines highlight the dimensions of user-centricity, data privacy, and economic feasibility. All these areas intertwine when developing mobile district apps and need to be considered for successful implementation. The article describes the realization of the guidelines using an app from the cooperative research project Stadtquartier 2050 concerning sustainable cities as an example. In this project, the residents of two demonstration districts in Germany are to be supplied with energy in a climate-neutral way.

From a network perspective, depression can be conceptualized as the result of mutual interactions among individual symptoms, an approach that may elucidate the structure and mechanisms underlying this disorder. This study aimed to examine the structure of depression among residents in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, in the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 2,515 participants were recruited from the community via snowball sampling. The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported depressive symptoms with the QuestionnaireStar program. The network structure and relevant centrality indices of depression were examined in this sample. Results: Network analysis revealed Fatigue, Sad mood, Guilt and Motor disturbances as the most central symptoms, while Suicide and Sleep problems had the lowest centrality. No significant differences were found between women and men regarding network structure (maximum difference = 0.11, p = 0.44) and global strength (global strength difference = 0.04; female vs. male: 3.78 vs. 3.83, p = 0.51), a finding that suggests there are no gender differences in the structure or centrality of depressive symptoms. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional study design, causal relationships between these depressive symptoms or dynamic changes in networks over time could not be established. Conclusions: Fatigue, Sad mood, Guilt, and Motor disturbances should be prioritized as targets in interventions and prevention efforts to reduce depression among residents in Wuhan, in the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Na; Li, Wen; Zhang, Shu-Fang; Yang, Bing Xiang; Sha, Sha; Cheung, Teris; Jackson, Todd; Zang, Yu-Feng; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514718/,179

Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and antibody responses in a large sample of health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases.

Here, we argue that targeting NLRP3 inflammasome could be a strategy to prevent cardiovascular outcomes [fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, venous thromboembolism (VTE)] and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discuss the rationale for NLRP3 targeting in clinical trials as an effective therapeutic strategy aimed to improve prognosis of COVID-19, analyzing the potential of two therapeutic options (tranilast and OLT1177) currently available in clinical practice.","Quagliariello, V; Bonelli, A; Caronna, A; Lombari, M C; Conforti, G; Libutti, M; Iaffaioli, R V; Berretta, M; Botti, G; Maurea, N",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_22867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965010/,179

We present a patient with a ruptured giant pseudoaneurysm that we occluded using a modified internal trapping technique with low-concentration N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and a minimum number of coils. An 80-year-old man with a history of chemoradiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancer presented with several episodes of active bleeding from the subsequent tracheostomy site. Radiological examination revealed a giant right common carotid artery (CCA) pseudoaneurysm. Endovascular internal trapping was performed using both NBCA and coils under proximal flow control. We slowly injected 9 ml of low-concentration NBCA, which subsequently filled the entire pseudoaneurysm. We then injected an additional 2 ml of NBCA into the proximal CCA to achieve complete obliteration. No re-bleeding was observed during the 6-month follow-up. Endovascular internal trapping using low-concentration NBCA was feasible to treat a giant CCA pseudoaneurysm. The injected low-concentration NBCA filled the entire pseudoaneurysm without the risk of catheter entrapment.","Harada, Tomoaki; Fujita, Atsushi; Sakata, Junichi; Kohta, Masaaki; Kohmura, Eiji",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574420953942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873222/,179

This study was performed to explore the efficacy of pure taTME (p-taTME) without laparoscopic assistance as a completely non-invasive surgical procedure for rectal cancer. Methods We retrospectively evaluated all patients with rectal cancer who underwent p-taTME between December 2015 and April 2018. Relevant patient characteristics and clinical information including the surgical procedure, specimens, pathological characteristics, and patients' post-operative state were analysed and the feasibility of p-taTME in patients with rectal cancer was assessed. Results Fifty-five patients who had undergone p-taTME were included in this study. They comprised 32 (58.2%) men and 23 (41.8%) women with a mean age of 65.6 ± 10.6 years and mean body mass index of 23.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2. The median surgical time was 180.0 (range, 130-360) min and estimated blood loss was 25.0 (range, 15-80) mL. The commonest post-operative complication was varying degrees of faecal incontinence (56.4%). However, such incontinence greatly improved after pelvic-floor-function-rehabilitation exercises and did not seriously affect the patients' quality of life. Conclusions p-taTME is a relatively safe and incisionless procedure for patients with middle and low rectal cancer, especially in those with obesity or a narrow pelvis. However, further studies of the indications and long-term efficacy are needed to verify the suitability of this procedure.","Wang, Xiao-Ming; Xu, Yan-Yan; Yu, Gang; Rong, Zhen; Geng, Rui-Chao; Wang, Rui; Chen, Long-Yi; Liu, Gang",Gastroenterology report,https://doi.org/10.1093/gastro/goz055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32104585/,179
63848,[COVID-19 and the impact of cardiovascular comorbidities].,2020-08-01,"Cannabis, or marijuana, has potential therapeutic and medicinal properties related to multiple compounds, particularly Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. Over the past 25 years, attitudes toward cannabis have evolved rapidly, with expanding legalization of medical and recreational use at the state level in the United States and recreational use nationally in Canada and Uruguay. As a result, the consumption of cannabis products is increasing considerably, particularly among youth. Our understanding of the safety and efficacy of cannabis has been limited by decades of worldwide illegality and continues to be limited in the United States by the ongoing classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. These shifts in cannabis use require clinicians to understand conflicting laws, health implications, and therapeutic possibilities. Cannabis may have therapeutic benefits, but few are cardiovascular in nature. Conversely, many of the concerning health implications of cannabis include cardiovascular diseases, although they may be mediated by mechanisms of delivery. This statement critically reviews the use of medicinal and recreational cannabis from a clinical but also a policy and public health perspective by evaluating its safety and efficacy profile, particularly in relationship to cardiovascular health.","Page, Robert L; Allen, Larry A; Kloner, Robert A; Carriker, Colin R; Martel, Catherine; Morris, Alanna A; Piano, Mariann R; Rana, Jamal S; Saucedo, Jorge F",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32752884/,179

METHODS Electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, Embase, Scielo, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for studies published before September 2018. Keywords included ""preterm birth"", ""ultrasound-indicated cerclage"", ""pregnancy"" and ""17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate"". Studies comparing ultrasound-indicated cerclage alone to cerclage plus 17-OHPC were included. The primary outcome measure was preterm birth at <35 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcome measures include preterm birth <24 weeks, <28 weeks, <32 weeks and <37 weeks of gestation, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), fetal birth weight, and intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV). Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. Risk of bias and quality assessment was performed using the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I). RESULTS Four studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Of the 396 women who received ultrasound-indicated cerclage, 142 (35.9%) received adjuvant 17-OHPC. The primary outcome, preterm birth <35 weeks of gestation, was present in three studies and 332/396 singleton pregnancies. Though there was a trend towards a reduced risk of preterm birth, the summary estimate of effect was not statistically significant when comparing cerclage alone to cerclage plus 17-OHPC at <35 weeks (relative risk (RR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.77-1.17). Similarly, we found no differences in preterm birth at <24 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06-1.60), <28 weeks (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.13-2.53), and <32 weeks (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.44-2.27) when comparing cerclage alone to cerclage plus 17-OHPC. There were no differences in fetal birth weight, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis comparing cerclage alone to cerclage plus 17-OHPC. CONCLUSION Intramuscular 17-OHPC in combination with ultrasound-indicated cerclage in women with prior preterm birth had no additional effect in reducing spontaneous recurrent preterm birth or improving perinatal outcomes.","Lichter, Katie E; Sheffield, Jeanne; Graham, Ernest M; Eke, Ahizechukwu C","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1568406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626240/,179

We hypothesized that in a specific epidemiologic study based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the association of clinical thyroid disease with serum concentration of PFOA and PFOS was due to reverse causality. Thyroid hormone affects glomerular filtration, which in turn affects excretion of PFOA and PFOS. We evaluated this by linking a model of thyroid disease status over the lifetime to a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of PFOA and PFOS. Using Monte Carlo methods, we simulated the target study population and analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression. The target and simulated populations were similar with respect to age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS, and prevalence of clinical thyroid disease. The analysis showed little or no evidence of bias from the hypothesized mechanism. The largest bias was for the fourth quartile of PFOA in females, with an odds ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90, 0.97). The reported odds ratio of clinical thyroid disease for this group was 1.63 (1.07, 2.47), and if it were corrected for the bias would have been 1.74 (1.14, 2.65). Our results suggest that little of the reported association in the target study was due to reverse causality.","Dzierlenga, Michael W; Allen, Bruce C; Clewell, Harvey J; Longnecker, Matthew P",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408218/,179

A viral suspension in the form of a microspray aerosol was delivered by intratracheal instillation into the distal lung of 6-8-week-old Fischer 344 rats. SDAV inoculation produced a 7 % body weight loss over a 5 day period that was followed by recovery over the next 7 days. SDAV caused focal lesions in the lung, which were most severe on day 4 post-inoculation (p.i.). Immunofluorescent staining showed that four cell types supported SDAV virus replication in the lower respiratory tract, namely Clara cells, ciliated cells in the bronchial airway and alveolar type I and type II cells in the lung parenchyma. In bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) a neutrophil influx increased the population of neutrophils to 45 % compared with 6 % of the cells in control samples on day 2 after mock inoculation. Virus infection induced an increase in surfactant protein SP-D levels in BALF of infected rats on days 4 and 8 p.i. that subsided by day 12. The concentrations of chemokines MCP-1, LIX and CINC-1 in BALF increased on day 4 p.i., but returned to control levels by day 8. Intratracheal instillation of rats with SDAV coronavirus caused an acute, self-limited infection that is a useful model for studying the early events of the innate immune response to respiratory coronavirus infections in lungs of the natural virus host.","Funk, C Joel; Manzer, Rizwan; Miura, Tanya A; Groshong, Steve D; Ito, Yoko; Travanty, Emily A; Leete, Jennifer; Holmes, Kathryn V; Mason, Robert J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.014282-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19741068/,179

METHODS Tribal college students (N = 3,239) participated in a cross-sectional online or paper survey assessing alcohol use patterns and mental health outcomes, yielding a response rate of 31.3%. RESULTS Of the students surveyed, 8.8% indicated moderate or high suicide risk. Hearing impairment was significantly associated with moderate/high suicide risk (OR = 2.11; 1.24-3.61, P = .006), as was vision impairment (OR = 3.03; 1.92-4.77, P < .001), having a physical/mental/or emotional condition (OR = 2.12; 1.75-2.57, P < .001), experiencing critical appraisal (OR = 1.30; 1.24-1.36, P < .001), and experiencing critical isolation (OR = 1.83; 1.66-2.01, P < .001). Scoring high on resilience (OR = 0.93; 0.92-0.95, P < .001), reporting higher emotional social support (OR = 0.75; 0.70-0.79, P < .001), and reporting higher levels of instrumental social support (OR = 0.69, 0.62-0.76, P < .001) were significantly associated with lower suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS Students attending tribal colleges who experience hearing impairment, sight impairment, or a physical/emotional/mental condition have a greater risk of suicidality. Students experiencing critical appraisal and critical isolation may benefit from behavioral health interventions to reframe these experiences and develop resiliency skills. Developing avenues of emotional and instrumental social support within TCU settings offers key protective factors to buffer the risk of suicidality. Examining additional ways to build resiliency may also offer protection from suicide risk in this population.","Parker, Myra; Duran, Bonnie; Rhew, Isaac; Magarati, Maya; Larimer, Mary; Donovan, Dennis",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894614/,179

Knowledge of the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and the clinicopathologic features may guide the decision-making process of metastatic breast cancer treatment, including endocrine therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with MBC. To evaluate the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and clinicopathologic features, a cohort of 22 patients with MBC were retrospectively analyzed using next generation sequencing. In 14 of 22 patients, four mutations were detected on the metastatic site, including Tyr537Ser, Glu542Asp, Leu536Arg and Arg548Cys. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the duration of aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator treatment, as well as the age of treatment initiation for early-stage breast cancer, were significantly associated with the development of ESR1 mutation. ESR1 mutation was identified in all five patients who received selective estrogen receptor modulators in the adjuvant setting followed by aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting, as well as in two of the three patients who received no selective estrogen receptor modulators in adjuvant setting followed by aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that administrating adjuvant selective estrogen receptor modulator followed by aromatase inhibitor for metastasis may increase the frequency of ESR1 mutation.","Takeshima, Kaoru; Hayashida, Tetsu; Maeda, Hinako; Nakashoji, Ayako; Yokoe, Takamichi; Seki, Tomoko; Takahashi, Maiko; Kitagawa, Yuko",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724363/,179

Untreated OUD is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality-notably, overdose, infectious complications of injecting drug use, and profoundly diminished quality of life. Withdrawal management and medication tapers are ineffective and are associated with increased rates of relapse and death. Pharmacotherapy is the evidence based mainstay of OUD treatment, and many studies support its integration into primary care settings. Evidence is strongest for the opioid agonists buprenorphine and methadone, which randomized controlled trials have shown to decrease illicit opioid use and mortality. Discontinuation of opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased rates of relapse and mortality. Less evidence is available for the opioid antagonist extended release naltrexone, with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showing decreased illicit opioid use but no effect on mortality. Treating OUD in primary care settings is cost effective, improves outcomes for both OUD and other medical comorbidities, and is highly acceptable to patients. Evidence on whether behavioral interventions improve outcomes for patients receiving pharmacotherapy is mixed, with guidelines promoting voluntary engagement in psychosocial supports, including counseling. Further work is needed to promote the integration of OUD treatment into primary care and to overcome regulatory barriers to integrating methadone into primary care treatment in the US.","Buresh, Megan; Stern, Robert; Rastegar, Darius",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011512/,179
69924,Tracheal Intubation with Aura-i and aScope-2: How to Minimize Apnea Time in an Unpredicted Difficult Airway.,2015,"BACKGROUND Emerging attempts have been made to reduce operative trauma and improve cosmetic results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There is a trend towards minimizing the number of incisions such as natural transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC). Many retrospective case series propose excellent cosmesis and reduced pain in SPLC. As the latter has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial, patient's satisfaction on cosmesis is still controversially debated. METHODS/DESIGN The SPOCC trial is a prospective, multi-center, double blinded, randomized controlled study comparing SPLC with 4-port conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (4PLC) in elective surgery. The hypothesis and primary objective is that patients undergoing SPLC will have a better outcome in cosmesis and body image 12 weeks after surgery. This primary endpoint is assessed using a validated 8-item multiple choice type questionnaire on cosmesis and body image. The secondary endpoint has three entities: the quality of life 12 weeks after surgery assessed by the validated Short-Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire, postoperative pain assessed by a visual analogue scale and the use of analgesics. Operative time, surgeon's experience with SPLC and 4PLC, use of additional ports, conversion to 4PLC or open cholecystectomy, length of stay, costs, time of work as well as intra- and postoperative complications are further aspects of the secondary endpoint. Patients are randomly assigned either to SPLC or to 4PLC. Patients as well as treating physicians, nurses and assessors are blinded until the 7th postoperative day. Sample size calculation performed by estimating a difference of cosmesis of 20% (alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.90, drop out rate of 10%) resulted in a number of 55 randomized patients per arm.

Thirty-six of 71 participants were randomly assigned to the RYGB group, and the others were in IMM group. Partial or complete remission of T2DM was defined as blood HbA1c < 6.5 % (48 mmol/mol) or <6 % (42 mmol/mol) without any antihyperglycemic medication for at least 1-year duration, respectively. RESULTS At baseline, Taiwanese participants had a lower BMI, younger age, and shorter duration of T2DM than American participants. At 24 months, weight loss was greater in the RYGB group in both populations than in the IMM group. No IMM participant of either population had partial or complete remission of T2DM. In the RYGB group, a substantial proportion of the subjects achieved complete or partial remission (57 % in Taiwanese and 27 % in American participants, P = 0.08). Logistic regression revealed stimulated C-peptide (Odds ratio 2.22, P = 0.02) but not nationality as a significant predictor of diabetes remission. CONCLUSION Adding RYGB to lifestyle and medical management was associated with a greater likelihood of remission of T2DM in both Taiwanese and American subjects with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes. Residual beta-cell function at baseline appears to be the major factor predicting remission of T2DM.

72107,Coronavirus disease 2019: investigational therapies in the prevention and treatment of hyperinflammation.,2020-11-04,"OBJECTIVE The tAccess Patient Support Program (PSP) is a personalized support program for patients prescribed vortioxetine therapy. We assessed the impact of the tAccess PSP on adherence to and persistence with vortioxetine among adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in patients with MDD receiving vortioxetine who were enrolled in the tAccess PSP. Eligible patients were 18 to 64 years of age and had ≥1 vortioxetine claim and ≥1 inpatient/outpatient medical MDD claim during the 12 months preceding or on the index date, defined as the date of the earliest vortioxetine claim. Study outcomes included medication adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC], adherent ≥80%) and persistence (the total number of days on therapy without a ≥30-day gap) at 90, 180, and 365 days. Additionally, persistence was reported for a subset of patients meeting the standardized Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS®) Antidepressant Medication Management (AMM) criteria (the percentage of adults aged 18 to 64 years who remained on an antidepressant for ≥84 days or ≥180 days), as defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. These data were reviewed alongside current HEDIS AMM data for commercially insured patients meeting the standardized metric. RESULTS The study identified a total of 2635 patients with an MDD diagnosis and ≥90 days of follow-up time and a subset of 2238 patients meeting HEDIS AMM criteria. Mean PDC among all patients with MDD was 0.78, with 58.3% of patients achieving PDC ≥80%. During the 90-day follow-up, 62.1% of patients with MDD were persistent on vortioxetine. Among the subset of patients who met HEDIS AMM criteria, persistence was 83.4% and 69.9% at 84 and 180 days, respectively. In comparison, in 2017, HEDIS AMM criteria for antidepressant persistence were met by 67.8% of commercially insured patients at 84 days and 51.8% at 180 days. CONCLUSIONS These initial results, reviewed alongside recent available HEDIS AMM data, suggest that the tAccess PSP may be beneficial in addressing treatment adherence and persistence in patients with MDD.","Lawrence, Debra F; Manjelievskaia, Janna; Chrones, Lambros; McCue, Maggie; Touya, Maëlys",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1918072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904815/,179

76044,Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia in a Kidney Transplant Patient Receiving Eculizumab.,2021-06-18,"PURPOSE To describe our initial experience with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Bosniak IV renal cysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2010 to 2014, 154 renal tumor cases were treated with percutaneous thermal ablation, of which 10 cases (6.4%) from nine patients were complex renal cysts and were treated with radiofrequency ablation. RESULTS All complex cysts were classified as Bosniak IV (four women and five men; mean age: 63.6 yrs, range: 33-83 years). One patient had a single kidney. Lesion size ranged from 1.5 to 4.1cm (mean: 2.5cm) and biopsy was performed on four cysts immediately before the procedure, all of which were malignant (two clear cell and two papillary carcinoma). Mean volume reduction of complex cysts was 25% (range: 10-40%). No patients required retreatment with RFA and no immediate or late complications were observed. The follow-up of Bosniak IV cysts had a median of 27 months (interquartile range [IQR], 23 to 38) and no recurrence or significant loss of renal function were observed. CONCLUSIONS Mid-term follow-up of the cases in our database suggests that image-guided percutaneous RFA can treat Bosniak IV cysts with very low complication rates and satisfactorily maintain renal function.","Menezes, Marcos Roberto de; Viana, Publio Cesar Cavalcante; Yamanari, Tassia Regina; Arap, Marco Antonio; Reis, Leonardo Oliveira; Nahas, William",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1677-5538.ibju.2015.0444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27286107/,179

As early diagnosis and management can mitigate complications, early prediction is important. Our aim was to determine whether postoperative blood tests are valuable predictors of IC. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 373 patients who underwent conventional ventral hernioplasty with mesh augmentation between 2008 and 2011. The clinical outcome was correlated with postoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell counts (WBC) and assessed by area under the curve (AUC) analysis of the receiver operating characteristics curve. RESULTS ICs occurred in 51 (13.7%) patients, who required further management. Among these, 48 patients developed a procedure-related complication, the most frequent being surgical site infection (n = 44). The infections appeared after a median postoperative delay of 12 days. Serum CRP was superior to WBC in the prediction of a complicated course. A maximum CRP < 105 mg/L on postoperative day (POD) 2 or 3 had the highest negative predictive value (NPV; 100%) in ruling out ICs [positive predictive value (PPV) 29%; sensitivity 100%; specificity 55%]. The PPV for occurrence of IC improved each day after surgery, reaching up to 46% on POD 5 or 6 for a CRP cut-off of 63.2 mg/L (NPV 93%; sensitivity 69%; specificity 83%). The AUC was 0.80 at both time points. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that postoperative serum CRP allows for early prediction of the postoperative course. Low CRP during the initial PODs is associated with lower risk of ICs. Higher levels on POD 5 or 6 behoove close surveillance.","Pochhammer, J; Scholtes, B; Keuler, J; Müssle, B; Welsch, T; Schäffer, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-018-1844-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30406322/,179

This study investigated self-reported compliance with three PPMs among a sample of office workers in Karachi, Pakistan. A cross-sectional survey with participants were adult office workers who had resumed work in Karachi, Pakistan. All full-time employees aged ≥ 18 years who had resumed work in the offices were invited to complete the survey. Of 487 workers who were invited, 411 (84.4%) completed the survey between March 1 and March 20, 2021. We examined the effects of sociodemographic factors, individual-level factors, interpersonal-level factors, and social-structural-level factors using logistic regression models. Of the total sample, 192 (46.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace. Self-reported sanitizing of hands (46.0%) was comparable to use of face masks, whereas avoiding crowded places (21.2%) was less common. Perceived effectiveness of individual preventive measures (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.19 to 1.42; confidence intervals (CIs) 1.04-1.37 to CI 1.18-1.71), perceived effectiveness of governmental preventive measures (AORs from 1.23 to 1.39 CI 1.02-1.47 to CI 1.12-1.72), and number of preventive measures implemented by the office (AORs from 1.20 to 1.26 CI 1.09-1.31 to CI 1.13-1.39) were associated with self-reported compliance with PPMs. Perceived preparedness of medical system in Karachi (AOR 1.44, CI 1.08-1.93) was only associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. Reduced compliance to PPMs was observed; hence, efforts need to be made to ensure strict adherence to PPMs.","Kumar, Pankaj; Sohail, Aruba; Shah, Mir Umer Farooq Alam; Khurshid, Maman; Yasmin, Farah; Asghar, Muhammad Sohaib",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.21-0570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607311/,179

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. AIMS To evaluate mental health outcomes among Egyptian healthcare workers (HCW) treating patients with confirmed or suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to direct the promotion of mental wellbeing, by screening for symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression and stress, and analyzing potential risk factors. METHODS This cross-sectional, hospital-based survey study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 502 HCW dealing with COVID-19. HCW were surveyed in 20 hospitals (Fever, Chest, and Quarantine hospitals) in different parts of Egypt, in April and May 2020. RESULTS Among the 502 HCW surveyed; 60.0% were physicians, 16.1% were specialized nurses, and 23.9% were non-specialized nurses. About 35.3% worked in chest hospitals, 17.5% in fever hospitals, and 47.2% in quarantine hospitals. A considerable proportion of HCW had symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and stress. Females were at higher risk of experiencing symptoms of severe anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.12-3.05; p = .016), severe depression (OR, 2.013; 95% CI, 1.17-3.4; p = .011), and severe stress (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; p < .001). Fever hospital workers were at higher risk of severe depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; p < .01), compared to Quarantine hospital workers. CONCLUSION Ensuring proper mental health support for HCW is an important component of public health measures for addressing the COVID-19 epidemic and safeguarding the continuity of appropriate medical service.","Elkholy, Hussien; Tawfik, Fairouz; Ibrahim, Islam; Salah El-Din, Waleed; Sabry, Mohamed; Mohammed, Suzan; Hamza, Mohamed; Alaa, Mohamed; Fawzy, Al Zahraa; Ashmawy, Rasha; Sayed, Maha; Omar, Abdel Nasser",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020960192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972298/,179

Here, we use Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to characterise the unpaired spins associated with the charges generated by molecular doping of the prototypical organic semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The EPR results reveal the P3HT radical cation as the only paramagnetic species in BCF-doped P3HT films and show evidence for increased mobility of the detected spins at high doping concentrations as well as formation of antiferromagnetically coupled spin pairs leading to decreased spin concentrations at low temperatures. The EPR signature for F4TCNQ-doped P3HT is found to be determined by spin exchange between P3HT radical cations and F4TCNQ radical anions. Results from continuous-wave and pulse EPR measurements suggest the presence of the unpaired spin on P3HT in a multitude of environments, ranging from free P3HT radical cations with similar properties to those observed in BCF-doped P3HT, to pairs of dipolar and exchange-coupled spins on P3HT and the dopant anion. Characterisation of the proton hyperfine interactions by ENDOR allowed quantification of the extent of spin delocalisation and revealed reduced delocalisation in the F4TCNQ-doped P3HT films.","Tait, Claudia E; Reckwitz, Anna; Arvind, Malavika; Neher, Dieter; Bittl, Robert; Behrends, Jan",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cp02133h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151324/,179
81916,Waiting for Certainty on Covid-19 Antibody Tests - At What Cost?,2020-06-05,"INTRODUCTION Tunnelled dialysis catheters (TDCs) are being increasingly inserted by nephrologists globally but there is limited experience and paucity of published outcomes data from South-East Asia (SEA). This study was conducted to analyse the outcomes of TDC insertion by nephrologists from a single centre in SEA. METHODS All patients who underwent TDC insertion by nephrologists from October 2013 to June 2016 were included. TDC survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival method. Impact of variables was assessed using Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS A total of 344 TDCs were inserted in 274 patients. The most common indication was haemodialysis initiation (60.2%) followed by existing catheter dysfunction (CD) (12.2%), failed vascular access (10.2%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (CRB) (9.9%). Insertion was successful in 97% patients. The most common location was the right internal jugular vein (87%). The cumulative survival for all TDCs inserted, as defined by the time to non-elective removal of a TDC, at 3, 6 and 9 months was 83%, 61%, and 44%, respectively. Median catheter survival was 231 days. Common indications for removal were CD (13.4%) and CRB or suspected infection (12.5%). Common complications were bleeding (8.72%), infection (13.7%) and CD (16.5%). Median time to infection was 103 days. In multivariate analysis, male gender was associated with poor catheter survival, for primary insertions (p = 0.015, HR 0.62) and diabetes was associated with TDC infection (p = 0.024, OR 1.1). CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first reports of TDC insertion by nephrologists from SEA. Our outcomes compare favourably with those reported in the literature.","Nikam, Milind; Renaud, Claude J; Lee, Joshua Shaowen; Saifful, Sri Fairuz B; Liu, Allen Yan Lun; Lim, Eng Kuang; Seow, Ying Ying; Yeoh, Lee Ying",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28665465/,179

MATERIALS AND METHODS 15 post-graduate students were enrolled in the study, which was performed using the SILStm port system for single-port procedures. All participants were already proficient in total nephrectomies in animal models and performed a left followed by a right nephrectomy. Analyzed data comprised incision size, complications, and the time taken to complete each part of the procedure. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS All students successfully finished the procedure using the single-port system. A total of 30 nephrectomies were analyzed. Mean incision size was 3.61 cm, mean time to trocar insertion was 9.61 min and to dissect the renal hilum was 25.3 min. Mean time to dissect the kidney was 5.18 min and to complete the whole procedure was 39.4 min. Total renal hilum and operative time was 45.8% (p<0.001) and 38% (p=0.001) faster in the second procedure, respectively. Complications included 3 renal vein lesions, 2 kidney lacerations and 1 lesion of a lumbar artery. All were immediately identified and corrected laparoscopically through the single-port system, except for one renal vein lesion, which required the introduction an auxiliary laparoscopic port. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic single-port nephrectomy in the experimental animal model is a feasible but relatively difficult procedure for those with intermediate laparoscopic experience. Intraoperative complications might be successfully treated with the single-port system. Training aids reducing surgical time and improves outcomes.","Marchini, Giovannni Scala; Fioravanti, Italo D; Horta, Leonardo V; Torricelli, Fabio C M; Mitre, Anuar Ibrahim; Arap, Marco Antonio",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1677-5538.ibju.2014.0658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27136472/,179

Since then, the virus has stretched its grip to almost all the countries in the world, affecting millions of people and causing enormous casualties. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2019. As of June 12, 2020, almost 7.30 million people have already been infected globally, with 413,000 reported casualties. In the United States alone, 2.06 million people have been infected and 115,000 have succumbed to this pandemic. A multipronged approach has been launched toward combating this pandemic, with the main focus on exhaustive screening, developing efficacious therapies, and vaccines for long-term immunity. Several pharmaceutical companies in collaboration with various academic institutions and governmental organizations have started investigating new therapeutics and repurposing approved drugs so as to find fast and affordable treatments against this disease.

84690,Occupational Risks and Safety Precautions for COVID-19 in Workers With Rheumatic Diseases.,2020-10-01,"Isatin (1H-indole-2,3-dione)-containing compounds have been shown to possess several remarkable biological activities. We had previously explored a few isatin-based imidazole derivatives for their predicted dual activity against both inflammation and cancer. We explored 47 different isatin-based derivatives (IBDs) for other potential biological activities using in silico tools and found them to possess anti-viral activity. Using AutoDock tools, the binding site, binding energy, inhibitory constant/K i and receptor-ligand interactions for each of the compounds were analyzed against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The partition coefficient (logP) values were predicted using MedChem Designer tool. Based on the best K i, binding energy and the ideal range of logP (between 1.0 and 3.0), 10 out of total 47 compounds were deemed to be prospective RdRp inhibitors. Some of these compounds gave better K i, binding energy and logP values when compared to standard RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (REM) (K i = 15.61 μM, logP = 2.2; binding energy = -6.95), a clinically approved RdRp inhibitor and nine other RdRp inhibitors. The results showed that the 10 selected IBDs could be further explored. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) showed that the selected RdRp-IBD complexes were highly stable compared to the native RdRp and RdRp-REM complex during 100 ns time periods. DFT studies were performed for the compounds 16a, 24a, 28a, 38a and 40a, to evaluate the charge transfer mechanism for the interactions between the IBDs and the RdRp residues. Among these, ADME profiling revealed that 28a is a possible lead compound which can be explored further for anti-RdRp activity in vitro. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Detailed demographic profile, including comorbidities, ocular, and systemic features were analyzed.Results: In the 78 cases, the mean tear positivity was 26.92% (21/78), 2 tear samples being positive despite a negative NP swab. The mean Ct value of tears and NP were 28.17 ± 4.76 and 23.71 ± 6.19, respectively (p= .003). None of the cases had ocular findings or relationship between tear positivity and comorbidity.Conclusions: The viral load of tears is less than the NP secretions with the possibility of prolonged shedding in tears. Tears act as an additional source of contact transmission in ICU that can possibly be decreased by frequent hand hygiene by the patient.Abbreviations: SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; RT-PCR: Real-time Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; COVID-19: Corona virus disease 2019; ICU: Intensive care unit; RdRp: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ORF 1b: Open reading frame 1b; AIIR: Airborne infection isolation room; HCW: Health care workers; VTM: viral transport media; NP: Nasopharyngeal swab; PPE: Personal protective equipment.","Arora, Ritu; Goel, Ruchi; Saxena, Sonal; Manchanda, Vikas; Ahmad, Mohammad; Gupta, Gaurav; Chhabra, Mohit; Kumar, Sumit; Nguyen, Tran Minh Nhu; Payden,; Pumma, Palak; Saxena, Kirti",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2021.1903938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974481/,179

METHODS We calculated the percentage weekly change in visits to SUDT facilities from the week of January 5 through the week of October 11, 2020, relative to the week of January 6 through the week of October 13, 2019. We stratified facilities by county COVID-19 incidence per 10,000 residents in each week and by 2018 fatal drug overdose rate. Finally, we conducted a multivariable linear regression analysis examining percent change in visits per week as a function of county-level COVID-19 tercile, a series of calendar month indicators, and the interaction of county-level COVID-19 tercile and month. We repeated the regression analysis replacing COVID-19 tercile with overdose tercile. RESULTS Beginning the eleventh week of 2020, the number of visits to SUDT facilities declined substantially, reaching a nadir of 48% of 2019 visits in early July. In contrast to January, there were significantly fewer visits in 2020 compared to 2019 in all subsequent months (p < 0.01 in all months). Multivariable regression results found that facilities in the tercile of counties experiencing the most COVID-19 cases had a significantly greater reduction in the number of SUDT visits in 2020 for the months of June through August than facilities in counties with the fewest COVID-19 rates (p < 0.05). The study found no statistically significant difference in the change in the number of visits by facilities in counties with historically different overdose rates. DISCUSSION Our findings support the hypothesis that a reduction has occurred in the average weekly number of visits to SUDT facilities. The size of the effect differs based on the number of COVID-19 cases but not on historical overdose rate.","Cantor, Jonathan; Kravitz, David; Sorbero, Mark; Andraka-Christou, Barbara; Whaley, Christopher; Bouskill, Kathryn; Stein, Bradley D",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134879/,179

This paper aimed to investigate the effect of nutrients on the immune system and their possible roles in the prevention, treatment, and management of COVID-19 in adults. METHODS This Systematic review was designed based on the guideline of the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). The articles that focussed on nutrition, immune system, viral infection, and coronaviruses were collected by searching databases for both published papers and accepted manuscripts from 1990 to 2020. Irrelevant papers and articles without English abstract were excluded from the review process. RESULTS Some nutrients are actively involved in the proper functioning and strengthening of the human immune system against viral infections including dietary protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, iron, zinc, and selenium. Few studies were done on the effect of dietary components on prevention of COVID-19, but supplementation with these nutrients may be effective in improving the health status of patients with viral infections. CONCLUSION Following a balanced diet and supplementation with proper nutrients may play a vital role in prevention, treatment, and management of COVID-19. However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and presenting the strong recommendations against this pandemic.","BourBour, Fatemeh; Mirzaei Dahka, Samaneh; Gholamalizadeh, Maryam; Akbari, Mohammad Esmail; Shadnoush, Mahdi; Haghighi, Mohammad; Taghvaye-Masoumi, Hamidreza; Ashoori, Narjes; Doaei, Saied",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1080/13813455.2020.1791188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644876/,179
88815,Inflammatory bowel disease in Australian Aboriginals and Black South Africans.,2021-05-01,"Males and females of the same species share the majority of their genomes, yet they are frequently exposed to conflicting selection pressures. Gene regulation is widely assumed to resolve these conflicting sex-specific selection pressures, and although there has been considerable focus on elucidating the role of gene expression level in sex-specific adaptation, other regulatory mechanisms have been overlooked. Alternative splicing enables different transcripts to be generated from the same gene, meaning that exons which have sex-specific beneficial effects can in theory be retained in the gene product, while exons with detrimental effects can be skipped. However, at present, little is known about how sex-specific selection acts on broad patterns of alternative splicing. Here we investigate alternative splicing across males and females of multiple bird species. We identify hundreds of genes that have sex-specific patterns of splicing, and establish that sex differences in splicing are correlated with phenotypic sex differences. Additionally, we find that alternatively spliced genes have evolved rapidly as a result of sex-specific selection, and suggest that sex differences in splicing offer another route to sex-specific adaptation when gene expression level changes are limited by functional constraints. Overall, our results shed light on how a diverse transcriptional framework can give rise to the evolution of phenotypic sexual dimorphism.","Rogers, Thea F; Palmer, Daniela H; Wright, Alison E",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977339/,179

89891,Living Well with Kidney Disease by Patient and Care-Partner Empowerment: Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND The implementation of evidence-based healthcare interventions is challenging, with a 17-year gap identified between the generation of evidence and its implementation in routine practice. Although contextual factors such as culture and leadership are strong influences for successful implementation, context remains poorly understood, with a lack of consensus regarding how it should be defined and captured within research. This study addresses this issue by providing insight into how context is defined and assessed within healthcare implementation science literature and develops a definition to enable effective measurement of context. METHODS Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched. Articles were included if studies were empirical and evaluated context during the implementation of a healthcare initiative. These English language articles were published in the previous 10 years and included a definition and assessment of context. Results were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS Three thousand and twenty-one search records were obtained of which 64 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Studies used a variety of definitions in terms of the level of detail and explanation provided. Some listed contextual factors (n = 19) while others documented sub-elements of a framework that included context (n = 19). The remaining studies provide a rich definition of general context (n = 11) or aspects of context (n = 15). The Alberta Context Tool was the most frequently used quantitative measure (n = 4), while qualitative papers used a range of frameworks to evaluate context. Mixed methods studies used diverse approaches; some used frameworks to inform the methods chosen while others used quantitative measures to inform qualitative data collection. Most studies (n = 50) applied the chosen measure to all aspects of study design with a majority analysing context at an individual level (n = 29). CONCLUSIONS This review highlighted inconsistencies in defining and measuring context which emphasised the need to develop an operational definition. By providing this consensus, improvements in implementation processes may result, as a common understanding will help researchers to appropriately account for context in research.","Rogers, L; De Brún, A; McAuliffe, E",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05212-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600396/,179
89906,Ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve block assists in anesthesia for bronchoscopic surgical procedure: A case report of anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy.,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND The horse intestinal tract is sensitive and contains a highly complex microbial population. A shift in the microbial population can lead to various issues such as inflammation and colic. The use of nutraceuticals in the equine industry is on the rise and curcumin is thought to possess antimicrobial properties that may help to minimize the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria. METHODS Four cecally-cannulated horses were utilized to determine the optimal dose of liposomal-curcumin (LIPC) on reducing Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex (SBEC), Escherichia coli K-12, Escherichia coli general, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in the equine hindgut without adversely affecting cecal characteristics. In the first study cecal fluid was collected from each horse and composited for an in vitro, 24 h batch culture to examine LIPC at four different dosages (15, 20, 25, and 30 g) in a completely randomized design. A subsequent in vivo 4 × 4 Latin square design study was conducted to evaluate no LIPC (control, CON) or LIPC dosed at 15, 25, and 35 g per day (dosages determined from in vitro results) for 9 days on the efficacy of LIPC on selected bacterial strains, pH, and volatile fatty acids. Each period was 14 days with 9 d for acclimation and 5 d withdrawal period. RESULTS In the in vitro study dosage had no effect (P ≥ 0.42) on Clostridium strains, but as the dose increased SBEC concentrations increased (P = 0.001). Concentrations of the E. coli strain varied with dose. In vivo, LIPC's antimicrobial properties, at 15 g, significantly decreased (P = 0.02) SBEC when compared to 25 and 35 g dosages. C. perfringens decreased linearly (P = 0.03) as LIPC dose increased. Butyrate decreased linearly (P = 0.01) as LIPC dose increased. CONCLUSION Further studies should be conducted with a longer dosing period to examine the antimicrobial properties of curcumin without adversely affecting cecal characteristics.","Bland, S D; Venable, E B; McPherson, J L; Atkinson, R L",Journal of animal science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40781-017-0138-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28638626/,179

91372,Comparison of outcome after right colectomy with an enhanced recovery programme in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients operated on for other conditions: a monocentric retrospective study.,2021-01-09,"ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused prolonged disruptions in daily life for many communities. Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of youth with chronic pain and their families. We conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study to characterize early adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic among 250 families of youth (ages 12-21 years) diagnosed with chronic headache (64%) or other chronic pain conditions (36%) and to determine whether direct exposures to COVID-19 and secondary economic stress modified symptom trajectories. Youth and parents reported on pain interference, anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms at 4 waves of data collection from April 2020 to July 2020. We also collected qualitative data on the impact of the pandemic on the youth's pain problem. Nearly half of our sample (49.6%) experienced direct exposures to COVID-19. Secondary economic stress was also common, affecting 44.4% of families. Symptom trajectories for pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety remained stable or improved for most participants, indicating adaptive adjustment. However, overall symptom burden was high with persistent and clinically elevated depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms common among youth and parents. Direct exposures to COVID-19 did not modify symptom trajectories. However, youth pain interference and parent insomnia worsened in families who experienced secondary economic stress. Qualitative data revealed perceived benefits and harms from school closures on the youth's pain problem. Our findings of high symptom burden suggest that pediatric pain clinicians should offer distance assessment and treatment (eg, through telemedicine) to avoid pandemic-related disruptions in pain care.","Law, Emily F; Zhou, Chuan; Seung, Fiona; Perry, Frankie; Palermo, Tonya M",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050112/,179

In this paper, the linear epitope of the 3F10 non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that was previously prepared in our laboratory was identified. The expression of truncated forms of the S protein for 3F10 reaction studies proved that the epitope was located between amino acids (aa) 674 and 791. To further locate the core aa of the 3F10 epitope, 12 random peptide libraries were used, and the result showed that the key aa located at aa 685-688 of the S protein (LLAF) were recognized by 3F10. Homology analysis of the regions corresponding to 20 typical strains of different PEDV subtypes showed that the epitope is highly conserved. Identifying the epitope recognized by an antibody helps to improve our understanding of the structure and function of the antigen.

A proposed mechanism linking airway insults to airway hyperreactivity is augmented cholinergic transmission. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that acute potentiation of cholinergic transmission is sufficient to induce airway hyperreactivity. We atomized the cholinergic agonist bethanechol to neonatal piglets and forty-eight hours later measured airway resistance. Bethanechol-treated piglets displayed increased airway resistance in response to intravenous methacholine compared to saline-treated controls. In the absence of an airway insult, we expected to find no evidence of airway inflammation; however, transcripts for several asthma-associated cytokines, including IL17A, IL1A, and IL8, were elevated in the tracheas of bethanechol-treated piglets. In the lungs, prior bethanechol treatment increased transcripts for IFNγ and its downstream target CXCL10. These findings suggest that augmented cholinergic transmission is sufficient to induce airway hyperreactivity, and raise the possibility that cholinergic-mediated regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways might contribute.","Reznikov, Leah R; Meyerholz, David K; Kuan, Shin-Ping; Guevara, Maria V; Atanasova, Kalina R; Abou Alaiwa, Mahmoud H",Lung,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00408-018-0091-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380034/,179

Studies of suicide repetition are important for suicide prevention. This study examined the clinical characteristics and psychiatric comorbidities of pesticide self-harm as associated with suicide attempt repetition status. Patients and Methods This retrospective, observational study included patients admitted to a medical center in northern Taiwan between 2000 and 2015 following suicide attempts by pesticide. Diagnoses were made by a consultation-liaison psychiatry team based on the DSM IV-TR criteria. Independent samples t-test was used to analyze the quantitative variables and Pearson's Chi-squared test with a Bonferroni adjustment for categorical variables. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors for repeated suicide attempt and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis to identify significant associated factors. Results Among 151 patients, organophosphate pesticides were the most used (80.8%). The average age was 52.9±17.2 years. Most patients were married males from rural areas, with depressive disorder most often diagnosed (40.4%). Nearly one-third of them were suicide repeaters (n=43, 28.5%); these patients were less likely to be married (53.5%, p=0.001), had previously used psychiatric services (72.1%, p<0.001) and chose complex suicide (46.5%, p=0.014) more often compared to nonrepeaters. No significant differences were found between repeaters and nonrepeaters regarding psychiatric comorbidities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that marital status (odds ratio: 2.916, 95% confidence interval: 1.234-6.891, p=0.015) and previous psychiatric services usage (odds ratio: 6.897, 95% confidence interval: 3.012-15.625, p<0.001) were significant risk factors associated with suicide repetition. Conclusion Pesticide suicide repeaters were characterized by less likely to be married and more likely to use psychiatric services before suicide attempts. These features help ensuring that the needs of people who have made a suicide attempt are addressed, and it reduces the likelihood of repetition.","Huang, Wei-Chen; Yen, Tzung-Hai; Lin, Long; Lin, Chemin; Juang, Yeong-Yuh; Wang, Bi-Hwa; Lee, Shwu-Hua",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s258475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764947/,179

This prospective, randomized study compared placebo with pregabalin in the hope that a lower pregabalin dose would improve analgesia without increasing side-effects after THA. METHODS This study was a prospective randomized blinded study, with a parallel design and an allocation ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board in Weifang People's Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before enrolment. A total of 120 patients who meet inclusion criteria are randomized to either pregabalin or placebo group. The primary objective of the study was visual analog scale score. As secondary outcomes, opioid consumption measurement, Harris Hip Score, hip range of motion, patient satisfaction, and complications were made at different time points throughout the study for comparison.

96206,The role of telemedicine in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review protocol.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE The academic and scientific community has reacted at pace to gather evidence to help and inform about COVID-19. Concerns have been raised about the quality of this evidence. The aim of this review was to map the nature, scope and quality of evidence syntheses on COVID-19 and to explore the relationship between review quality and the extent of researcher, policy and media interest. DESIGN AND SETTING A meta-research: systematic review of reviews. INFORMATION SOURCES PubMed, Epistemonikos COVID-19 evidence, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection and the WHO COVID-19 database, searched between 10 June 2020 and 15 June 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Any peer-reviewed article reported as a systematic review, rapid review, overview, meta-analysis or qualitative evidence synthesis in the title or abstract addressing a research question relating to COVID-19. Articles described as meta-analyses but not undertaken as part of a systematic or rapid review were excluded. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Abstract and full text screening were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Descriptive information on review type, purpose, population, size, citation and attention metrics were extracted along with whether the review met the definition of a systematic review according to six key methodological criteria. For those meeting all criteria, additional data on methods and publication metrics were extracted. RISK OF BIAS For articles meeting all six criteria required to meet the definition of a systematic review, AMSTAR-2 ((A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, version 2.0) was used to assess the quality of the reported methods. RESULTS 2334 articles were screened, resulting in 280 reviews being included: 232 systematic reviews, 46 rapid reviews and 2 overviews. Less than half reported undertaking critical appraisal and a third had no reproducible search strategy. There was considerable overlap in topics, with discordant findings. Eighty-eight of the 280 reviews met all six systematic review criteria. Of these, just 3 were rated as of moderate or high quality on AMSTAR-2, with the majority having critical flaws: only a third reported registering a protocol, and less than one in five searched named COVID-19 databases. Review conduct and publication were rapid, with 52 of the 88 systematic reviews reported as being conducted within 3 weeks, and a half published within 3 weeks of submission. Researcher and media interest, as measured by altmetrics and citations, was high, and was not correlated with quality. DISCUSSION This meta-research of early published COVID-19 evidence syntheses found low-quality reviews being published at pace, often with short publication turnarounds. Despite being of low quality and many lacking robust methods, the reviews received substantial attention across both academic and public platforms, and the attention was not related to the quality of review methods. INTERPRETATION Flaws in systematic review methods limit the validity of a review and the generalisability of its findings. Yet, by being reported as 'systematic reviews', many readers may well regard them as high-quality evidence, irrespective of the actual methods undertaken. The challenge especially in times such as this pandemic is to provide indications of trustworthiness in evidence that is available in 'real time'.

Given these conditions, using the daily mean PM2.5 concentration in 40 cities from January 2014 to December 2016, this research explored the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations in these three urban agglomerations. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are 35.39 µg/m3, 53.72 µg/m3 and 78.54 µg/m3, respectively. Compared with the other two urban agglomerations, abundant rainfall causes the Pearl River Delta to have the lowest PM2.5 level. Furthermore, a general regression neural network (GRNN) method is developed to predict the PM2.5 concentration in these clusters on the second day, with inputs including the average, maximum and minimum temperature; average, maximum and minimum atmosphere; total rainfall; average humidity; average and maximum wind speed; and the PM2.5 concentration measured 1 day ahead. The results indicate that the GRNN method can precisely predict the concentration level in these clusters, and it is especially useful for the Pearl River Delta, as the underlying influence mechanism is more specified in this cluster than in the others. Importantly, this 1-day-ahead forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations can raise awareness among the public to improve their precautionary behaviours and help urban planners to provide corresponding support.","Yan, Dan; Kong, Ying; Ye, Bin; Xiang, Haitao",Environmental geochemistry and health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00708-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901402/,179

This study evaluated the application of thoracoscopic techniques in more complex, unusual tracheal anomalies. METHODS From January 2002 to October 2008, 9 patients with more rare anatomic tracheal anomalies, between the thoracic inlet and the carina, were treated by thoracoscopy. Ages ranged from 5 months to 8 years and weights ranged from 5.4 to 8 years and from 5.9 to 42 kg. Pathology included 3 H-type TEFs, 2 recurrent TEFs following previous open repair of an esophageal atresia with fistula, resection of a giant tracheal pouch, and 3 tracheobronchi with associated abnormal lung parenchyma. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed thoracoscopically. Operative times ranged from 60 to 130 minutes. Procedures included division and closure of the 3 H-type fistulas and 2 recurrent fistulas, resection of the tracheal pouch, 2 upper lobectomies, and resection of an aberrant upper lobe segment by segmentectomy. There were no operative or postoperative complications. Chest tubes were left in for an average of 1 day, and hospital stay averaged 2.2 days. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopy provides an excellent technique for approaching tracheal pathology from the level of the thoracic inlet to the carina. A thoracoscopic approach avoids the morbidity of a major thoracotomy and virigule or a major neck exploration while providing greater exposure, especially in the upper thorax.","Rothenberg, Steven S",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

99785,Reversible changes in diffusion- and perfusion-based imaging in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.,2015,"OBJECTIVES Sonographic evaluation of neck anatomy before performing percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been shown to predict PDT success. In this study, we compared the real-time, long-axis, in-plane approach to the traditional bronchoscopically guided landmark technique. METHODS Data were analyzed from a prospectively maintained PDT database at a university tertiary care medical intensive care unit. A convenience sample of adult patients requiring PDT for prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence was enrolled. Critical care fellows, under direct supervision of an attending intensivist, performed all PDTs. Tracheostomy performance from the sonographically guided and landmark techniques was compared. RESULTS Twenty-three patients were enrolled: 11 in the sonography group and 12 in the landmark group. Initial midline introducer needle puncture was achieved in 72.7% in the sonography group compared to 8.3% in the landmark group (P< .001). The mean number of introducer needle punctures ± SD was significantly lower in the sonography group compared to the landmark group (1.4 ± 0.7 versus 2.6 ± 0.9; P < .001). The total tracheostomy time was 11.4 ± 4.2 minutes in the sonography group versus 15.3 ± 6.8 minutes in the landmark group (P = .12). Sonography accurately predicted tracheal ring space insertion in 90.9% of patients. Procedural complications did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under real-time sonographic guidance using a long-axis approach may increase the rate of midline punctures and decrease the number of needle punctures when compared to the landmark technique. Sonographic guidance can also help guide accurate and efficient placement of a tracheostomy tube into the desired tracheal ring space.","Dinh, Vi Am; Farshidpanah, Siavash; Lu, Samantha; Stokes, Phillip; Chrissian, Ara; Shah, Harsh; Giri, Paresh; Hecht, David; Nguyen, H Bryant",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.7863/ultra.33.8.1407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063406/,179
100136,Addendum to S3-Guidelines Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: Management of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the COVID-19 Pandemic - open questions and answers.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Heart surgery is a source of high levels of emotional distress for the patient. If the stress experience is not adequately compensated, it can have a negative impact on postoperative recovery, as can untreated comorbid mental disorders. METHODS A selective literature review on emotional distress and mental comorbidities in heart surgery patients and a scoping review on the spectrum and effectiveness of perioperative psychological interventions to compensate and reduce the stress experience. RESULTS Mental factors such as depressive symptoms or anxiety disorders are associated with an elevated risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients treated for heart disease. Mental comorbidities occur more frequently in these patients than in the general population. Following the manifestation of chronic heart disease (CHD), for example, 15-20% of the patients display severe depressive disorders. A few psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce anxiety and depression, emotional distress, consumption of analgesics, and extubation time have been found effective, with low to moderate evidence quality. Many different psychological interventions have proved useful in clinical practice, including multimodal, multiprofessional interventions incorporating medications, education, sports, and exercise as well as psychosocial therapy including stress management. Individual psychotherapy during the period of acute inpatient treatment after myocardial infarction is also effective. CONCLUSION Because psychosocial factors are important, the current guidelines recommend systematic screening for mental symptoms and comorbidities in advance of heart transplantation or the implantation of ventricular assist devices (VAD). Acute psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce mental symptoms can be offered in the perioperative setting.","Tigges-Limmer, Katharina; Sitzer, Matthias; Gummert, Jan",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2021.0116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180796/,179

This disease process was later called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C.) In this case series, we describe three previously healthy children who presented with severe manifestations of MIS-C, including cardiogenic shock and profound systemic inflammation. These children developed severely depressed myocardial function with end-organ injury and were cannulated to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) due to cardiogenic shock with arrhythmia. All three children improved with VA-ECMO support and anti-inflammatory treatment.

They harbor the catalytic cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The light-driven electron transfer from the excited state of the fully-reduced form of FAD to the DNA lesions causes rearrangement of the covalent bonds, leading to the restoration of intact nucleobases. In addition to the catalytic chromophore, some photolyases bear a secondary chromophore with better light absorption capability than FAD, acting as a light-harvesting chromophore that harvests photons in sunlight efficiently and transfers light energy to the catalytic center, as observed in natural photoreceptor proteins. Inspired by nature, we covalently and site-specifically attached a synthetic chromophore to the surface of photolyase using oligonucleotides containing a modified nucleoside and a cyclobutane-type DNA lesion, and successfully enhanced its enzymatic activity in the light-driven DNA repair. Peptide mapping in combination with theoretical calculations identified the amino acid residue that binds to the chromophore, working as an artificial light-harvesting chromophore. Our results broaden the strategies for protein engineering and provide a guideline for tuning of the light perception abilities and enzymatic activity of the photoreceptor proteins.","Terai, Yuma; Sato, Ryuma; Matsumura, Risa; Iwai, Shigenori; Yamamoto, Junpei",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901252/,179
102932,Review of the American Thoracic Society guidelines on the pharmacological management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,2020-11-02,"BACKGROUND Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) guided cardiovascular catheterizations can potentially reduce ionizing radiation exposure and enable new interventions. Commercially available paramagnetic X-Ray devices create a small signal void in CMR images, which is ambiguous and insufficient to guide catheterization procedures. This work aims to improve real-time CMR of off-the-shelf X-Ray devices by developing a real-time positive contrast sequence with color overlay of the device onto anatomy. METHODS A dual-echo bSSFP sequence was used to generate both a dephased positive contrast image and bSSFP image simultaneously. A variable flip angle scheme was implemented to reduce the specific absorption rate (SAR) and hence device heating. Image processing was used to isolate the device from background signal, and the device was overlaid in color on the anatomy, mimicking active device visualization. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed using a commercially available nitinol guidewire for left heart catheterization in Yorkshire swine. RESULTS The dual echo pulse sequence generated a temporal resolution of 175 ms (5.7 frames/second) with GRAPPA acceleration factor 4. Image processing was performed in real-time and color overlay of the device on the anatomy was displayed to the operator with no latency. The color overlay accurately depicted the guidewire location, with minimal background contamination, during left heart catheterization. CONCLUSIONS The ability to effectively visualize commercially available X-Ray devices during CMR-guided cardiovascular catheterizations, combined with safe low-SAR pulse sequences, could potentially expedite the clinical translation of interventional CMR.","Campbell-Washburn, Adrienne E; Rogers, Toby; Xue, Hui; Hansen, Michael S; Lederman, Robert J; Faranesh, Anthony Z",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12968-014-0088-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25359137/,179

Since a novel strain of avian influenza can be cross-infected human as well as birds and livestock due to genetic reassortment, some strains of influenza such as H7N9 and H5N1 have emerged as a severe virus which can be threaten the health of poultry as well as human. Therefore, we explored the development of simultaneously and rapid diagnostic tool for seasonal influenza (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (A/H5N1, A/H7N9). We analyzed the unique nucleotide sequences of influenza types including three seasonal influenza, A/H7N9, and A/H5N1, and distinguished each type of influenza and diagnosed through One Step RT-PCR. In the results, Chip-based PCR technique can be diagnosed rapidly and directly from naked eye with EvaGreen the influenza also respiratory specimens within 23 min 15 s, including reverse transcription. The Chip-based PCR is a point-of-care system, and it is expected to reduce diagnosis time and to develop a diagnostic kit.

Thus, the purpose of this experiment is to develop and verify a tomato transpiration model by correcting the relationship between the transpiration rate and environmental factors by measuring the actual transpiration rate. The actual crop transpiration rate, which is measured using a load cell, and the weight changes calculated at 10-min intervals, are applied to the development of the transpiration model. The experimental results show that the transpiration rate has no linear relationship with the radiation amount (Rad) or vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The relationship between Rad and VPD with transpiration rate was fitted by the exponential rise to maximum, and gaussian peak curve, respectively. This allowed a transpiration model to be developed by compensating the Rad and VPD based on the existing Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation. The developed transpiration model showed higher regression constant values than the existing one. The developed transpiration model from the experiment can be utilized for precise irrigation control.","Jo, Won Jun; Shin, Jong Hwa",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740678/,179

Nevertheless, detailed mechanisms of hyperuricosuria-induced kidney stone formation remained unclear. This study examined changes in cellular proteome and function of renal tubular cells after treatment with high-dose UA for 48-h. Quantitative proteomics using 2-DE followed by nanoLC-ESI-ETD MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry revealed significant changes in levels of 22 proteins in the UA-treated cells. These proteomic data could be confirmed by Western blotting. Functional assays revealed an increase in intracellular ATP level and enhancement of tissue repairing capability in the UA-treated cells. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 and HSP90 (the known receptors for CaOx crystals) were increased in apical membranes of the UA-treated cells. CaOx crystal-cell adhesion assay revealed significant increase in CaOx-binding capability of the UA-treated cells, whereas neutralization of the surface HSP70 and/or HSP90 using their specific monoclonal antibodies caused significant reduction in such binding capability. These findings highlighted changes in renal tubular cells in response to high-dose UA that may, at least in part, explain the pathogenic mechanisms of hyperuricosuria-induced mixed kidney stone disease.","Sutthimethakorn, Suchitra; Thongboonkerd, Visith",Chemico-biological interactions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991862/,179

Interventions to reduce their use are being developed and there is a need to understand their implementation into clinical care. Aim of review This systematic review aims to identify and analyse qualitative research studies exploring the barriers and facilitators to reducing anticholinergic burden. Methods Medline (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EMBSCO) and PsycINFO (OVID) were searched using comprehensive search terms. Peer reviewed studies published in English presenting qualitative research in relation to the barriers and facilitators of deprescribing anticholinergic medications, involving patients, carers or health professionals were eligible. Normalization Process Theory was used to explore and explain the data. Results Of 1764 identified studies, two were eligible and both involved healthcare professionals (23 general practitioners, 13 specialist clinicians and 12 pharmacists). No studies were identified that involved patients or carers. Barriers to collaborative working often resulted in poor motivation to reduce anticholinergic use. Low confidence, system resources and organisation of care also hindered anticholinergic burden reduction. Good communication and relationships with patients, carers and other healthcare professionals were reported as important for successful anticholinergic burden reduction. Having a named person for prescribing decisions, and clear role boundaries, were also important facilitators. Conclusions This review identified important barriers and facilitators to anticholinergic burden reduction from healthcare provider perspectives which can inform implementation of such deprescribing interventions. Studies exploring patient and carer perspectives are presently absent but are required to ensure person-centeredness and feasibility of future interventions.","Stewart, Carrie; Gallacher, Katie; Nakham, Athagran; Cruickshank, Moira; Newlands, Rumana; Bond, Christine; Myint, Phyo Kyaw; Bhattacharya, Debi; Mair, Frances S",International journal of clinical pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-021-01293-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173123/,179

METHODS An obesity model was established by feeding Sprague-Dawley rats (ORs) a high-fat diet (HFD) and treating them with COST for 8 weeks. A model of lipid accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was established by treating HepG2 cells with free fatty acids and COST for 24 h. RESULTS COST treatment of ORs reduced weight gain, inhibited adipose tissue hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and reduced the fat-to-weight ratio. COST improved dyslipidaemia, reduced liver weight and organ index, inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation, and prevented liver steatosis, and the high COST dose increased TC and TG excretion in the stool. Treatment of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells with COST reduced lipid accumulation and TG levels. COST modulated the expression of genes related to fat metabolism and ER stress response pathway-related factors in liver tissue and HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS COST can inhibit weight gain and improve dyslipidaemia and lipid metabolism in ORs. The COST-mediated regulation of hepatic and HepG2 cell lipid metabolism might be related to inhibition of fat synthesis, acceleration of lipid oxidative catabolism and reduction in ER stress.","Deng, Xiaoyi; Ye, Zhijun; Cao, Hua; Bai, Yan; Che, Qishi; Guo, Jiao; Su, Zhengquan",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01107j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602486/,179
107705,KDOQI Clinical Practice Guideline for Vascular Access: 2019 Update.,2020-04-01,"Some historical aspects on late lessons from early warnings on cancer risks with lost time for prevention are discussed. One current example is the cancer-causing effect from radiofrequency (RF) radiation. Studies since decades have shown increased human cancer risk. The fifth generation, 5G, for wireless communication is about to be implemented world-wide despite no comprehensive investigations of potential risks to human health and the environment. This has created debate on this technology among concerned people in many countries. In an appeal to EU in September 2017, currently endorsed by more than 400 scientists and medical doctors, a moratorium on the 5G deployment was required until proper scientific evaluation of negative consequences has been made (www.5Gappeal.eu). That request has not been taken seriously by EU. Lack of proper unbiased risk evaluation of the 5G technology makes adverse effects impossible to be foreseen. This disregard is exemplified by the recent report from the International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) whereby only thermal (heating) effects from RF radiation are acknowledged despite a large number of reported non-thermal effects. Thus, no health effects are acknowledged by ICNIRP for non-thermal RF electromagnetic fields in the range of 100 kHz-300 GHz. Based on results in three case-control studies on use of wireless phones we present preventable fraction for brain tumors. Numbers of brain tumors of not defined type were found to increase in Sweden, especially in the age group 20-39 years in both genders, based on the Swedish Inpatient Register. This may be caused by the high prevalence of wireless phone use among children and in adolescence taking a reasonable latency period and the higher vulnerability to RF radiation among young persons.","Hardell, Lennart; Carlberg, Michael",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594846/,179

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between August 2006 and August 2012 four women and two men (mean age 34.2 years) underwent right laparoscopic appendiceal onlay flap ureteroplasty. The mean stricture length was 2.5 cm. Stricture formation was secondary to impacted ureteric stones in three patients and failed pyeloplasty for congenital pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in the remaining three. Each patient had ipsilateral flank pain before surgery. RESULTS The mean operating time, estimated blood loss and hospital stay were 244 min, 175 mL and 3.2 days, respectively. No intra- or peri-operative complications were noted. The objective success rate was 100% (all patients had radiographic and/or endoscopic resolution of their ureteric strictures). The subjective success rate was 66%, (two patients developed recurrent discomfort, which upon exploration was found to be attributable to fibrosis away from the appendiceal onlay graft, where the gonadal vessels crossed the ureter). Both patients with recurrent pain underwent laparoscopic ureterolysis and bladder advancement flap proximal to the appendiceal onlay, which markedly improved one patient's pain but the other patient continued to have discomfort, ultimately resulting in a laparoscopic nephroureterectomy. CONCLUSIONS Appendiceal onlay ureteroplasty is a viable treatment option for patients with complex right proximal and mid-ureteric strictures, while minimising the potential morbidity of appendiceal and ileal interposition.","Duty, Brian D; Kreshover, Jessica E; Richstone, Lee; Kavoussi, Louis R",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.12651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471943/,179

People have little information about SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus). Internet has become a frequently used tool to obtain information in recent years, while YouTube is one of the popular sources of information with many videos on its platform. This study aims to identify the topics regarding Coronavirus that people learned about on YouTube. The videos about Coronavirus were also evaluated in terms of the reliability of their source of information. METHODS In total, 160 videos on Coronavirus that had 500,000 or more views were analysed. The latent Dirichlet allocation method was used in the process of identifying the topics that were then compared in terms of video parameters. The reliability of the source of information provided by videos was assessed with a modified DISCERN tool. RESULTS A proportion of 15.6 % of these videos had a scientific content, while 45 % of these videos were about the process entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of video reliability, the difference between video types was found to be significant; videos with scientific content had more reliable sources of information (p<0.001).

Initial reports published from Wuhan, China identified only limited symptoms in pregnant women and no cases of mortality, but more recent reports from other regions of the world have reported contrasting information. The purpose of the study was to evaluate initially published cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in China and compare them to subsequently published studies from the remainder of the world. Materials and Methods: This review curates 199 maternal published cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 initially reported in the literature from China and contrasts them to more recent literature reporting clinical findings and outcomes of 729 selected cases from the rest of the world, including the United States. Results: Overall, initial case reports and series from China reported no cases of maternal mortality, which contrasts with subsequent reports from other regions of the world demonstrating significant morbidity and mortality can and does occur in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: While initial reports suggest limited risks of infection in pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2, subsequent findings have demonstrated pregnant women are at risk for severe morbidity and mortality. Case studies and series that are imperative in the early stages of a pandemic to provide data on a novel pathogen cannot be used to provide generalizable information predicting group risks.","Sulentic, Rose O; Seferovic, Maxim D; Aagaard, Kjersti M; Valentine, Gregory C","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1849101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249963/,179

METHODS This prospective comparative cohort study comprised 66 patients complaining of new-onset non-specific typical dry eye 1 month after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Subjects were randomly allocated into control and omega-3 groups based on administration of the systemic rTG form of omega-3 fatty acids for 2 months, in addition to use of artificial teardrop. Ocular surface parameters (Schirmer's test, tear break-up time, corneal staining score and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)) and subjective questionnaire results (Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)) and Dry Eye Questionnaire [DEQ]) for dry eye were evaluated before and after omega-3 supplementation. RESULTS Two months after omega-3 supplementation, the Oxford score was lower in the omega-3 group than in the control group. There was an improvement of subjective symptom scores of OSDI and DEQ in the omega-3 group (both p<0.05). The ratio of increasing MMP-9 level in the omega-3 group was lower than that in the control group (p=0.027). CONCLUSION The rTG form of omega-3 supplementation might be related to reduction of ocular surface inflammation rather than secretion of tears, and it might be effective for non-specific typical dry eye after uncomplicated cataract surgery.

The commonly reported antecedent infections implicated in India include Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), chikungunya, dengue and Japanese encephalitis (JE). In this study from south India, we investigated the role of these four agents in triggering GBS. METHODS This case-control study was performed on 150 treatment-naive patients with GBS and 150 age and sex-matched controls from the same community. IgM immunoreactivity for C. jejuni, chikungunya and dengue were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum patients with GBS and control subjects. Immunoreactivity against JE was detected in serum as well as CSF from patients (n=150) and orthopaedic control (n=45) subjects. The immunoreactivity against infections was compared between demyelinating and axonal subtypes of GBS. RESULTS Overall, 119/150 patients with GBS had serological evidence of antecedent infection. Amongst those with evidence of antecedent infection, 24(16%), 8(5%), 9(6%) patients were exclusively immunoreactive to chikungunya, JE and C. jejuni, respectively. In the remaining patients (78/119), immunoreactivity to multiple pathogens was noted. C. jejuni infection was found in 32% of GBS patients compared to 2.7% controls (p<0.001), whereas chikungunya virus was reported in 66.7% of patients with GBS compared to 44.7% controls (p=0.006). Anti-dengue immunoreactivity was significantly associated with the demyelinating subtype of GBS. Patients positive for JE IgM (CSF) manifested demyelinating electrophysiology. INTERPRETATIONS In this large case-control study, immunoreactivity against multiple infectious agents was observed in a subset of patients. Chikungunya was the commonest antecedent infection, followed by C. jejuni. This article is protected by copyright.

The case was managed successfully with a subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) device and systemic antifungal medication. Case summary A 9-year-old, male, neutered, domestic shorthair cat was referred for severe azotemia, ureteral obstruction, and sonographically identified progressive pyelectasia of the left kidney. A SUB device was placed. Cytology of the left kidney subsequently identified fungal organisms, and the cat responded clinically to treatment with fluconazole and supportive care. The cat survived for 11 months with intermittent fluconazole treatment. Conclusion Fungal pyelonephritis should be considered as a possible concurrent diagnosis in cats with ureteral obstruction.

The older adults are seen as vulnerable because biological, psychological and social ageing predispose the ageing person to frailty, infirmity, and in many cases dependency, setting the older person apart from the rest of the population in need of special protection and rights. Although the implementation of legislation, policies, and a package of integrated programmes and projects to cater to the needs of older persons had helped them to uplift their status, more has to be done to stem the increase of the reach of laws in a more fruitful manner. AIM To develop a colloquial structured Healthcare Policies & Programmes Awareness Questionnaire and assess the awareness about the government healthcare provisions and benefits available for senior citizens among health professionals, older patients, and their caregivers. METHODS This study was conducted in two phases, the development of the questionnaire consisting of relevant healthcare national policies and programmes followed by a cross sectional pilot study on 335 participants. RESULTS The level of awareness was only 45.6% among health professionals followed by 26.4% & 22.2% of awareness among the caregivers and the older adults respectively. CONCLUSION There is a huge gap between the healthcare providers and healthcare takers knowledge due to which the preventive and promotive care of older adults is poor in our country. There is a need to strengthen institutions and mechanism that can more systematically promote interaction between researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders who can influence the uptake of the research findings in a synergistic manner.","Dey, A B; Bajpai, S; Pandey, M; Singh, P; Chaterjee, P; Sati, H C; Pandey, R M",Journal of healthcare quality research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhqr.2020.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069633/,179
114675,Living Well with Kidney Disease by Patient and Care-Partner Empowerment: Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere.,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) is a frequent infection in HIV-positive and also in immunocompromised HIV-negative patients. PCR analysis of pulmonary samples has become an essential element in PCP laboratory diagnosis. Currently, many commercially PCR-based tests are available for P. jirovecii detection and needs to be evaluated. OBJECTIVES We evaluated the performance of the RealStar® Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR kit for PCP diagnosis. METHODS We performed the RealStar® Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR and an in-house PCR in 219 pulmonary samples. We then assessed the performance of the RealStar® Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR kit by classifying patients in proven, probable, possible PCP or no final diagnosis, on the basis of the clinical and radiological signs and direct examination of bronchoalveolar lavage samples. RESULTS The results showed excellent concordance (96.8%) with another in-house PCR, previously used in the laboratory. The available clinical data allowed classifying 219 patients as having proven PCP (n=6), probable PCP (n=27), possible PCP (n=29), and no final diagnosis of PCP (n=157). The RealStar® Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR kit performed well with samples from patients with proven and probable PCP, as indicated by the detection of P. jirovecii DNA in all these samples. The percentage of positive samples in the possible PCP category was 75.9%. In patients with no final diagnosis of PCP, P. jirovecii DNA was detected in 13.4% of samples, indicating colonization by this pathogen. CONCLUSIONS The RealStar® Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR kit shows an excellent performance for PCP diagnosis.","Salsé, M; Mercier, V; Carles, M J; Lechiche, C; Sasso, M",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346113/,179
115045,The 2018 Adult Heart Allocation Policy Change Benefits Low-Volume Transplant Centers.,2021-06-21,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of the LiDCO-rapid™ during intraoperative phlebotomy in anesthetized children prior to surgery for congenital heart disease. Methods After the induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, baseline vital signs were recorded, along with pulse pressure variability (PPV) and stroke volume variability (SVV) from the LiDCO-rapid™ and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Phlebotomy was performed over 5 - 10 min with the volume of blood removed calculated to achieve a hematocrit of 24-28% on cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome was a decline in rSO2 ≥ 5 between the baseline value and the end of phlebotomy. At that time, the correlation of the starting and ending values of SVV and PPV with the NIRS was determined. Results The study cohort included 30 patients (mean age of 21 ± 11 years). Statistically significant changes during the study period were observed in rSO2, but not in the LiDCO-rapid™ parameters. In analysis of continuous NIRS data, the change in NIRS did not correlate with either baseline (r = 0.10, P = 0.644) or final (r = 0.02, P = 0.914) SVV. Likewise, the change in NIRS did not correlate with baseline (r = 0.01, P = 0.953) or final (r = 0.00, P = 0.982) PPV. Conclusion Baseline values as well as changes in the PVV and SVV from the LiDCO-rapid™ did not predict or correlate with changes in cerebral oxygenation measured by NIRS during intraoperative phlebotomy. Our preliminary data suggest that these parameters (PVV and SVV) are not useful in monitoring patient stability or the need for volume replacement during intraoperative phlebotomy prior to cardiac surgery.","Schloss, Brian; Tumin, Dmitry; Naguib, Aymen; Rice, Julie; Galantowicz, Mark; Tobias, Joseph D",Cardiology research,https://doi.org/10.14740/cr634w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317969/,179
115990,In this issue.,2018,"OBJECTIVES High-risk non-muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer (NMIBC) presents an increased risk of progression and cancer death. To reduce these risks, two different treatments are recommended - BCG or radical cystectomy (RC). The purpose of this study is to analyze cancer-specific survival of these two initial treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS BladderBaSe links information from the SNRUBC from 1997 to 2014, with a number of national healthcare and demographic registers. BCG was used for 3,862 patients (399 had delayed RC), while 687 had initial RC. Propensity scores were used to match the patients treated with RC and with relevant variables such as age, gender, and tumor stage with the same number treated with BCG (673 each arm). In a further comparison, an instrumental variable analysis using hospital strategy as the instrument was used. RESULTS The 5-year cancer-specific survival chance was higher for the BCG group than it was for the initial RC group, 87 vs 71%, respectively. In the population with propensity score matching, 78 died from cancer in the BCG group during follow-up and 162 in the RC group. In the instrumental variable analysis, the multivariate adjusted risk difference of cancer-specific death 2 years after diagnosis was 32 per 100 treated patients, in favor of the BCG group. CONCLUSIONS BCG therapy had better cancer-specific survival than RC also when two different statistic methods were used to try to control for confounding. A prospective randomized trial will be necessary to rule out that selection is a major factor for the outcome.","Wang, Eugen Y-H; Larsson, Ulf; Gårdmark, Truls; Malmström, Per-Uno",Scandinavian journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1080/21681805.2020.1851763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305681/,179

This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and follow-up imaging of MWA in the elderly aged 75 years and above. METHODS Eleven percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided MWA of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were performed in 10 patients aged 75 years and older. All but one patient were treated with a high-powered MWA system delivering maximally 140 W. Follow-up with CT and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was carried out over a maximum period of 30 months and a median period of 12 months. RESULTS There were no peri-procedural deaths or major complications. Seven patients were disease free at the time of manuscript submission. Three patients showed growth of the treated lesions, one patient aged 90 years deceased due to unknown cause after approximately 18 months. One patient presented with local progression and disseminated metastatic disease at 12 months; he is still alive. One patient showed increasing soft tissue at the ablation site 15 months post-treatment. Three consecutive core biopsies over 2 months failed to confirm tumour recurrence. CONCLUSIONS MWA therapy is a promising option of treating early-stage NSCLC in the elderly with good treatment outcome and negligible morbidity. Determining successful treatment outcome may be challenging at times as local tissue increase and PET-CT positivity do not seem to necessarily correlate with reccurrence of malignancy.","Acksteiner, Christian; Steinke, Karin",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.12251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335916/,179

Thirty-three participants were selected from four districts of Uganda to reflect different locations, levels of development, cultures, and contexts. Behaviors considered abusive were categorized into five themes: economic abuse, harassment and violence, disrespect, neglect and abandonment, and discrimination. Results showed that participants largely viewed their abuse from a cultural perspective, contrary to the West's perception based on a discourse of human rights.

DENVs derived from both cell types were equally effective at infecting DC-SIGN-expressing human monocytes and dendritic cells. The N-linked glycans on mosquito cell-derived virus were a mix of high-mannose and paucimannose glycans. In virus derived from mammalian cells, the N-linked glycans were a mix of high-mannose and complex glycans. These results indicate that N-linked glycans are incompletely processed during DENV egress from cells, resulting in high-mannose glycans on viruses derived from both cell types. Studies with full-length and truncated E protein demonstrated that incomplete processing was most likely a result of the poor accessibility of glycans on the membrane-anchored protein.","Hacker, Kari; White, Laura; de Silva, Aravinda M",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.012120-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19494052/,179

123747,Recurrent Cesarean scar pregnancy: case series and literature review.,2021-01-07,"The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is making great strides in promoting patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research across Europe, supporting patient organisations to be involved in the projects that it funds. Despite this, the literature around PPI in health services and research originating from European countries appears less than from the United Kingdom (UK), where PPI is well established. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to explore the attitudes and approaches to PPI across Europe. Eight scientific databases were systematically searched and data extracted. Data quality was assessed using a checklist based on the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) (Staniszewska et al., Research, Involvement and Engagement, 3, 13, 2017) and the critical appraisal guidelines developed by Wright et al. (Health Expectations, 13, 359, 2010). We included all studies reporting PPI activity in both public and private health services and research institutions in the World Health Organization European region, excluding the UK, published in the English language from 1996 to 2018. Forty studies in total were included in the analysis. The studies imply a growing interest and support for the idea of PPI in health services and, to a lesser extent, in health research. There seems to be a convergence of conceptualisations of PPI across Europe, with internationally significant areas of innovative work taking place in countries such as the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. However, the implementation of PPI is highly uneven, and PPI is not yet firmly embedded or adequately formalised in European healthcare systems and research, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure, guidance and support. In order to try to get a better understanding of what is happening on the ground, we are carrying out a survey with potential follow-up interviews as the next part of this research project.

In the clinical care setting of ataxia patients, no systematical and standardized assessment of dysphagia is employed. Its impact on patients' health-related quality of life is not well understood. To assess the impact of dysphagia in ataxia patients on diet, body weight, and health-related quality of life. We conducted a large survey using self-reported questionnaires for swallowing-related quality of life (Swal-QOL) and a food frequency list in combination with retrospective clinical data of 119 patients with cerebellar ataxia treated in the neurological outpatient clinic of a large German university hospital. Seventeen percent of ataxia patients suffered from dysphagia based on the Swal-QOL score. Less than 1% of all patients reported dysphagia as one of their most disabling symptoms.

The current published guidelines from surgical societies do not explicitly address ethical dilemmas, such as why public health ethics requires a cessation of nonemergency surgery or how to fairly allocate limited resources for delayed surgical care. We propose ethical guidance for the resumption of care on the basis of public health ethics with a focus on clinical equipoise, triage tiers, and flexibility.

With the introduction of antiretroviral drugs, people living with HIV (PLHIV) have a much better prognosis, even though there are still many new infections in young women. The role of widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the incidence of HIV in young women is unknown. METHODS We will conduct a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), World Health Organization's (WHO's) library database, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), conference abstracts, and gray literature sources to identify any relevant literature. We will include randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and cohort studies in which ART was offered to adults aged 18 and above reporting outcomes in females aged 15 to 24 years. The outcomes of interest are HIV incidence, ART initiation, adherence, retention, and viral load suppression. We will screen titles, abstracts, and the full texts of relevant articles in duplicate. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will extract data on the risk of HIV infection in younger females after the use of ART in the adult population. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to look at the impact of ART use among adults on HIV incidence in young women. The results of this review will be used in a modeling study to simulate the effects of using ART as an effective tool to prevent sexual transmission of HIV to young women. Our findings will inform the treatment-as-prevention (TasP) strategy to reduce new HIV infections among young women.

128281,Care of future mothers amid the COVID-19 outbreak: is there a monitoring role for lung ultrasound?,2020-09-01,"Few monoclonal antibodies are currently approved for treating infectious diseases, but multiple products are in development against a broad range of infectious diseases, including Ebola, influenza, hepatitis B, HIV, dengue, and COVID-19. The maturity of mAb technologies now allow us to identify and advance neutralizing mAb products to the clinic at ""pandemic pace"", as the pipeline of mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated. Ensuring global access to these products for passive immunization, however, will require both low manufacturing cost and multi-ton production capacity - particularly for those infectious diseases where the geographic burden falls mostly in low- and middle-income countries or those with pandemic potential. Analysis of process economics and manufacturing technologies for antibody and other parenteral protein therapeutics demonstrates the importance of economies of scale to reducing the cost of goods for drug substance manufacturing. There are major benefits to convergence on a standardized platform process for antibody production that is portable to most existing very large-scale facilities, carries low risk for complications during process transfer and scale-up, and has a predictable timeline and probability of technical and regulatory success. In the case of an infectious disease with pandemic potential which could be treated with an antibody, such as COVID-19 or influenza, these advantages are paramount.

Despite their importance, the population mutation properties of tumor evolution have not been well studied, especially in terms of overall genetic heterogeneity. The current study aims to examine factors in tumor evolution influencing overall genetic heterogeneity. Extensive simulations of the representative evolutionary patterns of various tumors were conducted in the current study to determine the overall genetic characteristics of tumor evolution. The variations in cell birth/death rates and angiogenesis duration were examined based on the simplest growth pattern of tumors with avascular growth, angiogenesis, and vascular growth. To examine the impact of evolutionary tree structure, three-step linear evolution and branching evolution were investigated based on various subpopulation initiation times. The population size during the initial growth phase and the duration of angiogenesis are important factors affecting overall genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the shape of the evolutionary tree is crucial for defining the genetic heterogeneity of the extant tumor cell population, indicating the importance of the initiation timing of subpopulations. Branching evolution results in slightly greater genetic heterogeneity in terms of allelic distribution than in terms of the number of variants. The results of the current study reveal that the pattern of tumor evolution is critical for defining tumor genetic heterogeneity. These population genetic approaches are important for understanding the properties of tumor cell populations.","Park, LeeYoung",Medical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01421-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975667/,179

We sought to investigate whether HbA1c levels are associated with high platelet reactivity (HPR) in patients loaded with clopidogrel and aspirin, thereby constituting an argument for intensified antiplatelet therapy in patients with poor glycemic control. In the prospective, multicenter Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug Eluting Stents registry, HbA1c levels were measured as clinically indicated in 1,145 of 8,582 patients, stratified by HbA1c <6.5% (n = 551, 48.12%), 6.5% to 8.5% (n = 423, 36.9%), and >8.5% (n = 171, 14.9%). HPR on clopidogrel and aspirin was defined after PCI as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) >208 and aspirin reaction units >550, respectively. HPR on clopidogrel was frequent (48.3%), whereas HPR on aspirin was not (3.9%). Patients with HbA1c >8.5% were younger, more likely non-Caucasian, had a greater body mass index, and more insulin-treated diabetes and acute coronary syndromes. Proportions of PRU >208 (42.5%, 50.2%, and 62.3%, p <0.001) and rates of definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST; 0.9%, 2.7%, and 4.2%, p = 0.02) increased progressively with HbA1c groups. Clinically relevant bleeding was greatest in the intermediate HbA1c group (8.2% vs 13.1% vs 9.5%, p = 0.04). In adjusted models that included PRU, high HbA1c levels (>8.5) remained associated with ST (hazard ratio 3.92, 95% CI 1.29 to 12.66, p = 0.02) and cardiac death (hazard ratio 4.24, 95% CI 1.41 to 12.70) but not bleeding at 2-year follow-up. There was no association between aspirin reaction units >550 and HbA1c levels. In conclusion, in this large-scale study, HbA1c and HPR were positively associated, but the clinical effect on adverse outcome was driven by poor glycemic control, which predicted ST and cardiac death after PCI regardless of PRU levels, warranting efforts to improve glycemic control after DES implantation in patients with diabetes mellitus.","Schoos, Mikkel M; Dangas, George D; Mehran, Roxana; Kirtane, Ajay J; Yu, Jennifer; Litherland, Claire; Clemmensen, Peter; Stuckey, Thomas D; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Weisz, Giora; Rinaldi, Michael J; Neumann, Franz-Josef; Metzger, D Christopher; Henry, Timothy D; Cox, David A; Duffy, Peter L; Brodie, Bruce R; Mazzaferri, Ernest L; Maehara, Akiko; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.10.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639039/,179

Worldwide measures are taken to prevent human to human transmission and improve general health. Public lifestyle and health are affected by social distancing and isolation. A strong host immune response to the novel coronavirus is a key factor, for protection against infection and avoiding reaching severe stages of the disease. AREAS COVERED Pathophysiology and the human immune response of similar coronaviruses have been previously described. The novel coronavirus has distinct clinical stages related to the immune response. Exercise improves host innate immunity and affords protection to viral infections. Exercise also mitigates the negative effects of isolation including stress, anxiety and sedentarism, all of which further reduces immunity and increases non-communicable disease risk. EXPERT OPINION Improving host immunity and mitigating the negative effects of isolation via physical activity is strongly justified. Exercise should be done in moderate intensities and volumes during the current pandemic, which is a nutritionally, psychologically, socially challenging environment in the presence of a virulent viral organism. Proactively creating innovative health promotion models with technology and government involvement with best available evidence should be encouraged to reduce physical inactivity during the current COVID-19 pandemic and after.","Ranasinghe, Chathuranga; Ozemek, Cemal; Arena, Ross",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1794818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662717/,179

Lamins are involved in numerous functions, including a role in providing structural support to the cell and the mechanosensing of the cell. Mutations in the genes encoding for lamins lead to the rare diseases termed laminopathies. However, not only laminopathies show alterations in the nuclear lamina. Deregulation of lamin expression is reported in multiple cancers and several viral infections lead to a disrupted nuclear lamina. The structural and mechanical effects of alterations in the nuclear lamina can partly explain the phenotypes seen in disease, such as muscular weakness in certain laminopathies and transmigration of cancer cells. However, a lot of answers to questions about the relation between changes in the nuclear lamina and disease development remain elusive. Here, we review the current understandings of the contribution of the nuclear lamina in the structural support and mechanosensing of healthy and diseased cells.","Stiekema, Merel; van Zandvoort, Marc A M J; Ramaekers, Frans C S; Broers, Jos L V",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9081884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796718/,179

Following coil-supported Pipeline embolization in 4 cases and stent-supported coiling in 1, 5 patients developed multiple subcentimeter enhancing lesions, usually with surrounding edema and variable magnetic susceptibility in the vascular territories of the treated aneurysms. Conventional angiography findings were unrevealing. Laboratory work-up showed mild CSF protein elevation with no leukocytosis. Brain biopsy in 2 cases revealed granulomatous angiitis encasing foreign material, identical in stain appearance to a polyvinylpyrrolidone catheter coating. Corticosteroid administration typically produced clinical improvement. A heterogeneous radiographic and clinical course was noted, with rise and fall in the number of enhancing lesions in 2 patients and persistence in others.

METHODS Fresh donor corneas and primary explant cultures of corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells were evaluated for expression of viral entry factors. Using immunohistochemistry, samples were tested for expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non integrin (DC-SIGN), DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). RESULTS In total, five donor corneas were evaluated for expression of viral entry factors. In all specimens, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed throughout the surface epithelium (corneal, limbal, and conjunctival) and corneal endothelium. In corneal stromal cells, ACE2 was sporadically expressed while TMPRSS2 was absent. DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR expression varied between donor specimens. Four specimens expressed DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR in a similar distribution to ACE2, but one specimen from a young donor showed no expression of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR. ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR were all expressed in cultured corneal, limbal, conjunctival epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS Both corneal and conjunctival epithelium express ACE2, DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR, and TMPRSS2 suggesting that the ocular surface is a potential route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The risk of viral transmission with corneal transplantation cannot be ruled out given the presence of ACE2 in corneal epithelium and endothelium. Cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells mimic the expression of viral entry factors in fresh donor tissue and may be useful for future in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection studies.","Roehrich, Heidi; Yuan, Ching; Hou, Joshua H",Cornea,https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000002509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826650/,179

Nevertheless, many occupational health and safety (OHS) guidelines are still not based on the best available evidence. In the last decade, numerous systematic reviews on behavioural, relational and mixed interventions to reduce occupational injuries and diseases have been carried out, but a comprehensive synopsis is yet missing. The aim of this overview of reviews is to provide a comprehensive basis to inform evidence-based decision-making about interventions in the field of OHS. METHODS We conducted an overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), epistemonikos.org and Scopus (Elsevier) for relevant systematic reviews published between January 2008 and June 2018. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications and determined the risk of bias of the included systematic reviews with the ROBIS (Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews) tool. RESULTS We screened 2287 abstracts and 200 full-texts for eligibility. Finally, we included 25 systematic reviews with a low risk of bias for data synthesis and analysis. We identified systematic reviews on the prevention of occupational injuries, musculoskeletal, skin and lung diseases, occupational hearing impairment and interventions without specific target diseases. Several interventions led to consistently positive results on individual diseases; other interventions did not show any effects, or the studies are contradictory. We provide detailed results on all included interventions. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive overview of behavioural, relational and mixed interventions and their effectiveness in preventing occupational injuries and diseases. It provides policymakers with an important basis for making evidence-based decisions on interventions in this field.

137344,Surface electromyography before and after orthognathic surgery and condylectomy in active laterognathia: a case report.,2017,"BACKGROUND Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are communications between an artery and a vein outside the capillary level. This pathologic communication may be either a fistula, a simple communication between a single artery and a dilated vein, or a more complex communication, a nidus of tortuous channels between one or more arteries/arterioles and one or more draining veins. The latter type of lesion is most frequently seen in the extremities; in the kidney they tend to appear more rarely. The most common clinical presentation of renal arteriovenous malformations (RAVMs) is haematuria. Percutaneous treatment with selective endovascular techniques offers a minimally invasive, nephron-sparing option in comparison to the more invasive surgical approaches. The purpose of this pictorial review is to highlight the general lines of management and to show the range of imaging findings of the percutaneous treatment of RAVMs. METHODS The imaging characteristics of a selection of cases of percutaneously managed congenital RAVMs are presented and the most common lines of approach are discussed. CONCLUSION The imaging spectrum of diagnosis and percutaneous treatment of RAVMs is presented in order to aid interpretation and endovascular management. TEACHING POINTS • Renal arteriovenous malformations are very rare lesions. • Clinical expression is usually haematuria. • Diagnosis is made with CT or MRI but the gold standard is digital subtraction angiography. • Catheter-directed treatment with the use of coils or liquid embolics is minimally invasive, safe and effective.","Hatzidakis, Adam; Rossi, Michele; Mamoulakis, Charalampos; Kehagias, Elias; Orgera, Gianluigi; Krokidis, Miltiadis; Karantanas, Apostolos",Insights into imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13244-014-0342-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996396/,179

This study was undertaken with the aim of determining and improving signs and symptoms of venous disease (measured by venous clinical severity score) and complications (by routine surveillance ultrasound and long-term post-operative follow up) for each treatment strategy. METHODS We performed a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from 979 limbs undergoing procedures for significant varicose veins and venous insufficiency from March 2008 until June 2014 performed at a single tertiary referral hospital. Patient demographics, Clinical Etiology Anatomy and Pathophysiology classification, venous clinical severity scores pre- and post-procedure, treatment chosen, and peri-operative complications were collected; descriptive statistics were calculated and unadjusted surgical outcomes for patients stratified by the procedure performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between procedure type and thrombotic complications after adjusting for patient characteristics, severity of disease, pre-operative anticoagulation, and post-operative compression. RESULT Venous clinical severity scores improved more with radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared to radiofrequency ablation alone (3.8 ± 3.4 vs. 3.2 ± 3.1, p = 0.018). Regarding deep venous thrombosis, there was no significant difference between radiofrequency ablation + transilluminated powered phlebectomy vs. radiofrequency ablation alone. There was no statistical difference in asymptomatic endovenous heat-induced thrombosis or infection, although there were slightly more hematomas and cases of asymptomatic superficial thrombophlebitis with combined therapy. On multivariable analysis, only procedure type predicted thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION Ablation of axial reflux plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy produces improved outcomes as measured by venous clinical severity score, with slight increases in minor post-operative complications and should be strongly considered as initial therapy when patients present with significant symptomatic varicose veins and superficial venous insufficiency. Implementation of a standardized thromboprophylaxis protocol with individual risk assessment results in few significant thrombotic complications amongst high-risk patients, thus potentially obviating the need for routine post-operative duplex.","Obi, Andrea T; Reames, Bradley N; Rook, Trent J; Mouch, Sandford O; Zarinsefat, Arya; Stabler, Cathy; Rectenwald, John E; Coleman, Dawn M; Wakefield, Thomas W",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355515604257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26376824/,179

140157,Identifying perceptions and barriers regarding vaccination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A Canadian perspective.,2020-09-23,"Most bacteria naturally release spherical lipid-bilayered extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing proteins, nucleic acids, and virulence-related molecules, thus contributing to diverse biological functions including transport of virulence factors. The group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), a major human pathogen, also releases EVs; however, it remains unclear how GAS EVs interact physiologically and pathologically with host cells, and what the differences are between invasive and non-invasive strains. The proteome profile in this study revealed that GAS EVs enclosed many virulence-related proteins such as streptolysin O and NAD-glycohydrolase, facilitating their pathogenicity, and invasive GAS EVs were more abundant than non-invasive counterparts. In terms of biological effects, invasive GAS EVs showed slo-dependent cytotoxic activity and the induction of cytokine expression, contributing to GAS pathogenicity directly. Although non-invasive GAS EVs did not show cytotoxic activity, they may be utilized as a means to prevent antibacterial mechanisms such as autophagy, leading to enhancement of their own survival in the intracellular environment after the infection. These results suggest that invasive and non-invasive GAS EVs play different roles in GAS infection strategy and pathogenicity. Our findings also indicate that EVs could be a key factor for GAS pathogenicity in GAS-host interactions.","Murase, Kazunori; Aikawa, Chihiro; Nozawa, Takashi; Nakatake, Ayako; Sakamoto, Kuniyo; Kikuchi, Taisei; Nakagawa, Ichiro",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.711144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350134/,179

140631,Evolution of the emotional impact in patients with early Inflammatory Bowel Disease during and after Covid-19 lockdown.,2021-05-20,"Purpose Metastases from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) occur in 2-5% of cases. Surgery is the standard treatment, often combined with adjuvant radiotherapy. Concurrent carboplatin treatment with post-operative radiotherapy may be prescribed, although it has not shown benefit in recent clinical trials in high-risk cSCC patients. The novel high-Z nanoparticle thulium (III) oxide has been shown to enhance radiation dose delivery to brain tumors by specific uptake of these nanoparticles into the cancerous tissue. As the dose-enhancement capacity of thulium oxide nanoparticles following radiotherapy against metastatic cSCC cells is unknown, its efficacy as a radiosensitizer was evaluated, with and without carboplatin. Methodology Novel and validated human patient-derived cell lines of metastatic cSCC were used. The sensitivity of the cells to radiation was investigated using short term proliferation assays as well as clonogenic survival as the radiobiological endpoint. Briefly, cells were irradiated with 125 kVp orthovoltage X-rays (0 - 6 Gy) with and without thulium oxide nanoparticles (99.9 % trace metals basis; 50 µg/ml) or low dose carboplatin pre-sensitization. Results Cellular uptake of the nanoparticles was first confirmed by microscopy and found to have no impact on short-term cell survival for the cSCC cells, highlighting the biocompatibility of thulium oxide nanoparticles. Clonogenic cell survival assays confirmed radio-sensitization when exposed to thulium nanoparticles, with the cell sensitivity increasing by a factor of 1.24 (calculated at the 10% survival fraction) for the irradiated cSCC cells. The combination of carboplatin with thulium oxide nanoparticles with irradiation did not result in significant further reductions in survival compared to nanoparticles alone. Conclusions This is the first study to provide in vitro data demonstrating the independent radiosensitization effect of high-Z nanoparticles against metastatic cSCC with or without carboplatin. Further preclinical investigations with radiotherapy plus high-Z nanoparticles for the management of metastatic cSCC are warranted.","Perry, Jay Ryan; Minaei, Elahe; Engels, Elette; Ashford, Bruce; McAlary, Luke; Clark, Jonathan; Gupta, Ruta; Tehei, Moeava; Corde, Stéphanie; Carolan, Martin; Ranson, Marie",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abaa5d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726756/,179

141416,Traditional Chinese Medicine guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019.,2020-12-01,"Compared to genomic data of individual markers, haplotype data provide higher resolution for DNA variants, advancing our knowledge in genetics and evolution. Although many computational and experimental phasing methods have been developed for analyzing diploid genomes, it remains challenging to reconstruct chromosome-scale haplotypes at low cost, which constrains the utility of this valuable genetic resource. Gamete cells, the natural packaging of haploid complements, are ideal materials for phasing entire chromosomes because the majority of the haplotypic allele combinations have been preserved. Therefore, compared to the current diploid-based phasing methods, using haploid genomic data of single gametes may substantially reduce the complexity in inferring the donor's chromosomal haplotypes. In this study, we developed the first easy-to-use R package, Hapi, for inferring chromosome-length haplotypes of individual diploid genomes with only a few gametes. Hapi outperformed other phasing methods when analyzing both simulated and real single gamete cell sequencing datasets. The results also suggested that chromosome-scale haplotypes may be inferred by using as few as three gametes, which has pushed the boundary to its possible limit. The single gamete cell sequencing technology allied with the cost-effective Hapi method will make large-scale haplotype-based genetic studies feasible and affordable, promoting the use of haplotype data in a wide range of research.","Li, Ruidong; Qu, Han; Chen, Jinfeng; Wang, Shibo; Chater, John M; Zhang, Le; Wei, Julong; Zhang, Yuan-Ming; Xu, Chenwu; Zhong, Wei-De; Zhu, Jianguo; Lu, Jianming; Feng, Yuanfa; Chen, Weiming; Ma, Renyuan; Ferrante, Sergio Pietro; Roose, Mikeal L; Jia, Zhenyu",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668004/,179
143026,Acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after COVID-19 infection and subsequent ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.,2021-10-04,"Rotator cuff tendon tears are one of the most common shoulder pathologies, especially in the aging population. Due to a poor healing response and degenerative changes associated with aging, rotator cuff repair failure remains common. Although cell-based therapies to augment rotator cuff repair appear promising, it is unknown whether the success of such a therapy is age-dependent. We hypothesized that autologous cell therapy would improve tendon-to-bone healing across age groups, with autologous juvenile cells realizing the greatest benefit. In this study, juvenile, adult, and aged rats underwent bilateral supraspinatus tendon repair with augmentation of one shoulder with autologous tendon-derived cell-seeded polycaprolactone scaffolds. At 8 weeks, shoulders treated with cells in both juvenile and aged animals exhibited increased cellularity, increased collagen organization, and improved mechanical properties. No changes between treated and control limbs were seen in adult rats. These findings suggest that cell delivery during supraspinatus repair initiates earlier matrix remodeling in juvenile and aged animals. This may be due to the relative ""equilibrium"" of adult tendon tissue with regards to catabolic and anabolic processes, contrasted with actively growing juvenile tendons and degenerative aged tendons. This study demonstrates the potential for autologous cell-seeded scaffolds to improve repairs in both the juvenile and aged population. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

METHODS From May 2011 to May 2020, 59 patients out of 240 with AAAD underwent ARREAA. Data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS The mean age was 61.4 ± 8.6 years and 43 patients were males (73%). Hemiarch and total arch replacement were performed in 37 (62.7%) and 14 (23.7%) patients. An aortic valvuloplasty was performed in seven patients (11.8%). Five patients (8.5%) required coronary artery bypass graft. Re-exploration for bleeding was required in six patients (10.1%). The 30-day mortality rate was 18.6%. Preoperative hemodynamic instability (odds ratio [OR] = 8.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.57-46.71; p = 0.013), consciousness disorder (OR = 19.18, 95% CI = 3.02-121.72]; p = 0.002) or myocardial ischemia (OR = 6.28, 95% CI = 1.27-31.10; p = 0.013) were significantly associated with postoperative mortality. No patient was reoperated for aortic valve during the postoperative period. One patient suffered a stroke postoperatively with partial recovery. Kidney failure requiring temporary dialysis occurred in 12 patients (20.3%). At discharge, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate aortic regurgitation (AR; grade 2) in two patients. During follow-up (mean = 58.4 ± 32.4 months), three patients died. The rate of mortality was 6.2%. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 76.3%. No patient required reoperation on the proximal aorta or aortic valve. At 4 years, freedom from any aortic valve or root reintervention and AR > 2 were both 100%. CONCLUSION In a center with expertise in valve-sparing procedures, ARREAA is a reasonable option in the surgical management of AAAD in selected patients. This technique stabilizes the aortic annulus and preserves root anatomy for durable outcomes.","Morgant, Marie-Catherine; Malapert, Ghislain; Bernard, Chloé; Laubriet, Aline; Pujos, Charline; Varin, Thomas; Lansac, Emmanuel; Bouchot, Olivier",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032374/,179

METHODS The German Glioma Network cohort was screened for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who received TMZ/RT → TMZ and completed ≥6 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy without progression. Associations of clinical patient characteristics, molecular markers, and residual tumor determined by magnetic resonance imaging after 6 cycles of TMZ with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed with the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed to assess associations of prolonged TMZ use with outcome. RESULTS Sixty-one of 142 identified patients received at least 7 maintenance TMZ cycles (median 11, range 7-20). Patients with extended maintenance TMZ treatment had better PFS (20.5 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.7-23.3, vs 17.2 months, 95% CI 10.2-24.2, p = 0.035) but not OS (32.6 months, 95% CI 28.9-36.4, vs 33.2 months, 95% CI 25.3-41.0, p = 0.126). However, there was no significant association of prolonged TMZ chemotherapy with PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.559) or OS (HR = 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.3, p = 0.218) adjusted for age, extent of resection, Karnofsky performance score, presence of residual tumor, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, or isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. CONCLUSION These data may not support the practice of prolonging maintenance TMZ chemotherapy beyond 6 cycles.

144860,Mobile Health Approaches to Breastfeeding.,2021-04-02,"The COVID-19 pandemic has unhinged the lives of employees across the globe, yet there is little understanding of how COVID-19 health anxiety (CovH anxiety)-that is, feelings of fear and apprehension about having or contracting COVID-19-impacts critical work, home, and health outcomes. In the current study, we integrate transactional stress theory (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) with self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) to advance and test a model predicting that CovH anxiety prompts individuals to suppress emotions, which has detrimental implications for their psychological need fulfillment. In turn, lack of psychological need fulfillment hinders employees' abilities to work effectively, engage with their family, and experience heightened well-being. Our model further predicts that handwashing frequency-a form of problem-focused coping-will mitigate the effects of CovH anxiety. We test our propositions using a longitudinal design that followed 503 employees across the first four weeks that stay-at-home and social distancing orders were enacted. Consistent with predictions, CovH anxiety was found to impair critical work (goal progress), home (family engagement) and health (somatic complaints) outcomes due to increased emotion suppression and lack of psychological need fulfillment. Further, individuals who frequently engage in handwashing behavior were buffered from the negative impact of CovH anxiety. Combined, our work integrates and extends existing theory and has a number of important practical implications. Our research represents a first step to understanding the work-, home-, and health-related implications of this unprecedented situation, highlighting the detrimental impact of the anxiety stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS We retrospectively identified all patients with newly diagnosed endometrial carcinosarcoma who underwent primary surgery via any approach at our institution from January 2009 to January 2018. Patients with known bulky disease identified on preoperative imaging were excluded. The χ2 and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival, and compared using the log rank test. RESULTS We identified 147 eligible patients, of whom 37 (25%) underwent an open approach and 110 (75%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. Within the minimally invasive group, 92 (84%) of 110 patients underwent a robotic procedure and 14 (13%) underwent a laparoscopic procedure. Four minimally invasive cases (4%) were converted to open procedures. Median age, body mass index, operative time, stage, complication grade, and use of adjuvant treatment were clinically and statistically similar between groups. Median length of hospital stay in the open group was 4 days (range 3-21) compared with 1 day (range 0-6) in the minimally invasive group (p<0.001). The rates of any 30-day complication were 46% in the open and 8% in the minimally invasive group (p<0.001). The rates of grade 3 or higher complications were 5.4% and 1.8%, respectively (p=0.53). Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 30 months (range 0.4-121). Two-year progression-free survival rates were 52.8% (SE±8.4) in the open group and 58.5% (SE±5.1) in the minimally invasive group (p=0.7). Two-year disease-specific survival rates were 66.1% (SE±8.0) and 81.4% (SE±4.1), respectively (p=0.8).

Our aim in this study was to study the sexual function of men after TEP and LH repair according to SF 36 (Health Survey Scoring Demonstration) and IIEF (The International Index of Erectile Function). METHODS A total of 176 men with unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized into two groups. Group T (n = 88) received TEP hernia repair, and Group L (n:88) received LH repair. Patients' demographics and perioperative findings were recorded. For all patients, the preoperative as well as postoperative 7th, 30th and 90th day SF 36 and IIEF were recorded. RESULTS A total of 176 operations consisting of 88 TEP and 88 LH repairs were evaluated. There were no differences in demographics, hernia type, and complications except for body mass index (BMI). The operative time was higher in Group T (29.6 ± 5.8 vs. 43.5 ± 5.7 min; p = 0.001). The averages of the SF 36-Vitality and Social Function for Postoperative (PO) 30th day scores were higher in Group T. The averages of the SF 36-Bodily Pain, General Health, Physical Role, Emotional Role for PO 7-30th days SF36- Mental Health for PO 7th day and SF 36 Physical Function for PO 30-90th days scores were statistically higher in Group T. The averages of the IIEF- Erectile Function for PO 30th day, IIEF- Orgasmic Function, Sexual Desire, Intercourse Satisfaction, and Intercourse Satisfaction for PO 7th and 30th days scores were higher in Group T. CONCLUSIONS TEP and LH repairs have similar results for recurrence, complications, and hospital stay; otherwise, TEP repair yields better results than the LH repair in the postoperative course at the 7th and 30th day evaluation, concerning sexual function and quality of life, but this benefit is no longer apparent at the 90th day.

METHODS Six complete cadaveric dissections were performed to identify key anatomic landmarks, and these landmarks were validated in two consecutive patients with T1 human papillomavirus-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil treated by TORS. For radiographic landmark analysis, 25 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck for a variety of endoscopic skull base procedures were selected. Measurements were taken from the lateral pharyngeal wall at C2-C3 interspace and greater horn of hyoid (C6) to the external carotid artery (ECA). RESULTS The glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve was consistently identified deep to the superior constrictor musculature and at the intersection of the posterior tonsillar pillar with the base of tongue.

Five 3 T, single-voxel, stimulated echo acquisition mode spectra (STEAM) were acquired consecutively at progressively longer TEs in a fat-water emulsion phantom and in 121 human subjects with known or suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. T(2)-corrected peak areas were calculated. Phantom data were used to validate the model. Human data were used in the model to determine the complete liver fat spectrum. In the fat-water emulsion phantom, the spectrum predicted by the model (based on known fatty acid chain distribution) agreed closely with spectroscopic measurement. In human subjects, areas of CH(2) peaks at 2.1 and 1.3 ppm were linearly correlated (slope, 0.172; r = 0.991), as were the 0.9 ppm CH(3) and 1.3 ppm CH(2) peaks (slope, 0.125; r = 0.989).

149733,Respiratory modulations in the photoplethysmogram (DPOP) as a measure of respiratory effort.,2016,"BACKGROUND Although many previous studies on local ablation outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have dichotomized tumor size with a 3-cm cutoff to determine prognostic significance, a growing number of reports describe excellent outcomes for larger tumors. To address the logic of this 3-cm cutoff beyond small single-center experiences, we stratified patients by 1-cm tumor size intervals and hypothesized that disease-specific survival (DSS) would not vary significantly between adjacent groups. METHODS Patients treated with local ablation for T1 HCC (≤8 cm) were identified from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database (2004-2008). Log-rank tests and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare DSS curves of adjacent study groups. RESULTS There were 1,083 patients included in the study (26 % female, median age: 62 years). The 3-year DSS was significantly lower in patients with 3- to 4-cm tumors compared to 2- to 3-cm tumors (58 vs. 72 %, p = 0.002). In adjusted models, DSS did not vary significantly between any size intervals up to 3 cm. Patients with 3- to 4-cm tumors, however, had a poorer prognosis compared with patients with 2- to 3-cm tumors (hazard ratio: 1.6, 95 % confidence interval: 1.18-2.18, p = 0.002). DSS also fell when tumor size increased from 5-6 to 6-7 cm (53 vs. 21 %, 0.006). CONCLUSIONS This study emphasizes the 3-cm size, and possibly the 6-cm size, as informative predictive thresholds when ablating HCC, because variability of DSS occurred specifically at these tumor sizes. Future research in this field should either adopt a 3-cm breakpoint or provide evidence for alternative thresholds.","Groeschl, Ryan T; Gamblin, T Clark; Turaga, Kiran K",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-013-3031-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720072/,179

These operations are possible with optical transformations that reshape optical wave fronts according to azimuthal scaling. However, schemes proposed thus far have been limited to OAM multiplication by integer factors and require complex beam-copying or multitransformation diffraction stages; a result of the limited phase excursion 2πℓ around the annulus of an OAM state exp(iℓθ). Based on the key idea that the phase excursion along spirals in the transverse plane of a vortex is theoretically unlimited, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a simple yet effective scheme using an azimuth-scaling spiral transformation that can accomplish both OAM multiplication and division by arbitrary rational factors in a single stage.","Wen, Yuanhui; Chremmos, Ioannis; Chen, Yujie; Zhang, Yanfeng; Yu, Siyuan",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.213901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530673/,179

METHODS We pooled and analyzed data from multiple child asthma programs in the Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts, collected in 2011 to 2016, to examine the association of environmental scores (ES) with measures of asthma outcomes and compare the results across programs. RESULTS Our analysis showed that demographics were important contributors to variability in asthma outcomes and total ES, and largely explained the differences among programs at baseline. Among all programs in general, we found that asthma outcomes were significantly improved and total ES significantly reduced over visits, with the total Asthma Control Test score negatively associated with total ES. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that the Environmental Scoring System is a useful tool for measuring home asthma triggers and can be applied regardless of program and survey designs, and that demographics of the target population may influence the improvement in asthma outcomes.","Dong, Zhao; Nath, Anjali; Guo, Jing; Bhaumik, Urmi; Chin, May Y; Dong, Sherry; Marshall, Erica; Murphy, Johnna S; Sandel, Megan T; Sommer, Susan J; Ursprung, W W Sanouri; Woods, Elizabeth R; Reid, Margaret; Adamkiewicz, Gary",American journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2017.304125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161061/,179

A detailed understanding of the structural requirements for inhibitors targeting this enzyme is crucial to develop new therapeutic strategies in infectious diseases, including an urgent unmet need for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previously, we have identified a potent furin inhibitor, peptide Ac-RARRRKKRT-NH 2 (CF1), based on the highly pathogenic avian influenza hemagglutinin. The goal of this study was to determine how its N-terminal part (the P8-P5 positions) affects its activity profile. To do so, the positional-scanning libraries of individual peptides modified at the selected positions with natural amino acids were generated. Subsequently, the best substitutions were combined together and/or replaced by unnatural residues to expand our investigations. The results reveal that the affinity of CF1 can be improved (2-2.5-fold) by substituting its P5 position with the small hydrophobic residues (Ile or Val) or a basic Lys.","Lewandowska-Goch, Monika A; Kwiatkowska, Anna; Łepek, Teresa; Ly, Kévin; Navals, Pauline; Gagnon, Hugo; Dory, Yves L; Prahl, Adam; Day, Robert",ACS medicinal chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738063/,179
153362,"A Neonatal Hip Septic Arthritis Caused by Klebsiella pneumonia at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital Neonatal Unit, Hawassa, Sidama, Ethiopia.",2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES As technology in surgery evolves, the medical instrument industry is inevitability involved in promoting the use and appropriate (ie, effective and safe) application of its products. This study was undertaken to evaluate industry-supported product safety courses in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery, by using the metrics of surgeons' adoption of the technique, safety of the procedure, and surgeons' perception of the surgery. METHODS LESS surgery courses that involved didactic lectures, operative videos, operation observation, collaborative learning, and simulation, were attended by 226 surgeons. With Florida Hospital Tampa Institutional Review Board approval, the surgeons were queried before and immediately after the course, to assess their attitudes toward LESS surgery. Then, well after the course, the surgeons were contacted, repeatedly if necessary, to complete questionnaires. RESULTS Before the course, 82% of the surgeons undertook more than 10 laparoscopic operations per month. Immediately after the course, 86% were confident that they were prepared to perform LESS surgery. Months after the course, 77% of the respondents had adopted LESS surgery, primarily cholecystectomy; 59% had added 1 or more trocars in 0-20% of their procedures; and 73% held the opinion that operating room observation was the most helpful learning experience. Complications with LESS surgery were noted 12% of the time. Advantages of the technique were better cosmesis (58%) and patient satisfaction (38%). Disadvantages included risk of complications (37%) and higher technical demand (25%). Seventy-eight percent viewed LESS surgery as an advancement in surgical technique. CONCLUSION In multifaceted product safety courses, operating room observation is thought to provide the most helpful instruction for those wanting to undertake LESS surgery. The procedure has been safely adopted by surgeons who frequently perform laparoscopies. The tradeoff is in performing a more difficult technique to obtain better cosmesis for the patient. We must continue to conduct critical evaluations of product safety courses for the introduction of new technology in surgery.","Toomey, Paul G; Ross, Sharona B; Choung, Edward; Donn, Natalie; Vice, Michelle; Luberice, Kenneth; Albrink, Michael; Rosemurgy, Alexander S",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2015.00007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045652/,179

Vaccinia-related kinase (VRK1) and barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BANF1) are overexpressed in ESCC. In the present study, the roles of VRK1 and BANF1 were explored in the development of ESCC. In the present study, the effects of small interfering (si)RNA-induced downregulation of VRK1 on BANF1 expression were investigated as well as the effects on proliferative and migratory activity of ESCC cells. Western blot analysis indicated that the protein expression levels of BANF1 were decreased following siRNA depletion of VRK1. Furthermore, the depletion of VRK1 expression inhibited the proliferation and migration of ESCC cell lines, and flow cytometry analysis indicated that the depletion of VRK1 triggered cell cycle arrest mainly in the S phase. These results suggested that VRK1 and BANF1 may have pivotal roles in the progression of ESCC.","Ren, Zhenzhen; Geng, Jie; Xiong, Chao; Li, Xuebing; Li, Yuqing; Li, Jin; Liu, Hongchun",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724356/,179

This set of proteins accounts for more than 40% of all available human PDB entries and represent past trends as well as current status for protein structural biology. We briefly discuss the relationship which some of the prominent protein structures have with protein research as a whole and mention their relevance to human diseases. The top-10 soluble and membrane proteins are all well-known (most of their first structures being deposited more than 30 years ago). Overall, there is no dramatic change in recent trends in the PDB.

This kind of manipulation fits the view that political manipulation of language is based on a fusion of partial truths and whole lies (Katukani, 2018). The data was collected from the Brazilian far-right news website criticanacional.com.br and from the book The sovereign virus?, written by the postmodern leftist philosopher Donatella di Cesare. Data analysis shows that the most note worthy manipulation found in these political discourses is the concealment of relevant information about where the virus is. The large majority of sentences about the virus found in the corpus offers no hint where the virus is located or how it is spreading. It will be shown that this concealment favors the baseless claims of both radical political discourses.

The precise role of such palmitoylation of the spike protein in membrane fusion and infection is not completely understood. Here, we report that palmitoylation of the first five cysteine residues of the c-terminal cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike are indispensable for infection and palmitoylation deficient spike mutants are defective in trimerization and subsequent membrane fusion. The DHHC9 palmitoyltransferase interacts with and palmitoylates the spike protein in the ER and Golgi, and knockdown of DHHC9 results in reduced fusion and infection of SARS-CoV-2. Two bis-piperazine backbone-based DHHC9 inhibitors inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein palmitoylation and the resulting progeny virion particles released are defective in fusion and infection. This establishes these palmitoyltransferase inhibitors as potential new intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Ramadan, Ahmed A.; Mayilsamy, Karthick; McGill, Andrew R.; Ghosh, Anandita; Giulianotti, Marc A.; Donow, Haley M.; Mohapatra, Shyam S.; Mohapatra, Subhra; Chandran, Bala; Deschenes, Robert J.; Roy, Arunava",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.07.463402,179
169728,Myra touch for disease activity evaluation in rheumatoid arthritis: A comparison of patient-reported outcomes with physician's assessment,2021,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic, automated liquid dispensers have been increasingly developed to assist transmission prevention. However, data availability of automatic liquid dispenser mechanism's technical characteristics is not yet widely available. This causes frequent over or under design in its development. Therefore, we specifically measure push and pull forces engineering characteristics generated by the automatic liquid dispenser mechanism. A wire mechanism-based automatic liquid dispenser apparatus was used to experiment. A load-cell sensor was used to detect the force that occurs from a servo motor controlled by a microcontroller. The force data (push and pull) will be sent directly to the database server cloud with a recording frequency of every second. Three types of fluid treatment levels are used i.e. water, liquid soap, and hand sanitizer gel. Three types of fluid volume treatment levels used were 50 ml, 150 ml, and 250 ml. Each treatment level combination is carried out at the servo motors rotation steps 180°, 150°, 120°, 90°, 60°, and 30°. The results show that no significant differences were found in maximal forces required to release the water, liquid soap, and hand-sanitizer gel. It is also known that the volume of the fluid has a very significant effect on the amount of push and pull forces generated. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Using a new dataset collected via an online survey in Hong Kong, we first examine the influence of culture and recent sociopolitical tensions on people’s privacy concerns for and acceptance of three types of COVID-19 control measures that use IGD: contact tracing, self-quarantine monitoring, and location disclosure. We then compare Hong Kong people’s views with the views of people in the United States and South Korea using the pooled data of the three study areas. The results indicate that, when compared to people in the United States and South Korea, people in Hong Kong have a lower acceptance rate for digital contact tracing and higher acceptance rates for self-quarantine monitoring using e-wristbands and location disclosure. Further, there is geographic heterogeneity in the age and gender differences in privacy concerns, perceived social benefits, and acceptance of COVID-19 control measures: young people (age &lt; 24) and women in Hong Kong and South Korea have greater privacy concerns than men. Further, age and gender differences in privacy concerns, perceived social benefits, and acceptance of COVID-19 control measures in Hong Kong and South Korea are larger than those in the United States, and people in Hong Kong have the largest age and gender differences in privacy concerns, perceived social benefits, and acceptance of COVID-19 measures among the three study areas.","Huang, Jianwei Mei-Po Kwan Kim Junghwan",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10070490,179

174429,Safety of COVID-19 vaccine in the patient with history of drug allergy: An issue to be monitored,2021,"Background Dengue disease is an ongoing problem, especially in tropical countries. Like many other vector-borne diseases, the spread of dengue is driven by a myriad of climate and socioeconomic factors. Over recent years, mechanistic approaches have predicted areas of dengue risk according to the temperature effect on mosquitos' lifespan and incubation period shaping their persistence and competence in transmission. Within developing countries such as Brazil, heterogeneities on socioeconomic factors are expected to create variable conditions for dengue transmission by its main vectors. However, both the relative role of socioeconomic aspects and its association with the temperature effect in determining the effective dengue prevalence are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal findings Here we gathered essential socioeconomic factors comprising demography, infrastructure, and urbanization over 5570 municipalities across Brazil and evaluated their relative effect on dengue prevalence jointly with a previously predicted temperature suitability for transmission. Using a simultaneous autoregressive approach (SAR), we showed that the variability in the prevalence of dengue cases across Brazil is highly explained by the combined effect of climate and socio-economic factors. Moreover, the temperature effect on transmission potential might be a better proxy at some dengue epidemy seasons but the socioeconomic factors are tightly linked with the recent increase of the dengue prevalence over Brazil. Conclusions/Significance In a large and heterogeneous country such as Brazil recognizing the drivers of transmission by mosquitoes is a fundamental issue to effectively predict and combat tropical neglected diseases as dengue. Ultimately, it indicates that not considering socioeconomic factors in disease transmission predictions might compromise efficient strategies of surveillance. Our study indicates that sanitation, urbanization, and GDP are regional indicators that should be considered along with temperature suitability for dengue transmission, setting a good starting point to effective vector-borne disease control.","Simon, L.

As the novel coronavirus pandemic spreads globally with overwhelming outcomes on individual health, pets and animals have also become unnecessary targets amongst the pandemic panic. In the face of a global pandemic, domesticated and companion animals are relegated to the most vulnerable stratification of society. Prolonged lockdown has greatly reduced food resources for animals. This situation is worrying for all of us that so far the welfare of animals in lockdown situations has not been managed. The author provides an overview of rapidly expanding COVID-19 current perspective, its impact on domestic, pets, wild animals and managemental strategies are also discussed. Inappropriately, even though pets and other animal species have continually served as sentinels for emergent transmissible infections, they are currently not included in prerogative of any federal agency and are not under reconnaissance. This review also highlights the role of organizations that are providing food supplies for pets in this pandemic of COVID-19. This article also emphasizes on programmatic and legislative developments of animal welfare and offers suggestions to protect the nature, pets and wildlife during pandemic situations. There is also a need to divert the attention of people towards the safety of domestic animals as well as wild animals are compulsory for their survival.","Knawal, Aneela Zahra Aiman Hussain Tanveer",Pure and Applied Biology,https://doi.org/10.19045/bspab.2021.100089,179

The MCF curriculum was developed using a participatory approach from Montana Team Nutrition staff, school nutrition professionals, and state-level administration to include evidence-based materials and learning strategies. Twenty-two nutrition professionals from 9 Montana school districts in July 2020. MCF was developed as a 30-hour, 5-day in-person training during 2018 and 2019. In 2020, the format of MCF was adjusted to a 10 day, 30-hour, 3-hour a day virtual workshop. MCF utilized live video conferencing and independent work completed via an online learning management platform. Topics addressed USDA regulations, procurement, food production, culinary skills, and emergency preparedness. A pre and post self-reported survey tool and a post MCF evaluation tool were applied. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA was applied to determine significant changes from pre to post (P &lt; 0.05). Pre (n = 22) and post surveys (n = 21) determined an average 9.96% percent change in mean comfort level, confidence, and likelihood of future behavior (P &lt; 0.05). The emergency preparedness plan demonstrated the greatest increase in comfort level (+26.50%;P &lt; 0.05). Although not significant, comfort levels with farm to school (+16.98%) and USDA foods (14.06%) increased, while scratch cooking (-4.40%) decreased. Using herbs and spices in recipes (+20.48%) and completing a daily production record (+23.31%) demonstrated the greatest increases in reported comfort level (P &lt; 0.05). Participants were most likely to participate in future remote professional development activities (+16.40%) and use a new recipe that includes fresh and dried legumes (+13.71%), although not significant. Seventy-five percent of knowledge questions demonstrated increases in correct answers. The pre to post evaluation results indicate that a virtual MCF can achieve positive learning outcomes. Future training efforts should be focused on exploring ways to improve participants comfort with scratch cooking and batch cooking in a virtual format. USDA Team Nutrition Montana No Kid Hungry.

179158,Excess giant cell arteritis cases are associated with peaks in COVID-19 prevalence,2021,"We report 1-year follow-up outcomes from a randomized controlled trial involving parents resolving separation or divorce-related disputes and reporting high levels of intimate partner violence (IPV). We compared traditional litigation to two mediation approaches designed to protect parent safety (i.e., shuttle and videoconferencing) at a court-annexed mediation division. The sample was not nationally representative, limiting generalizability. We found no significant differences across conditions in parent reports of satisfaction with the process, level of continuing IPV or interparental conflict, parenting quality, parent functioning, or child functioning. Parents in traditional litigation, relative to parents in mediation, reported significantly more social support. Also, parents in videoconferencing, versus those in shuttle, mediation reported more PTSD symptoms from IPV. Based on coding of legal records, no significant condition differences emerged in relitigation rates in the family court case or charges of study case IPV-related incidents. Given few differences across study conditions, including in satisfaction levels, in contrast to the immediate outcomes, the 1-year follow-up findings do not clearly favor mediation or litigation. We conclude that when both parents in cases with reported high IPV are willing to mediate, mediation designed with safety protocols and carried out in a protected environment by well-trained staff may be an appropriate alternative to traditional litigation. We consider implications of our findings;for example, we discuss implications of the form of videoconferencing mediation examined for conducting online mediation, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Up to now, no previous systematic reviews have performed a comprehensive and rigorous methodological approach to figure out the impact of BSC implementation in HCOs. Methods: This systematic review was prepared according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases, as well as Google search engine, were inspected to find all BSC implementations at HCOs until 20 September 2020. Then the resulted articles were screened to find the implementations which measured the impact of BSC on HCWs' satisfaction, patient satisfaction, and financial performance. Quality assessment was performed using the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies: (StaRI) checklist. Results: Out of 4031 records, 20 articles were finally included for measuring one or more of the three impact types. 17 measured the impact of BSC on patient satisfaction, 7 on HCWs' satisfaction, and 12 on financial performance. Studies with higher quality had a higher positive impact. Conclusion: This paper offers evidence to HCOs and policymakers on the benefits of implementing BSC. BSC implementations showed a positive impact on patient satisfaction and financial performance in HCOs. However, less impact was found on HCWs' satisfaction, which should be given better consideration in future BSC implementations. High and medium-quality BSC studies were associated with higher positive impacts than low ones. BSC can be utilized as an effective tool to improve HCOs' performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Amer, F.; Hammoud, S.; Khatatbeh, H.; Lohner, S.; Boncz, I.; Endrei, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261666v1?rss=1,179

Recommendations of CDC and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC).,2003,"Travel destinations, particularly large resorts in otherwise small communities, risk infectious disease outbreaks from an influx of visitors who may import infections during peak seasons. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this risk in the context of global travel and has raised questions about appropriate interventions to curb the potential spread of infectious disease at tourist destinations. In Colorado, the initial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in the state occurred in ski communities, leading to large economic losses from closures and visitor restrictions. In this study, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the 2020-21 season in a ski region of Colorado to determine optimal combinations of intervention strategies that would keep the region below a predetermined threshold of SARS-CoV-2 infection density. This analysis used an age-stratified, deterministic SEIR compartmental model of disease transmission, calibrated to cellphone-based mobility data, to simulate infection trajectories during the winter ski season. Under three national infection levels corresponding to high, medium, and low viral importation risk, we estimated the potential impact of interventions including policy and behavior changes, visitor restriction strategies, and case investigation/contact tracing, in order to quantify the relative and absolute impacts of these interventions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that, in the context of low viral importation risk, case investigation/contact tracing and policy and behavior changes may be sufficient to stay below predetermined infection thresholds without visitor restrictions. However, if viral importation risk is high, visitor restrictions and/or screening for infected visitors would be needed to avoid lockdown-like control scenarios and large outbreaks in tourist communities. These findings provide important guidance to tourist destinations for balancing policy impact in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Wu, E. J.; Bayham, J.; Carlton, E. J.; Samet, J.

This study was aimed to assess the clinical preference of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescence immunoassay. METHODS: An upper respiratory specimen was collected in a series of patients referred to the Laboratory Medicine service of Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) for screening or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were assayed with DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Altona Diagnostics RealStar(®) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit. RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 421 patients (median age, 48 years; 227 women), 301 (71.5%) with positive result of molecular testing, and 126 (29.9%) with cycle threshold (Ct) values of both E and S genes <29.5, thus reflecting higher infectivity. The area under the curve of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86) for sample positivity and 0.98 for higher sample infectivity (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99). The optimal cut-off for sample positivity was 82 TCID(50)/mL (0.78 sensitivity, 0.73 specificity and 77% diagnostic accuracy), whilst that for identifying samples associated with a high infective risk was 106 TCID(50)/mL (0.94 sensitivity, 0.96 specificity and 95% diagnostic accuracy). CONCLUSION: The performance of this chemiluminescence immunoassay would not permit it to replace molecular testing for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, but may enable rapid and efficient detection of subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load, who are responsible for the largest proportion of infectious clusters.","Salvagno, Gian Luca; Gianfilippi, Gianluca; Fiorio, Giacomo; Pighi, Laura; De Nitto, Simone; Henry, Brandon M.; Lippi, Giuseppe",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8343054/,179
188120,Pharmacological Management and Prevention Of Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Hospitalized Patients.,2016,"Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are one of the most important respiratory pathogens of humans and cattle, and there is currently no safe and effective vaccine prophylaxis. In this study, we designed two codon-optimized plasmids encoding the bovine RSV fusion (F) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and assessed their immunogenicity in young calves. Two administrations of both plasmids elicited low antibody levels but primed a strong cell-mediated immunity characterized by lymphoproliferative response and gamma interferon production in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, this strong cellular response drastically reduced viral replication, clinical signs, and pulmonary lesions after a highly virulent challenge. Moreover, calves that were further vaccinated with a killed-virus vaccine developed high levels of neutralizing antibody and were fully protected following challenge. These results indicate that DNA vaccination could be a promising alternative to the classical vaccines against RSV in cattle and could therefore open perspectives for vaccinating young infants.","Boxus, Mathieu; Tignon, Marylène; Roels, Stefan; Toussaint, Jean-François; Walravens, Karl; Benoit, Marie-Ange; Coppe, Philippe; Letesson, Jean-Jacques; Letellier, Carine; Kerkhofs, Pierre",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459933/,179

196741,A case-control study of the role of cold symptoms and other historical triggering factors in asthma exacerbations.,2000,"Previous work has shown that the avian reovirus cell-attachment sigma C (sigmaC) protein is a multimer. In the first part of this study the oligomerization state of intracellularly synthesized sigmaC was analysed by different approaches, including SDS-PAGE, chemical cross-linking, sedimentation and gel filtration analysis. All these approaches indicated that protein sigmaC in its native state is a homotrimer. In the second part of the present work we investigated the effect of different factors and reagents on oligomer stability, in order to elucidate the nature of the forces that maintain the conformational stability of the homotrimer. Our results, based on the stabilizing effect conferred by reducing agents, demonstrate that the sigmaC subunits are not covalently bound via disulfide linkages. They further suggest that the formation of an intrachain disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues of the sigmaC polypeptide has a negative effect on oligomer stability. The susceptibility of the trimer to pH, temperature, ionic strength, chemical denaturants and detergents indicates that hydrophobic interactions contribute much more to oligomer stability than do ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Finally, our results also reveal that mammalian and avian reovirus cell attachment proteins follow different subunit dissociation pathways.","Grande, Ana; Costas, Celina; Benavente, Javier",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11752709/,179

However, sometimes adverse events (AEs) of stapling are experienced. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze AEs of stapling in thoracic surgery. METHODS A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the 27 institutions of the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group. Between January 2009 and December 2010, 4495 patients underwent thoracic surgery using mechanical stapling. RESULTS Stapling of various tissues was performed 16403 times. Total number of AEs related to stapling was 126 (0.77%). One hundred and nine events occurred intraoperative and 17 events occurred postoperative. The AE rates ranged from 0% to 1.8%. No relationship was seen between the incidence of AE and a stapling volume of thoracic surgery. CONCLUSION We have investigated intraoperative and postoperative AEs of stapling. Generally, stapling in thoracic surgery was safe. An AE rate of stapling in thoracic surgery is not influenced by the numbers of stapling in institutions.","Yano, Motoki; Sano, Masaaki; Kani, Hisanori; Nishida, Tsutomu; Nakamae, Katsumi; Funai, Kazuhito; Sasaki, Hidefumi",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24088925/,179

199584,Clinical and Technical Limitations of Cerebral and Somatic Near-Infrared Spectroscopy as an Oxygenation Monitor,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by the human coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The main viral protease, SARS 3CLpro, is a validated target for the development of antiviral therapies. Since the enzyme is a homodimer and the individual monomers are inactive, two approaches are being used to develop inhibitors: enzyme activity inhibitors that target the active site and dimerization inhibitors. Dimerization inhibitors are usually targeted to the dimerization interface and need to compete with the attractive forces between subunits to be effective. In this paper, we show that the dimerization of SARS 3CLpro is also under allosteric control and that additional and energetically more favorable target sites away from the dimerization interface may also lead to subunit dissociation. We previously identified a cluster of conserved serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) located adjacent to the active site of 3CLpro that could effectively be targeted to inactivate the protease [Bacha, U et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 4906-4912]. Mutation of any of these serine residues to alanine had a debilitating effect on the catalytic activity of 3CLpro. In particular, the mutation of Ser147, which does not make any contact with the opposing subunit and is located approximately 9 A away from the dimer interface, totally inhibited dimerization and resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. The finding that residues away from the dimer interface are able to control dimerization defines alternative targets for the design of dimerization inhibitors.","Barrila, Jennifer; Bacha, Usman; Freire, Ernesto",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17154528/,179

We hypothesized that real-time MRI guidance could improve the yield through targeted biopsy of focal myocardial pathology. METHODS An animal model of focal myocardial pathology was created by infusing 3mL of fluorescent microspheres (NuFlow Hydrocoat, 15μm diameter, 5 million spheres/mL) followed by 2mL of 100% ethanol to a branch coronary artery. Animals were survived for minimum 14days, before undergoing MRI guided endomyocardial biopsy using a custom 6.5Fr active visualization MRI-conditional bioptome and X-ray guided biopsy using a commercial bioptome. Specimens were analyzed using a dissecting microscope under ultraviolet light to determine the proportion of 'on-target' specimens containing fluorescent microspheres. RESULTS A total of 77 specimens were obtained using real-time MRI guidance and 87 using X-ray guidance, in five animals. Specimens obtained with the MRI-conditional bioptome were smaller compared with the commercial X-ray bioptome. Real-time MRI guidance significantly increased the diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy (82% vs. 56% on-target biopsy specimens with real-time MRI vs. X-ray guidance, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Endomyocardial biopsy performed using real-time MRI guidance is feasible and significantly improves the diagnostic yield compared with X-ray fluoroscopy guidance.","Rogers, Toby; Ratnayaka, Kanishka; Karmarkar, Parag; Campbell-Washburn, Adrienne E; Schenke, William H; Mazal, Jonathan R; Kocaturk, Ozgur; Faranesh, Anthony Z; Lederman, Robert J",JACC.

The substrate specificities of five coronavirus main proteases, including the prototypic enzymes from the coronavirus groups I, II and III, were characterized. Recombinant main proteases of human coronavirus (HCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were tested in peptide-based trans-cleavage assays. The determination of relative rate constants for a set of corresponding HCoV, TGEV and MHV 3CL(pro) cleavage sites revealed a conserved ranking of these sites. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide representing the N-terminal HCoV 3CL(pro) cleavage site was shown to be effectively hydrolysed by noncognate main proteases. The data show that the differential cleavage kinetics of sites within pp1a/pp1ab are a conserved feature of coronavirus main proteases and lead us to predict similar processing kinetics for the replicase polyproteins of all coronaviruses.","Hegyi, Annette; Ziebuhr, John",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11842254/,179

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated causative pathogen during postinfluenza pneumonia. Considering that S. pneumoniae utilizes the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) to invade the respiratory epithelium and that the PAFR is upregulated during viral infection, we here used PAFR gene-deficient (PAFR-/-) mice to determine the role of this receptor during postinfluenza pneumococcal pneumonia. Viral clearance was similar in wild-type and PAFR-/- mice, and influenza virus was completely removed from the lungs at the time mice were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (day 14 after influenza infection). PAFR-/- mice displayed a significantly reduced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs, a diminished dissemination of the infection, and a prolonged survival. Pulmonary levels of IL-10 and KC were significantly lower in PAFR-/- mice, whereas IL-6 and TNF-alpha were only trendwise lower. These data indicate that the pneumococcus uses the PAFR leading to severe pneumonia in a host previously exposed to influenza A.","van der Sluijs, Koenraad F; van Elden, Leontine J R; Nijhuis, Monique; Schuurman, Rob; Florquin, Sandrine; Shimizu, Takao; Ishii, Satoshi; Jansen, Henk M; Lutter, René; van der Poll, Tom",American journal of physiology.

We aimed to analyse the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases living in a district of Lombardy with a high prevalence of COVID-19. Methods: We did a single-centre observational study at the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy. We collected data from patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases enrolled in our outpatient clinic to identify confirmed or possible cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected through a survey that was administered via telephone or in the outpatient clinic by rheumatologists. We also did a case-control study of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were admitted to the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia during the study period. Cases were matched by age, sex, and month of hospital admission to at least two controls admitted to the same hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period. Findings: Between Feb 24 and May 1, 2020, we collected data from 1525 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: 117 (8%) presented with symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19. 65 patients had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas 52 presented with a spectrum of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 but were not swab tested. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than those with suspected COVID-19 (median age 68 [IQR 55-76] years vs 57 [49-67] years; p=0·0010) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (33 [51%] vs 14 [27%] patients; odds ratio [OR] 2·8 [95% CI 1·3-6·1]; p=0·031) and obesity (11 [17%] vs 1 [2%]; OR 11·0 [1·3-83·4]; p=0·0059). We found no differences in rheumatological disease or background therapy between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. 47 (72%) of the 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital. 12 (10%) deaths occurred among the 117 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ten in those with confirmed COVID-19 and two in those with suspected COVID-19). Deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than survivors (median age 78·8 years [IQR 75·3-81·3] vs 65·5 years [53·3-74·0]; p=0·0002). We observed no differences in sex, comorbidities, or therapies between the deceased patients and survivors. The case-control study comprised 26 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and COVID-19 pneumonia and 62 matched controls. We found no significant differences between cases and controls in duration of COVID-19 symptoms before admission, duration of stay in hospital, or the local chest X-ray scoring system. Glucocorticoids were used for severe respiratory manifestations related to lung involvement in 17 (65%) of 26 cases and tocilizumab in six (23%) of 26; thrombotic events occurred in four (15%) of 26 cases. Four (15%) of 26 cases and six (10%) of 62 controls died during the study period. Interpretation: In this cohort of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in a geographical region with a high prevalence of COVID-19, a poor outcome from COVID-19 seems to be associated with older age and the presence of comorbidities rather than the type of rheumatic disease or the degree of pharmacological immunosuppression.

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome involves the core replication-transcription complex (RTC, nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and the proofreading complex (nsp14-nsp10) that can correct mismatched base pairs during replication. Structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 RTC have been actively studied, yet little is known about SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10. Here, we purified, reconstituted, and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 proofreading nuclease in vitro. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 is activated by nsp10, functioning as a potent RNase that can hydrolyze RNAs in the context of single- and double-stranded RNA and RNA/DNA hybrid duplex. SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 shows a metal-dependent nuclease activity but has different metal selectivity from RTC. While RTC is activated by Ca2+, nsp14-nsp10 is completely inhibited. Importantly, the reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 efficiently removed the A:A mismatch at the 3'-end of the primer, enabling the stalled RTC to restart RNA replication. Our collective results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 functions as the RNA proofreading complex in SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a useful foundation to understand the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism.","Ma, Zhijun; Pourfarjam, Yasin; Kim, In-Kwon",Protein Expr Purif,,179

Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer (CHIO) is a recent metaheuristic population-based algorithm that mimics the COVID-19 herd immunity treatment strategy. In this paper, CHIO is modified for capacitated vehicle routing problem. The modifications for CHIO are accomplished by modifying its operators to preserve the solution feasibility for this type of vehicle routing problems. To evaluate the modified CHIO, two sets of data sets are used: the first data set has ten Synthetic CVRP models while the second is an ABEFMP data set which has 27 instances with different models. Moreover, the results achieved by modified CHIO are compared against the results of other 13 well-regarded algorithms. For the first data set, the modified CHIO is able to gain the same results as the other comparative methods in two out of ten instances and acceptable results in the rest. For the second and the more complicated data sets, the modified CHIO is able to achieve very competitive results and ranked the first for 8 instances out of 27. In a nutshell, the modified CHIO is able to efficiently solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem and can be utilized for other routing problems in the future such as multiple travelling salesman problem.","Mohammad Dalbah, Lamees Azmi Al-Betar Mohammed Awadallah Mohammed A.; Abu Zitar, Raed",Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,179

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in medical university. Levels of perceived stress, insomnia and depression were measured using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The descriptive analyses of the demographic characteristics and correlation analyses of the three variables were calculated. The significance of the mediation effect was obtained using a bootstrap approach with SPSS PROCESS macro. RESULTS: The mean age of medical students was 21.46 years (SD=2.50). Of these medical students, 10,185 (34.3%) were male and 19,478 (65.7%) were female. Perceived stress was significantly associated with depression (ß=0.513, P < 0.001). Insomnia mediated the association between perceived stress and depression (ß=0.513, P < 0.001). The results of the non-parametric bootstrapping method confirmed the significance of the indirect effect of perceived stress through insomnia (95% bootstrap CI =0.137, 0.149). The indirect effect of insomnia accounted for 44.13% of the total variance in depression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interactive mechanisms underlying perceived stress and depression, and elucidating the mediating effects of insomnia on the association. This research provides a useful theoretical and methodological approach for prevention of depression in medical students. Findings from this study indicated that it may be effective to reduce depression among medical students by improving sleep quality and easing perceived stress.","Liu, Zhuang; Liu, Rongxun; Zhang, Yue; Zhang, Ran; Liang, Lijuan; Wang, Yang; Wei, Yange; Zhu, Rongxin; Wang, Fei",J Affect Disord,,179

This study analyzed state-trait anxiety levels of nursing students because of e-Learning during two periods of the COVID-19 confinement. A mixed follow-up study was used, which evaluates the same cohort cross-sectionally but with a longitudinal component. A sample of 460 nursing students of the Nursing Degree at the University of Lorca (Murcia) and University of Almería (Spain) completed an online anxiety level questionnaire using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) during the first and fourth weeks of the COVID-19 confinement. Total anxiety levels increased in the fourth week, as compared to the first week (first week: 50.4 ± 20.8 and fourth week: 59.9 ± 10.6 (p < 0.001)). The linear regression model showed that the significant predictors for STAI anxiety in nursing students were being in the last year of the degree program, being female, and spending confinement in a house without a garden. In general, most nursing students were emotionally affected by high levels of anxiety of state-trait during the COVID-19 outbreak.","García-González, Jessica; Ruqiong, Wei; Alarcon-Rodriguez, Raquel; Requena-Mullor, Mar; Ding, Can; Ventura-Miranda, Maria Isabel",,,179

We felt there was a need for rapid proof-of-concept human self-exposure, to inform future controlled research and promote informed discussion. A Fitzpatrick Skin Type II individual exposed their inner forearms to large radiant exposures from a filtered Krypton-Chloride (KrCl) far-UVC system (SafeZoneUVC, Ushio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with peak emission at 222 nm. No visible skin changes were observed at 1,500 mJcm-2 , whereas skin yellowing that appeared immediately and resolved within 24 hours occurred with a 6,000 mJcm-2 exposure. No erythema was observed at any time point with exposures up to 18,000 mJcm-2 . These results combined with Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer computer modelling suggest that filtering longer ultraviolet wavelengths is critical for the human skin safety of far-UVC devices. This work also contributes to growing arguments for the exploration of exposure limit expansion, which would subsequently enable faster inactivation of viruses.","Eadie, Ewan; Barnard, Isla M R; Ibbotson, Sally H; Wood, Kenneth",Photochem. photobiol,,179
216434,HIV/AIDS in the Era of COVID-19: A Juxtaposition of Two Pandemics,2021,"This study aimed to investigate burnout among physicians during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This research was conducted in a pandemic hospital which is among the largest hospital complexes in Turkey. Internal medicine physicians actively working in many departments under the severe conditions in the diagnosis and treatment processes were included. Among the physicians constituting the study population, residents, attendings, and subspecialists from different fields were included. These physicians were working in the quarantine services, inpatient services, intensive care units, and polyclinics. A short and easy face-to-face survey, in which included questions on demographic information, medicolegal subjects, and questions from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, was used to collect data. While 58.2% of the physicians stated that they were extremely worried about malpractice in the pandemic period, 82.1% stated they needed training on medicolegal subjects, and 25.4% stated they were exposed to violence during work. Three sub-dimensions within the burnout inventory were compared with other parameters. The Cronbach alpha value was found highly reliable in the evaluation of the answers' internal consistency. The notable significance of burnout was interesting regarding physicians' anxiety on medicolegal issues and exposure to violence (p < 0.05). The findings obtained in this study suggest that healthcare workers' motivations will increase if they feel valued, their working conditions have been improved, and if they are in mentally well. This mental wellness may contribute to fighting public health crises such as a pandemic more efficiently with the lowest number of casualties.","Buran, Ferat; Altin, Zeynep",Leg Med (Tokyo),,179

RT-PCR test is considered as one of the gold standards worldwide to confirm the presence of COVID-19 infection reliably. Radiological images can also be used for the same purpose to some extent. Easy and no contact acquisition of the radiological images makes it a suitable alternative and this work can help to locate and interpret some prominent features for the screening purpose. One major challenge of this domain is the absence of appropriately annotated ground truth data. Motivated from this, a novel unsupervised machine learning-based method called SUFMACS (SUperpixel based Fuzzy Memetic Advanced Cuckoo Search) is proposed to efficiently interpret and segment the COVID-19 radiological images. This approach adapts the superpixel approach to reduce a large amount of spatial information. The original cuckoo search approach is modified and the Luus-Jaakola heuristic method is incorporated with McCulloch's approach. This modified cuckoo search approach is used to optimize the fuzzy modified objective function. This objective function exploits the advantages of the superpixel. Both CT scan and X-ray images are investigated in detail. Both qualitative and quantitative outcomes are quite promising and prove the efficiency and the real-life applicability of the proposed approach.","Chakraborty, Shouvik; Mali, Kalyani",Expert Syst Appl,,179

Unlike other forecasting techniques, our proposed approach first groups the countries having similar demographic and socioeconomic aspects and health sector indicators using K-means clustering algorithm. The cumulative case data of the clustered countries enriched with data related to the lockdown measures are fed to the bidirectional LSTM to train the forecasting model. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by studying the disease outbreak in Qatar and the proposed model prediction from December 1st until December 31st, 2020. The quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed technique outperforms state-of-art forecasting approaches.","Said, Ahmed Ben; Erradi, Abdelkarim; Aly, Hussein Ahmed; Mohamed, Abdelmonem",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

In addition, analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has an important role in viral diagnostics and seroprevalence estimates. METHODS: We developed and optimized an enzyme immunoassays (EIA) using SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, and N proteins from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and 4 low-pathogenic human CoVs. Neutralizing antibody activity was compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM EIA results. RESULTS: The sensitivity of EIA for detecting immune response in COVID-19 patients (n = 101) was 77% in the acute phase and 100% in the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection when N and RBD were used as antigens in IgG and IgA specific EIAs. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased humoral immune responses against the 229E and NL63 N proteins. S1 and RBD-based EIA results had a strong correlation with microneutralization test results. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate a combination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD and N proteins and analysis of IgG and IgA immunoglobulin classes in sera provide an excellent basis for specific and sensitive serological diagnostics of COVID-19.","Jalkanen, Pinja; Pasternack, Arja; Maljanen, Sari; Melén, Krister; Kolehmainen, Pekka; Huttunen, Moona; Lundberg, Rickard; Tripathi, Lav; Khan, Hira; Ritvos, Mikael A; Naves, Rauno; Haveri, Anu; Österlund, Pamela; Kuivanen, Suvi; Jääskeläinen, Anne J; Kurkela, Satu; Lappalainen, Maija; Rantasärkkä, Kaisa; Vuorinen, Tytti; Hytönen, Jukka; Waris, Matti; Tauriainen, Sisko; Ritvos, Olli; Kakkola, Laura; Julkunen, Ilkka",J Infect Dis,,179

However, the information about protected attributes in datasets may be inaccurate due to either issues with data collection or when the protected attributes used are themselves predicted by algorithms. Such inaccuracies can prevent existing fair classification algorithms from achieving desired fairness guarantees. Motivated by this, we study fair classification problems when the protected attributes in the data may be ``noisy''. In particular, we consider a noise model where any protected type may be flipped to another with some fixed probability. We propose a ``denoised'' fair optimization formulation that can incorporate very general fairness goals via a set of constraints, mitigates the effects of such noise perturbations, and comes with provable guarantees. Empirically, we show that our framework can lead to near-perfect statistical parity with only a slight loss in accuracy for significant noise levels.","Celis, L.

226205,COVID-19 Reinfection in a Patient with Hodgkin Lymphoma: a Case Report,2021,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, which was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries from 2002 to 2003. Given the significant morbidity and mortality rate, the current pandemic poses a danger to all of humanity, prompting us to understand the activity of SARS-CoV-2 at the atomic level. Experimental studies have revealed that spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering the cell for replication. However, the binding affinities reported by different groups seem to contradict each other. Wrapp et al. (Science 2020, 367, 1260-1263) showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) more strongly than does SARS-CoV, and this fact may be associated with a greater severity of the new virus. However, Walls et al. (Cell 2020, 181, 281-292) reported that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher binding affinity, but the difference between the two variants is relatively small. To understand the binding mechnism and experimental results, we investigated how the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) interacts with a human ACE2-PD using molecular modeling. We applied a coarse-grained model to calculate the dissociation constant and found that SARS-CoV-2 displays a 2-fold higher binding affinity. Using steered all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, like a coarse-grained simulation, SARS-CoV-2-RBD was associated with ACE2-PD more strongly than was SARS-CoV-RBD, as evidenced by a higher rupture force and larger pulling work. We show that the binding affinity of both viruses to ACE2 is driven by electrostatic interactions.","Nguyen, Hoang Linh; Lan, Pham Dang; Thai, Nguyen Quoc; Nissley, Daniel A; O039,; Brien, Edward P; Li, Mai Suan",J Phys Chem B,,179

227902,499. Infection with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Personnel with Exposure to COVID-19,2020,"ABSTRACT: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Harvard Medical School Master of Medical Sciences in Medical Education program implemented the Plus/Delta debriefing model to collect real-time learner feedback and facilitate continuous quality improvement within our assessment and program evaluation module, which rapidly transitioned online. The model is grounded in quality improvement methodology and encourages bidirectional rather than top-down feedback. Learners identified specifically what went well with each module session (Plus) and how to improve for the next time (Delta). After each session, narrative responses were reviewed, aggregated into meaningful categories, and implemented when possible. Implemented improvements focused on increasing session interactivity and enhancing communication. Learners pointed to the uniqueness of the model and applauded efforts to embed them in the cocreation process. Asking learners to debrief their experience-especially during a module which is iteratively redesigned week-by-week-can offer a realistic view of what is working and what needs further refinement.

In this commentary, we discuss how this enormous challenge could be addressed for viral vector-based Covid-19 vaccines by learning from the wealth of formulation development experience gained over the years on stability issues related to live attenuated virus vaccines and viral vector vaccines for other diseases. This experience has led -over time- to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8 °C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 °C be considered. In confronting this ""perfect storm"" of Covid-19 vaccine stability challenges, understanding the many lessons learned from decades of development and manufacturing of live virus-based vaccines is the shortest path for finding promising and rapid solutions.","Crommelin, Daan J A; Volkin, David B; Hoogendoorn, Karin H; Lubiniecki, Anthony S; Jiskoot, Wim",J. pharm. sci,,179

The present study builds on the recently developed ""Fear of COVID-19 Scale"" (Ahorsu et al., In International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8, 2020). The sample comprised of 850 participants, male and female young adults from Russia and Belarus. The majority of survey participants are university students and graduates. Females, students, and others from Russia report higher levels of COVID-19-related fear than those from Belarus. Respondents from Russia and Belarus report less fear than people from Iran who were surveyed earlier. The scale used for the present survey evidenced a good Cronbach's Alpha measure of internal consistency or reliability (0.809). Clearly, further research is needed across locations and over time about the nature and extent of fear caused by COVID 19. Overall, the FCV-19S appears to be a valuable and brief instrument that may provide useful information for intervention and policy purposes to migrate fear and problem behavior linked to infectious disease outbreaks.","Reznik, Alexander; Gritsenko, Valentina; Konstantinov, Vsevolod; Khamenka, Natallia; Isralowitz, Richard",Int J Ment Health Addict,,179

We model over 20-years-long, high cadence $I$-band light curves collected by The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and fit them to light curves collected in the remaining optical/near-infrared/mid-infrared bands to derive both the variability amplitude ratio and phase-lag as a function of wavelength. We show that the variability amplitude ratio declines with the increasing wavelength for both oxygen-rich (O-rich) and carbon-rich (C-rich) Miras, while the variability phase-lag increases slightly with the increasing wavelength. In a significant number of Miras, mostly the C-rich ones, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) require a presence of a cool component (dust) in order to match the mid-IR data. Based on SED fits for a golden sample of 140 Miras, we calculated synthetic period-luminosity relations (PLRs) in 42 bands for the existing and future sky surveys that include OGLE, The VISTA Near-Infrared $YJK_\mathrm{s}$ Survey of the Magellanic Clouds System (VMC), Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Gaia, Spitzer, The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST), and The Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We show that the synthetic PLR slope decreases with increasing wavelength for both the O-rich and C-rich Miras in the range of 0.1$-$40 microns.

230819,BNT162b2 vaccination in heart transplant recipients: Clinical experience and antibody response,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has rapidly spread globally. Due to different testing strategies, under-detection of positive subjects and COVID-19-related-deaths remains common. Aim of this analysis was to assess the real impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of 2020 Italian all-cause mortality data compared to historical series. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 2020 and 2015-2019 all-cause mortality data released by the Italian National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT) for the time period 'January 1 - March 21'. This preliminary sample included 1,084 Italian municipalities showing at least 10 deaths during the above-mentioned timeframe and an increase in mortality of more than 20% as compared to the previous five years (2015-2019), with a resulting coverage of 21% of Italian population. The difference between 2020 observed and expected deaths (mean of weekly deaths in 2015-2019) was computed, together with mortality rate ratio (MRR) for each of the four weeks following detection of the first autochthonous COVID-19 case in Italy (23 February, 2020 - 21 March, 2020), as well as for this entire timeframe. Subgroup analysis by age groups was also performed. RESULTS: Overall MRR was 1.79 [1.75-1.84], with an observed excess mortality of 8,750 individuals in the investigated sample, which in itself outweighs Italian Civil Protection report of only 4,825 COVID-19-related deaths across Italy, as of March 21. Subgroup analysis did not show any difference in mortality rate in '0-14 years' age group, while MRRs were significantly increased in older age groups, in particular in patients >75 years (MRR 1.84 [1.79-1.89]). In addition, week-by-week analysis showed a progressive increase in MRR during this period, peaking in the last week (15 March, 2020 - 21 March, 2020) with an estimated value of 2.65 [2.53-2.78]. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of all-cause mortality data in Italy indicates that reported COVID-19-related deaths are an underestimate of the actual death toll. All-cause death should be seen as the epidemiological indicator of choice to assess the real mortality impact exerted by SARS-CoV-2, given that it also best reflects the toll on frail patient subsets (eg the elderly or those with cardiovascular disease).","Saglietto, Andrea; D039,; ascenzo, Fabrizio; Cavarretta, Elena; Frati, Giacomo; Anselmino, Matteo; Versaci, Francesco; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; De Ferrari, Gaetano M",Minerva cardioangiol,,179

233468,Nephrotic syndrome relapse in a boy with COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Approximately 3-15% of COVID-19 patients will require prolonged mechanical ventilation thereby requiring consideration for tracheotomy. Guidelines for tracheotomy in this cohort of patients are therefore required with assessed outcomes of tracheotomies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy. Inclusion criteria were the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients between March 11 and December 31, 2020. Exclusion criteria were lack of consent, extubation prior to the performance of a tracheotomy, death prior to the performance of the tracheotomy; and COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy who tested negative twice after medical treatment. The primary predictor variable was the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients and the primary outcome variable was the time to cessation of mechanical ventilation with the institution of supplemental oxygen via trach mask. RESULTS: Seventeen tracheotomies were performed between 4-25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯17 days). Seven patients died between 4 and 6 days (meanâ¯=â¯8.7 days) following tracheotomy and 10 living patients realized cessation of mechanical ventilation from 4 hours to 61 days following tracheotomy (meanâ¯=â¯19.3 days). These patients underwent tracheotomy between 4 and 22 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯14 days). The 7 patients who died following tracheotomy underwent the procedure between 7 and 25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯18.2 days). Seven patients underwent tracheotomy on or after 20 days of intubation and 3 survived (43%). Ten patients underwent tracheotomy before 20 days of intubation and 7 patients survived (70%). Significant differences between the mortality groups were detected for age (Pâ¯=â¯.006), and for P/F ratio at time of consult (Pâ¯=â¯.047) and the time of tracheotomy (Pâ¯=â¯.03). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheotomies are safely performed in COVID-19 patients with a standardized protocol. The timing of tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients is based on ventilator parameters, P/F ratio, patient prognosis, patient advanced directives, and family wishes.","Carlson, Eric R; Heidel, R Eric; Houston, Kyle; Vahdani, Soheil; Winstead, Michael",J. oral maxillofac. surg,,179

Studies demonstrating more specific and more severe neurological involvement such as cerebrovascular insults, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome are also emerging. Respiratory failure, a significant condition that leads to mortality in COVID-19, is hypothesized to be partly due to brainstem impairment. Notably, some of these neurological complications seem to persist long after infection.

236605,Interaction of local and systemic renin angiotensin aldosteron system with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Virtual care has historically faced barriers to widespread adoption. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid adoption and expansion of virtual care technologies. Although the intense and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed people's interest in health systems resilience, which includes how services adapt or transform in response to shocks, evidence regarding the role of virtual care technologies in health systems resilience is scarce. OBJECTIVE: At Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, the rapid virtualization of cardiac care began on March 9, 2020, as a response to the pandemic. The objective of this study was to understand people's experiences with and the barriers and facilitators of the rapid virtualization and expansion of cardiac care resulting from the pandemic. METHODS: A single-case study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. Patients, clinicians, and staff were recruited purposively from an existing mobile, phone-based telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. Individual, semistructured phone interviews were conducted by two researchers and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis at the semantic level was used to analyze transcripts and develop themes. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and staff (n=4). The following five themes were identified: (1) patient safety as a catalyst for virtual care adoption; (2) piecemeal virtual care solutions; (3) confronting new roles and workloads; (4) missing pieces in virtual care; and (5) the inequity paradox. The motivation to protect patient safety and a piecemeal approach to virtual care adoption facilitated the absorptive and adaptive resilience of cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ad hoc changes to clinic roles and workflows, challenges in building relationships through remote methods, and widened inequities were barriers that threatened virtual care sustainment. CONCLUSIONS: We contend that sustaining virtual care hinges upon transformative actions (rather than adaptive actions) that strengthen health systems so that they can face the dynamic and emergent challenges associated with COVID-19 and other shocks. Based on the barriers and facilitators we identified, we present the lessons we learned and recommend transformations for sustaining virtual care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shah, Amika; Guessi, Milena; Wali, Sahr; Ware, Patrick; McDonald, Michael; O039,; Sullivan, Mary; Posada, Juan Duero; Ross, Heather; Seto, Emily",JMIR Cardio,,179

METHODS: 97 adults (77% female) completed a 3-day WDR with a 24-h urine collection on day 3, followed by at least one 24HDR with myfood24-Germany (corresponding to day 3 of the WDR). Intake of energy and 32 nutrients assessed by myfood24-Germany and the WDR for the same day were compared (method comparison). Intakes of protein and potassium assessed by myfood24-Germany/WDR were compared with intake estimated from urinary biomarkers for protein and potassium (biomarker comparison). RESULTS: In the method comparison, significant correlations were found for energy and all tested nutrients (range 0.45-0.87). There was no significant difference between both methods in the assessed mean energy and macronutrient intake. However, myfood24-Germany underestimated mean intake of 15 nutrients. In the biomarker comparison, protein intake reported by myfood24-Germany/WDR was on average 10%/8% lower than estimated by biomarker. There was no significant difference in mean potassium intake assessed by myfood24-Germany/WDR and biomarker. However, a shared bias in the assessment of potassium intake was observed for both instruments. Concordance correlation coefficients (pc) and weighted Kappa coefficients (&#954;) confirmed good agreement with the biomarker estimates for myfood24-Germany/WDR in case of protein (pc = 0.58/0.66, &#954; = 0.51/0.53) and moderate agreement in case of potassium (pc = 0.44/0.51; &#954; = 0.30/0.33).

238762,The association between COVID-19 cases and deaths and web-based public inquiries,2020,"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been research considering the impact on medical healthcare professionals and the mental health needs of the general population. However, limited focus has been placed on mental health services or mental health staff providing care in the community and in hospitals. While nurses make up the largest section of the mental health workforce in the UK, the impact that this pandemic has had on their work has been largely ignored. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper provides a unique insight into the experiences and impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on mental health nurses across a range of community and inpatient settings to understand what has changed in their work and the care they can and do provide during this crisis. This includes exploring how services have changed, the move to remote working, the impact of the protective equipment crisis on nurses and the difficult working conditions facing those in inpatient settings where there is minimal guidance provided. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: By understanding the impact the pandemic has had on mental health nursing care, we can understand the gaps in guidance that exist, the challenges being faced and the impact the crisis has had on care for mental health service users. By doing so, we can plan for the ongoing nature of this pandemic and the aftermath that the crisis may leave for our service users and workforce alike. ABSTRACT: Introduction While evidence has emerged concerning the impact of COVID-19 on the general population and the challenges facing health services, much less is known regarding how the pandemic has directly affected the delivery of mental health nursing care. Aim This paper aimed to explore how COVID-19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK. Method We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed-methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated. Discussion Key themes within the data explore the following: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users.

METHODS: In according to the recommendations of the European Association of Urology, we have developed practical additional document on the treatment of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Low-Risk Group Watchful Waiting should be offered to patients >75 years old, with a limited life expectancy and unfit for local treatment. In Active Surveillance (AS) patients re-biopsy, PSA evaluation and visits should be deferred for up to 6 months, preferring non-invasive multiparametric-MRI. The active treatment should be delayed for 6-12 months. Intermediate-Risk Group AS should be offered in favorable-risk patients. Short-course neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with ultra-hypo-fractionation radiotherapy should be used in unfavorable-risk patients. High-Risk Group Neoadjuvant ADT combined with moderate hypofractionation should be preferred. Whole-pelvis irradiation should be offered to patients with positive lymph nodes in locally advanced setting. ADT should be initiated if PSA doubling time is < 12 months in radio-recurrent patients, as well as in low priority/low volume of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. If radiotherapy cannot be delayed, hypo-fractionated regimens should be preferred. In high priority class metastatic disease, treatment with androgen receptor-targeted agents should be offered. When palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastasis is required, single fraction of 8 Gy should be offered. CONCLUSIONS: In Covid-19 Era, the challenge should concern a correct management of the oncologic patient, reducing the risk of spreading the virus without worsening tumor prognosis.","Detti, Beatrice; Ingrosso, Gianluca; Becherini, Carlotta; Lancia, Andrea; Olmetto, Emanuela; Alì, Emanuele; Marani, Simona; Teriaca, Maria Ausilia; Francolini, Giulio; Sardaro, Angela; Aristei, Cynthia; Filippi, Andrea Riccardo; Sanguineti, Giuseppe; Livi, Lorenzo",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,179

The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients. One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets. Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV or not is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome. The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the manpower almost in every country. Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed. In this review article, we sort out some state-of-the-art novel approaches that might be applied for a fast, sensitive, and precise detection of SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV not only to help the routine laboratory testing but also to improve effective quarantine.","Yang, De-Ming; Chang, Tai-Jay; Wang, Mong-Lien; Tsai, Ping-Hsing; Lin, Ta-Hsien; Wang, Chin-Tien; Liang, Kung-Hao",J Chin Med Assoc,,179

However, patients may have a wide range of symptoms representing a spectrum of mild to severe illness. Symptoms in children tend to be milder and may include fever, cough, and feeding difficulty. The incubation period is two to 14 days, although symptoms typically appear within five days of exposure. Multiple testing modalities exist, but infection should be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using a nasopharyngeal swab. There are no evidence- based treatments appropriate for use in the outpatient setting; management is supportive and should include education about isolation. In hospitalized patients, remdesivir should be considered to reduce time to recovery, and low-dose dexamethasone should be considered in patients who require supplemental oxygen. Overall, 85% of patients have mild illness, whereas 14% have severe disease requiring hospitalization, including 5% who require admission to an intensive care unit. Predictors of severe disease include increasing age, comorbidities, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, low oxygen saturation, and increased levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer, transaminases, and lactate dehydrogenase.","Cheng, Anthony; Caruso, Dominic; McDougall, Craig",Am Fam Physician,,179

In comparison with conventional drug formulations, nanoparticles ensure better penetration into the tumor mass by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect, longer blood circulation times by a reduced renal excretion and a decrease in side effects and drug accumulation in healthy tissues. The most significant classes of nanoparticles (i.e., liposomes, inorganic and organic nanoparticles) are here discussed with a particular focus on their use as delivery systems for small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A number of these new compounds (e.g., Imatinib, Dasatinib, Ponatinib) have been approved as first-line therapy in different cancer types but their clinical use is limited by poor solubility and oral bioavailability. Consequently, new nanoparticle systems are necessary to ameliorate formulations and reduce toxicity. In this review, some of the most important TKIs are reported, focusing on ongoing clinical studies, and the recent drug delivery systems for these molecules are investigated.","Russo, Eleonora; Spallarossa, Andrea; Tasso, Bruno; Villa, Carla; Brullo, Chiara",Int. j. mol. sci.

Previous screens of Culicoides have described the presence of the endosymbiont Candidatus Cardinium hertigii (Bacteroidetes). However, any impacts of this microbe on vectorial capacity, akin to those conferred by Wolbachia in mosquitoes, are yet to be uncovered and await a suitable system to study Cardinium-midge interactions. To identify potential candidate species to investigate these interactions, accurate knowledge of the distribution of the endosymbiont within Culicoides populations is needed. We used conventional and nested PCR assays to screen Cardinium infection in 337 individuals of 25 Culicoides species from both Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. Infections were observed in several vector species including C. imicola and the Pulicaris complex (C. pulicaris, C. bysta, C. newsteadi and C. punctatus) with varying prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Gyrase B gene grouped all new isolates within 'group C' of the genus, a clade that has to date been exclusively described in Culicoides. Through a comparison of our results with previous screens, we suggest C. imicola and C. sonorensis represent good candidates for onward study of Cardinium-midge interactions.","Pilgrim, J; Siozios, S; Baylis, M; Venter, G; Garros, C; Hurst, G D D",Med. vet. entomol,,179

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed 2-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than 2-fold higher rate for death as compared with White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared with White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors, health comorbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are underrepresented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on postdiagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for health care access will be critical to stem these disparities.","Newman, Lisa A; Winn, Robert A; Carethers, John M",Clin. cancer res,,179

Among inpatients who were ARB/ACEI (n = 210) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 275) users, there were 3.4 and 2.0 all-cause deaths per 100 person months (HR 1.25, 95%CI 0.30-5.13, median follow-up 30 days). Among inpatients, ARB (n = 1,164) and ACEI (n = 2,014) users had 21.0 vs. 17.7 all-cause deaths, per 100 person-months (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.93-1.38, median follow-up 30 days). CONCLUSIONS: This observational analysis supports continued ARB or ACEI use for patients already using these medications before SARS-CoV-2 infection. The novel beneficial association observed among outpatients between users of ARBs vs. ACEIs on hospitalization or mortality should be confirmed with randomized trials.","Derington, Catherine G; Cohen, Jordana B; Mohanty, April F; Greene, Tom H; Cook, James; Ying, Jian; Wei, Guo; Herrick, Jennifer S; Stevens, Vanessa W; Jones, Barbara E; Wang, Libo; Zheutlin, Alexander R; South, Andrew M; Hanff, Thomas C; Smith, Steven M; Cooper-DeHoff, Rhonda M; King, Jordan B; Alexander, G Caleb; Berlowitz, Dan R; Ahmad, Faraz S; Penrod, M Jason; Hess, Rachel; Conroy, Molly B; Fang, James C; Rubin, Michael A; Beddhu, Srinivasan; Cheung, Alfred K; Xian, Weiming; Weintraub, William S; Bress, Adam P",PLoS One,,179
252777,Outcomes of COVID-19-positive kidney transplant recipients,2020,"Fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic, we must not forget to prepare for the next. Since elderly and frail people are at high risk, we wish to predict their vulnerability, and intervene if possible. For example, it would take little effort to take additional swabs or dried blood spots. Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic. Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection & inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment & vaccination response. Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity & mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis & osteoarthritis patients alike. Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells. Our review suggests that more samples should be taken and saved systematically, following minimum standards, and data be made available, to maximize healthspan & minimize frailty, leading to savings in health care, gains in quality of life, and preparing us better for the next pandemic, all at the same time.","Fuellen, Georg; Liesenfeld, Oliver; Kowald, Axel; Barrantes, Israel; Bastian, Manuela; Simm, Andreas; Jansen, Ludger; Tietz-Latza, Alexander; Quandt, Dagmar; Franceschi, Claudio; Walter, Michael",Ageing Res Rev,,179

253406,Emergency Management of the Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Specialized Branches of Hospital,2020,"The purpose of the article is to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the agricultural supply chains and markets in Zimbabwe and subsequent effect on livelihoods. The research methodology that was applied is a systematic literature survey anchored on inductive research approach. This article is based on the systematic review of secondary data sources, such as journals, policy reports, as well as reports from national and international organizations. The review involved a predetermined and comprehensive approach of searching, analyzing and synthesizing extant literature on agricultural supply chains. In general, the pandemic has affected the whole supply chain from the food production systems and input supply, the storage and distribution, processing and packaging as well as the retail and marketing aspect. The research showed that the COVID-19 pandemic severely threatens an already critical food security situation arising mainly from the prevailing poor macroeconomic conditions and consecutive years of drought in Zimbabwe. This has led to a higher than previously anticipated food insecure population, especially in urban centers. Over 70% of the workers are self-employed and a vast majority operate in the informal sector. The informally employed represent a significant breadwinner constituency, whose dependents comprise vulnerable sections of the populace. The restrictions on mobility and the closure of borders meant immediate loss of employment and income. The study revisited the previous viruses such as Ebola to extrapolate though marginally, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using secondary sources and the general agriculture supply chain to guide understanding, the findings show that unless measures are put in place to safeguard farmers especially smallholder activities in Zimbabwe, COVID-19 has the potential to reproduce the same catastrophic implications created by Ebola in West Africa countries where peasant food systems where shattered and livelihoods strategies maimed. © 2021 The Author(s).

Remote management of HF patients has been recommended in order to maintain routine standards of care, but satisfaction with this platform of care is unknown. We set out to address the physician and patient opinion of remote management of HF during COVID-19. Methods and Results: An observational report of the use of a Structured Telephonic assessment (STA) in stable outpatient HF patients. Physician grading of the STA was complemented by 100 randomly chosen patients to ascertain patient's satisfaction and comment. 278 patients underwent a STA. Patient preference for STA was noted in 66%. Convenience was the single most cited reason for this preference (83.3%). The STA was deemed satisfactory by clinicians in 67.6%. The two-leading reasons for clinician dissatisfaction were data gaps providing a barrier to titration (55.6%) and need for clinical exam (18.9%). The annual review appointment visit subtype possessed the highest levels of satisfaction congruence amongst both clinicians and patients. Conclusion: In summary, this report demonstrates reasonable patient / physician satisfaction with STA, and providing some direction on how this care platform might be sustained beyond the COVID crisis.","Kerr, Brian; Pharithi, Rebabonye B; Barrett, Matthew; Halley, Carmel; Gallagher, Joe; Ledwidge, Mark; McDonald, Kenneth",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,,179

Thus, it is essential to undertake COVID-19 research and to identify therapeutic interventions in which computational modeling and virtual screening of lead molecules provide significant insights. The present study aimed to predict the interaction potential of natural lead molecules against prospective protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular modeling, docking, and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey and database search, fourteen molecular targets were selected and the three targets which lack the native structures were computationally modeled. The drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetic features of ninety-two natural molecules were predicted. Four lead molecules with ideal drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetic properties were selected and docked against fourteen targets, and their binding energies were compared with the binding energy of the interaction between Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine to their usual targets. The stabilities of selected docked complexes were confirmed by MD simulation and energy calculations. Four natural molecules demonstrated profound binding to most of the prioritized targets, especially, Hyoscyamine and Tamaridone to spike glycoprotein and Rotiorinol-C and Scutifoliamide-A to replicase polyprotein-1ab main protease of SARS-CoV-2 showed better binding energy, conformational and dynamic stabilities compared to the binding energy of Chloroquine and its usual target glutathione-S-transferase. The aforementioned lead molecules can be used to develop novel therapeutic agents towards the protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, and the study provides significant insight for structure-based drug development against COVID-19.","Skariyachan, Sinosh; Gopal, Dharshini; Muddebihalkar, Aditi G; Uttarkar, Akshay; Niranjan, Vidya",Comput Biol Med,,179

Here, we present a light-activable immunological adjuvant (LIA), which is composed of a hypoxia-responsive amphiphilic dendrimer nanoparticle loaded with chlorin e6. Under irradiation with near-infrared light, the LIA not only induces tumour cell lysis and tumour antigen release, but also promotes the structural transformation of 2-nitroimidazole containing dendrimer to 2-aminoimidazole containing dendrimer which can activate dendritic cells via the Toll-like receptor 7-mediated signaling pathway. The LIA efficiently inhibits both primary and abscopal tumour growth and induces strong antigen-specific immune memory effect to prevent tumour metastasis and recurrence in vivo. Furthermore, LIA localizes the immunological adjuvant effect at the tumour site. We demonstrate this light-activable immunological adjuvant offers a safe and potent platform for in situ cancer vaccination.","Wang, Yongchao; Gong, Ningqiang; Ma, Chi; Zhang, Yuxuan; Tan, Hong; Qing, Guangchao; Zhang, Jimei; Wang, Yufei; Wang, Jinjin; Chen, Shizhu; Li, Xianlei; Ni, Qiankun; Yuan, Yuan; Gan, Yaling; Chen, Junge; Li, Fangzhou; Zhang, Jinchao; Ou, Caiwen; Zhao, Yongxiang; Liu, Xiaoxuan; Liang, Xing-Jie",Nat Commun,,179

Changes on recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), decontamination protocols and organization of patient demand resulted may result in cost variation. Based on this, the present study aimed to evaluate the economic impact of new biosafety recommendations for oral healthcare assistance during COVID-19. An Activity Based Costing evaluation was used to calculate the acquisition of PPE and decontamination solutions recommended for dental practice during COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. PPE and decontamination solutions quantity and frequency of use were based on the newly COVID-19 recommendations. Costs (in Brazilian Real – R$) for biosafety recommendations pre-and post-COVID-19 were outlined and calculated for each patient, service shift and year. A sensitivity analysis considered 20% variation of direct costs. Previously to COVID-19 pandemic, direct costs of biosafety recommendations consisted of R$0.84 per patient, R$6.69 per service shift and R$3,413.94 per year. Post-COVID-19 costs of biosafety recommendations resulted in R$16.01 per patient, R$128.07 per service shift, and R$32,657.96 per year. Yearly costs can vary between R$26,126.37 and R$39,189.56. The annual budget increase necessary to adopt post-COVID biosafety recommendations was R$29,244.02. Newly biosafety recommendations increased significantly the costs of oral healthcare assistance during COVID-19 pandemic.

We screened asymptomatic HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. Complementary viral genome sequencing was performed on positive swab specimens. A seroprevalence analysis was also performed using multiple assays. Asymptomatic health care worker cohorts had a combined swab positivity rate of 29/5776 (0.50%, 95%CI 0.32-0.75) relative to a comparative cohort of symptomatic HCWs, where 54/1597 (3.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic 6.8:1). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among 996 asymptomatic HCWs with no prior known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4-3.4%, depending on assay. A novel in-house Coronavirus protein microarray showed differing SARS-CoV-2 protein reactivities and helped define likely true positives vs. suspected false positives.

This study hypothesized that IFR would be influenced by COVID-19 epidemic intensity. We tested the association between epidemic intensity and IFR using serological results from a recent large SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey (N = 60,983) in 19 Spanish regions. The infection fatality rate for Spain as a whole was 1.15% and varied between 0.13% and 3.25% in the regions (median 1.07%, IQR 0.69-1.32%). The IFR by region was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (rho = 0.54; p = 0.0162), cases/100,000 (rho = 0.75; p = 0.002), hospitalizations/100,000 (rho = 0.78; p = 0.0001), mortality/100,000 (rho = 0.77; p = 0.0001) and case fatality rate (rho = 0.49; p = 0.0327). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 IFR is not fixed. The Spanish regions with more rapid and extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 had higher IFRs. These findings are compatible with the theory that slowing the spread of COVID-19 down reduces the IFR and case fatality rate via preventing hospitals from being overrun, and thus allowing better and lifesaving care.","Kenyon, Chris",,,179

This study aims at exploiting Artificial intelligence (AI) for the identification, segmentation and quantification of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions. We investigated the effects of using multiple datasets, heterogeneously populated and annotated according to different criteria. We developed an automated analysis pipeline, the LungQuant system, based on a cascade of two U-nets. The first one (U-net_1) is devoted to the identification of the lung parenchyma, the second one (U-net_2) acts on a bounding box enclosing the segmented lungs to identify the areas affected by COVID-19 lesions. Different public datasets were used to train the U-nets and to evaluate their segmentation performances, which have been quantified in terms of the Dice index. The accuracy in predicting the CT-Severity Score (CT-SS) of the LungQuant system has been also evaluated. Both Dice and accuracy showed a dependency on the quality of annotations of the available data samples. On an independent and publicly available benchmark dataset, the Dice values measured between the masks predicted by LungQuant system and the reference ones were 0.95$\pm$0.01 and 0.66$\pm$0.13 for the segmentation of lungs and COVID-19 lesions, respectively. The accuracy of 90% in the identification of the CT-SS on this benchmark dataset was achieved. We analysed the impact of using data samples with different annotation criteria in training an AI-based quantification system for pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia. In terms of the Dice index, the U-net segmentation quality strongly depends on the quality of the lesion annotations. Nevertheless, the CT-SS can be accurately predicted on independent validation sets, demonstrating the satisfactory generalization ability of the LungQuant.","Lizzi, Francesca; Agosti, Abramo; Brero, Francesca; Cabini, Raffaella Fiamma; Fantacci, Maria Evelina; Figini, Silvia; Lascialfari, Alessandro; Laruina, Francesco; Oliva, Piernicola; Piffer, Stefano; Postuma, Ian; Rinaldi, Lisa; Talamonti, Cinzia; Retico, Alessandra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02566v1.pdf,179

263323,Projected HIV and Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infection Incidence Following COVID-19-Related Sexual Distancing and Clinical Service Interruption,2021,"BACKGROUND: AKI is a common sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, few studies have focused on AKI treated with RRT (AKI-RRT). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 3099 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 67 hospitals across the United States. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient-and hospital-level risk factors for AKI-RRT and to examine risk factors for 28-day mortality among such patients. RESULTS: A total of 637 of 3099 patients (20.6%) developed AKI-RRT within 14 days of ICU admission, 350 of whom (54.9%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Patient-level risk factors for AKI-RRT included CKD, men, non-White race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, higher body mass index, higher d-dimer, and greater severity of hypoxemia on ICU admission. Predictors of 28-day mortality in patients with AKI-RRT were older age, severe oliguria, and admission to a hospital with fewer ICU beds or one with greater regional density of COVID-19. At the end of a median follow-up of 17 days (range, 1-123 days), 403 of the 637 patients (63.3%) with AKI-RRT had died, 216 (33.9%) were discharged, and 18 (2.8%) remained hospitalized. Of the 216 patients discharged, 73 (33.8%) remained RRT dependent at discharge, and 39 (18.1%) remained RRT dependent 60 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: AKI-RRT is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a hospital mortality rate of >60%. Among those who survive to discharge, one in three still depends on RRT at discharge, and one in six remains RRT dependent 60 days after ICU admission.","Gupta, Shruti; Coca, Steven G; Chan, Lili; Melamed, Michal L; Brenner, Samantha K; Hayek, Salim S; Sutherland, Anne; Puri, Sonika; Srivastava, Anand; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Shehata, Alexandre M; Flythe, Jennifer E; Rashidi, Arash; Schenck, Edward J; Goyal, Nitender; Hedayati, S Susan; Dy, Rajany; Bansal, Anip; Athavale, Ambarish; Nguyen, H Bryant; Vijayan, Anitha; Charytan, David M; Schulze, Carl E; Joo, Min J; Friedman, Allon N; Zhang, Jingjing; Sosa, Marie Anne; Judd, Eric; Velez, Juan Carlos Q; Mallappallil, Mary; Redfern, Roberta E; Bansal, Amar D; Neyra, Javier A; Liu, Kathleen D; Renaghan, Amanda D; Christov, Marta; Molnar, Miklos Z; Sharma, Shreyak; Kamal, Omer; Boateng, Jeffery Owusu; Short, Samuel A P; Admon, Andrew J; Sise, Meghan E; Wang, Wei; Parikh, Chirag R; Leaf, David E",J.

263570,Chlamydia trachomatis Mimicking COVID-19 Chronic Follicular Conjunctivitis,2021,"Introduction: COVID-19 disease is an acute viral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Its main means of transmission is from person to person through respiratory droplets. It presents as a febrile condition with respiratory symptoms and high transmissibility rate. There is no vaccine, so the clinical suspicion and immediate isolation of the patient are essential Objective: The purpose of this work is to report the first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease in Córdoba (Argentina), highlighting telemedicine as a novel form of outpatient management. Methodology: We describe the first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease in Córdoba (Argentina), which presented in a patient without comorbidities in good clinical condition, and therefore ambulatory management using telemedicine was decided, which was satisfactory. Results: Outpatient management using telemedicine turned out to be optimal, avoiding the use of beds and the transmission of the virus within the hospital through management at home. Conclusion: Outpatient management of selected patients avoids virus transmission within the hospital and saturation of beds. Telemedicine is an effective and novel strategy for this situation.","Milanesio, Martín; Escudero, Daiana; Caeiro, Juan Pablo",Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba,,179
263850,Prevalence of COVID-19 Symptoms among Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Treated with Biological Agents,2020,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health threat facing mankind. There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and many vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trials. This study aimed to understand the perception of social media users regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional survey among social media users in Nigeria in August 2020 using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. Results: the results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents 385 (74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). We found a significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02). Conclusion: it was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings also reiterate the need to reassure the public the benefits an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine can reap for public health. There is a need for national health authorities in Nigeria to ensure public trust is earned and all communities, including the marginalized populations, are properly engaged to ensure an optimal COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Akande-Sholabi, Wuraola; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,,179

266472,Incubation period of SARS-CoV-2: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far resulted in over a hundred million people being infected. COVID-19 poses a threat to human health around the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been confirmed as the pathogenic virus of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus family of viruses and is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract. It has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors on the surface of various cells in humans. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current evidence suggests that the damage caused by the virus may be closely related to the induction of cytokine storms in COVID-19. No specific drugs or measures have yet to be shown to cure COVID-19 completely. Cell-based approaches, primarily mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been identified to have anti-inflammatory and immune functions in COVID-19. Clinical studies about using MSCs and its derivatives—exosomes for COVID-19 treatment—are under investigation. Here, we review the current progress of the biological characteristics, clinical manifestations, and cell-based treatment development for COVID-19. Providing up-to-date information on COVID-19 and potential MSC therapies will help highlight routes to prevent and treat the disease.

Unfortunately, final year university pre-service teacher education students’ practicum assessment could not be finalised. The practicum is a critical component in teacher education as it engenders professional transformation, reflection and growth. Unlike other academic modules which could be completed via online and distance education, the practicum, being a practical undertaking in a classroom situation, presented unique challenges. The research question that the article addresses is: How would certification of teachers be finalised when this time-tested assessment had not been done?The articleemploys content and discourse analysis to unpack the philosophical and professional arguments being advanced by faculty, in order to understand how they are likely to determine future directions of teacher education. The argument is that the emerging ‘new normal’ should not compromise the quality assurance mechanisms developed overtime.","Moyo, Nathan",J. Educ. Teach.,,179

267865,Challenges and issues about organizing a hospital to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak: experience from a French reference centre,2020,"The use of face masks for the general public has been suggested in literature as a means to decrease virus transmission during the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, literature findings indicate that most mask designs do not provide reliable protection. This paper investigates the hypothesis that the impaired protection is mainly due to imperfect fitting of the masks, so that airflow, which contains virus-transporting droplets, can leak through gaps into or out of the mask. The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient 2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and droplets may pass through the gap. The implications of these findings are discussed and improvements to existing mask designs are suggested.","Peri'c, Robinson; Peri'c, Milovan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08800v1.pdf,179

However, no definite treatment of COVID-19 has been found till date. The COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy has emerged as an important investigational therapy in the management of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the regulatory agencies, in particular, the Indian blood transfusion council must release some interim recommendations for the blood centres on the CCP blood donor eligibility criteria after COVID-19 vaccination. More clinical trials are needed to know the efficacy of the CCP harvested from COVID-19 recovered individuals who have been vaccinated against those COVID-19 recovered individuals who are not vaccinated to understand the vaccine impact on the IgG titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Bansal, N; Raturi, M; Bansal, Y",Transfus. clin. biol,,179

Although metabolic and immunological changes may contribute to the increased risk for COVID-19 mortality in obese, little is known about the impact of obesity in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed gene expression profiles of autopsy lungs of a cohort of 14 COVID-19 patients and 4 control individuals. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their comorbidities: hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. We then identified the molecular alterations associated with these comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Patients with only hypertension showed higher levels of inflammatory genes and B-cell related genes when compared to those with T2D and obesity. However, the levels of IFN-gamma, IL22, and CD274 (a ligand that binds to receptor PD1) were higher in COVID-19 patients with T2D and obesity. Several metabolic- and immune-associated genes such as G6PD, LCK and IL10 were significantly induced in the lungs of the obese group. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs may exacerbate the immune response and chronic condition in obese COVID-19 patients.","Santos E Silva, Juan Carlo; Vasconcelos, Amanda Pereira; Noma, Isabella Harumi Yonehara; Noronha, Natália Yumi; Aquino, Rodrigo; Giddaluru, Jeevan; Durão, Luiz; Costa-Martins, André Guilherme; Schuch, Viviane; Moraes-Vieira, Pedro M; Nakaya, Helder I",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,179
270195,Possible auto-antigens that may explain the post-infection autoimmune manifestations in COVID-19 patients displaying neurological conditions,2020,"AimsTo compare the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a simulation-based learning (SBL) programme for Junior Doctors virtually versus face to face.MethodThe Nottinghamshire Healthcare Simulation Centre has been delivering a SBL programme for Foundation Year 2 doctors on behalf of Health Education East Midlands for the past three years. Since face to face teaching was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic the programme was delivered online using the same content and format as for prior cohorts. Feedback questionnaires from 128 face to face participants (F2F) and 133 virtual participants (V) were compared.ResultThere was a decrease in Likert scale ratings across all domains in the virtual group. This was most apparent when examining the ‘strongly agreed’ responses: the venue/remote format was suitable for the session 34% decrease, the course length was appropriate 24% decrease, the pace of the course was appropriate 20% decrease, the simulation was helpful and relevant 15% decrease, the content of the course was organised and easy to follow 13% decrease, the learning objectives were met 10% decrease, the presenters were engaging 6% decrease, the trainers were well prepared 3% decrease. The virtual group included responses in the ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’ categories relating to the virtual format, length and pace, which did not occur in any domain for the F2F group.Combining the ‘strongly agree’ and ‘agree’ statements also showed a decrease in satisfaction with 72.5% of responses falling into this category for the V group and 88.3% for the F2F group. Fewer participants in the V group would recommend the course to a colleague (98% V vs 99% F2F).ConclusionProviding the SBL programme using an online format was feasible while also being acceptable to most participants. However, participants did not rate this experience as highly as face to face teaching. The largest decreases in satisfaction were in areas related to the virtual format. An interesting finding is that participants rated the pace and length of the online course as less agreeable, despite the content and scheduling being the same as for the face to face group.Based on these findings face to face teaching should resume when practicable. In the meantime, the virtual delivery may be improved if the course length was reduced. Analysis of qualitative feedback may provide insights into why participants did not rate the virtual simulation as highly as the face to face equivalent.","Bachra, Josh Ludvigsen Anna Kehinde Junaid",BJPsych Open,,179
272803,Are patients with systemic lupus erythematosus at increased risk for COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected African countries, specifically the countries, such as Libya, that are in constant conflict. Clinical and laboratory information, including mortality and associated risk factors in relation to hospital settings and available resources, about critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Africa is not available. This study aimed to determine the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) following 60 days after ICU admission, and explore the factors that influence in-ICU mortality rate. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective observational study among COVID-19 critical care patients in 11 ICUs in Libya from May 29th to December 30th 2020. Basic demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory values, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, quick SOFA, and clinical management were analyzed. RESULT: We included 465 consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients. The majority (67.1%) of the patients were older than 60 years, with a median (IQR) age of 69 (56.5-75); 240 (51.6%) were male. At 60 days of follow-up, 184 (39.6%) were discharged alive, while 281 (60.4%) died in the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 7 days (4-10) and non-survivors had significantly shorter stay, 6 (3-10) days. The body mass index was 27.9 (24.1-31.6) kg/m2. At admission to the intensive care unit, quick SOFA median (IQR) score was 1 (1-2), whereas total SOFA score was 6 (4-7). In univariate analysis, the following parameters were significantly associated with increased/decreased hazard of mortality: increased age, BMI, white cell count, neutrophils, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and d-dimer levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Decreased lymphocytes, and platelet count were associated with higher risk of mortality. Quick SOFA and total SOFA scores increase, emergency intubation, inotrope use, stress myocardiopathy, acute kidney injury, arrythmia, and seizure were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study reported the highest mortality rate (60.4%) among critically ill patients with COVID-19 60 days post-ICU admission. Several factors were found to be predictive of mortality, which may help to identify patients at risk of mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Abusalama, Abdurraouf; Alkaseek, Akram; Abdeewi, Saedah; Yahya, Mohammed; Mohammed, Alsnosy; Abdelkabir, Mohammed; Huwaysh, Mohammed; Amkhatirah, Emad; Alshorbaji, Kamel; Khel, Samer; Gamra, Marwa; Alhadi, Abdulmueti; Abubaker, Taha; Anaiba, Mohamed; Elmugassabi, Mohammed; Binnawara, Muhannud; Khaled, Ala; Zaid, Ahmed; Msherghi, Ahmed",PLoS One,,179

The epidemic-situation sample dreamed more of threatening events than the non-epidemic-situation sample (supporting the TST) and more of non-aggression threatening events, possibly due to the hyperassociation during sleep. However, the epidemic-situation sample did not show a greater prevalence of illness events in dreams (not supporting the ICH).

280236,WITHDRAWN: A mechanistic analysis placental intravascular thrombus formation in COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We posit current infection control guidelines generally protect HCP from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare setting. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we use viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States between 25 March - 27 December, 2020. We obtain limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combine epidemiological information with healthcare-associated viral sequences and with viral sequences collected in the broader community to infer the most likely source of infection in HCP. RESULTS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 95 HCP and 137 possible patient contact sequences. The majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker (55/95; 57.9%) and were genetically similar to viruses circulating concurrently in the community. We found 10.5% of infections could be traced to a coworker (10/95). Strikingly, only 4.2% of HCP infections could be traced to a patient source (4/95). CONCLUSIONS: Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients, HCP, and communities at risk. We found no evidence for healthcare-associated transmission in the majority of HCP infections evaluated here. Though we cannot rule out the possibility of cryptic healthcare-associated transmission, it appears that HCP most commonly becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 via community exposure. This emphasizes the ongoing importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs, and rapid distribution of vaccines.","Braun, Katarina M; Moreno, Gage K; Buys, Ashley; Somsen, Elizabeth D; Bobholz, Max; Accola, Molly A; Anderson, Laura; Rehrauer, William M; Baker, David A; Safdar, Nasia; Lepak, Alexander J; O039,; Connor, David H; Friedrich, Thomas C",Clin. infect. dis,,179

281777,SARS-CoV2: should inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with COVID-19?,2020,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barré syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barré syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.","Shahrizaila, Nortina; Lehmann, Helmar C; Kuwabara, Satoshi",Lancet,,179

282054,Characteristics of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donors and Antibody Levels,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with COVID-19 frequently exhibit a hypercoagulable state with high thrombotic risk, particularly those admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Thromboprophylaxis is mandatory in these patients; nevertheless, thrombosis still occurs in many cases. Thus, the problem of assessing an adequate level of anticoagulation in ICU patients becomes evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the heparin resistance and the efficacy of heparin monitoring using an anti-Xa activity assay. METHODS: Thirty-seven heparin-treated patients admitted to ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were retrospectively studied for antifactor Xa activity (anti-Xa), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), Antithrombin, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Factor VIII, von Willebrand Factor, and the total daily amount of heparin administered. The correlation between APTT and anti-Xa was evaluated for unfractionated heparins (UFH). The correlations between the daily dose of UFH or the dosage expressed as IU/kg b.w. for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and anti-Xa were also evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received calcium heparin, 8 sodium heparin, and 8 LMWH. A moderate correlation was found between APTT and anti-Xa for UFH. APTT did not correlate with coagulation parameters. 62% of UFH and 75% of LMWH treated patients were under the therapeutic range. About 75% of patients could be considered resistant to heparin. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV2 pneumonia patients in ICU have frequently heparin resistance. Anti-Xa seems a more reliable method to monitor heparin treatment than APTT in acute patients, also because the assay is insensitive to the increased levels of fibrinogen, FVIII, and LAC that are common during the COVID-19 inflammatory state.","Novelli, Chiara; Borotto, Erika; Beverina, Ivo; Punzi, Veronica; Radrizzani, Danilo; Brando, Bruno",Int. j. lab. hematol,,179

The underlying pathogenesis of hepatitis B-related glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN) involves immune complexes, which can be isolated from kidney tissues. Clearance of HBV antigenemia improves renal impairment and proteinuria in HBV-GN patients.Areas covered: In this review, we present our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of HBV-GN. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs), and the main pharmaceutical treatment for hepatis B.Expert opinion: Currently, antiviral agents are the main HBV-GN therapeutic agents. Although no randomized controlled clinical trials have compared the efficacy of interferon (IFN) and NA, we suggest IFN treatment for pediatric patients (IFN-&#945; in patients &#8805;1 year; pegIFN-&#945; in patients &#8805;3 years) considering treatment duration and absence of resistance. Novel NAs have brought about promising treatment options involving high efficacy viral suppression and low resistance rates. NAs with a high barrier to resistance (e.g. entecavir) are recommended as first-line therapy of HBV-GN. Immunosuppression monotherapy, such as corticosteroids, is of little benefit and potentially harmful to HBV-GN patients due to the possibility of viral reactivation.","Liu, Yanjun; Shi, Cuicui; Fan, Jiangao; Wang, Baocan; Li, Guangming",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,,179

It is not clear how detection rate, sensitivity, and the risk of exposure for medical providers differ in two sampling methods. Methods: In this prospective study, 120 paired NPS and OPS specimens were collected from 120 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in swabs were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load were analyzed with regards NPS and OPS. Sampling discomfort reported by patients was evaluated. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate was significantly higher for NPS [46.7% (56/120)] than OPS [10.0% (12/120)] (P &lt; 0.001). The sensitivity of NPS was also significantly higher than that of OPS (P &lt; 0.001). At the time of sampling, the time of detectable SARS-CoV-2 had a longer median duration (25.0 vs. 20.5 days, respectively) and a longer maximum duration (41 vs. 39 days, respectively) in NPS than OPS. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of NPS (37.8, 95% CI: 37.0–38.6) was significantly lower than that of OPS (39.4, 95% CI: 38.9–39.8) by 1.6 (95% CI 1.0–2.2, P &lt; 0.001), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 load was significantly higher in NPS specimens than OPS. Patient discomfort was low in both sampling methods. During NPS sampling, patients were significantly less likely to have nausea and vomit. Conclusions: NPS had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load than OPS. NPS could reduce droplets production during swabs. NPS should be recommended for diagnosing COVID-19 and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 load.

Some of these patients are under oral anticoagulation (OAC) at admission, but to date, there are no data on the clinical profile, prognosis and risk factors of such patients during hospitalization for COVID-19. DESIGN: Subanalysis of the international 'real-world' HOPE COVID-19 registry. All patients with prior OAC at hospital admission for COVID-19 were suitable for the study. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: From 1002 patients included, 110 (60.9% male, median age of 81.5 [IQR 75-87] years, median Short-Form Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] of 1 [IQR 1-3]) were on OAC at admission, mainly for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. After propensity score matching, 67.9% of these patients died during hospitalization, which translated into a significantly higher mortality risk compared to patients without prior OAC (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.08-2.16). After multivariate Cox regression analysis, respiratory insufficiency during hospitalization (HR 6.02, 95% CI 2.18-16.62), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) during hospitalization (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.34-3.91) and the Short-Form CCI (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.49) were the main risk factors for mortality in patients on prior OAC. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients without prior OAC, COVID-19 patients on OAC therapy at hospital admission showed lower survival and higher mortality risk. In these patients on OAC therapy, the prevalence of several comorbidities is high. Respiratory insufficiency and SIRS during hospitalization, as well as higher comorbidity, pointed out those anticoagulated patients with increased mortality risk.","Rivera-Caravaca, José Miguel; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Vivas, David; Viana-Llamas, María C; Uribarri, Aitor; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel; Trabattoni, Daniela; Fernández Rozas, Inmaculada; Feltes, Gisela; López-Pais, Javier; El-Battrawy, Ibrahim; Macaya, Carlos; Fernandez-Ortiz, Antonio; Estrada, Vicente; Marín, Francisco",Eur J Clin Invest,,179

Olfactory training involving aromatic oils has been recommended to improve olfactory recovery, but quantitative data are missing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the benefit of olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application for patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction for &#8805;1 month. METHODS: We performed an observational, real-life, data-based study on a cohort of patients who experienced at least 1 month of persistent olfactory dysfunction between January 30 and March 26, 2021. An analysis was performed after a mean olfactory training time of 4 weeks, and at least 500 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. Participants exposed themselves twice daily to odors from 4 high-concentration oils and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application. Improvement was defined as a 2-point increase on a 10-point, self-assessed olfactory visual analogue scale. RESULTS: In total, 548 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. The mean baseline, self-assessed olfactory score was 1.9 (SD 1.7), and this increased to 4.6 (SD 2.8) after a mean olfactory training time of 27.7 days (SD 17.2). Olfactory training was associated with at least a 2-point increase in 64.2% (352/548) of patients. The rate of patients' olfactory improvement was higher for patients who trained for more than 28 days than that rate for patients who trained for less than 28 days (73.3% vs 59%; P=.002). The time to olfactory improvement was 8 days faster for patients with hyposmia compared to the time to improvement for patients with anosmia (P<.001). This benefit was observed regardless of the duration of the olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application was associated with significant improvement in olfaction, especially after 28 days of olfactory training.","Denis, Fabrice; Septans, Anne-Lise; Periers, Lea; Maillard, Jean-Michel; Legoff, Florian; Gurden, Hirac; Moriniere, Sylvain",J Med Internet Res,,179

Children are thought to have milder respiratory symptoms and to recover more quickly. We describe a new presentation of COVID-19 infection in children consisting of multisystem inflammation with decreased left ventricular function and evidence of lung disease. CASE REPORT Three children presented with fever, conjunctivitis, dry and cracked lips, rash, and/or cervical lymphadenopathy for at least 5 days. Two of these children required mechanical ventilation, and 1 of the 2 needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support cardiorespiratory function. All of these children had moderate to severe hyponatremia and lymphopenia, which is usually seen in COVID-19. They were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose aspirin. All of the children recovered. CONCLUSIONS Early recognition of children with multisystem inflammation is important because they are at increased risk for deterioration. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin was used because this regimen has been shown to be beneficial in vasculitis of Kawasaki disease. The development of shock due to cardiac involvement may require ECMO.","Heidemann, Sabrina M; Tilford, Bradley; Bauerfeld, Christian; Martin, Amarilis; Garcia, Richard U; Yagiela, Lauren; Sarnaik, Ashok P",Am J Case Rep,,179

METHODS: Between April13th and 30th, 1.523 health workers were recruited to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology screening (All Test®) and they answered a questionnaire with demographic, epidemiological and clinical information and previous exposure to COVID-19. FINDINGS: One thousand two hundred ninety two (84.8%) were tested. Positive serology (IgM and/or IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 was found in 17.2% (222/1.292), in 15.5% (201/1.292) if only IgG was considered. Median age was 44±13 years, 73% were female. The 33.8% (75/222) were asymptomatic. Eighty one had a previous positive rRT-PCR. The 14% (32/222) referred a family contact. CONCLUSION: Serology prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in workers of a pediatric hospital was higher than in general population. Many of them had an unnoticed infection.","Escribano Ceruelo, Eva; Espinel Ruíz, Marco Antonio; Ortega López-Peláez, Marta; Fernández Garoz, Bárbara; Asensio Antón, Julia; Jiménez García, Raquel",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

In this work, we apply a particular measure of statistical complexity, namely the Rademacher complexity, to the quantum circuit model in quantum computation and study how the statistical complexity depends on various quantum circuit parameters. In particular, we investigate the dependence of the statistical complexity on the resources, depth, width, and the number of input and output registers of a quantum circuit. To study how the statistical complexity scales with resources in the circuit, we introduce a resource measure of magic based on the $(p,q)$ group norm, which quantifies the amount of magic in the quantum channels associated with the circuit. These dependencies are investigated in the following two settings: (i) where the entire quantum circuit is treated as a single quantum channel, and (ii) where each layer of the quantum circuit is treated as a separate quantum channel. The bounds we obtain can be used to constrain the capacity of quantum neural networks in terms of their depths and widths as well as the resources in the network.","Bu, Kaifeng; Koh, Dax Enshan; Li, Lu; Luo, Qingxian; Zhang, Yaobo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06154v1.pdf,179

295180,Down-Regulation of Colonic ACE2 Expression in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Responding to Anti-TNF Therapy: Implications for COVID-19,2020,"Since December 2019, Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world, leading to a global effort to develop vaccines and treatments. Despite extensive progress, there remains a need for treatments to bolster the immune responses in infected immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients who recently underwent a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunological protection against COVID-19 is mediated by both short-lived neutralising antibodies and long-lasting virus-reactive T cells. Therefore, we propose that T cell therapy may augment efficacy of current treatments. For the greatest efficacy with minimal adverse effects, it is important that any cellular therapy is designed to be as specific and directed as possible. Here, we identify T cells from COVID-19 patients with a potentially protective response to two major antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Spike and Nucleocapsid protein. By generating clones of highly virus-reactive CD4+ T cells, we were able to confirm a set of 9 immunodominant epitopes and characterise T cell responses against these. Accordingly, the sensitivity of T cell clones for their specific epitope, as well as the extent and focus of their cytokine response was examined. Moreover, by using an advanced T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach, we determined the paired TCR&#945;ß sequences of clones of interest. While these data on a limited population require further expansion for universal application, the results presented here form a crucial first step towards TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cell therapy of COVID-19.","Verhagen, Johan; van der Meijden, Edith D; Lang, Vanessa; Kremer, Andreas E; Völkl, Simon; Mackensen, Andreas; Aigner, Michael; Kremer, Anita N",Clin. exp. immunol,,179

This paper presents a discussion of the impact of cybersecurity issues that occur during and are attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations. This discussion is facilitated by a simulation tool, the Disaster Vulnerability Threat and Impact Simulator System (DVTISS). DVTISS simulates the network structure, security measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region's computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support. Based on the example emergencies, the paper also discusses key areas of vulnerability during emergency situations and their financial, data and system outage impacts. © 2020 IEEE.","Clare Lusardi, M.; Dubovoy, I.; Straub, J.","2020 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop, AIPR 2020",,179

In this paper, we explore the role of animal farming and meat consumption in the emergence and amplification of infectious diseases. First, we discuss how meat production increases epidemic risks, either directly through increased contact with wild and farmed animals or indirectly through its impact on the environment (e.g., biodiversity loss, water use, climate change). Traditional food systems such as bushmeat and backyard farming increase the risks of disease transmission from wild animals, while intensive farming amplifies the impact of the disease due to the high density, genetic proximity, increased immunodeficiency, and live transport of farmed animals. Second, we describe the various direct and indirect costs of animal-based infectious diseases, and in particular, how these diseases can negatively impact the economy and the environment. Last, we discuss policies to reduce the social costs of infectious diseases. While existing regulatory frameworks such as the ""One Health"" approach focus on increasing farms' biosecurity and emergency preparedness, we emphasize the need to better align stakeholders' incentives and to reduce meat consumption. We discuss in particular the implementation of a ""zoonotic"" Pigouvian tax, and innovations such as insect-based food or cultured meat.","Espinosa, Romain; Tago, Damian; Treich, Nicolas",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,179
298249,Inflammatory bowel disease in Australian Aboriginals and Black South Africans,2021,"BACKGROUND: In a pandemic situation the overall mortality rate is of considerable interest; however, these data must always be seen in relation to the given healthcare system and the availability of local level of care. A recently published German data evaluation of more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients treated in 920 hospitals showed a high mortality rate of 22% in hospitalized patients and of more than 50% in patients requiring invasive ventilation. Because of the high infection rates in Bavaria, a large number of COVID-19 patients with considerable severity of disease were treated at the intensive care units of the LMU hospital. The LMU hospital is a university hospital and a specialized referral center for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OBJECTIVE: Data of LMU intensive care unit (ICU) patients were systematically evaluated and compared with the recently published German data. METHODS: Data of all COVID-19 patients with invasive and noninvasive ventilation and with completed admission at the ICU of the LMU hospital until 31 July 2020 were collected. Data were processed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In total 70 critically ill patients were included in the data evaluation. The median SAPS II on admission to the ICU was 62 points. The median age was 66 years and 81% of the patients were male. More than 90% were diagnosed with ARDS and received invasive ventilation. Treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was necessary in 10% of the patients. The median duration of ventilation was 16 days, whereby 34.3% of patients required a tracheostomy. Of the patients 27.1% were transferred to the LMU hospital from external hospitals with reference to our ARDS/ECMO program. Patients from external hospitals had ARDS of higher severity than the total study population. In total, nine different substances were used for virus-specific treatment of COVID-19. The most frequently used substances were hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Immunomodulatory treatment, such as Cytosorb® (18.6%) and methylprednisolone (25.7%) were also frequently used. The overall in-hospital mortality rate of ICU patients requiring ventilation was 28.6%. The mortality rates of patients from external hospitals, patients with renal replacement therapy and patients with ECMO therapy were 47.4%, 56.7% and 85.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in the ventilated COVID-19 intensive care patients was considerably different from the general rate in Germany. The data showed that treatment in an ARDS referral center could result in a lower mortality rate. Low-dose administration of steroids may be another factor to improve patient outcome in a preselected patient population. In the authors' opinion, critically ill COVID-19 patients should be treated in an ARDS center provided that sufficient resources are available.","Schroeder, Ines; Scharf, Christina; Zoller, Michael; Wassilowsky, Dietmar; Frank, Sandra; Stecher, Stephanie-Susanne; Stemmler, Joachim; Kneidinger, Nikolaus; Peterß, Sven; Zwißler, Bernhard; Irlbeck, Michael",Anaesthesist,,179

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of patients who received intravitreal injections between April 12th and May 9th, 2020, a period during the national COVID-19 lockdown (March 16th to June 6th, 2020). Special medical and logistic arrangements, priority and visual risk assessment and strict infection control precautions were implemented. Demographics, diagnosis, intravitreal injection history, medical history, ophthalmic examinations and optical coherence tomography data were collected and analyzed. Results: Intravitreal injections were successfully administered to 132 patients with diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. All logistic and transmission control measures were followed by the medical staff and patients with no incidents. No new exposures or COVID-19 positive cases were traced to our location or time of therapy. No complications related to the injections were recorded. The mean period of delay due to the lockdown from the original scheduled appointment was six weeks. Mean visual acuity significantly decreased from 20/55 before the lockdown to 20/70 after the lockdown, and mean central macular thickness significantly increased from 329 to 370 μ. Conclusion: The administration of intravitreal injection therapy during the COVID-19 lockdown under special safety precautions was feasible and successful. Resumption of the essential therapies and medical services during periods of pandemic restrictions while adhering to strict transmission control measures is encouraged.","Saleh, Omar A.; Jammal, Hisham; Alqudah, Noor; Alqudah, Asem; Abu-Yaghi, Nakhleh",Clin.

We observed the correlation between neutralizing antibody titer and IgG, but not IgM, antibody titer of COVID-19 patients. In the analysis of the predicted the linear B cell epitopes, hot spots in the N-terminal domain of the S protein were observed in the serum from patients in the intensive care unit of Osaka University Hospital. Overall, the analysis of antibody production and B cell epitopes of the S protein from patient serum may provide a novel target for the vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.","Yoshida, Shota; Ono, Chikako; Hayashi, Hiroki; Fukumoto, Shinya; Shiraishi, Satoshi; Tomono, Kazunori; Arase, Hisashi; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Nakagami, Hironori",Sci Rep,,179

The proposed system consists of two deep-learning-based models. A quality assessment module automates predictions of image quality, and a diagnosis assistance module determines the likelihood-of-anomaly in ultrasound images of sufficient quality. Our two-stage strategy uses a novelty detection algorithm to address the lack of control cases available for training a quality assessment classifier. The diagnosis assistance module can then be trained with data that are deemed of sufficient quality, guaranteed by the closed-loop feedback mechanism from the quality assessment module. Integrating the two modules yields accurate, fast, and practical acquisition guidance and diagnostic assistance for patients with suspected respiratory conditions at the point-of-care. Using more than 25,000 ultrasound images from 37 COVID-19-positive patients scanned at two hospitals, plus 12 control cases, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed machine learning approach. We report an accuracy of 86% when classifying between sufficient and insufficient quality images by the quality assessment module. For data of sufficient quality, the mean classification accuracy in detecting COVID-19-positive cases was 95% on five holdout test data sets, unseen during the training of any networks within the proposed system.","Baum, Zachary M C; Bonmati, Ester; Cristoni, Lorenzo; Walden, Andrew; Prados, Ferran; Kanber, Baris; Barratt, Dean C; Hawkes, David J; Parker, Geoffrey J M; Wheeler-Kingshott, Claudia A M Gandini; Hu, Yipeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08840v1.pdf,179

RESULTS: The number of patients undergoing single or multiple biomarker testing was similar in 2019 (n=43) and in 2020 (n=45). Considering adequate samples for molecular testing, before the outbreak, next-generation sequencing was mostly used (35/42, 83.3%). Testing six genes had a reagent cost of 98/patient. Conversely, in 2020, almost all cases (38/41, 92.7%) were analysed by automated testing. This latter had for any single assay/gene a significant reagent cost (95-136) and a faster mean turnaround time (5.3 vs 7.9 working days).

The objective of the study was to demonstrate that percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) with a period of apnea in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 is safe and can be performed for the usual indications in the intensive care unit. METHODS: This study involves an observational case series at a single-center medical intensive care unit at a level-1 trauma center in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were assessed for tracheostomy. Success of a modified technique included direct visualization of tracheal access by bronchoscopy and a blind dilation and tracheostomy insertion during a period of patient apnea to reduce aerosolization. Secondary outcomes include transmission rate of COVID-19 to providers and patient complications. RESULTS: From April 6th, 2020 to July 21st, 2020, 2030 patients were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, 615 required intensive care unit care (30.3%), and 254 patients required mechanical ventilation (12.5%). The mortality rate for patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 29%. Eighteen patients were assessed for PDT, and 11 (61%) underwent the procedure. The majority had failed extubation at least once (72.7%), and the median duration of intubation before tracheostomy was 15 d (interquartile range 13-24). The median positive end-expiratory pressure at time of tracheostomy was 10.8. The median partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio on the day of tracheostomy was 142.8 (interquartile range 104.5-224.4). Two patients had bleeding complications. At 1-week follow-up, eight patients still required ventilator support (73%).

Data were collected from 70 centres that participate in the Spanish Registry of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients' information was collected from their medical chart. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and development of the infection in neonates within 14 days postpartum. RESULTS: The early cord clamping (ECC) group consisted of 231 infants (57.3%) and the DCC group consisted of 172 infants (42.7%). Five positive newborns (1.7% of total tests performed) were identified with the nasopharyngeal PCR tests performed in the first 12 hours postpartum, two from the ECC group (1.7%) and three from the DCC group (3.6%). No significant differences between groups were found regarding neonatal tests for SARS-CoV-2. No confirmed cases of vertical transmission were detected. The percentage of mothers who made skin-to-skin contact within the first 24 hours after delivery was significantly higher in the DCC group (84.3% versus 45.9%). Breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period was also significantly higher in the DCC group (77.3% versus 50.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show no differences in perinatal outcomes when performing ECC or DCC, and skin-to-skin contact, or breastfeeding. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: This study demonstrates that delayed cord clamping is safe in mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mejía Jiménez, I; Salvador López, R; García Rosas, E; Rodriguez de la Torre, I; Montes García, J; de la Cruz Conty, M L; Martínez Pérez, O",BJOG,,179

Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA), defined as shoulder pain and limited range of motion occurring after the administration of a vaccine intended for intramuscular administration in the upper arm, is a well-established condition in the medical literature, yet underreported. In such cases, subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis may occur, leading to shoulder dysfunction and ongoing pain. Millions of doses of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 have been administered to adults worldwide during the pandemic. We report a case of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis after COVID-19 vaccination, related to the unintentional injection of vaccine solution into the bursa resulting in a robust immune-mediated inflammatory reaction.","Cantarelli Rodrigues, Tatiane; Hidalgo, Pedro Filgueiras; Skaf, Abdalla Youssef; Serfaty, Aline",Skelet. radiol,,179

308787,A report of three COVID-19 cases with prolonged viral RNA detection in anal swabs,2020,": This commentary begins as a question and makes a call for action. The question is: ""Are ICU (intensive care unit) patients' outcomes related to the degree to which the patients' nurses practice the art of nursing unique to critical care?"" When nurses address patients' basic human needs as opposed to tending solely to tasks, it likely affects the patients' vital signs, need for analgesia or sedation, adverse effects of stress, and short- and long-term outcomes. These factors are often collected in studies of the critically ill. The level of practice reflecting the art of critical care nursing can be an unrecognized confounding variable influencing results. The call for action is ""create a tool to measure and study the effect of the art of nursing unique to the ICU on patient outcomes."" The current COVID crisis has created tremendous visibility and awareness illuminating the role of the nurses and other health care providers. It is quite fitting, as this is also the year of the nurse and the midwife, that we celebrate and articulate much of what is unique to the art of our practice.","Harvey, Maurene A",Dimens Crit Care Nurs,,179

309559,Antibody response using six different serological assays in a completely PCR-tested community after a COVID-19 outbreak - The CoNAN study,2020,"A major driver of the U.S. opioid crisis is limited access to effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that reduce overdose risks. Traditionally, jails and prisons in the U.S. have not initiated or maintained MOUD for incarcerated individuals with OUD prior to their return to the community, which places them at high risk for fatal overdose. A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone). Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative. The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate. The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release. The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208. We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism; (2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners; (3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls. MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming. MassJCOIN adapted research activities to this new reality in an effort to document and account for the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to each aim. The goal remains to produce findings with direct implications for policy and practice for OUD in criminal justice settings.","Evans, Elizabeth A; Stopka, Thomas J; Pivovarova, Ekaterina; Murphy, Sean M; Taxman, Faye S; Ferguson, Warren J; Bernson, Dana; Santelices, Claudia; McCollister, Kathryn E; Hoskinson, Randall; Lincoln, Thomas; Friedmann, Peter D",J Subst Abuse Treat,,179

310725,COVID-19 Presentation in Association with Myasthenia Gravis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,2020,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 displays a variety of clinical manifestations; in pauci-symptomatic patients olfactory (OD) and gustatory dysfunctions (GD) may represent the first or only symptom. This topic is currently arousing great interest, and a growing number of papers are being published. Aim of this study is to investigate the timing of recovery from OD and GD in a real-life population hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We followed up by a phone interview the first 100 patients discharged a month earlier from three Italian non-intensive care wards. RESULTS: All 100 patients were Caucasian, mean age was 65 years, 60% were males. Forty-two patients (mean age 63 years) experienced subjective chemosensory dysfunctions (29 OD and 41 GD): the male/female ratio was 2:1; 83% reported a complete or near complete recovery at follow-up. The recovery rate was not significantly different between males and females. The mean duration of OD and GD was 18 and 16 days, respectively. The mean recovery time from OD or GD resulted significantly longer for females than for males (26 vs 14 days, P = 0.009). Among the 42 symptomatic, the mean age of males was significantly higher than that of females (66 vs 57 years, P = 0.04), while the opposite was observed in the 58 asymptomatic patients (60 vs 73 years, P = 0.0018). CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from OD or GD was rapid, occurring within 4 weeks in most patients. Chemosensory dysfunctions in women was less frequent, but longer lasting. The value of our study is its focus on a population of hospitalized patients significantly older than those previously described, and the additional data on gender differences.","Meini, Simone; Suardi, Lorenzo Roberto; Busoni, Michele; Roberts, Anna Teresa; Fortini, Alberto",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,179

The topic of discussion is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets. Therefore, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples. Thirty patients were included in the study aged 35.67 ± 6.84 years. The day after the pharyngeal and/or nose swab of SARS-CoV-2 was positive, urine and semen samples were taken from patients, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated. Laboratory tests and chest CT findings were evaluated simultaneously. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four (13.3%) patients' semen samples and in seven (23.3%) patients' urine samples. White blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and procalcitonin were significantly higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 in semen (p < .05), though no statistical difference was found in urine (p > .05). Patients with severe pneumonia findings in Chest CT images are likely to be PCR positive in semen and urine samples (p = .005, p = .001). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in urine and semen samples of patients after they had recovered (average duration 23 ± 4 days). SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the urogenital fluids of patients with severe clinical conditions and high viral load.","Saylam, Baris; Uguz, Mustafa; Yarpuzlu, Mehmet; Efesoy, Ozan; Akbay, Erdem; Çayan, Selahittin",Andrologia,,179
311640,"Full autopsy in a confirmed COVID-19 patient in Lagos, Nigeria – A case report",2021,"After the global spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), research has concentrated its efforts on several aspects of the epidemiological burden of pandemic. In this frame, the presented study follows a previous analysis of the temporal link between cases and deaths during the first epidemic wave (Phase 1) in Italy (March-June 2020). We here analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the time span from March 2020 to June 2021. The elaboration of the curves of cases and deaths allows identifying the temporal shift between the positive testing and the fatal event, which corresponds to one week from W2 to W33, two weeks from W34 to W41, and three weeks from W42 to W67. Based on this finding, we calculate the Weekly Lethality Rate (WLR). The WLR was grossly overestimated (~13.5%) in Phase 1, while a mean value of 2.6% was observed in most of Phase 2 (starting from October 2020), with a drop to 1.4% in the last investigated weeks. Overall, these findings offer an interesting insight into the magnitude and time evolution of the lethality burden attributable to COVID-19 during the entire pandemic period in Italy. In particular, the analysis highlighted the impact of the effectiveness of public health and social measures, of changes in disease management, and of preventive strategies over time.","d039, Vincenzo; Alessandro,; Balasco, Nicole; Ferrara, Pietro; Vitagliano, Luigi",,,179

The present convergent parallel design mixed-methods study explored the early effects of COVID-19 on African American/Black or Latino (AABL) long-term survivors of HIV in a pandemic epicenter, New York City. A total of 96 AABL PLWH were recruited from a larger study of PLWH with non-suppressed HIV viral load. They engaged in structured assessments focused on knowledge, testing, trust in information sources, and potential emotional, social, and behavioral impacts. Twenty-six of these participants were randomly selected for in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants were mostly men (64%), African American/Black (75%), and had lived with HIV for 17 years, on average (SD=9 years). Quantitative results revealed high levels of concern about and the adoption of recommended COVID-19 prevention recommendations. HIV care visits were commonly canceled but, overall, engagement in HIV care and antiretroviral therapy use were not seriously disrupted. Trust in local sources of information was higher than trust in various federal sources. Qualitative findings complemented and enriched quantitative results and provided a multifaceted description of both risk factors (e.g., phones/internet access were inadequate for some forms of telehealth) and resilience (e.g., ""hustling"" for food supplies). Participants drew a direct line between structural racism and the disproportional adverse effects of COVID-19 on communities of color, and their knowledge gleaned from the HIV pandemic was applied to COVID-19.

There is a need to design a simple, low-cost, waterproof breath shield to minimise risk of infection.Dimensions of the Haag-Streit slit lamp (model BM 900) were recorded to guide accurate design of the breath shield. A questionnaire was circulated among slit lamp users on their perceived risk and concern about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and their perception of how effective different designs of breath shields would be at protecting them from an infection. A number of breath shield prototypes were designed and trialled. Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles were used to improve the design. Materials used to create the breath shields included transparent A3 laminating pouches and laminator, two sheets of A4 paper, scissors, hole punch and a ruler. The breath shield was designed to fit over the objective lens on the slit lamp after temporarily removing the standard, manufacturer-provided breath shield, before replacing it. The breath shields were cleaned after every patient with alcohol wipes and removed for deep cleaning with hand soap and water after each session. We used a proof of concept experiment using fluorescein instilled spray to test the effectiveness of each breath shield at preventing droplet transmission to the slit lamp user.Following four PDSA cycles, a breath shield that is user-friendly, easy to clean was produced. The percentage of confidence that the final design would be effective at preventing droplet transmission increased from 5.6% to 80%.Implementation of a low cost, simple to make, transparent, waterproof breath shield together with other forms of person protective equipment (PPE) creates a safe working environment for clinicians and patients. This intervention can be readily replicated and modified for other slit lamp models.","Wu, Clara Hoi Ka; Jarrar, Zakariya; Harsum, Steven",,,179

A significant portion of the global population is infected with HPV, with the virus attributed to causing up to 5% of cancers worldwide. Bivalent, quadrivalent, and nine-valent vaccinations exist to aid in the prevention of these diseases and have been proven to be effective at preventing both benign and malignant disease. While vaccination is readily accessible in more developed countries, barriers exist to worldwide distribution and acceptance of vaccination. Vaccination and screening of HPV infection when used in combination are proven and predicted to decrease HPV related pathology. Improvements in vaccination formulations, for treatment as well as prevention, are actively being sought from a variety of mechanisms. Despite these advancements, and the data supporting their efficacy, there has been substantial delay in obtaining adequate vaccination coverage. In reviewing these challenges and looking forward to new vaccine development-especially within the current pandemic-it is clear from the challenges of HPV we require methods to more effectively encourage vaccination, ways to dispel vaccination myths as they occur, and implement better processes for vaccine distribution globally.","Rosalik, Kendal; Tarney, Christopher; Han, Jasmine",Viruses,,179

320702,Point-of-care faecal calprotectin testing in patients with paediatric inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The current gold standard in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnostics is the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. Alternatively, nasal swab (NS) or saliva swab (SS) specimens are used, although available data on test accuracy are limited. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of NPS/NS/SS samples for this purpose. METHODS: Ten patients were included after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in NPS samples according to the National Institute of Infectious Disease guidelines. In comparison with this conventional diagnostic method, NPS/NS/SS samples were tested using the cobas 6800 systems RT-PCR device. To investigate the usefulness of the cobas method and the difference among sample types, the agreement and sensitivity were calculated. Five to six samples were collected over a total period of 5-6 d from each patient. RESULTS: Fifty-seven sets of NPS/NS/SS samples were collected, of which 40 tested positive for COVID-19 by the conventional method. Overall, the concordance rates using the conventional method were 86.0%/70.2%/54.4% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas); however, for samples collected up to and including on Day 9 after disease onset (22 negative and one positive specimens), the corresponding rates were 95.7%/87.0%/65.2%. The overall sensitivity estimates were 100.0%/67.5%/37.5% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas). For samples up to 9 d after onset, the corresponding values were 100.0%/86.4%/63.6%. CONCLUSIONS: NS samples are more reliable than SS samples and can be an alternative to NPS samples.

321424,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thromboses in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Three Cases and a Review of the Literature,2020,"Aerosols represent a potential transmission route of COVID-19. This study examined effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Simulated sunlight and matrix significantly affected decay rate of the virus. Relative humidity alone did not affect the decay rate; however, minor interactions between relative humidity and other factors were observed. Mean decay rates (± SD) in simulated saliva, under simulated sunlight levels representative of late winter/early fall and summer were 0.121â ±â 0.017 min-1 (90% loss, 19 minutes) and 0.306â ±â 0.097 min-1 (90% loss, 8 minutes), respectively. Mean decay rate without simulated sunlight across all relative humidity levels was 0.008â ±â 0.011 min-1 (90% loss, 286 minutes). These results suggest that the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on environmental conditions, particularly sunlight. These data may be useful to inform mitigation strategies to minimize the potential for aerosol transmission.","Schuit, Michael; Ratnesar-Shumate, Shanna; Yolitz, Jason; Williams, Gregory; Weaver, Wade; Green, Brian; Miller, David; Krause, Melissa; Beck, Katie; Wood, Stewart; Holland, Brian; Bohannon, Jordan; Freeburger, Denise; Hooper, Idris; Biryukov, Jennifer; Altamura, Louis A; Wahl, Victoria; Hevey, Michael; Dabisch, Paul",J Infect Dis,,179

321654,Coronavirus Uncovers Mysterious Mediastinal Mass: a Diagnostic and Management Dilemma,2020,"BACKGROUND: Widespread social distancing and lockdowns of everyday activity have been the primary policy prescription across many countries throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their uniformity, these measures may be differentially valuable for different countries. METHODS: We use a compartmental epidemiological model to project the spread of COVID-19 across policy scenarios in high- and low-income countries. We embed estimates of the welfare value of disease avoidance into the epidemiological projections to estimate the return to more stringent lockdown policies. RESULTS: Social distancing measures that 'flatten the curve' of the disease provide immense welfare value in upper-income countries. However, social distancing policies deliver significantly less value in lower-income countries that have younger populations, which are less vulnerable to COVID-19. Equally important, social distancing mandates a trade-off between disease risk and economic activity. Poorer people are less able to make those economic sacrifices. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and welfare value of social distancing is smaller in lower-income countries and such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector often lack the resources and social protections that enable them to isolate themselves until the virus passes. By limiting these households' ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity.","Barnett-Howell, Zachary; Watson, Oliver John; Mobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq",Trans.

322791,Balancing Risks and Benefits in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Examining CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses after primary Yellow Fever vaccination in a cohort of 210 volunteers, we have identified and tetramer-validated 92 CD8+ and 50 CD4+ T cell epitopes, many inducing strong and prevalent (i.e., immunodominant) T cell responses. Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4+ T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4+ T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4+ T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of (1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes, (2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, (3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and (4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes. We believe that future investigations of emerging pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) should include population-wide T cell epitope discovery using blood samples from patients, convalescents and/or long-term survivors, who might all hold important information on T cell epitopes and responses.","Stryhn, Anette; Kongsgaard, Michael; Rasmussen, Michael; Harndahl, Mikkel Nors; Østerbye, Thomas; Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Thybo, Søren; Gabriel, Mette; Hansen, Morten Bagge; Nielsen, Morten; Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard; Randrup Thomsen, Allan; Buus, Soren",Front Immunol,,179

The index is composed by eight dimensions of subjective well-being and is estimated relying on Twitter data by using human supervised sentiment analysis. The index is then compared with the analogous SWB-I index for Italy, in order to verify possible analogies and cultural differences. Further, through structural equation models, a causal assumption is tested to see whether the economic and health conditions of the country influence the well-being latent variable and how this latent dimension affects the SWB-J and SWB-I indicators. It turns out that, as expected, the economic and health welfare is only one aspect of the multidimensional well-being that is captured by the Twitter-based indicator.","Carpi, Tiziana; Hino, Airo; Iacus, Stefano Maria; Porro, Giuseppe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14372v1.pdf,179

The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the quality of care for patients with liver disease is still unknown. AIMS: The Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) conducted a survey to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on hepatology units activities in Italy. METHODS: A prospective web-based survey was proposed to all AISF active members. The survey was available online from April 8 2020, to May 3 2020, (lockdown phase in Italy). RESULTS: 194 AISF members answered the questionnaire, most of whom were specialists in Gastroenterology (41%) or Internal Medicine (28%), and worked in Northern Italy (51%). 26% of hepatology wards had been converted into COVID-19 wards, and 33% had bed reductions. All hepatological activities, including the management of patients with decompensated liver disease, liver transplant and HCC had been significantly reduced/stopped. The number of physicians answering that their practices had not been modified ranged between 0.6% (for chronic hepatitis) to 47% (for the execution of paracentesis). The recorded answers were consistent among different regions, and did not show any north-south gradient CONCLUSION: COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted on hepatological clinical activity. This survey can serve as a basis to compare the impact of future measures aimed at delivering an acceptable level of liver care during a national pandemic or crisis.","Aghemo, Alessio; Masarone, Mario; Montagnese, Sara; Petta, Salvatore; Ponziani, Francesca Romana; Russo, Francesco Paolo",Dig Liver Dis,,179
325535,COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: What is known about the unknown,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel zoonotic virus identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has crossed species and infected humans. In order to develop new insights on the immune-based treatments against this disease, it is vital to understand the immunopathology of the COVID-19, implications of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and immune dysfunction in response to SARS-CoV-2. There is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. It is, thus, promising to design immune-based treatments that inhibit the infectious mechanism of the virus, improve the inadequate immune response, or regulate the hyperactivated immune response in severely ill patients. According to the antiviral immune response against the virus, antibody-based immunotherapies of COVID-19 include injection of convalescent plasma from recovered patients, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), monoclonal antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies. Also, cell-based treatment, vaccine-based approaches, cytokine-based immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, decoy receptors, and immunosuppressive drugs are discussed in this chapter.","Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza; Jafari, Davood; Tahmasebi, Safa; Elahi, Reza; Khosh, Elnaz",Adv Exp Med Biol,,179

The hybrid deep learning model is designed as a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) and named as DeepSense method. It is designed as a series of layers to extract and classify the related features of COVID-19 infections from the lungs. The computerized tomography image is used as an input data, and hence, the classifier is designed to ease the process of classification on learning the multidimensional input data using the Expert Hidden layers. The validation of the model is conducted against the medical image datasets to predict the infections using deep learning classifiers. The results show that the DeepSense classifier offers accuracy in an improved manner than the conventional deep and machine learning classifiers. The proposed method is validated against three different datasets, where the training data are compared with 70%, 80%, and 90% training data. It specifically provides the quality of the diagnostic method adopted for the prediction of COVID-19 infections in a patient.","Khadidos, Adil; Khadidos, Alaa O; Kannan, Srihari; Natarajan, Yuvaraj; Mohanty, Sachi Nandan; Tsaramirsis, Georgios",Front Public Health,,179

AIM: To summarize the findings of a multinational observational cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in four countries (1 February 2020-16 June 2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). RESULTS: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort; 1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970-1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60 and 79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%; 1080/100,000 95%CI 920-1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%; 190/100,000 95%CI 130-280/100,000), and 3 with CVST (0.02%; 20/100,000, 95%CI 4-60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline stroke severity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p < 0.1: male sex, tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, and intracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63-15.44, p < 0.01), older age (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07-2.94, p = 0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98, p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients with stroke and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a small but significant risk of clinically relevant cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. The mortality rate is high for COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular complications; therefore, aggressive monitoring and early intervention should be pursued to mitigate poor outcomes.","Siegler, James E; Cardona, Pere; Arenillas, Juan F; Talavera, Blanca; Guillen, Ana N; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; de Lera, Mercedes; Khandelwal, Priyank; Bach, Ivo; Patel, Pratit; Singla, Amit; Requena, Manuel; Ribo, Marc; Jillella, Dinesh V; Rangaraju, Srikant; Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C; Vazquez, Alejandro R; Urra, Xabier; Chamorro, Ángel; Román, Luis S; Thon, Jesse M; Then, Ryna; Sanborn, Emma; de la Ossa, Natalia P; Millàn, Mònica; Ruiz, Isaac N; Mansour, Ossama Y; Megahed, Mohammed; Tiu, Cristina; Terecoasa, Elena O; Radu, Razvan A; Nguyen, Thanh N; Curiale, Gioacchino; Kaliaev, Artem; Czap, Alexandra L; Sebaugh, Jacob; Zha, Alicia M; Liebeskind, David S; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Farooqui, Mudassir; Hassan, Ameer E; Preston, Laurie; Patterson, Mary S; Bushnaq, Saif; Zaidat, Osama; Jovin, Tudor G",Int J Stroke,,179
326477,Impact of COVID-19 on Lung Allograft and Clinical Outcomes in Lung Transplant Recipients: A Case-Control Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Disparities were marked in previous pandemics, usually with higher attack rates reported for those in lower socioeconomic positions and for ethnic minorities. METHODS: We examined characteristics of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, assessed associations between incidence and population-level characteristics at the level of small geographic areas, and evaluated relations between socioeconomics and work-from-home (WFH) arrangements. RESULTS: The largest source of COVID-19 importations switched from students studying overseas in the second wave to foreign domestic helpers in the third. The local cases were mostly individuals not in formal employment (retirees and homemakers) and production workers who were unable to WFH. For every 10% increase in the proportion of population employed as executives or professionals in a given geographic region, there was an 84% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1% to 97%) reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 during the third wave. In contrast, in the first two waves, the same was associated with 3.69 times (95% CI: 1.02 to 13.33) higher incidence. Executives and professionals were more likely to implement WFH and experienced frequent changes in WFH practice, compared to production workers. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings on the reversed socioeconomic patterning of COVID-19 burden between infection waves in Hong Kong at both individual and population level analyses indicated that risks of infections may be related to occupations involving high exposure frequency and WFH flexibility. Contextual determinants should be taken into account in policy planning aiming at mitigating such disparities.","Yang, Bingyi; Wu, Peng; Lau, Eric H Y; Wong, Jessica Y; Ho, Faith; Gao, Huizhi; Xiao, Jingyi; Adam, Dillon C; Ng, Tiffany W Y; Quan, Jianchao; Tsang, Tim K; Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J; Leung, Gabriel M",Clin. infect. dis,,179

Purpose of this paper is to investigate and prioritize the factors that are responsible for supply chain vulnerability. Extant literature review and interviews with the experts helped to extract 26 supply chain vulnerability factors. Further, the relative criticality of vulnerability factors is assessed by analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Critical part supplier; location of supplier; long supply chain lead times; Fixing process owners and mis-aligned incentives in supply chain are identified as the most critical factors among twenty-six vulnerability factors. Research concludes that not only long and complex supply chain but supply chain practices adopted by firms also increase supply chain vulnerability. Relative assessment of vulnerability factors enables professionals to take appropriate mitigation strategies to make the supply chains more robust. This research adds in building a model for vulnerability factors that are internal to supply chain & controllable.","Sharma, Satyendra Kumar; Srivastava, Praveen Ranjan; Kumar, Ajay; Jindal, Anil; Gupta, Shivam",Ann Oper Res,,179

A major concern for neurologists worldwide is the course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with MS treated with different DMTs. Although initial studies do not suggest an unfavourable course of infection in this group of patients, the data is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 396 MS patients treated with DMTs and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 28 Polish MS centres. Information concerning patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course of MS, current DMT use, as well as symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for pharmacotherapy, oxygen therapy, and/or hospitalisation, and short-term outcomes was collected up to 30 January 2021. Additional data about COVID-19 cases in the general population in Poland was obtained from official reports of the Polish Ministry of Health. RESULTS: There were 114 males (28.8%) and 282 females (71.2%). The median age was 39 years (IQR 13). The great majority of patients with MS exhibited relapsing-remitting course (372 patients; 93.9%). The median EDSS was 2 (SD 1.38), and the mean disease duration was 8.95 (IQR 8) years. Most of the MS patients were treated with dimethyl fumarate (164; 41.41%). Other DMTs were less frequently used: interferon beta (82; 20.70%), glatiramer acetate (42; 10.60%), natalizumab (35;8.84%), teriflunomide (25; 6.31%), ocrelizumab (20; 5.05%), fingolimod (16; 4.04), cladribine (5; 1.26%), mitoxantrone (3; 0.76%), ozanimod (3; 0.76%), and alemtuzumab (1; 0.25%). The overall hospitalisation rate due to COVID-19 in the cohort was 6.81% (27 patients). Only one patient (0.3%) died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and three (0.76%) patients were treated with mechanical ventilation; 106 (26.8%) patients had at least one comorbid condition. There were no significant differences in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection regarding patient age, duration of the disease, degree of disability (EDSS), lymphocyte count, or type of DMT used. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Most MS patients included in this study had a favourable course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hospitalisation rate and the mortality rate were not higher in the MS cohort compared to the general Polish population. Continued multicentre data collection is needed to increase the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection impact on the course of MS in patients treated with DMTs.","Czarnowska, Agata; Brola, Waldemar; Zajkowska, Olga; Rusek, Stanislaw; Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Kalinowska-Lyszczarz, Alicja; Kania, Karolina; Slowik, Agnieszka; Wnuk, Marcin; Marona, Monika; Podlecka-Pietowska, Aleksandra; Nojszewska, Monika; Zakrzewska-Pniewska, Beata; Jasinska, Elzbieta; Goluch, Katarzyna; Lech, Beata; Noga, Magdalena; Perenc, Adam; Popiel, Malgorzata; Lasek-Bal, Anetta; Puz, Przemyslaw; Maciejowska, Katarzyna; Kucharska-Lipowska, Marta; Lipowski, Michal; Kapica-Topczewska, Katarzyna; Chorazy, Monika; Tarasiuk, Joanna; Kochanowicz, Jan; Kulikowska, Joanna; Wawrzyniak, Slawomir; Niezgodzinska-Maciejek, Anna; Pokryszko-Dragan, Anna; Gruszka, Ewa; Budrewicz, Slawomir; Bialek, Marta; Kurkowska-Jastrzebska, Iwona; Kurowska, Katarzyna; Stepien, Adam; Wlodek, Agata; Ptasznik, Violetta; Pawelczyk, Malgorzata; Sobolewski, Piotr; Lejmel, Henryka; Strzalinska, Katarzyna; Maciejowski, Maciej; Tutaj, Andrzej; Zwiernik, Jacek; Litwin, Anna; Lewanczyk, Bozena",Neurol Neurochir Pol,,179

332381,Ischemic stroke and purpuric dermatitis as COVID-19-related complications in a peritoneal dialysis patient,2020,"Importance: Patient perceptions regarding the risks of obtaining in-person ophthalmic care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may affect adherence to recommended treatment plans and influence visual outcomes. A deeper understanding of patient perspectives will inform strategies to optimize adherence with vision-preserving therapies. Objective: To evaluate perceptions of COVID-19 exposure risk and their association with appointment attendance among patients at high risk of both reversible and irreversible vision loss from lapses in care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study included a nonvalidated telephone survey designed in April and May of 2020 and a retrospective medical record review conducted in parallel with survey administration from May 22 to August 18, 2020. Participants were recruited from 2 tertiary eye care centers (Emory Eye Center in Atlanta, Georgia, and W.K. Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan). The study included a random sample of patients with diagnoses of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic retinopathy (DR) who received an intravitreal injection between January 6 and March 13, 2020, and were scheduled for a second injection between March 13 and May 6, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between perceptions regarding COVID-19 risks and loss to follow-up. Results: Of 1004 eligible patients, 423 (42%) were successfully contacted, and 348 (82%) agreed to participate (participants' mean [SD] age, 75 [12] years; 195 women [56%]; 287 White [82%] patients). Respondents had a mean (SD) of 2.7 (1.1) comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, and 77 (22%) knew someone with COVID-19. Of all respondents, 163 (47%) were very concerned or moderately concerned about vision loss from missed treatments during the pandemic. Although 208 (60%) believed the COVID-19 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exposure at the eye clinic was extremely unlikely or unlikely, 49 (14%) believed it was extremely likely or likely. Seventy-eight participants (22%) were lost to follow-up. Concern regarding COVID-19 exposure during clinic visits (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.4) and diagnosis of DR (vs AMD) (OR, 8.130; 95% CI, 3.367-20.408) were associated with an increase in likelihood of loss to follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients at high risk for vision loss from lapses in care, many expressed concerns regarding the effect of the pandemic on their ability to receive timely care. Survey results suggest that fear of SARS-CoV-2 exposure was associated with a roughly 4-fold increase in the odds of patient loss to follow-up. These results support the potential importance of clearly conveying infection-control measures.","Lindeke-Myers, Aaron; Zhao, Peter Yu Cheng; Meyer, Benjamin I; Liu, Elaine A; Levine, David A; Bennett, Olivia M; Ji, Sunjong; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Rao, Rajesh C; Jain, Nieraj",JAMA Ophthalmol,,179
333484,COVID-19 and the Renin-Angiotensin System,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced the modification of surgical practice worldwide. Medical centers have been adapted to provide an efficient arrangement of their economic and human resources. Although neurosurgeons are not in the first line of management and treatment of COVID-19 patients, they take care of patients with neurological pathology and potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, the authors describe their institutional actions against the pandemic and compare these actions with those in peer-reviewed publications. METHODS: The authors conducted a search using the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases from the beginning of the pandemic until July 11, 2020, using the following terms: ""Neurosurgery,"" ""COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2,"" ""reconversion/modification,"" ""practice,"" ""academy,"" and ""teaching."" Then, they created operational guidelines tailored for their institution to maximize resource efficiency and minimize risk for the healthcare personnel. RESULTS: According to the reviewed literature, the authors defined the following three changes that have had the greatest impact in neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) changes in clinical practices; 2) changes in the medical care setting, including modifications of perioperative care; and 3) changes in the academic teaching methodology. CONCLUSIONS: The Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía ""Manuel Velasco Suárez"" is one of the major referral centers for treating highly complex neurosurgical pathologies in Mexico. Its clinical and neurosurgical practices have been modified with the implementation of specific interventions against the spread of COVID-19. These practical and simple actions are remarkably relevant in the context of the pandemic and can be adopted and suited by other healthcare centers according to their available resources to better prepare for the next event.","Díaz-Bello, Sergio; Hernández-Hernández, Alan; Guinto-Nishimura, Gerardo Y; Mondragón-Soto, Michel G; Lem-Carrillo, Monica; González-Aguilar, Alberto; Calleja-Castillo, Juan M; Leyva-Rendón, Adolfo; León-Ortiz, Pablo; Chávez-Piña, Carmen M; Pando-Tarín, Gustavo A; Mejía-Pérez, Sonia I; Taboada-Barajas, Jesús; Zavala-Álvarez, Elsa D; Soto-Hernández, José L; Cárdenas, Graciela; Gómez-Amador, Juan L",Neurosurg Focus,,179

The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is still unclear. Except for the initial status and the imported cases, the isolation measures and the medical treatments of the infected patients have essential influences on the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission involving the interactive effect of various factors for the infected people, including imported cases, isolating rate, diagnostic rate, recovery rate and also the mortality rate. Under the assumption that the random incubation period, the cure period and the diagnosis period are subject to the Weibull distribution, the quantity of daily existing infected people is finally governed by a linear integral-differential equation with convolution kernel. Based on the asymptotic behavior and the quantitative analysis on the model, we rigorously prove that, for limited external input patients, both the quantity of infected patients and its variation ratio will finally tend to zero, if the infected patients are sufficiently isolated or the infection rate is small enough. Finally, numerical performances for the proposed model as well as the comparisons between our simulations and the clinical data of the city Wuhan and Italy are demonstrated, showing the validity of our model with suitably specified model parameters.","Liu, Jijun; Wang, Liyan; Zhang, Qiang; Yau, Shing-Tung",Applied mathematical modelling,,179

People working inside airports face every day challenges and difficulties that not insiders cannot even imagine, but which have to be considered in strategic training projects, where people has to be placed at the centre of the training action. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The GHA project (Genius Handling and Academy) was born with the aim of increasing the quality of the professional commitment made by airport professionals, preparing them to adequately face not only the technical-operational challenges but also the psychological ones underlying a complex and particular environment. such as the airport one. The year 2018 has been the starting point of this training project, the bettering of professional qualification has been the goal during the year 2019, up to the first part of 2020 (March). The headquarters of the pilot project was the 'Leonardo Da Vinci' Rome International Airport. The sample was composed by 25 employees of the 'Genius Handling' , a company operating inside the airport. RESULTS: The results collected at the end of the training period recorded a 37% increase in the quality of professional performance compared to the previous period in which no training activity was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: When the airport world had to stop in order to take the restrictive measures for containing contagion, the importance of the airport reality in everyone's economic and professional life has become immediately evident. So, it has become even more urgent to work in implementation and encouraging research and experimentation, with the aim not only to promote the well-being of people who are in transit, but of its 'permanent residents' as well, that is, people who spend their working days there.","Spurio, Maria Grazia",Psychiatr Danub,,179

This study aims to explore the role of mitochondrial genomic variations in ischemic stroke, and to uncover the nuclear genes involved in this relationship. Eight hundred and thirty Taiwanese patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 966 normal controls were genotyped for their mitochondrial haplogroup (Mthapg). Cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) harboring different Mthapgs were used to observe functional differences under hypoxia-ischemia. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was conducted to identify the particularly elevated mRNA. The patient study identified an association between Mthapg F1 and risk of ischemic stroke (OR 1.72:1.27-2.34, p = 0.001). The cellular study further demonstrated an impeded induction of hypoxic inducible factor 1&#945; in the Mthapg F1 cybrid after hypoxia-ischemia. Additionally, the study demonstrated that Mthapg F cybrids were associated with an altered mitochondrial function, including decreased oxygen consumption, higher mitochondrial ROS production, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Mthapg F cybrids were also noted to be prone to inflammation, with increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines and elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9. The RNASeq identified significantly elevated expressions of angiopoietin-like 4 in Mthapg F1 cybrids after hypoxia-ischemia.

340210,COVID-19 presenting with immune thrombocytopenia: A case report and review of the literature,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multifaceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a ""mental health tsunami"", the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remain unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to provide insights regarding people's psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. METHODS: We obtained about 60 million Twitter streaming posts originating from the United States from March 24 to May 24, 2020, and compared these with about 40 million posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people's social media self-disclosure. Using these data sets, we studied people's self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employed transfer learning classifiers that identified the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examined the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 data sets. RESULTS: We found that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis-mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by about 14%, and support expressions have increased by about 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observed a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlighted that people express concerns that are specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people's mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their ""new normal."" Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, health care and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This study shows the potential to provide insights to mental health care and stakeholders and policy makers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amid the health crisis.","Saha, Koustuv; Torous, John; Caine, Eric D; De Choudhury, Munmun",J Med Internet Res,,179

Une asthénie persistante a été rapportée par 73,2 % des cas, trois patients ont été hospitalisés. L’évolution a été favorable pour tous. Le pic épidémique a été observé le 16 septembre. Conclusion Nous rapportons ici la première épidémie de fièvre à OROV décrite dans un territoire ultra marin français. C’est un Orthobunyavirus transmis par les arthropodes, notamment les culicoides. Vecteurs et hôtes (singes, paresseux) sont tous deux présents de ce territoire. Le taux d’attaque élevé pourrait s’expliquer par les conséquences indirectes de la pandémie COVID-19 : majoration de l’isolement du village du fait des mesures de restriction de déplacement, diminution de la présence de l’armée occasionnant une augmentation du nombre d’orpailleurs illégaux en transit (origine de l’importation d’OROV ?). Des informations sanitaires ont été transmises à la population et aux autorités locales. Des mesures de lutte anti-vectorielle ont été mises en oeuvre après la réalisation d’enquêtes entomologiques. La présence de Culex sur le littoral de ce territoire et l’expansion territoriale de l’OROV observée ces dernières années en Amérique du Sud appellent à la plus grande vigilance.","Epelboin, L.; Enfissi, A.; Perez, L.; Abboud, P.; Andrieu, A.; Prudhomme, J.; Jeanne, I.; Pichard, C.; Rousset, D.; Gaillet, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,,179
343519,Early experience with COVID-19 patients at academic hospital in Southwestern United States,2020,"This paper introduces new methods to analyze the changing progression of COVID-19 cases to deaths in different waves of the pandemic. First, an algorithmic approach partitions each country or state's COVID-19 time series into a first wave and subsequent period. Next, offsets between case and death time series are learned for each country via a normalized inner product. Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries have most substantially reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19. Finally, our paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths for European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception that the mortality rate has greatly decreased throughout Europe during its second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate a bifurcation in which wealthier Western European countries have managed their mortality rate more successfully. A similar distinction exists in the United States, where Northeastern states have been the most successful in the country.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Radchenko, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13197v1.pdf,179

343840,Two Cases of Spontaneous Bleeding in Lung Transplant Recipients Treated with Systemic Anticoagulation for COVID-19,2021,"CONTEXT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused increased interest in the application of telehealth to provide care without exposing patients and physicians to the risk of contagion. The urological literature on the topic is sparse. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the literature and evaluate all the available studies on urological applications of telehealth. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: After registration on PROSPERO, we searched PubMed and Scopus databases to collect any kind of studies evaluating any telehealth interventions in any urological conditions. The National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies was used to estimate the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis was performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 45 studies (11 concerning prostate cancer [PCa], three hematuria management, six urinary stones, 14 urinary incontinence [UI], five urinary tract infections [UTIs], and six other conditions), including 12 randomized controlled trials. The available literature indicates that telemedicine has been implemented successfully in several common clinical scenarios, including the decision-making process following a diagnosis of nonmetastatic PCa, follow-up care of patients with localized PCa after curative treatments, initial diagnosis of hematuria, management diagnosis and follow-up care of uncomplicated urinary stones and uncomplicated UTIs, and initial evaluation, behavioral therapies, and pelvic floor muscle training in UI patients, as well as follow-up care after surgical treatments of stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse. The methodological quality of most of the reports was good. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has been implemented successfully in selected patients with PCa, UI, pelvic organ prolapse, uncomplicated urinary stones, and UTIs. Many urological conditions are suitable for telehealth, but more studies are needed on other highly prevalent urological malignant and benign conditions. Likely, the COVID-19 pandemic will give a significant boost to the use of telemedicine. More robust data on long-term efficacy, safety, and health economics are necessary. PATIENT SUMMARY: The diffusion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections has recently increased the interest in telehealth, which is the adoption of telecommunication to deliver any health care activity. The available literature indicates that telemedicine has been adopted successfully in selected patients with several common clinical urological conditions, including prostate cancer, uncomplicated urinary stones, uncomplicated urinary infections, urinary incontinence, or pelvic organ prolapse. Likely, the COVID-19 pandemic will give a significant boost to the use of telemedicine, but more robust data on long-term efficacy, safety, and costs are necessary.","Novara, Giacomo; Checcucci, Enrico; Crestani, Alessandro; Abrate, Alberto; Esperto, Francesco; Pavan, Nicola; De Nunzio, Cosimo; Galfano, Antonio; Giannarini, Gianluca; Gregori, Andrea; Liguori, Giovanni; Bartoletti, Riccardo; Porpiglia, Francesco; Scarpa, Roberto Mario; Simonato, Alchiede; Trombetta, Carlo; Tubaro, Andrea; Ficarra, Vincenzo",Eur. urol,,179

345364,A 75-Year-Old Woman with COVID-19 Pneumonia and Wellens Syndrome Diagnosed by Electrocardiography,2021,"PURPOSE: The diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction is mainly based on psychophysical measurements. The aim of the current study was to investigate how well the olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can effectively distinguish between normosmic people and subjects with olfactory dysfunction. METHODS: Thirty-eight participants were recruited for the study. Group 1 consisted of 22 subjects with olfactory dysfunction (mean age = 44.3 years, SD = 18.6), and Group two consisted of 16 participants with normal olfactory function (mean age = 49.6 years, SD = 11.6). Olfactory functions were assessed in great detail for all participants, and brain activation in response to odorous stimulation was assessed using fMRI. RESULTS: The between-group comparison showed stronger odor induced brain activation of the primary olfactory area and the insular cortex among the normosmic group as compared to the dysosmic group. As indicated by the individual analysis, positive responses in the primary olfactory cortex were significantly higher in normosmic people (94%) than in subjects with olfactory dysfunction (41%). However, there was no association between individual fMRI parameters (including the percentage of BOLD signal change, activated cluster size and peak z value), and psychophysical olfactory test scores. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested the subjects could not be differentiated from normosmics based on their BOLD signal from the primary olfactory area, orbitofrontal cortex, or the insular cortex. CONCLUSION: There are large inter-individual variabilities for odor-induced brain activation among normosmic subjects and subjects with olfactory dysfunction, due to this variation, at present it appears problematic to diagnose olfactory dysfunction on an individual level using fMRI.","Yunpeng, Zang; Han, Pengfei; Joshi, Akshita; Hummel, Thomas",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,179
345443,Positive stool test suggests that the discharge standard of COVID-19 needs to be improved,2020,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial offshoots of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have extended to body dissatisfaction, especially among women. Factors such as increased social media exposure, weight gain memes, and peer conversations about appearance during lockdown might be the potential contributing factors, which need further exploration. The study examined the contribution of 'fat talk' and societal influences in determining body dissatisfaction among Indian women. The likely content of the 'fat talk' during the lockdown was also analyzed. METHODS: The study followed a cross-sectional online based design. Participants comprised of 265 women, aged 15 to 50 years. The Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ-8c), Sociocultural Attitudes toward Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ-3), and Negative Body Talk Scale were used to measure body satisfaction, societal influences, and fat talk respectively. Further, participants were asked to respond to a friend's comment about her supposed weight gain in the pandemic (fat talk). RESULTS: Fat talk, social influence, weight, and age were significantly correlated with body dissatisfaction. Multiple Regression models indicated that fat talk, social influence, weight, and age accounted for 53.33% of the variance in body satisfaction. Thematic analysis of responses to fat-talk conversations revealed two dominant themes: focus on exercise and diet, as well as acknowledging weight gain and normalizing it in the context of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Fat talk amongst peers, societal influence and body-image stereotypes were the most potent contributors in determining body dissatisfaction among Indian women during the pandemic, which can contribute to significant dysfunction. These factors need addressal in the socio-cultural context through health campaigns, interpersonal strategies, and more positive and constructive forms of weight and body image-related communication.","Ahuja, Kanika K; Khandelwal, Ananya; Banerjee, Debanjan",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,179
345556,364 Branded Beef Program Response to COVID-19,2020,"Vaccine-mediated immunity often relies on the generation of protective antibodies and memory B cells, which commonly stem from germinal center (GC) reactions. An in-depth comparison of the GC responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in healthy and immunocompromised individuals has not yet been performed due to the challenge of directly probing human lymph nodes. In this study, through a fine-needle-aspiration-based approach, we profiled the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in lymph nodes of healthy individuals and kidney transplant (KTX) recipients. We found that, unlike healthy subjects, KTX recipients presented deeply blunted SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses coupled with severely hindered T follicular helper cells, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-domain-specific memory B cells and neutralizing antibodies. KTX recipients also displayed reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell frequencies. Broadly, these data indicate impaired GC-derived immunity in immunocompromised individuals, and suggest a GC-origin for certain humoral and memory B cell responses following mRNA vaccination.","Lederer, Katlyn; Parvathaneni, Kalpana; Painter, Mark M; Bettini, Emily; Agarwal, Divyansh; Lundgreen, Kendall A; Weirick, Madison; Goel, Rishi R; Xu, Xiaoming; Drapeau, Elizabeth M; Gouma, Sigrid; Greenplate, Allison R; Coz, Carole Le; Romberg, Neil; Jones, Lisa; Rosen, Mark; Besharatian, Behdad; Kaminiski, Mary; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Hensley, Scott E; Bates, Paul; Wherry, E John; Naji, Ali; Bhoj, Vijay; Locci, Michela",,,179

It has affected most countries of the world, including India. Both the disease and the unavoidable national response to it have posed unique challenges to our health-care system. A particular vulnerable group of patients is those with opioid dependence maintained on opioid substitution therapy (OST). These patients are pharmacologically dependent on the OST medication (buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone combination [BNX], and methadone) for their healthy functioning and recovery. COVID-19 outbreak, lock-down, and difficult access to medical care, all are likely to induce stress and withdrawal, which is a potential risk for relapse among individuals with opioid dependence, who are anyway more vulnerable due to social, housing, living, and medical conditions. In this context, it is essential to re-strategize the existing OST services to adapt to the challenging circumstances. In this communication, we share our experience and formulate interim standard operating procedures (SOPs) for running a hospital-based OST service utilizing take-home BNX. The challenges, principles to meet the challenges, and interim SOPs are shared as being currently practiced in our center. Individual institutes, agencies, hospitals, and clinics running OST service with BNX can adapt these SOPs according to their characteristics, needs, demand, and resources; so long as, the basic principles are adhered to.","Basu, Debasish; Ghosh, Abhishek; Subodh, B.

METHODS: Descriptive and analytical observational retrospective study of all emergency consultations between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020, carried out by the Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Department of a tertiary university hospital. The adequacy of consultations was assessed with the Hospital Emergency Suitability Protocol (HESP). The correlation between the emergencies and the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases was assessed with a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Although there was a decrease of almost 50% in ENT-ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19, the pattern of most cases remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 era: non-urgent consultations, not previously assessed by Primary Care (PC), being considered inadequate by the HESP. The three main reasons for consultation were otalgia, odynophagia, and epistaxis. The number of ENT-ED visits and the total number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the health area were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was a challenge for the Spanish health system. The critical epidemiological situation experienced during March, April, and May explains the reduction in the number of visits to the ENT-ED. However, this condition did not affect the predominant pattern of visits with respect to the pre-COVID-19 era, which were mostly inadequate.

353539,Cyclophosphamide plus etoposide is a safe and effective mobilization regimen in patients with multiple myeloma,2021,"Background: Numerous successful therapies developed for human medicine involve animal experimentation. Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury. Methods: Nineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups. Results: Compared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2/FiO 2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury. Conclusions: These novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.","Chemonges, Saul",F1000Res,,179

This assertion was based on the existing conditions in sub-Saharan Africa that exposed the region to the dire consequences of the pandemic. Previously existing underlying conditions that affected the food system include a high dependence on trade for inputs supply, the adverse effects of climate change, crop pests and diseases, poverty, low input use, weak institutions and ineffective policies, and insecurity and conflicts. We collected data from farmers, aggregators, bean research coordinators, and urban and peri-urban consumers in five Eastern African countries in order to describe the immediate impacts of the pandemic on the bean value chain. Access to seed and labor appear to be the most critical impacts of the pandemic on bean production. There are observable differences in patterns and frequency of bean consumption in these regions, suggesting that the effect of the pandemic depends on the level of implementation of containment measures and pre-COVID-19 underlying conditions that affect the food systems. In the mid to long-term, the pandemic may disrupt food systems, resulting in hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity. Thus, governments should support farmers and businesses in becoming resilient to exogenous shocks through increased efficiency in supply chains, capacity building, and the adoption of modern digital technology.","Nchanji, E.; Lutomia, C.

Furthermore, a new mathematical model is developed to determine an appropriate seat layout for groups. The proposed seating layout is based on the idea that group members are allowed to have close contact and that groups should have a distance among each other. The sum of individual transmission rates is taken as the objective function to derive scenarios with a low level transmission risk. After the determination of an appropriate seat layout, the cellular automata is used to derive and evaluate a corresponding boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. We find that the consideration of groups in a pandemic scenario will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%), which reaches the level of boarding times in pre-pandemic scenarios.","Schultz, Michael; Soolaki, Majid",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.16021v1.pdf,179

The globally interconnected system of tourism mobility is modeled as a complex network, where two main stages in the temporal spread of COVID-19 are revealed and defined by the cutting-point of the 44th day from Wuhan. The first stage describes the outbreak in Asia and North America, the second one in Europe, South America, and Africa, while the outbreak in Oceania is spread along both stages. The analysis shows that highly connected nodes in the global tourism network (GTN) are infected early by the pandemic, while nodes of lower connectivity are late infected. Moreover, countries with the same network centrality as China were early infected on average by COVID-19. The paper also finds that network interconnectedness, economic openness, and transport integration are key determinants in the early global spread of the pandemic, and it reveals that the spatio-temporal patterns of the worldwide spread of COVID-19 are more a matter of network interconnectivity than of spatial proximity.","Tsiotas, Dimitrios; Tselios, Vassilis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11036v1.pdf,179

Thorough disinfection of the ward environment was subsequently performed, after which these surfaces in the isolation wards tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings remind us that the contaminated environment in the wards may become potential infectious resources and that despite a long time from exposure, the thorough disinfection in the COVID-10 units after is still necessary.","Zhou, Yunyun; Zeng, Yuyang; Chen, Changzheng",Int J Infect Dis,,179

Over 20 international researchers in the field of ageing have contributed to this document. This commentary discusses how older people are misrepresented and undervalued in the current public discourse surrounding the pandemic. It points to issues in documenting the deaths of older adults, the lack of preparation for such a crisis in long-term care homes, how some 'protective' policies can be considered patronising and how the initial perception of the public was that the virus was really an older adult problem. This commentary also calls attention to important intergenerational solidarity that has occurred during this crisis to ensure support and social-inclusion of older adults, even at a distance. Our hope is that with this commentary we can contribute to the discourse on older adults during this pandemic and diminish the ageist attitudes that have circulated.","Fraser, Sarah; Lagacé, Martine; Bongué, Bienvenu; Ndeye, Ndatté; Guyot, Jessica; Bechard, Lauren; Garcia, Linda; Taler, Vanessa; Adam, Stéphane; Beaulieu, Marie; Bergeron, Caroline D; Boudjemadi, Valérian; Desmette, Donatienne; Donizzetti, Anna Rosa; Éthier, Sophie; Garon, Suzanne; Gillis, Margaret; Levasseur, Mélanie; Lortie-Lussier, Monique; Marier, Patrik; Robitaille, Annie; Sawchuk, Kim; Lafontaine, Constance; Tougas, Francine",Age Ageing,,179

The neutralization activity of plasma from patients with COVID-19 decreases rapidly during the first weeks after recovery. However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we select plasma from a cohort of convalescent patients with COVID-19 and selectively deplete immunoglobulin A, M, or G before testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We find that depletion of immunoglobulin M is associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization, followed by immunoglobulin G. This observation may help design efficient antibody-based COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of immunoglobulin M (IgM).","Gasser, Romain; Cloutier, Marc; Prévost, Jérémie; Fink, Corby; Ducas, Éric; Ding, Shilei; Dussault, Nathalie; Landry, Patricia; Tremblay, Tony; Laforce-Lavoie, Audrey; Lewin, Antoine; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Laumaea, Annemarie; Medjahed, Halima; Larochelle, Catherine; Richard, Jonathan; Dekaban, Gregory A; Dikeakos, Jimmy D; Bazin, Renée; Finzi, Andrés",Cell Rep,,179

The laboratory data includes blood routine, liver and renal function, myocardial infarction tests, coagulation function, inflammatory factors, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, procalcitonin etc. The patients were divided into two groups according to cardiac troponin I（TNI）34.2 ug/L. The differences of general conditions and laboratory data between the two groups were compared. Besides, the correlation between coagulation function and coagulation function, and the ROC curve of D-dimer in AMI were conducted .ResultsAmong the 133 patients, 9 (6.77%) had cTnI greater than 34.2 μg/L, and 124 (93.23%) had normal cTnI. There were significant differences between the two groups in age, COPD history, blood routine (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count), myoglobin, liver function (direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin), cytokines (IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α), coagulation function (PT, PTA, D-dimer). D-dimer level was positively correlated with TnI, CK-MB and myoglobin levels. The cut off value of D-dimer was 2.35 μg/ml in acute myocardial injury.ConclusionAcute myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients may be related to coagulation dysfunction. Therefore, monitoring of coagulation function dynamically, screening of thrombus and starting anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy timely help to reduce acute myocardial injury.","Ying, XU; XIE, Dan; QIAN, Ya-jun; Wen-kui, YU; TANG, Jian",Journal of Medical Postgraduates,,179

In this setting, the virus' basic reproductive number R_0, which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each primary case, takes on a significant importance in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic. Yet, in most models, R_0 is assumed to be a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations -- thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable. Considering its expected value thus leads to biased or loose results in the reported predictive scenarios, especially as these are tailored to a given country or region. The goal of this paper is the examination of the impact of the reproductive number R's variability on important output metrics, and the percolation of this variability in projected scenarios so as to provide uncertainty quantification. In this perspective, instead of considering a single R_0, we consider a distribution of reproductive numbers R and devise a simple Bayesian hierarchical model that builds upon current methods for estimating the R to integrate its heterogeneity. We then simulate the spread of the epidemic, and the impact of different social distancing strategies using a probabilistic framework that models hospital occupancy. This shows the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results. We emphasize that our goal is not to replace benchmark methods for estimating the basic reproductive numbers, but rather to discuss the importance of the impact of R's heterogeneity on uncertainty quantification for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Donnat, Claire; Holmes, Susan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05272v1.pdf,179

This article focuses on the rapid detection of COVID-19. We propose an ensemble deep learning model for novel COVID-19 detection from CT images. 2933 lung CT images from COVID-19 patients were obtained from previous publications, authoritative media reports, and public databases. The images were preprocessed to obtain 2500 high-quality images. 2500 CT images of lung tumor and 2500 from normal lung were obtained from a hospital. Transfer learning was used to initialize model parameters and pretrain three deep convolutional neural network models: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet. These models were used for feature extraction on all images. Softmax was used as the classification algorithm of the fully connected layer. The ensemble classifier EDL-COVID was obtained via relative majority voting. Finally, the ensemble classifier was compared with three component classifiers to evaluate accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F value, and Matthews correlation coefficient. The results showed that the overall classification performance of the ensemble model was better than that of the component classifier. The evaluation indexes were also higher. This algorithm can better meet the rapid detection requirements of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.","Zhou, Tao; Lu, Huiling; Yang, Zaoli; Qiu, Shi; Huo, Bingqiang; Dong, Yali",Appl Soft Comput,,179

We investigated the effect of the deficient and excessive VitD on emotion, behavior and attention. METHODS: 351 preschool children in a multicenter study in Shanghai, China that had serum 25(OH)D measurements and emotion, behavior and attention measures were included in the analyses. In animal experiments, C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): control (C) group, VitD deficiency (VDD) group, and VitD overdose (VDO) group. The emotion, behavior and attention of juvenile mice were evaluated through the behavioral experiments. RESULTS: There was an ""U"" relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and emotion, behavior and attention. Compared with 20-40 ng/mL group, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.5 (1.0, 4.8) for emotional problem, 3.8 (1.2, 12.1) for conduct problem and 1.8 (1.1, 5.7) for inattention in <20 ng/mL group. Meanwhile, compared with 20-40 ng/mL group, ORs were 9.5 (2.9, 31.4) for impulsive hyperactivity, and 3.9 (1.2, 12.9) for conduct problem in >40 ng/mL group. Consistent with the results in children, animal experiments showed that the attention level decreased in VDD group, while the anxiety level, hyperactive level and aggressiveness in VDD group and VDO group were significantly increased, respectively. LIMITATIONS: 25(OH)D measurements were only available in one season. CONCLUSION: The deficient and excessive VitD status both adversely affected children's emotion, behavior and attention.","Wang, Xirui; Jiao, Xianting; Xu, Mingqing; Wang, Bin; Li, Juan; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Lishan; Xu, Lei; Yu, Xiaodan",J Affect Disord,,179

CoVID-19 arrived and acted as an unexpected experiment in nature, catalyzing telemedicine's widespread implementation across many disciplines of medicine. The arrival of CoVID-19 in Ireland gave us the opportunity to record these perceptions pre- and post-CoVID. Data were extracted from the National Epilepsy Electronic Patient Record (EEPR). Power BI Analytics collated data from two epilepsy centers in Dublin. Analysis of data on reasons for using the telephone support line was conducted. A subset of patients and clinicians who attended virtual encounters over both periods were asked for their perception of telemedicine care through a mixed methods survey. Between 23rd December 2019 and 23rd March 2020 (pre-CoVID era), a total of 1180 patients were seen in 1653 clinical encounters. As part of a telemedicine pilot study, 50 of these encounters were scheduled virtual telephone appointments. Twenty eight surveys were completed by clinicians and 18 by patients during that period. From 24th March 2020 to 24th June 2020, 1164 patients were seen in 1693 encounters of which 729 (63%) patients were seen in 748 scheduled virtual encounters. 118 clinician impressions were captured through an online survey and 75 patients or carers completed a telephone survey during the post-CoVID era. There was no backlog of appointments or loss of care continuity forced by the pandemic. Clinicians expressed strong levels of satisfaction, but some doubted the suitability of new patients to the service or candidates for surgery receiving care via telemedicine. Patients reported positive experiences surrounding telephone appointments comparing them favorably to face-to-face encounters. The availability of a shared EEPR demonstrated no loss of care contact for patients with epilepsy. The survey showed that telemedicine is seen as an effective and satisfactory method of delivering chronic outpatient care.","Banks, Jack; Corrigan, Derek; Grogan, Roger; El-Naggar, Hany; White, Máire; Doran, Elisabeth; Synnott, Cara; Fitzsimons, Mary; Delanty, Norman; Doherty, Colin P",Epilepsy Behav,,179

We propose a mixed approach, leveraging on embeddings technique in NLP to train classifiers with article metadata (title, abstract, keywords in particular) labelled with the journal-level classification FoR (Fields of Research) and then apply these classifiers at the article level. We use this approach in the context of biomedical publications using metadata from Pubmed. Fasttext classifiers are trained with FoR codes and used to classify publications based on their available metadata. Results show that using a stratification sampling strategy for training help reduce the bias due to unbalanced field distribution.

Lungs are the first, and often the most affected organ by SARS-CoV-2; viral infection involves and damages both epithelial and vascular compartments, sometimes leading to severe and even fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Histopathological findings, mainly from postmortem examination of COVID-19 deceased patients, have been increasingly published in the last few months, helping to elucidate the sequence of events resulting in organ injury, and the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of this novel disease. A multidisciplinary approach to autopsy, including light microscopy examination along with the detection of viral proteins and/or RNA in tissue samples through ancillary techniques, provided crucial information on the mechanisms underlying the often-heterogeneous clinical picture of COVID-19.","Sanguedolce, Francesca; Zanelli, Magda; Ascani, Stefano; Zizzo, Maurizio; Tortorella, Simona; Soriano, Alessandra; Cavazza, Alberto; Sollitto, Francesco; Loizzi, Domenico",Panminerva med,,179
377481,Traditional Indian practices: Time to revisit and re-adopt for a healthier lifestyle,2020,"A promising route for revealing the existence of dark matter structures on mass scales smaller than the faintest galaxies is through their effect on strong gravitational lenses. We examine the role of local, lens-proximate clustering in boosting the lensing probability relative to contributions from substructure and unclustered line-of-sight (LOS) halos. Using two cosmological simulations that can resolve halo masses of $M_{\rm halo} \simeq 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ (in a simulation box of length $L_{\rm box}{\sim}100\,{\rm Mpc}$) and $10^{7}\ M_{\odot}$ ($L_{\rm box}\sim20\,{\rm Mpc}$), we demonstrate that clustering in the vicinity of the lens host produces a clear enhancement relative to an assumption of unclustered halos that persists to $>20\,R_{\rm vir}$. This enhancement exceeds estimates that use a two-halo term to account for clustering, particularly within $2-5\,R_{\rm vir}$. We provide an analytic expression for this excess, clustered contribution. We find that local clustering boosts the expected count of $10^9 \ M_\odot$ perturbing halos by ${\sim}35\%$ compared to substructure alone, a result that will significantly enhance expected signals for low-redshift ($z_l \simeq 0.2$) lenses, where substructure contributes substantially compared to LOS halos. We also find that the orientation of the lens with respect to the line of sight (e.g., whether the line of sight passes through the major axis of the lens) can also have a significant effect on the lensing signal, boosting counts by an additional $\sim 50\%$ compared to a random orientations.","Lazar, Alexandres; Bullock, James S.; Boylan-Kolchin, Michael; Feldmann, Robert; cCatmabacak, Onur; Moustakas, Leonidas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03958v1.pdf,179

379757,The Spectrum of Histopathologic Findings in Lungs of Patients with Fatal COVID-19 Infection,2020,"Since the first reports of a coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, scientists are working around the clock to find sound answers to the issue of its origin. While the number of scientific articles on SARS-CoV-2 is increasing, there are still many gaps as to its origin. All studies failed to find a coronavirus in other animals that is more similar to human SARS-COV2 than the bat virus, considered to be the primary reservoir. In this paper we address a new hypothesis, based on a possible recombination between a DNA and SARS-CoV viruses, to explain the rise of SRAS-CoV-2. By comparing SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs with circoviruses (CVs), we found strong sequence similarity of the genomic region at the 3-end of Bat-CoV ORF1a and the origin of replication (Ori) of porcine CV type 2 (PCV2), as well as similar RNA secondary structures of the region encompassing the cleavage site of CoV S gene with the PCV2 Ori. This constitutes a primary evidence that supports a possible recombination, which occurrence might explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2.","Abid, Nabil; Chillemi, Giovanni; Rebai, Ahmed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00531v1.pdf,179

380866,COVID-19 Related Stress among Lung Transplant Recipients,2021,"The initiation of RNA interference (RNAi) by topically applied small interfering RNA (siRNA) has potential applications for plant functional genomics, crop improvement and crop protection, but the primary obstacle for the development of this technology is the efficient delivery of RNAi effectors into the cell. The plant cell wall is a particularly challenging barrier for the delivery of macromolecules because many of the transfection agents that are commonly used with animal cells produce nano-complexes that are significantly larger than the size exclusion limit of the cell wall. Here, we illustrate the use of a class of very small nanoparticles, called carbon dots, for delivering siRNA into the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Low-pressure spray application of these formulations with a spreading surfactant resulted in strong silencing of GFP transgenes in both species. The delivery efficacy of carbon dot formulations was also demonstrated by the silencing of endogenous genes that encode two subunits of magnesium chelatase, an enzyme necessary for chlorophyll synthesis. The strong visible phenotypes observed with the carbon dot-facilitated delivery were validated by measuring significant reductions in the target gene transcript and/or protein levels. Methods for the delivery of RNAi effectors into plants, such as the carbon dot formulations described here, could become valuable tools for gene silencing in plants with practical applications in plant functional genomics and agriculture.","Schwartz, Steven H; Hendrix, Bill; Hoffer, Paul H; Sanders, Rick; Zheng, Wei",Plant physiol,,179

Online teaching has grown rapidly under lockdown. Yet the online approach for assessment presents a number of challenges, particularly when evaluating clinical competencies. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, reliability and validity of an online Virtual Clinical Encounter Examination (VICEE) to assess non-psychomotor competencies (non-procedure or manual skills) of medical students. METHOD: Sixty-one final year medical students took the VICEE as part of the final summative examination. A panel of faculty experts developed the exam cases and competencies. They administered the test online via real-time interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual patients, along with faculty and IT support. RESULTS: Student and faculty surveys demonstrated satisfaction with the experience. Confirmatory factor analysis supported convergent validity of VICEE with Direct Observation Clinical Encounter Examination (DOCEE), a previously validated clinical examination. The observed sensitivity was 81.8%, specificity 64.1% and likelihood ratio 12.6, supporting the ability of VICEE to diagnose 'clinical incompetence' among students. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that online AI-based virtual patient high fidelity simulation may be used as an alternative tool to assess some aspects of non-psychometric competencies.","Hamdy, Hossam; Sreedharan, Jayadevan; Rotgans, Jerome I; Zary, Nabil; Bahous, Sola Aoun; Venkatramana, Manda; AbdelFattah Elzayat, Elsayed; Lamba, Pankaj; Sebastian, Suraj K; Momen, Noha Kamal Abdel",Med Teach,,179

This study aimed to compare plasmatic adipokines concentration and lymphocyte cytokine production in children with different daily steps (DS) range, as well as to discuss the potential negative impact of the social isolation during COVID-19 pandemic in this context. DS can be a useful and low-cost way of monitoring children's health status. Study design: Fifty children were classified into clusters based in DS measured by pedometer: Sedentary Group (DS = 9338 ± 902 steps) and Active Group (DS = 13,614 ± 1003 steps). Plasma and lymphocytes were isolated and cultured to evaluate cytokine production. Results: Sedentary group presented lower adiponectin (7573 ± 232 pg/mL), higher leptin (16,250 ± 1825 pg/mL) plasma concentration, and higher lymphocyte production of IL-17, IFN-gamma, TNF-, IL-2 in relation to active group, suggesting predominance of Th1 response. Otherwise, the active group presented higher lymphocyte supernatant concentration of IL-10 and higher regulatory T cell (Treg) percentage. Conclusion: These results indicate that lymphocytes of children performing higher DS have an anti-inflammatory profile, especially of Treg. Besides, the prolonged social isolation in children during the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting physical mobility and exercise, reduces DS and increases adiposity, which could impair the immune system function and raise the susceptibility to inflammatory diseases.","Merlin, Murilo; de Oliveira, Heloisa Helena; Passos, Maria Elizabeth Pereira; Momesso, Cesar Miguel; Dos Santos de Oliveira, Laiane Cristina; Santana, Juliana Exel; Levada-Pires, Adriana C; Hatanaka, Elaine; Massao-Hirabara, Sandro; Guaré, Renata; Cury-Boaventura, Maria Fernanda; Pithon-Curi, Tania C; Gorjão, Renata",Sport Sci Health,,179

An accurate understanding of the body's temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31-60 days PSO. By 61-90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check&#8482; to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1-4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5-7 days PSO. Further studies are required to determine the longevity and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and whether they are protective against re-infection.","Higgins, Renee L; Rawlings, Stephen A; Case, Jamie; Lee, Florence Y; Chan, Clarence W; Barrick, Bethany; Burger, Zoe C; Yeo, Kiang-Teck J; Marrinucci, Dena",PLoS One,,179

Besides, there are clear indications that the pre-planning processes that led to easing the lockdown did not adhere to the global practices and guidelines as stipulated by WHO. Every day of the easing phase of the lockdown has witnessed an increasing number of cases indicating the possibility is that the COVID 19 cases may escalate in future dates. By implication, the healthcare system is at the risk of being overwhelmed and thus unable to rescue the situation which could further aggravate the number of untimely death afflicting the citizens.","Ibrahim, Ridwan Lanre; Ajide, Kazeem Bello; Olatunde Julius, Omokanmi",,,179

385368,Teaching NeuroImages: A 41-Year-Old Woman Presented With Excessive Sweating of Contralateral Face and Extremity,2021,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses, however, the lncRNA-mediated genetic networks response to cadmium (Cd) treatment remain elusive in trees, the promising phytoremediation candidates for Cd contamination. Here, we identified 172 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 295 differentially expressed target genes in the leaves of Populus tomentosa under Cd treatment. Functional annotation revealed that these lncRNAs involved in various processes, including photosynthesis, hormone regulation, and phenylalanine metabolism. Association studies identified 78 significant associations, representing 14 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 28 target genes for photosynthetic and leaf physiological traits. Epistasis uncovered 83 pairwise interactions among these traits, unveiling Cd-responsive lncRNA-mediated genetic networks for photosynthesis and leaf physiology in P. tomentosa. We then focused on the roles of two Cd-responsive lncRNA-gene pairs, MSTRG.22608.1-PtoMYB73 and MSTRG.5634.1-PtoMYB27, in Cd tolerance of Populus, and detected insertions/deletions within lncRNAs as polymorphisms driving target gene expression. LncRNAs genotype analysis and heterologous overexpressing PtoMYB73 and PtoMYB27 in Arabidopsis indicated their positive effects on enhancing Cd tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and leaf growth, and the potential interaction mechanisms of PtoMYB73 with abiotic stresses. Our study provides the genetic basis for Populus response to Cd treatment, facilitating genetic improvement of enhancing Cd tolerance in trees.","Quan, Mingyang; Liu, Xin; Xiao, Liang; Chen, Panfei; Song, Fangyuan; Lu, Wenjie; Song, Yuepeng; Zhang, Deqiang",,,179
385698,COVID-19 in Renal Transplant Recipients: Case Series and a Brief Review of Current Evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immeasurable impact, affecting healthcare systems, the global economy, and society. Exploration of trends within the existing COVID-19 data may guide directions for further study and novel treatment development. As the world faces COVID-19 disease, it is essential to study its epidemiological and clinical characteristics further to better understand and aid in its detection and containment. METHODS: We aimed to study the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Dubai, a multi-national Society. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, age, gender, and country of origin were associated with more severe cases of COVID-19, higher risk for hospitalization and death. Male individuals between 41 and 60 years of age from India had the most significant hospitalization and death predictor (p=.0001). The predictors for COVID-19 related deaths were slightly less than UAE Nationals by individuals from GCC (p=.02) that were followed closely behind by Pilipino (p=.02) and Arabs (p=.001). CONCLUSION: The vulnerability of individuals to infection and in the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms remains to be understood. There are large variations in disease severity, one component of which may be genetic variability in responding to the virus. Genomics of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and the wide variation in clinical response to COVID-19 in patients should become active investigation areas.","Farajallah, Halah Mohammed; AlSuwaidi, Sara Khamis; AlSuwaidi, Shatha Mohammad; AlAli, Ghada AlAhmdani; AlZubaidi, Amani Salem; Carrick, Frederick Robert; Abdulrahman, Mahera",J Infect Public Health,,179

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG anti-bodies. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers of two hospitals and Territorial Medical and Administrative services in Northern Italy. From 8 May to 3 June 2020, 2252 subjects were tested. Seroprevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all individuals who were stratified by job title, COVID-19 risk of exposure, direct contact with patients, unit ward, and intensity of care. RESULTS: Median age was 50 years, and 72% of subjects were female. The overall seroprevalence was 17.11% [95% CI 15.55-18.67]. Around 20% of healthcare assistants were seropositive, followed by physicians and nurses (16.89% and 15.84%, respectively). HCWs with high risk of exposure to COVID-19 were more frequently seropositive (28.52%) with respect to those with medium and low risks (16.71% and 12.76%, respectively). Moreover, personnel in direct contact had higher prevalence (18.32%) compared to those who did not (10.66%). Furthermore, the IgG were more frequently detected among personnel of one hospital (19.43%). CONCLUSION: The high seroprevalence observed can be partially explained by the timing and the population seroprevalence; the study was conducted in an area with huge spread of the infection.","Airoldi, Chiara; Patrucco, Filippo; Milano, Fulvia; Alessi, Daniela; Sarro, Andrea; Rossi, Maicol Andrea; Cena, Tiziana; Borrè, Silvio; Faggiano, Fabrizio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,179

METHODS: Patients with foot complications attending the diabetic foot clinic prior to lockdown who sought teleconsultations during COVID-19 lockdown underwent virtual triage to include clinical history, visual inspection of feet, domiciliary wound care (community nurse assisted dressings) and offloading instructions. The subsequent ulcer, limb and mortality outcomes during the following 24 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (April-September 2020, group 1) were assessed and compared with those who attended foot clinic during the same period in 2019 (April-September, group 2). RESULTS: Group 1 included 561 participants with foot complications provided with teleconsultations, median age 57 (51 to 63) years and diabetes duration of 10 (5 to 16) years. Twelve patients with severe DFU were excluded and 549 patients [357 (65%) neuropathic foot, 104 (18.9%) ischemic foot and 88 (16%) chronic Charcot foot with deformities] were evaluated. There were 227 (41.3%) participants with active DFU at start of lockdown, 32 (5.8%) with new onset ulcer during lockdown (47.1%) and 290 patients without ulcers. Group 2 included 650 participants; active foot ulcer was present in 366 patients. Wound closed or reduced in area in 78.4% of participants of group 1 compared to 76.0% (p = 0.318) in group 2.

389120,COVID-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome,2020,"Collective intelligence of viruses is witnessed in many research articles. Most of the researches focus on the qualitative properties or observations. In this research, we model the behaviours and collective intelligence of SARS-CoV-2 by minimal spanning trees (MSTs), which specify the underlying mechanisms of resource allocation in the viral colony. The vertices of the trees are 50 states, DC and NYC in the USA. The weights of the edges are assigned by the reciprocal of the sum of cases or deaths of COVID-19. The types of trees are decided by the chosen 18 factors. We sample 304 time-series data and compute their MST-based auto-correlations for stability analysis. Then we perform correlated analysis and comparative analysis on these stable factors. Our results show MST approach fits the collective intelligence modelling very well; the total cases and total deaths over areas are highly correlated in terms of MSTs; and these stable factors have little to do with the geographical distance. The results also indicate the colonisation of SARS-CoV-2 is pretty mature and organised. Based on the results, for environmental or health policies, we should also turn our attention to the transmission routes that are independent of or far away from human population or densities. The viruses' colonies might already exist in the wild in a large scale, not only in the populated or polluted cities. We shall build or conduct a monitoring system of their colonisation and survival techniques, in order to terminate, contain or live with their communities.","Chen, Ray-Ming",Environ Res,,179

Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated. We would suggest that health professionals investigate cardiac function as part of the routine care.","Wang, Yueying; Roever, Leonardo; Tse, Gary; Liu, Tong",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,179

The demand for such devices is considerable, as is the amount of plastic waste generated after their use (approximately 1.6 million tons/day since the outbreak). Even if the sanitary emergency must have the maximum priority, environmental concerns require investigation to find possible mitigation solutions. The aim of this work is to develop an eco-design actions guide that supports the design of dedicated masks, in a manner to reduce the negative impacts of these devices on the environment during the pandemic period. Toward this aim, an environmental assessment based on life cycle assessment and circularity assessment (material circularity indicator) of different types of masks have been carried out on (i) a 3D-printed mask with changeable filters, (ii) a surgical mask, (iii) an FFP2 mask with valve, (iv) an FFP2 mask without valve, and (v) a washable mask. Results highlight how reusable masks (i.e., 3D-printed masks and washable masks) are the most sustainable from a life cycle perspective, drastically reducing the environmental impacts in all categories.

These characteristics are consistent with the multi-step model of disease. We applied this model to Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of log(CFR) against log(age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. We also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multi-step model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility.","Pearce, Neil; Moirano, Giovenale; Maule, Milena; Kogevinas, Manolis; Rodo, Xavier; Lawlor, Deborah A; Vandenbroucke, Jan; Vandenbroucke-Grauls, Christina; Polack, Fernando P; Custovic, Adnan",Eur J Epidemiol,,179

398984,Two Challenging Cases with COVID heart,2020,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proved a globally prevalent outbreak since December 2019. As a focused country to alleviate the epidemic impact, China implemented a range of public health interventions to prevent the disease from further transmission, including the pandemic lockdown in Wuhan and other cities. This paper establishes China's mobility network by a flight dataset and proposes a model without epidemiological parameters to indicate the spread risks through the network, which is termed as epidemic strength. By simply adjusting an intervention parameter, traffic volumes under different travel-restriction levels can be simulated to analyze how the containment strategy can mitigate the virus dissemination through traffic. This approach is successfully applied to a network of Chinese provinces and the epidemic strength is smoothly interpreted by flow maps. Through this node-to-node interpretation of transmission risks, both overall and detailed epidemic hazards are properly analyzed, which can provide valuable intervention advice during public health emergencies.","Chen, Haonan; He, Jing; Song, Wenhui; Wang, Lianchao; Wang, Jiabao; Chen, Yijin",PLoS One,,179

Aside from African green monkeys, nonhuman primate models that replicate airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been investigated. A comparative evaluation of COVID-19 in African green monkeys, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus macaques following airborne exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was performed to determine critical disease parameters associated with disease progression, and establish correlations between primate and human COVID-19. Respiratory abnormalities and viral shedding were noted for all animals, indicating successful infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed fever, and thrombocytopenia was measured for African green monkeys and rhesus macaques. Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and alveolar fibrosis were more frequently observed in lung tissue from cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys. The data indicate that, in addition to African green monkeys, macaques can be successfully infected by airborne SARS-CoV-2, providing viable macaque natural transmission models for medical countermeasure evaluation.","Johnston, Sara C; Ricks, Keersten M; Jay, Alexandra; Raymond, Jo Lynne; Rossi, Franco; Zeng, Xiankun; Scruggs, Jennifer; Dyer, David; Frick, Ondraya; Koehler, Jeffrey W; Kuehnert, Paul A; Clements, Tamara L; Shoemaker, Charles J; Coyne, Susan R; Delp, Korey L; Moore, Joshua; Berrier, Kerry; Esham, Heather; Shamblin, Joshua; Sifford, Willie; Fiallos, Jimmy; Klosterman, Leslie; Stevens, Stephen; White, Lauren; Bowling, Philip; Garcia, Terrence; Jensen, Christopher; Ghering, Jeanean; Nyakiti, David; Bellanca, Stephanie; Kearney, Brian; Giles, Wendy; Alli, Nazira; Paz, Fabian; Akers, Kristen; Danner, Denise; Barth, James; Johnson, Joshua A; Durant, Matthew; Kim, Ruth; Hooper, Jay W; Smith, Jeffrey M; Kugelman, Jeffrey R; Beitzel, Brett F; Gibson, Kathleen M; Pitt, Margaret L M; Minogue, Timothy D; Nalca, Aysegul",PLoS One,,179
399959,"Intussusception and COVID19, Successful Mechanic Reduction, Case Report",2021,"Despite over 140 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic, relatively few confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been reported. While immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection is probable, at least in the short term, few studies have quantified the reinfection risk. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to synthesise the evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time. A standardised protocol was employed, based on Cochrane methodology. Electronic databases and preprint servers were searched from 1 January 2020 to 19 February 2021. Eleven large cohort studies were identified that estimated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time, including three that enrolled healthcare workers and two that enrolled residents and staff of elderly care homes. Across studies, the total number of PCR-positive or antibody-positive participants at baseline was 615,777, and the maximum duration of follow-up was more than 10 months in three studies. Reinfection was an uncommon event (absolute rate 0%-1.1%), with no study reporting an increase in the risk of reinfection over time. Only one study estimated the population-level risk of reinfection based on whole genome sequencing in a subset of patients; the estimated risk was low (0.1% [95% CI: 0.08-0.11%]) with no evidence of waning immunity for up to 7 months following primary infection. These data suggest that naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity does not wane for at least 10 months post-infection. However, the applicability of these studies to new variants or to vaccine-induced immunity remains uncertain.","O Murchu, Eamon; Byrne, Paula; Carty, Paul G; De Gascun, Cillian; Keogan, Mary; O039,; Neill, Michelle; Harrington, Patricia; Ryan, Máirín",Rev Med Virol,,179

402093,Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a Child with COVID-19 Complicated By MIS-C: A Case Report from Kuwait,2020,"This paper explores to what extent product and marketing channel diversification contributed to the economic success of small-scale agricultural producers involved in short food supply chains after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was conducted between April and July 2020 in four countries of the European Union-Estonia, Hungary, Portugal and Romania,-resulting in a relatively large sample of farmers (N = 421). The analysis was built on a semi-nonparametric approach. Approximately 19 percent of small-scale producers were able to increase sales during the first wave of the pandemic, although country-level variation was significant. Fruits and vegetables were by far the most popular products. The importance of specific channels varied across countries, but farm gate sales were among the most important marketing channels both before and during the first wave. The importance of channels that were based on digital resources and home delivery increased. Our evidence indicates that diversification was a strategy that paid off, both in terms of marketing channels and different product categories. However, the impact appears to be nonlinear; the initial advantage generated by diversification rapidly tapered off, either temporarily (in the case of products), or permanently (in the case of marketing channels). Later research may clarify whether these findings are generalizable in other socio-economic contexts, as well as in a non-COVID situation.","Benedek, Zsófia; Ferto, Imre; Galamba Marreiros, Cristina; Aguiar, Pâmela Mossmann de; Pocol, Cristina Bianca; Cechura, Lukás; Põder, Anne; Pääso, Piia; Bakucs, Zoltán",PLoS One,,179

Oligochaeta (Annelida) is a large group of invertebrates, with several small specimens inhabiting almost every possible niche at most freshwater ecosystem. The goal of the present study was to examine the spatial variation of Oligochaeta community in five floodplain lakes from the Ilha Grande National Park and relate the distribution with abiotic variables. Samples were taken at five sampling stations using a modified Petersen grab. Thirteen species of Oligochaeta belonging to two families Naididae and Tubificidae were recorded. Different patterns of richness and abiotic factors were identified among the lakes located in the island and at the margin of Paraná river. The different patterns of granulometric texture affected directly the distribution of the Oligochaeta assemblage of theses environments. The results of this study permit to infer that the Oligochaeta assemblage, in preserved areas, present a higher richness in relation to long term studies with more frequent samplings. We concluded that Ilha Grande National Park contributes for the preservation of benthic invertebrates.","Henrique Ragonha, Flávio; Barros Chiaramonte, Josiane; Martins Fontes Junior, Hélio; Ribeiro da Cunha, Eduardo; Benedito, Evanilde; Michiyo Takeda, Alice",Acta Sci.

This is a quantitative dyadic study with a sample of 80 couples (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 160). Dyadic data were analyzed among couples with cancer to examine the within-person (actor effects) and between-partner (partner effects) associations among links between cancer-related communication and cancer-related distress through the use of actor–partner interdependence models. Significant actor and partner effects were found for cancer-related communication in partners facing cancer, a factor that predicted cancer-related distress. The findings underscore the need to adopt a systemic perspective that accounts for multiple, simultaneous adaptive processes including cancer-related communication as influences on cancer-related distress in the time of COVID-19.

We utilized the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study to understand how family- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage relate to disease burden, family communication, and preventative responses to the pandemic in over 6,000 youth-parent/caregiver dyads. Data were collected at three timepoints (May to August 2020). Here, we show that both family- and neighborhood-level disadvantage were associated with parentsa TM reports of greater family COVID-19 exposure risk and diagnoses, less perceived exposure risk, more frequent parent-youth conversations about COVID-19 risk/prevention and reassurance, and greater youth preventative behaviors. More disadvantaged families may be adaptively incorporating more protective strategies to reduce emotional distress and likelihood of COVID-19 infection. The results highlight the importance of parent-youth communication and disease-preventative practices for buffering the economic and disease burdens of COVID-19, along with policies and programs that reduce these burdens for families with socioeconomic disadvantage.","Marshall, A.; Hackman, D.; Baker, F.; Breslin, F.; Brown, S.; Dick, A.; Gonzalez, M.; Guillaume, M.; Kiss, O.; Lisdahl, K.; McCabe, C.; Iii, W.

407613,Successful Management of COVID-19 Infection in 2 Early Post-Liver Transplant Recipients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 31, 2020, governments have been enfaced with crisis for timely responses. The efficacy of these responses directly depends on the social behaviors of the target society. People react to these actions with respect to the information they received from different channels, such as news and social networks. Thus, analyzing news demonstrates a brief view of the information users received during the outbreak. METHODS: The raw data used in this study is collected from official news channels of news wires and agencies in Telegram messenger, which exceeds 2,400,000 posts. The posts that are quoted by NCRC's members are collected, cleaned, and divided into sentences. The topic modeling and tracking are utilized in a two-stage framework, which is customized for this problem to separate miscellaneous sentences from those presenting concerns. The first stage is fed with embedding vectors of sentences where they are grouped by the Mapper algorithm. Sentences belonging to singleton nodes are labeled as miscellaneous sentences. The remained sentences are vectorized, adopting Tf-IDF weighting schema in the second stage and topically modeled by the LDA method. Finally, relevant topics are aligned to the list of policies and actions, named topic themes, that are set up by the NCRC. RESULTS: Our results show that major concerns presented in about half of the sentences are (1) PCR lab. test, diagnosis, and screening, (2) Closure of the education system, and (3) awareness actions about washing hands and facial mask usage. Among the eight themes, intra-provincial travel and traffic restrictions, as well as briefing the national and provincial status, are under-presented. The timeline of concerns annotated by the preventive actions illustrates the changes in concerns addressed by NCRC. This timeline shows that although the announcements and public responses are not lagged behind the events, but cannot be considered as timely. Furthermore, the fluctuating series of concerns reveal that the NCRC has not a long-time response map, and members react to the closest announced policy/act. CONCLUSION: The results of our study can be used as a quantitative indicator for evaluating the availability of an on-time public response of Iran's NCRC during the first three months of the outbreak. Moreover, it can be used in comparative studies to investigate the differences between awareness acts in various countries. Results of our customized-design framework showed that about one-third of the discussions of the NCRC's members cover miscellaneous topics that must be removed from the data.","Kaveh-Yazdy, Fatemeh; Zarifzadeh, Sajjad",Int J Med Inform,,179

A matched case-control study was designed by analyzing the data regarding positive subjects observed up to April 21, 2020. The case fatality rate was 7.9%, with a higher proportion of deaths in men than women. The specific standardized mortality ratio was 0.15-0.13 for males and 0.2 for females, showing that mortality is much lower than expected. Cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases and diabetes mellitus showed a significant association with the outcome. Although the case fatality rate in Sardinia in regard to age and gender patterns seems to be similar to that for Italy as a whole, its quantitative value was far lower than the national one and possible explanations might include the genetic characteristics of the Sardinian population or the immediate closure of its borders as soon as the epidemic started.

410485,Higher expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of Type I IFN signaling,2021,"Medical students need to understand core neuroscience principles as a foundation for their required clinical experiences in neurology. In fact, they need a solid neuroscience foundation for their clinical experiences in all other medical disciplines also, because the nervous system plays such a critical role in the function of every organ system. Due to the rapid pace of neuroscience discoveries, it is unrealistic to expect students to master the entire field. It is also unnecessary, as students can expect to have ready access to electronic reference sources no matter where they practice. In the pre-clerkship phase of medical school, the focus should be on providing students with the foundational knowledge to use those resources effectively and interpret them correctly. This article describes an organizational framework for teaching the essential neuroscience background needed by all physicians. This is particularly germane at a time when many medical schools are re-assessing traditional practices and instituting curricular changes such as competency-based approaches, earlier clinical immersion, and increased emphasis on active learning. This article reviews factors that should be considered when developing the pre-clerkship neuroscience curriculum, including goals and objectives for the curriculum, the general topics to include, teaching and assessment methodology, who should direct the course, and the areas of expertise of faculty who might be enlisted as teachers or content experts. These guidelines were developed by a work group of experienced educators appointed by the Undergraduate Education Subcommittee (UES) of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).

410534,Post covid-19 invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis: A case report,2021,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has rapidly developed into a global public health threat. Patients severely affected with COVID-19 present distinct clinical features, including acute respiratory disorder, neutrophilia, cytokine storm, and sepsis. In addition, multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines are found in the plasma of such patients. Transcriptome sequencing of different specimens obtained from patients suffering from severe episodes of COVID-19 shows dynamics in terms of their immune responses. However, those host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 propagation and the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional immune responses during COVID-19 infection remain elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA-long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) co-expression network derived from publicly available SARS-CoV-2-infected transcriptome data of human lung epithelial cell lines and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients. Through co-expression network analysis, we identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs strongly correlated with genes involved in various immune-related pathways crucial for cytokine signaling. Our findings suggest that the aberrant expression of these four lncRNAs can be associated with cytokine storms and anti-viral responses during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lungs. Thus, the present study uncovers molecular interactions behind the cytokine storm activation potentially responsible for hyper-inflammatory responses in critical COVID-19 patients.","Mukherjee, Sumit; Banerjee, Bodhisattwa; Karasik, David; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",Viruses,,179

In our tertiary referral center, we aimed to study performance of abdominal CT-scan before bariatric surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included all patients who underwent bariatric surgery and a pre-operative abdominal CT-scan in our academic center, between January 2015 and December 2018. RESULTS: We included 521 patients (417 women and 104 men) with a mean age of 48.0±11.5 years. Mean preoperative body mass index was 44.9±7.0kg/m2. Among the 392 patients with abnormal CT-scan, mean number of anomalies per patient was of 2.2±1.2. Vast majority of anomalies (91.8%) were non-significant. Only 5 (1%) patients needed treatment prior to bariatric surgery. No factor predictive of abnormal CT-scan was found. CONCLUSION: Only few patients had severe anomaly on CT-scan before bariatric surgery. Abdominal CT-scan could not be advocated to seek cancer before bariatric surgery.","Lesourd, R; Greilsamer, T; de Montrichard, M; Jacobi, D; Frampas, E; Mirallié, E; Blanchard, C",Journal of visceral surgery,,179

It suggests a new framework for assessing the phases of the pandemic. Method: The paper draws its information and conclusions from a rapid synthesis and translation process (RSTP) of a series of webinars and online discussions from the Pandemic-Mental Health International Network (Pan-MHIN) - policy experts from across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. While the initial focus of this research was on mental health, COVID-19 has raised much broader issues and questions for health planners. Results: We identified gaps affecting the capacity to respond effectively and quickly, including in relation to system indicators, the inadequacy of the prior classification of the phases of the pandemic, the absences of a healthcare ecosystem approach, and the quick shift to digital technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of COVID-19 responses across different systems, services, sites and countries been identified and compared, including both low and high impacted areas. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for managerial epidemiology based on healthcare ecosystem research encompassing multidisciplinary teams, visualization tools and decision analytics for rapid response. Policy and healthcare context played a key role in the response to COVID-19. Its severity, the containment measures and the societal response varied greatly across sites and countries. Understanding this variation is vital to assess the impact of COVID-19 in specific areas such as ageing or mental health.","Salvador-Carulla, Luis; Rosenberg, Sebastian; Mendoza, John; Tabatabaei-Jafari, Hossein",Health Policy Technol,,179

COVID-19 defined as the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. The virus has been illustrated inhibits the production of IFN-ß1-a from inflammatory cells. We conducted a retrospective study of all adult confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients who received combination of three doses of 12 million international units of IFN-ß1-a and Lopinavir 400 mg and Ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (case group) for 14 days besides standard care and age- and sex- matched COVID-19 patients with receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (control group) at Masih Daneshvari Hospital as a designated hospital for COVID-19 between Feb 19 and Apr 30, 2020. Multivariate analysis was done to determine the impact of IFN-ß1-a on outcome and all-cause mortality. 152 cases in IFN-ß1-a group and 304 cases as control group were included. IFN-ß1-a group stayed at hospital longer and required noninvasive ventilation more than control group (13 vs. 6 days, p = 0.001) and (34% vs. 24%, p = 0.04), respectively. During treatment, 57 (12.5%) patients died. The death rate in case and control groups was 11% and 13% respectively. In multivariate analysis, not receiving IFN-ß1-a (HR 5.12, 95% CI: 2.77-9.45), comorbidity (HR 2.28, 95% CI: 1.13-4.60) and noninvasive ventilation (HR 2.77, 95% CI: 1.56-4.93) remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, risk of death decreased by using IFN-ß1-a in COVID-19 patients.

This study aims to evaluate the in vitro anti-viral activities of combinations of certain commercially available drugs that have recently formed part of COVID-19 therapy. Dual combinatory drugs, namely; Lopinavir-Ritonavir (LOPIRITO)-Clarithromycin (CLA), LOPIRITO-Azithromycin (AZI), LOPIRITO-Doxycycline (DOXY), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-AZI, HCQ-DOXY, Favipiravir (FAVI)-AZI, HCQ-FAVI, and HCQ-LOPIRITO, were prepared. These drugs were mixed at specific ratios and evaluated for their safe use based on the cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) values of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. The anti-viral efficacy of these combinations in relation to Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a patient in Universitas Airlangga hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia and evaluated for IC50 24, 48, and 72 hours after viral inoculation was subsequently determined. Observation of the viral load in qRT-PCR was undertaken, the results of which indicated the absence of high levels of cytotoxicity in any samples and that dual combinatory drugs produced lower cytotoxicity than single drugs. In addition, these combinations demonstrated considerable effectiveness in reducing the copy number of the virus at 48 and 72 hours, while even at 24 hours, post-drug incubation resulted in low IC50 values. Most combination drugs reduced pro-inflammatory markers, i.e. IL-6 and TNF-&#945;, while increasing the anti-inflammatory response of IL-10. According to these results, the descending order of effective dual combinatory drugs is one of LOPIRITO-AZI>LOPIRITO-DOXY>HCQ-AZI>HCQ-FAVI>LOPIRITO-CLA>HCQ-DOX. It can be suggested that dual combinatory drugs, e.g. LOPIRITO-AZI, can potentially be used in the treatment of COVID-19 infectious diseases.","Miatmoko, Andang; Hendrianto, Eryk; Karsari, Deya; Dinaryanti, Aristika; Ertanti, Nora; Ihsan, Igo Syaiful; Purnama, Disca Sandyakala; Asmarawati, Tri Pudy; Marfiani, Erika; Rosyid, Alfian Nur; Wulaningrum, Prastuti Asta; Setiawan, Herley Windo; Siswanto, Imam; Tri Puspaningsih, Ni Nyoman",PLoS One,,179

425593,Pathogenesis-directed therapy of 2019 novel coronavirus disease,2020,"The current pandemic has rocked the lives of human beings every-where in ways never imagined, forcing us to question where our civilization is headed. In this article, we explore and discuss scien-tifi c evidence that helps explain recent events in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is caused by infection with a zoonotic-origin novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that is genetically close to two coronavirus types iso-lated in bats. The transmission dynamics to humans from the original and intermediary hosts remain poorly understood, but it is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected humans after undergoing an inter-species transfer from bats to an intermediate species, and from there to human beings. Crossing the species barrier is largely fostered by industrial-scale agricultural practices that simplify original ecosystem connections by reducing biodiversity, facilitating the emergence of new infectious diseases. The scientifi c community has played an exemplary role in responding to this global emergency, working to fi nd timely, relevant solutions for governments and society as a whole. We need to take this opportunity to promote a global and open science that delves into the interrelation-ships of the biological, environmental, social and economic dimen-sions of this and other diseases while questioning current modes of production and their impact on the environment, and thus on human health worldwide.

425648,Amazon fires coincide with increased respiratory illnesses in indigenous populations,2020,"PURPOSE: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis are vulnerable to viral infections like COVID-19 because of the low chance of obedience and complying with rules besides the need for transfer to distant dialysis facilities. We investigated the impact and clinical effect of treatment of COVID-19 in dialysis patients. METHODS: We included patients on maintenance hemodialysis at different healthcare facilities in Zonguldak city. With the diagnosis of the first infected HD case, all other patients who shared the same session were screened. Hospitalized and clinically confirmed cases were included. COVID-19 diagnosis was made based on clinical, biochemical along radiologic findings. RESULTS: 34 (F/M:19/15, mean age 62 ± 13.2 years, dialysis duration 66.9 ± 57.7 months, length of hospital stay 16.2 ± 7.9 days) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of COVID-19 was found to be 18.4% of our exposed population. 38.2% of our patients were initially diagnosed by CT screening while asymptomatic. 35.3% had a fever as the first presenting symptom. Lymphopenia was the most common laboratory finding. Except for one, all had at least one comorbidity. Out of 12 (35.3%) patients admitted to ICU 6(17.6%) died. The deceased patients were older, presented with lower serum albumin and lymphocyte count, and had higher CRP and fibrinogen levels. High CRP level on admission was the only significant predictor of mortality. CONCLUSION: Early detection will lower mortality. In this study, with a low prevalence of COVID-19, the importance of early screening of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was shown to be highly important. Further studies are still needed to find out the most appropriate medical management.","Islam, Mahmud; Ozturk, Yasin; Koc, Yener",Int. urol. nephrol,,179
425745,Assessment of neonatal perfusion,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province. DESIGN: National surveillance studies, 2008-17. SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Dong, Yanhui; Wang, Liping; Burgner, David P; Miller, Jessica E; Song, Yi; Ren, Xiang; Li, Zhongjie; Xing, Yi; Ma, Jun; Sawyer, Susan M; Patton, George C",BMJ,,179

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study carried out in June 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 13 426 individuals from 19 countries. RESULTS: More than 60% of all respondents felt their government had communicated adequately during the pandemic. National variances ranged from 83.4% in China down to 37.2% in Brazil, but overall, males and those with a higher income were more likely to rate government communications highly. Almost half (48.8%) of the respondents felt their government had ensured adequate access to physical health services (ranging from 89.3% for Singapore to 27.2% for Poland), with higher ratings reported by younger and higher-income respondents. Ratings of mental health support were lower overall (32.9%, ranging from 74.8% in China to around 15% in Brazil and Sweden), but highest among younger respondents. Providing support for basic necessities of food and housing was rated highest overall in China (79%) and lowest in Ecuador (14.6%), with higher ratings reported by younger, higher-income and better-educated respondents across all countries.

426919,Reducing hospital admissions for COVID-19 at a dedicated screening centre in Singapore,2020,"Fake news has now grown into a big problem for societies and also a major challenge for people fighting disinformation. This phenomenon plagues democratic elections, reputations of individual persons or organizations, and has negatively impacted citizens, (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US or Brazil). Hence, developing effective tools to fight this phenomenon by employing advanced Machine Learning (ML) methods poses a significant challenge. The following paper displays the present body of knowledge on the application of such intelligent tools in the fight against disinformation. It starts by showing the historical perspective and the current role of fake news in the information war. Proposed solutions based solely on the work of experts are analysed and the most important directions of the application of intelligent systems in the detection of misinformation sources are pointed out. Additionally, the paper presents some useful resources (mainly datasets useful when assessing ML solutions for fake news detection) and provides a short overview of the most important R&D projects related to this subject. The main purpose of this work is to analyse the current state of knowledge in detecting fake news; on the one hand to show possible solutions, and on the other hand to identify the main challenges and methodological gaps to motivate future research.","Choras, Michal; Demestichas, Konstantinos; Gielczyk, Agata; Herrero, Alvaro; Ksieniewicz, Pawel; Remoundou, Konstantina; Urda, Daniel; Wozniak, Michal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01142v1.pdf,179

Detecting COVID-19 and other lung diseases from Chest X-Ray (CXR) images can be very effective for emergency diagnosis and treatment as CXR is fast and cheap. The objective of this study is to develop a system capable of detecting COVID-19 along with 14 other lung diseases from CXRs in a fair and unbiased manner. The proposed system consists of a CXR image selection technique and a deep learning based model to classify 15 diseases including COVID-19. The proposed CXR selection technique aims to retain the maximum variation uniformly and eliminate poor quality CXRs with the goal of reducing the training dataset size without compromising classifier accuracy. More importantly, it reduces the often hidden bias and unfairness in decision making.

DesignCohort from the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) registry Setting30 acute care hospitals across Canada ParticipantsPatients hospitalized for non-COVID-19 related diagnoses who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 1, and December 29, 2020 Main outcomePositive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 Outcome measureDiagnostic yield ResultsWe enrolled 15,690 consecutive eligible adults who were admitted to hospital without clinically suspected COVID-19. Among these patients, 122 tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in a diagnostic yield of 0.8% (95% CI 0.64% - 0.92%). Factors associated with a positive test included presence of a fever, being a healthcare worker, having a positive household contact or institutional exposure, and living in an area with higher 7-day average incident COVID-19 cases. ConclusionsUniversal screening of hospitalized patients for COVID-19 across two pandemic waves had a low diagnostic yield and should be informed by individual-level risk assessment in addition to regional COVID-19 prevalence. Trial registrationNCT04702945 SUMMARY BOXESSection 1: Universal screening of admitted patients for SARS-CoV-2 was implemented in many hospitals at the beginning of the pandemic. The Infections Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommended avoiding universal screening of asymptomatic hospitalized patients in areas and times of low-COVID prevalence (defined as <2% prevalence) with very low certainty of evidence, based on studies of COVID-19 prevalence among asymptomatic individuals in the community. Section 2: This study supports IDSA recommendations to avoid universal screening for COVID-19 in times and areas of low COVID prevalence and identifies patient-level risk factors strongly associated with positive testing that should be considered for screening.","Davis, Phil; Rosychuk, Rhonda J; Hau, Jeffrey P; Cheng, Ivy; McRae, Andrew D; Daoust, Raoul; Lang, Eddy; Turner, Joel; Khangura, Jaspreet; Fok, Patrick T; Stachura, Maja; Brar, Baljeet; Hohl, Corinne M",,,179

433857,Management of inflammatory bowel disease during COVID-19 pandemic. A practical review,2020,"Conferences are widely recognised as a central component of academic life, providing important opportunities for dissemination of research, professional networking, and extending scholarship. Notwithstanding this, concerns are increasingly voiced around such factors as the environmental and sustainability aspects of conference travel and hosting, and issues of equity and access. The imposition of travel and congregation restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has seen the suspension of in-person academic conferences throughout the world. This desk-based research study provides a timely opportunity to consider the challenges that this has precipitated, and the ensuing changes to the long-established and relatively consistent format that is employed for academic conferences. In doing so, it reflects upon what has been lost through the unavoidable abandonment of the traditional face-to-face conference during these unique times, but also what may have been found in terms of creative solutions, reimagined formats, and unexpected benefits that have arisen through the reconceptualisation of such events, and which may have wider implications for the academic conference in the post-pandemic world that awaits us.

435336,"Clinical Characteristics, Treatments and Outcomes of 18 Lung Transplant Recipients with COVID-19",2021,"The coronavirus (CoV) infects a broad range of hosts including humans as well as a variety of animals. It has gained overwhelming concerns since the emergence of deadly human coronaviruses (HCoVs), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015. Very recently, special attention has been paid to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 due to its high mobility and mortality. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, despite vast research efforts, the effective pharmaceutical interventions are still not available for clinical uses. Both expanded knowledge on structure insights and the essential function of viral nucleocapsid (N) protein are key basis for the development of novel, and potentially, a broad-spectrum inhibitor against coronavirus diseases. This review aimed to delineate the current research from the perspective of biochemical and structural study in cell-based assays as well as virtual screen approaches to identify N protein antagonists targeting not only HCoVs but also animal CoVs.","Tseng, Yeu-Yang; Liao, Guan-Ru; Lien, Abigail; Hsu, Wei-Li",,,179
435352,Subacute Thyroiditis from COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report and Review of Literature,2020,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges, particularly for health systems, which may be forced to ration the resources available to treat patients with this disease. With its ethical implications, this decision forces health care institutions to choose, among patients with similar vital needs, who will receive the scarce available life support resources in the emergency room or intensive care units based on prognostic criteria. This utilitarian approach aims to achieve the greatest benefit for the largest possible number of patients; however, in Colombia, its implementation faces several obstacles, such as the medical ethos, the instruments used to define the prognosis, the prioritization criteria, the legal-constitutional precepts, and the economic nature of the provision of intensive care services in the country. This article aims to reflect on these aspects and propose a model for patient prioritization based on the creation of multidisciplinary teams that make decisions within a transparent, humane, plural, impartial, equitable, and fair methodological framework. In the context of the current pandemic, these multidisciplinary teams should be guided by four ethical-clinical principles: (a) treat all persons equally, (b) prioritize patients with the worst condition, (c) maximize the benefits that can be obtained from the scarce resources available and (d) preferably select patients with instrumental value. If these four principles are followed, the guidelines drawn up by the Colombian Government concerning the care of COVID-19 patients would be fulfilled within a context of ethical medical autonomy and scientific and professional practice determined by a utilitarian perspective.","Echeverry-Raad, Jairo; Navarro-Vargas, José Ricardo",Rev.

Thus, the current study explored the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and aspects of mental health, namely anxiety and depression, and will consider whether this relationship can be mediated by mindfulness. Data were collected from a student sample of 355 participants (71.5% female and 28.5% male) ranging between 18 and 41 years of age (M = 22.41 ± 3.27), with participants completing a fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS), and the anxiety and depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). In terms of the results, correlational analyses indicated that fear of COVID-19 is inversely associated with mindfulness, while positive correlations were found with anxiety and depression. Structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that mindfulness mediated the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression and anxiety.

435868,Association between fatality rate of COVID-19 and selenium deficiency in China,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is a serious problem throughout the world. The pathophysiology of cancer is multifactorial and is also related to gut microbiota. Intestinal microbes are the useful resident of the healthy human. They play various aspects of human health including nutritional biotransformation, flushing of the pathogens, toxin neutralization, immune response, and onco-suppression. Disruption in the interactions among the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelium, and the host immune system are associated with gastrointestinal disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp.) have been regarded as beneficial to health and shown to play a significant role in immunomodulation and displayed preventive role against obesity, diabetes, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, tumor progression, and cancer. OBJECTIVE: The involvement of gut microorganisms in cancer development and prevention has been recognized as a balancing factor. The events of dysbiosis emphasize metabolic disorder and carcinogenesis. The gut flora potentiates immunomodulation and minimizes the limitations of usual chemotherapy. The significant role of prebiotics and probiotics on the improvement of immunomodulation and antitumor properties has been considered. METHODS: I had reviewed the literature on the multidimensional activities of prebiotics and probiotics from the NCBI website database PubMed, Springer Nature, Science Direct (Elsevier), Google Scholar database to search relevant articles. Specifically, I had focused on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in immunomodulation and cancer prevention. RESULTS: Prebiotics are the nondigestible fermentable sugars that selectively influence the growth of probiotic organisms that exert immunomodulation over the cancerous growth. The oncostatic properties of bacteria are mediated through the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, approaches have also been taken to use probiotics as an adjuvant in cancer therapy. CONCLUSION: The present review has indicated that dysbiosis is the crucial factor in many pathological situations including cancer. Applications of prebiotics and probiotics exhibit the immune-surveillance as oncostatic effects. These events increase the possibilities of new therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention.","Samanta, Saptadip",Anticancer agents med chem (Print),,179

This study aimed to investigate the impact of pandemic-associated stress on food parenting practices including interactions surrounding snacks, and child diet. METHODS: Parents (N = 318) of 2-12-year old children completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing current COVID-19-specific stress, pre-COVID-19 stress, financial stress (e.g. food insecurity), food parenting practices, and child snack intake frequency. Structural Equation Modeling was used to model simultaneous paths of relationships and test direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Stress, including financial hardship, was higher compared with before the crisis. The majority of children had regular mealtimes and irregular snack times. Higher COVID-19-specific stress was associated with more non-nutritive use of food and snacks (e.g. emotional and instrumental feeding), but also more structure and positive interactions (e.g. eating with or engaging with child around mealtimes). Higher COVID-19-specific stress was also associated with greater child intake frequency of sweet and savory snacks, with some evidence for mediation by snack parenting practices. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be linked to child snack intake with potential impacts on child obesity risk, and suggest several modifiable points of intervention within the family context.","Jansen, E; Thapaliya, G; Aghababian, A; Sadler, J; Smith, K; Carnell, S",Appetite,,179

METHODS: Death data of registered residents of Suzhou from 2014 to 2020 were collected and the weekly mortality rates due to respiratory disease and all deaths were analyzed. The differences in mortality rates during the pandemic and the same period in previous years were compared. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, the crude mortality rate (CMR) and standardized mortality rate (SMR) of Suzhou residents including respiratory disease, were not much different from those in previous years. During the emergency period, the CMR of Suzhou residents was 180.2/100,000 and the SMR was 85.5/100,000, decreasing by 9.1% and 14.6%, respectively; the CMR of respiratory disease was 16.4/100,000 and the SMR was 6.8/100,000, down 41.4% and 44.9%, respectively. Regardless of the mortality rates of all deaths or respiratory disease, the rates were higher in males than in females, although males had aslightly greater decrease in all deaths during the emergency period compared with females, and the opposite was true for respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, the death rate of residents decreased, especially that due to respiratory disease.","Huang, Chunyan; Lu, Yan; Wang, Linchi; Hua, Yujie; Xu, Jianrong; Wei, Xiaolin; Zhang, Zhengji; Zhang, Jun",Expert Rev Respir Med,,179

438369,"Suggestions from Cremona, Italy: 2 months into the pandemic at the frontline of COVID-19 in Europe",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Optimistic bias refers to the phenomenon that individuals believe bad things are less likely to happen to themselves than to others. However, whether optimistic bias could vary across age and culture is unknown. The present study aims to investigate: 1) whether individuals exhibit optimistic bias in the context of COVID-19 pandemic; 2) and whether age and culture would moderate such bias. METHOD: 1051 participants recruited from China, Israel and the US took the online survey. Risk perceptions consists of three questions: estimating the infected probability of different social distance groups (i.e., self, close others, and non-close others), the days that it would take for the number of new infections to decrease to zero and the trend of infections in regions of different geographical distances (i.e., local place, other places inside participants' country and other countries). Participants in China and the US also reported their personal communal values measured by Schwartz's Value Survey. RESULTS: Results from HLM generally confirmed that 1) all participants exhibited optimistic bias to some extent, and 2) with age, Chinese participants had a higher level of optimistic bias than Israeli and US participants. Compared to their younger counterparts, older Chinese are more likely to believe that local communities are at lower risk of COVID-19 than other countries. DISCUSSION: These findings support the hypothesis that age differences in risk perceptions might be influenced by cultural context. Further analysis indicated that such cultural and age variations in optimistic bias were likely to be driven by age-related increase in internalized cultural values.","Lin, Hongmei; Chang, Yuanqing; Chen, Chao; Ho, Yuen Wan; Xi, Wanyu; Zhang, Xin; Fung, Helene H; Ayalon, Liat",,,179

This study aims to assess COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in Latin American children, to appropriately plan and allocate resources to face the pandemic on a local and international level. METHODS: Ambispective multicenter cohort study from 5 Latin American countries. Children 18 years of age or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or fulfilling MIS-C definition were included. FINDINGS: Four hundred nine children were included, with a median age of 3.0 years (interquartile range 0.6-9.0). Of these, 95 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS-C. One hundred ninety-one (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. Ninety-two (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. Thirty-five (8.5%) patients required inotropic support. The following factors were associated with pediatric intensive care unit admission: preexisting medical condition (P < 0.0001), immunodeficiency (P = 0.01), lower respiratory tract infection (P < 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.006), radiologic changes suggestive of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P < 0.0001) and low socioeconomic conditions (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a generally more severe form of COVID-19 and a high number of MIS-C in Latin American children, compared with studies from China, Europe and North America, and support current evidence of a more severe disease in Latin/Hispanic children or in people of lower socioeconomic level.

The Golisano Institute for Developmental Disability Nursing identified this as an unmet need and created an online asynchronous course for DSPs on infection prevention and use of personal protective equipment to reduce transmission of COVID-19 among individuals with disabilities and DSPs. Constructivism, experiential learning theory, and active learning theory guided content development. The course used games to break-up dense information into more manageable chunks as a means to increase learner engagement and motivation. The course was delivered on a dynamic Learning Management System to allow for a variety of content authoring tools to be utilized. After evaluation, the course was disseminated to DSPs.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor can bind to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Then, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can be cleaved and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are potential antiviral targets for treatment of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we discovered that 10-250 µg/mL of GB-2, from Tian Shang Sheng Mu of Chiayi Puzi Peitian Temple, can inhibit ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression in HepG2 and 293 T cells without cytotoxicity. GB-2 treatment could decrease ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression level of lung tissue and kidney tissue without adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, in animal model. In the compositions of GB-2, we discovered that 50 µg/mL of theaflavin could inhibit protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Theaflavin could inhibit the mRNA expression of ACE2. In conclusion, our results suggest that GB-2 and theaflavin could act as potential compounds for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 inhibitors in the further clinical study.","Wu, Ching-Yuan; Lin, Yu-Shih; Yang, Yao-Hsu; Shu, Li-Hsin; Cheng, Yu-Ching; Liu, Hung Te",Biomed Pharmacother,,179

At the same time, social isolation restrictions have disrupted most in-person mental health services. Many mental health providers are adapting to the crisis by utilizing telemental health. However, the literature is scant about how to most effectively utilize telemental health practices with refugee clients, many of whom do not speak English and require an interpreter, may have limited technological proficiency or access, and/or have additional case management needs and coordination as part of their treatment plan. The purpose of this study is to understand how mental health clinicians and case workers at a refugee-serving mental health clinic are successfully shifting their face-to-face practice to telemental health, the obstacles they encounter, and what resources they have found to be helpful. Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) refugee mental health providers display initiative and flexibility in their adaptation to telemental health and (2) providers reported numerous obstacles to effective telemental health, including client barriers, tech barriers, communication issues, and the challenge of reading nonverbal cues virtually. By better understanding telemental health when working with refugees, clinical social workers will be more effective in meeting the needs of a population with significant mental health needs and limited mental healthcare access.","Disney, Lindsey; Mowbray, Orion; Evans, Dana",Clin Soc Work J,,179

To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first description of RRP after administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19, or any other currently available vaccine against COVID-19. Acute skin reactions were observed in 2 RT patients with differing timelines of RT and vaccinations. In both cases however, the RRP presented within days of the patient receiving the second dose of vaccine. For each RT course, the treatment planning dosimetry of the radiation fields was compared with the area of the observable RRP. RRP developed within the borders of treatment fields where prescription dose constraints were prioritized over skin sparing. Our observation is currently limited to 2 patients. The actual incidence of RRP in conjunction with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or any other vaccine against COVID-19 is unknown. For patients with cancer being treated with radiation with significant dose to skin, consideration should be given to the probability of RRP side effects from vaccinations against COVID-19.","Soyfer, Viacheslav; Gutfeld, Orit; Shamai, Sivan; Schlocker, Albert; Merimsky, Ofer",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,179

451125,The Courage to Return to Everyday Life at the Time of Covid-19: the Point of View of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Needing Endoscopy,2020,"Introduction: First spotted in Wuhan, China, World Health Organisation declared the deadly outbreak caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) as global pandemic on March 11, 2020. With over 72 million cases globally till December 2020, countries need to gear up to detect, isolate and treat Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases. Laboratories play a crucial role in diagnosis thereby instituting early contact tracing and quarantine measures. The laboratory based COVID-19 diagnostic testing data may help in formulating strategies to contain the spread of infection. Aim: To describe key patient variables of the respiratory samples processed for SARS-CoV-2 by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at a diagnostic laboratory. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive, single centre study carried out at ICMR approved COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory, nasopharyngeal swabs received in Viral Transport Medium (VTM) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RTPCR. Key patient variables, like age, gender, symptoms and sample positivity rate were tabulated. The demographic and clinical data of samples tested were summarised by medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for continuous variables and by proportions for categorical variables. Results: A total of 12,187 samples were received between 21st March to 8th July 2020. The data from 11,196 individuals were complete and were included in the analysis. Overall, 2,053 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 indicating positivity rate of 18.33%. Sample positivity was highest (63.91%) among high-risk contacts of a laboratory confirmed case. The maximum number of samples tested belonged to age group of 21-40 years and male predominance was observed. Conclusion: Although social distancing, mask usage, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquettes are important measures for containment of COVID-19, strengthening and capacity building of laboratory network is crucial for mitigating the pandemic.

451687,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19,2020,"Unfortunately, malaria still remains a major problem in tropical areas, and it takes thousands of lives each year and causes millions of infected cases. Besides, on December 2019, a new virus known as coronavirus appeared, that its rapid prevalence caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider it a pandemic. As a potential drug for controlling or treating these two undesired diseases at the cellular level, chloroquine and its derivatives are being investigated, although they possess side effects, which must be reduced for effective and safe treatments. With respect to the importance of this medicine, the current research aimed to calculate the solubility of chloroquine in supercritical carbon dioxide, and evaluated effect of pressure and temperature on the solubility. The pressure varied between 120 and 400â¯bar, and temperatures between 308 and 338â¯K were set for the measurements. The experimental results revealed that the solubility of chloroquine lies between 1.64â¯×â¯10-5 to 8.92â¯×â¯10-4 (mole fraction) with different functionality to temperature and pressure. Although the solubility was indicated to be strong function of pressure and temperature, the effect of temperature was more profound and complicated. A crossover pressure point was found in the solubility measurements, which indicated similar behaviour to an inflection point. For the pressures higher than the crossover point, the temperature indicated direct effect on the solubility of chloroquine. On the other hand, for pressures less than the crossover point, temperature enhancement led to a reduction in the solubility of chloroquine. Moreover, the obtained solubility results were correlated via semi-empirical density-based thermodynamic correlations. Five correlations were studied including: Kumar & Johnston, Mendez-Santiago-Teja, Chrastil, Bartle et al., and Garlapati & Madras. The best performance was obtained for Mendez-Santiago-Teja's correlation in terms of average absolute relative deviation percent (12.0%), while the other examined models showed almost the same performance for prediction of chloroquine solubility.","Pishnamazi, Mahboubeh; Hosseini, Saber; Zabihi, Samyar; Borousan, Fatemeh; Hezave, Ali Zeinolabedini; Marjani, Azam; Shirazian, Saeed",J Mol Liq,,179
452329,Clinical Trials for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Global Guidance During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"AIMS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a ubiquitous finding in inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths, but recent reports have also described additional atypical findings, including vascular changes. An aim of this study was to assess lung autopsy findings in COVID-19 inpatients, and in untreated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive individuals who died in the community, in order to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 represents a unique histological variant of DAD by comparing the pathological findings with those of uninfected control patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung sections from autopsy cases were reviewed by three pulmonary pathologists, including two who were blinded to patient cohort. The cohorts included four COVID-19 inpatients, four cases with postmortem SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses who died in the community, and eight SARS-CoV-2-negative control cases. DAD was present in all but one SARS-CoV-2-positive patient, who was asymptomatic and died in the community. Although SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were noted to have more focal perivascular inflammation/endothelialitis than control patients, there were no significant differences in the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi, airspace organisation, and 'acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia'-like intra-alveolar fibrin deposition between the cohorts. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, haemorrhage and capillaritis were not features of COVID-19-related DAD. CONCLUSIONS: DAD is the primary histological manifestation of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients who die both in hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxaemic mechanical ventilation to the histological changes. There are no distinctive morphological features with which to confidently differentiate COVID-19-related DAD from DAD due to other causes.","Konopka, Kristine E; Nguyen, Teresa; Jentzen, Jeffrey M; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J; Wilson, Allecia M; Farver, Carol F; Myers, Jeffrey L",Histopathology,,179
452330,Clinical Trials for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Global Guidance During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on vaccine responsiveness in patients who have received anti-CD20 therapy. PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to 4 January 2021 to identify studies of vaccine immunogenicity in patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy, including patients with hematologic malignancy or autoimmune disease. The primary outcomes were seroprotection (SP), seroconversion (SC), and/or seroresponse rates for each type of vaccine reported. As the pandemic influenza vaccine (2009 H1N1) has standardized definitions for SP and SC, and represented a novel primary antigen similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, meta-analysis was conducted for SC of studies of this vaccine. Pooled estimates, relative benefit ratios (RBs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Thirty-eight studies (905 patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy) were included (19 studies of patients with hematologic malignancies). Patients on active (<3 months since last dose) anti-CD20 therapy had poor responses to all types of vaccines. The pooled estimate for SC after 1 pandemic influenza vaccine dose in these patients was 3% (95% CI, 0% to 9%), with an RB of 0.05 (95% CI, 0-0.73) compared with healthy controls and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09-0.56) compared with disease controls. SC compared with controls seems abrogated for at least 6 months following treatment (3-6 months post anti-CD20 therapy with an RB of 0.50 [95% CI, 0.24-1.06] compared with healthy and of 0.44 [95% CI, 0.23-0.84] compared with disease controls). For all vaccine types, response to vaccination improves incrementally over time, but may not reach the level of healthy controls even 12 months after therapy.","Vijenthira, Abi; Gong, Inna; Betschel, Stephen D; Cheung, Matthew; Hicks, Lisa K",Blood Adv,,179

METHODS: The authors invited 355 dental trainees at the University of Washington School of Dentistry to complete an 83-item questionnaire in August and September 2020. The outcome analyzed was intention to leave their programs. There were 4 self-reported predictors: anxiety, burnout, depression, and COVID-19 impact on overall mental health. The authors ran multiple variable logistic regression models to evaluate relationships between each predictor and outcome (&#945; = .05) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 35.5%. Overall, 12.7% of participants reported any intention to leave. In total, 22.2% and 16.7% of participants endorsed clinically significant anxiety or depression symptomatology, respectively; 28.6% reported 1 or more burnout symptoms; and 69.0% reported that COVID-19 affected their overall mental health. Participants reporting anxiety (OR, 8.87; 95% CI, 1.80 to 43.57; P = .007), depression (OR, 11.18; 95% CI, 1.84 to 67.74; P = .009), or burnout (OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.73 to 38.23; P = .008) were significantly more likely to report intention to leave than those not reporting mental health problems. All participants reporting that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their mental health expressed intention to leave. CONCLUSIONS: Poor mental health is common among dental trainees and is associated with intention to leave their program. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 has exacerbated the prevalence and consequences of poor mental health among dental students, highlighting the importance of providing wellness resources.","Chi, Donald L; Randall, Cameron L; Hill, Courtney M",,,179

CoVs are known to generate negative subgenomes (subgenomic RNAs [sgRNAs]) through transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent template switching, but the global dynamic landscapes of coronaviral subgenomes and regulatory rules remain unclear. Here, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short-read and Nanopore long-read poly(A) RNA sequencing in two cell types at multiple time points after infection with SARS-CoV-2, we identified hundreds of template switches and constructed the dynamic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes. Interestingly, template switching could occur in a bidirectional manner, with diverse SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes generated from successive template-switching events. The majority of template switches result from RNA-RNA interactions, including seed and compensatory modes, with terminal pairing status as a key determinant. Two TRS-independent template switch modes are also responsible for subgenome biogenesis. Our findings reveal the subgenome landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and its regulatory features, providing a molecular basis for understanding subgenome biogenesis and developing novel anti-viral strategies.","Wang, Dehe; Jiang, Ao; Feng, Jiangpeng; Li, Guangnan; Guo, Dong; Sajid, Muhammad; Wu, Kai; Zhang, Qiuhan; Ponty, Yann; Will, Sebastian; Liu, Feiyan; Yu, Xinghai; Li, Shaopeng; Liu, Qianyun; Yang, Xing-Lou; Guo, Ming; Li, Xingqiao; Chen, Mingzhou; Shi, Zheng-Li; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu; Zhou, Yu",Mol. cell,,179

The guidelines evolve each day, however there are limited number of studies and trials in children regarding the drugs available, their dosage and their safety profiles. This review article details the drugs that have been tried against SARS CoV 2 infection from a pediatric perspective. The drugs have been classified into 3 main groups: (i) Drugs with antiviral activity like remedesvir, ivermectin and ribavirin that directly act on the virus affecting viral entry, assembly and replication.(ii) Drugs that are immunomodulators like anakinra and interferons which act upon the immune system to modulate the immune response to the virus (iii) Drugs that mitigate the complications like immunoglobulins, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants like aspirin which act at the cytokine release and in treatment of complications like Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Pediatric weight loused dosage and safety profiles have been established in other conditions and are being explored in SARS CoV2 infection in these drugs and many drugs are still to establish pediatric doses. (iv) Drugs that have been tried earlier were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin but have not shown any therapeutic benefit over the course of the pandemic. With the SARS CoV 2 global pandemic causing varied clinical pictures and outcomes in children, that differ from adults, knowledge of the drugs that can be used in children, their safety profile and their dosage is imperative and will guide the way in the future management of pediatric SARS CoV 2 infection.

PIM administration may result in iatrogenic disorders and adverse consequences may be attenuated by limiting PIM intake.Areas covered: The goal of this review article is to discuss the trends, risks, and concerns regarding PIM administration with focus on cardiovascular patients. To find data, we searched literature using electronic databases (Pubmed/Medline 1966-2021 and Web of Science 1975-2021). The data search terms were cardiovascular diseases, potentially inappropriate medication, potentially harmful drug-drug combination, potentially harmful drug-disease combination, drug interaction, deprescribing, and electronic health record.Expert opinion: Drugs for heart diseases are the most commonly prescribed medications in older individuals. Despite the availability of explicit and implicit PIM criteria, the incidence of PIM use in cardiovascular patients remains high ranging from 7 to 85% in different patient categories. Physician-induced disorders often occur when PIM is administered and adverse effects may be reduced by limiting PIM intake.

465537,Lung Transplantation during COVID19 Pandemic: Latam Experience,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the ultrasonic energy during MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) of uterine fibroids on molecular and tissue markers of endometrial receptivity in women of reproductive age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 60 women of reproductive age was conducted. The main group consisted of 32 patients suffering from the symptomatic course of uterine fibroids who received treatment with HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids. The control group consisted of 28 healthy fertile women examined voluntarily. The endometrium obtained with pipelle biopsy on days 20-22 of the cycle was examined by scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry before and three months after the treatment. The results were processed by the method of variation statistics using the SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: The focused ultrasound rays passing through the endometrium did not cause any change in the maturation rate or the state of intercellular contacts. At the same time, a significant increase in the frequency of asynchronous maturation of pinopodia was found to be 14.28% before HIFU versus 50.00% after HIFU; p = .021 and the number of heteromorphic secretory cells 5.88% before HIFU versus 53.33% after HIFU; p = .002 in implantation endometrium. A significant decrease in the stromal expression of CD95+bright in the endometrium to the level comparable with control values was observed after HIFU (from 70.22 ± 9.77 c/s to 48.81 ± 5.47 c/s; p < .001; the control level - 47.80 ± 2.13 c/s). The ratio and expression of steroid receptors, proliferation markers, p53-dependent apoptosis and its blockers, regulators and markers of angiogenesis, LIF and LIF-R signaling molecules in the stroma and endometrial glands did not change significantly after treatment. CONCLUSION: This study did not reveal any significant negative effects of HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids on endometrial receptivity in women of reproductive age.","Melkozerova, Oxana; Shchedrina, Irina; Gryshkina, Anastasia; Bashmakova, Nadezhda; Malgina, Galina; Michelson, Anna; Chistyakova, Guzel",Gynecol Endocrinol,,179

465828,Large Simple Double-Blind Randomized Trials for the Rapid Assessment of the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines,2020,"Research Ethics Committees (RECs)-or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), as they are known in the US-were created about 50 years ago to independently assess the ethical acceptability of research projects involving human subjects, their fundamental role being the protection of the dignity and rights of research participants. In this paper we develop some critical reflections about the current situation of RECs. Our starting point is the definition of the role they should ideally play, a role that should necessarily include a collaborative approach and the focus on the ethics component of the review. This ideal is unfortunately quite far from reality: inadequacies in the functioning of RECs have been discussed for decades, along with reform proposals. Both in the US and in the European Union (EU), reforms that aim at the centralization of the review process were recently approved. Even though these reforms were needed, they nonetheless raise concerns. We focus on two such concerns, related in particular to Regulation (EU) No 536/2014: the risk of narrowing the scope of the ethics review and that of disregarding the local context. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for the transition towards the centralized model and that an analysis of its impact on the research review process could provide some interesting insights into possible shortcomings of this new model. We conclude by identifying three objectives that define the role of a REC, objectives that any reform should preserve.","Tusino, Silvia; Furfaro, Maria",,,179

468356,Waitlisted Transplant Candidates' Attitudes and Concerns Toward Transplantation During COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: /Objectives: The management of acute pancreatitis (AP) in China has undergone major changes since the launch of the updated guideline in 2013. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this guideline on clinical practice and patient outcome. METHODS: Moderately severe and severe adult AP patients, who were admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2016, were retrospectively included in the study. All enrolled patients were divided into two groups based on the publication date of the updated guideline, as the pre-guideline (Pre) group and post-guideline (Post) group. In-hospital case-fatality rates were compared between two groups after adjusting baseline features, including gender, age, etiology and disease severity. In addition, the associations between specific therapeutic approaches recommended in the updated guideline and in-hospital case-fatality rates were explored. RESULTS: A total of 475 patients were enrolled in this study, including 273 (57%) in the Pre group and 202 (43%) in the Post group. The adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rate significantly decreased in the Post group (14.3% vs. 5.9%, OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.19-0.82). In the post-hoc analysis, the use of enteral nutrition was a protective factor against in-hospital death (OR: 0.08, 95%CI: 0.03-0.18), while open surgery showed an opposite effect (OR: 3.81, 95%CI: 1.06-13.74). Prophylactic antibiotics was not significantly associated with in-hospital death (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.39-2.60). CONCLUSIONS: There was a prominent transition in the management of moderately severe and severe AP after the release of the guideline in China in 2013, which made the prognosis better.","Bai, Xiaoyin; Jin, Meng; Zhang, Huimin; Lu, Bo; Yang, Hong; Qian, Jiaming",Pancreatology,,179
469022,COVID-19: Yet another coronavirus challenge in transplantation,2020,"Early analyses revealed that dark web marketplaces (DWMs) started offering COVID-19 related products (e.g., masks and COVID-19 tests) as soon as the current pandemic started, when these goods were in shortage in the traditional economy. Here, we broaden the scope and depth of previous investigations by analysing 194 DWMs until July 2021, including the crucial period in which vaccines became available, and by considering the wider impact of the pandemic on DWMs. First, we focus on vaccines. We find 250 listings offering approved vaccines, like Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca, as well as vendors offering fabricated proofs of vaccination and COVID-19 passports. Second, we consider COVID-19 related products. We reveal that, as the regular economy has become able to satisfy the demand of these goods, DWMs have decreased their offer. Third, we analyse the profile of vendors of COVID-19 related products and vaccines. We find that most of them are specialized in a single type of listings and are willing to ship worldwide. Finally, we consider a broader set of listings simply mentioning COVID-19. Among 10,330 such listings, we show that recreational drugs are the most affected among traditional DWMs product, with COVID-19 mentions steadily increasing since March 2020. We anticipate that our effort is of interest to researchers, practitioners, and law enforcement agencies focused on the study and safeguard of public health.","Bracci, Alberto; Nadini, Matthieu; Aliapoulios, Maxwell; McCoy, Damon; Gray, Ian; Teytelboym, Alexander; Gallo, Angela; Baronchelli, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05470v4.pdf,179

Besides clinical risk factors (such as numerous comorbidities, immune disorders), dialysis patients are additionally exposed to the virus through regular stays for several hours in a dialysis center and ambulance journeys. In such an epidemiological situation, it seems that peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis are good alternatives for treatment. Currently available telemedicine and medical technologies allow for effective renal replacement therapy also outside dialysis centers. Thanks to this, it is possible to limit the stay of patients in a medical facility to clinically justified situations. For this reason, increasing the number of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis, which is carried out at home and without contact with medical personnel, seems to be a good solution. Enabling patients to undergo home hemodialysis treatment, nowadays unavailable in Poland and establishing it as a guaranteed benefit in the health care system will enable renal replacement therapy to be adapted to the clinical condition and the need for isolation.","Zebrowski, Pawel; Zawierucha, Jacek; Marcinkowski, Wojciech; Prystacki, Tomasz; Chomicka, Inga; Malyszko, Jolanta",Wiad Lek,,179

We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were adolescents and adults admitted with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62).

471531,Socioeconomic disparities and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance: a nationwide ecologic study,2021,"Helicobacter pylori is a class one carcinogen which causes chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The mechanisms by which H. pylori interacts with other risk and protective factors, particularly vitamin C in gastric carcinogenesis are complex. Gastric carcinogenesis includes metabolic, environmental, epigenetic, genomic, infective, inflammatory and oncogenic pathways. The molecular classification of gastric cancer subtypes has revolutionized the understanding of gastric carcinogenesis. This includes the tumour microenvironment, germline mutations, and the role of Helicobacter pylori bacteria, Epstein Barr virus and epigenetics in somatic mutations. There is evidence that ascorbic acid, phytochemicals and endogenous antioxidant systems can modify the risk of gastric cancer. Gastric juice ascorbate levels depend on dietary intake of ascorbic acid but can also be decreased by H. pylori infection, H. pylori CagA secretion, tobacco smoking, achlorhydria and chronic atrophic gastritis. Ascorbic acid may be protective against gastric cancer by its antioxidant effect in gastric cytoprotection, regenerating active vitamin E and glutathione, inhibiting endogenous N-nitrosation, reducing toxic effects of ingested nitrosodimethylamines and heterocyclic amines, and preventing H. pylori infection. The effectiveness of such cytoprotection is related to H. pylori strain virulence, particularly CagA expression. The role of vitamin C in epigenetic reprogramming in gastric cancer is still evolving. Other factors in conjunction with vitamin C also play a role in gastric carcinogenesis. Eradication of H. pylori may lead to recovery of vitamin C secretion by gastric epithelium and enable regression of premalignant gastric lesions, thereby interrupting the Correa cascade of gastric carcinogenesis.","Toh, James W T; Wilson, Robert B",,,179

The research is based on an analytical and empirical approach. The starting point of the research is a critical and comprehensive analysis of the relevant literature regarding the efficiency of organizations due to teleworking, digital information security, and cyber risk management. The quantitative approach is based on designing a structural equation model (SEM) on a sample of 1101 respondents from the category of employees in Montenegro. Within the model, we examine simultaneously the impact of their perceptions on the risks of teleworking, changes in cyber-attacks during teleworking, organizations’ capacity to respond to cyber-attacks, key challenges in achieving an adequate response to cyber-attacks, as well as perceptions of key challenges related to cybersecurity. The empirical aspects of our study involve constructing latent variables that correspond to different elements of employee perception;namely, their perception of organizational efficiency and the extent to which the digital information security of their organizations has been threatened during teleworking during the pandemic.","Mihailović, Andreja Cerović Smolović Julija Radević Ivan Rašović Neli Martinović Nikola",Sustainability,,179

METHODS: Diagnoses were compared by examining the patient files of the 3-month period when the pandemic was influential in our country and the 2-week non-pandemic period corresponding to the same season a year ago. The outpatient diagnoses in the first month and the last month of the 3-month pandemic period were also compared. RESULTS: During the 3-month pandemic process, the most common reasons for applying to the outpatient clinic were acne, urticaria, psoriasis, and allergic/irritant contact dermatitis. Urticaria, psoriasis, allergic/irritant contact dermatitis, scabies, liken planus, mycosis fungoides, zona zoster, recurrent aphthous stomatitis and polymorph light eruption were statistically more common in the pandemic period. Moreover, acne, other eczematous dermatities, verruca, androgenic alopecia, and melanocytic nevus diagnoses were found to decrease statistically during the pandemic period when compared with the non-pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Unlike other studies, the present study evaluated the patient diagnoses during the pandemic period and the period a year before and discussed the possible reasons for the changes in patient profiles.","Turkmen, Dursun; Altunisik, Nihal; Mantar, Irem; Durmaz, Imge; Sener, Serpil; Colak, Cemil",Int J Clin Pract,,179

DESIGN: A follow-up online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Among the 1,600 baseline online survey participants, 388 adults were already frail, and 275 older adults did not respond to the follow-up survey. Thus, the final number of participants in this study was 937 (follow-up rate: 77.3%). METHODS: We assessed the total PA time at four time points according to the COVID-19 waves in Japan: January 2020 (before the pandemic), April 2020 (during the first wave), August 2020 (during the second wave), and January 2021 (during the third wave). We then investigated the incidence of frailty during a one-year follow-up period (during the pandemic). RESULTS: The total PA time during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic decreased from the pre-pandemic PA time by 33.3%, 28.3%, and 40.0%, respectively. In particular, the total PA time of older adults who were living alone and socially inactive decreased significantly: 42.9% (first wave), 50.0% (second wave), and 61.9% (third wave) less than before the pandemic, respectively. Additionally, they were at a significantly higher risk of incident frailty than those who were not living alone and were socially active (adjusted odds ratio: 2.04 [95% confidence interval: 1.01-4.10]). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that older adults who live alone and are socially inactive are more likely to experience incident frailty/disability due to decreased PA during the pandemic. Understanding this mechanism may be crucial for maintaining the health status of older adults.","Yamada, M; Kimura, Y; Ishiyama, D; Otobe, Y; Suzuki, M; Koyama, S; Kikuchi, T; Kusumi, H; Arai, H",J Nutr Health Aging,,179

478327,Screening for active COVID-19 infection prior to biologic therapy in IBD patients: Let's not increase our uncertainty without reducing our concerns,2020,"The impact of nutrition on recovery from various illnesses is well recognised. Malnutrition can affect duration of hospitalisation and impede recovery, and therefore it is important to monitor this condition, especially in at-risk groups, such as older adults and those with chronic disease. Underlying malnutrition impairs the immune system, potentially making people more vulnerable to infections such as COVID-19 and impacting recovery. Patients recovering from severe illness are likely to have muscle wasting or feel weak and may have increased protein needs. In addition individuals who have been discharged from hospital may need ongoing nutritional rehabilitation. This article explores the range of symptoms of COVID-19 that can interfere with dietary intake, such as respiratory issues, loss of taste and smell and fatigue and weakness. It goes on to describe how community nurses can identify risk of malnutrition and dietary issues when working remotely. Additionally, it signposts to a range of resources developed to assist patients and carers in accessing appropriate dietary advice.","Holdoway, Anne",Br J Community Nurs,,179
479518,Fatal outcome of anti-MDA5 juvenile dermatomyositis in a pediatric COVID-19 patient: a case report,2020,"BACKGROUND: The death toll of COVID-19 topped 170,000 in Europe by the end of May 2020. COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially among doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the mental health of medical professionals with nonmedical professionals in different European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. We also aimed to determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in 8 European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and inquired whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales32 (23.53)-21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors were completed by medical professionals. RESULTS: The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses, and 255 nonmedical professionals. Participants from France and the United Kingdom reported experiencing severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress more often compared to those from the other countries. Nonmedical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals, no significant link was reported between direct contact with patients with COVID-19 at work and anxiety, depression, or stress. ""Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under control"" caused the most amount of stress for health care professionals while ""taking protective measures"" was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety, and stress. Even though medical professionals exhibited less mental stress than nonmedical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Du, Junfeng; Posenato, Elisabetta; Resende de Almeida, Rosa Maria; Losada, Raquel; Ribeiro, Oscar; Frisardi, Vincenza; Hopper, Louise; Rashid, Asarnusch; Nasser, Habib; König, Alexandra; Rudofsky, Gottfried; Weidt, Steffi; Zafar, Ali; Gronewold, Nadine; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik",J Med Internet Res,,179

The method uses peak parking experiments conducted on particles that were previously stripped of their stationary phase by flushing the column with trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature of 60°C. Further using pure organic solvents as the mobile phase, any potential retention or surface diffusion effect is omitted. To avoid interference between the parked peaks and baseline disturbances typically occurring when switching on and off the flow, peak parking experiments were carried out in a set-up wherein two identical columns were used in parallel. This set-up allowed to maintain the flow through the detector at all times, by redirecting the flow from one column to the other during the peak parking experiments. Several tracer molecules (ionic and deuterated tracers) were compared and it was found that the use of deuterated molecules provides the best possible coverage of the accessible space of the mesopore volume. Interpreting the peak parking responses obtained with these tracers with a model based on the effective medium theory (EMT) subsequently provided an estimate of the value of the mesopore diffusion obstruction factor Î³mp. Taking the well-established pore hindrance factor F(&#955;) correction into account, the obtained experimental Î³mp-values are more in agreement with the tortuous and constricted diffusion paths one can expect in the void space within a structure resembling a monolithic skeleton with tetrahedral connectivity rather than in the void space formed by a packing of nanospheres. This is also more in line with the measured internal porosity values lying around Îµpz=0.5, whereas a packing of nanospheres would rather correspond to an Îµpz of 0.4. As such, the presented protocol provides a means to infer the internal mesopore structure of reversed-phase particles.","Song, Huiying; Desmet, Gert; Cabooter, Deirdre",J Chromatogr A,,179

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","Chakraborty, Sandipan",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,179

This study aims to estimate the risk of disease progression of patients who have been confirmed with COVID-19. Methods: Meta-analysis was performed in existing literatures to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia progression. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to hospitals in Wuhan or Hangzhou were retrospectively enrolled. The risk prediction model and nomogram were developed from Wuhan cohort through logistic regression algorithm, and then validated in Hangzhou and Yinchuan cohorts. Results: A total of 270 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 30, 2019, and Mar 30, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled (Table 1). The development cohort (Wuhan cohort) included 87 (43%) men and 115 (57%) women, and the median age was 53 years old. Hangzhou validation cohort included 20 (48%) men and 22 (52%) women, and the median age was 59 years old. Yinchuan validation cohort included 12 (46%) men and 14 (54%) women, and the median age was 44 years old. The meta-analysis along with univariate logistic analysis in development cohort have shown that age, fever, diabetes, hypertension, CREA, BUN, CK, LDH, and neutrophil count were significantly associated with disease progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. The model and nomogram derived from development cohort show good performance in both development and validation cohorts. Conclusion: The severe COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with various types of risk factors including age, fever, comorbidities, and some laboratory examination indexes. The model integrated with these factors can help to evaluate the disease progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Cao, Guodong; Li, Pengping; Chen, Yuanyuan; Fang, Kun; Chen, Bo; Wang, Shuyue; Feng, Xudong; Wang, Zhenyu; Xiong, Maoming; Zheng, Ruiying; Guo, Mengzhe; Sun, Qiang",Front Med (Lausanne),,179

485665,Ongoing challenges in unravelling the association between COVID-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome,2021,"Prolonged and unexplained fevers in young adults are uncommon, especially when access to diagnostic tests is simplified. Therefore, the definition of unexplained fever depends on the volume of tests performed. However, low-grade fever has not been a priority in research. Management of low-grade fever [eg, an oral temperature of ≥37.8°C (100°F) and &lt;38.3°C (101°F) at any time of the day] is not codified. The presented case of a 37-year-old nurse with an intermittent fever for three months, with no clear diagnostic evidence and no elevated markers of inflammation, illustrates “habitual hyperthermia” (HH)—retained after ordering tests sequentially in town and at the hospital. HH was made known by Prof. H.A. Reimann (1897–1986) an American virologist, although the diagnostic criteria are fallible. The article reviews the criteria and then discusses how to select diagnostic tests in family practice for prolonged fever in young adults without clinical signs of orientation. Given the polymorphism of febrile illnesses, the principle of parsimony must be transgressed, and in the event of an early suspicion of HH, surveillance is a rule to be further amended.","Ginier-Gillet, M.; Esparcieux, A.",International Journal of General Medicine,,179
485941,Invasive Aspergillosis associated with Covid-19: A word of caution,2021,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19, the newly emerging infectious disease, has been associated with acute liver injury, often related to progression to severe pneumonia. The association between moderate-severe liver injury and more severe clinical course of COVID-19 has suggested that liver injury is prevalent in severe than in mild cases of COVID-19, while no difference in liver involvement has been reported between survivors and non-survivors. The spectrum of liver involvement during COVID-19 ranges from an asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatitis. Only rarely, cases with acute hepatitis have been reported in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Both epithelial and biliary cells possess the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 uses to be internalized. However, to our knowledge, no ultrastructural identification of the virus in liver cells has been reported to date. Here we provide evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver of two patients, a 34-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated two patients with COVID-19 showing several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. In both patients, we performed histological and ultrastructural examinations by liver biopsy. After two months, both patients were free of symptoms, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection had resolved. RESULTS: Liver biopsy histological and ultrastructural examination showed liver injury and several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. CONCLUSIONS: Although most studies in COVID-19 have been focused on the lungs, recently, cholestatic liver pathology has been introduced in the spectrum of pathological changes related to COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, those presented in this paper are the first images of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infected liver cells. Our findings suggest a role for cholangiocytes and biliary structures in the COVID-19.","Pirisi, M; Rigamonti, C; D039,; Alfonso, S; Nebuloni, M; Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Orrù, G; Venanzi Rullo, E; Pavone, P; Faa, G; Saba, L; Boldorini, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,179

The inhibitory capability of active compounds in the TA from Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam over the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in human body - the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the main protease (PDB6LU7) of the SARS-CoV-2 using docking simulation has been studied herein. The results indicate that the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins were strongly inhibited by 10 out of 24 compounds accounting for 70.9% in the TA. The most powerful anticoronavirus activity is expressed in the order: Terpineol (TA2) ≈ Guaiol (TA5) ≈ Linalool (TA19) &gt; Cineol (TA1) &gt; β-Selinenol (TA3) &gt; α-Eudesmol (TA4) &gt; γ-Eudesmol (TA7). Interestingly, the synergistic interactions of these 10 substances of the TA exhibit excellent inhibition into the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins.

Contudo, há poucos estudos genéticos realizados com esta espécie, especialmente de melhoramento genético. Para a construção de um mapa genético desta espécie, é necessário o desenvolvimento de um elevado número de marcadores moleculares. Desta forma, este estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar microssatélites gene-associados e neutros (não gênicos), obtidos por Next Generation Sequencing (RNA-seq e Whole Genome Shotgun - WGS, respectivamente), para serem disponibilizados em estudos de associação com QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci) e construção de um mapa genético. De modo geral, a avaliação de 200 marcadores (100 de cada conjunto) resultou em 45 loci polimórficos. Do conjunto de marcadores RNA-seq, as heterozigosidades observada e esperada (HO e HE) variaram de 0,09 a 0,73, e 0,09 a 0,85, respectivamente. Do conjunto WGS, HO e HE variaram de 0,33 a 0,95, e 0,28 a 0,92, respectivamente. Posteriormente, alguns microssatélites foram testados em três famílias de C. macropomum para buscar associações com características de resistência à bactéria e crescimento. Para o estudo de resistência, três famílias (n = 120), foram submetidas ao desafio bacteriano com Aeromonas hydrophila. Os dados do desafio apresentaram diferenças significativas nos tempos de morte e taxa de mortalidade entre as famílias. O crescimento foi avaliado por medidas morfométricas e peso, sendo que todas as características estavam correlacionadas significativamente (p < 0,01). Análises de associação microssatélite/fenótipo sugeriram que o marcador gene-associado c3842 (tncrc6b) está associado ao comprimento padrão (CP) e um marcador neutro (r912) com a altura 2 (A2). O presente estudo possibilitou prospectar marcadores moleculares associados com crescimento que poderão ser utilizados na validação de seleção assistida por marcadores em famílias de tambaqui.

We are proposing a connected Internet of Things ( IoT) based paradigm that makes use of object detection based on convolution neural networks (CNN), smart wearable and connected e-health to avoid current and future outbreaks. First, connected surveillance cameras feed continuous video stream to the server where we detect the inter-object distance to identify any social distancing violations. A violation activates area-based monitoring of active smartphone users and their current state of illness. In case a confirmed patient or a person with high symptoms is present, the system tracks exposed and infected people and appropriate measures are put into actions.

This study sought to share our experiences with in-hospital management and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive AMI patients, including those with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), from February 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), and from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic), respectively. Fifty-three AMI patients (31 STEMI, 22 NSTEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic were matched to 53 AMI patients before the pandemic. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the matched patients. STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer delay time, less primary or remedial PCI and more emergency thrombolysis than those before the pandemic. Less coronary angiography and stenting were performed in AMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the matched patients. However, STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a 4-fold (12.9% vs. 3.2%) increase in all-cause mortality rate compared with those before the pandemic. AMI combined with COVID-19 infection was associated with higher rates of mortality than AMI alone. This study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic results in significant reperfusion delays in STEMI patients and has a marked impact on the treatment options selection in AMI patients. The mortality rate of STEMI patients exhibits an increasing trend during the pandemic of COVID-19.","Huang, Bing; Xu, Changwu; Liu, Huafen; Deng, Wei; Yang, Zheng; Wan, Jun; Yan, Hui; Cao, Guiqiu; Chen, Jing; Jiang, Hong",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,,179

We sought to investigate the baseline characteristics, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes of a wide cohort < 65 years admitted for COVID-19. Using the international multicenter HOPE-COVID-19 registry, we evaluated the baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, therapeutic approach, and prognosis of patients < 65 years discharged (deceased or alive) after hospital admission for COVID-19, also compared with the elderly counterpart. Of the included 5746 patients, 2676 were < 65 and 3070 &#8805; 65 years. All risk factors and several parameters suggestive of worse clinical presentation augmented through increasing age classes. In-hospital mortality rates were 6.8% and 32.1% in the younger and older cohort, respectively (p < 0.001). Among young patients, mortality, access to ICU and treatment with IMVwere positively correlated with age. Contrariwise, over 65 years of age this trend was broken so that only the association between age and mortality was persistent, while the rates of access to ICU and IMV started to decline. Younger patients also recognized specific predictors of case fatality, such as obesity and gender. Age negatively impacts on mortality, access to ICU and treatment with IMV in patients < 65 years. In elderly patients only case fatality rate keeps augmenting in a stepwise manner through increasing age categories, while therapeutic approaches become more conservative. Besides age, obesity, gender, history of cancer, and severe dyspnea, tachypnea, chest X-ray bilateral abnormalities, abnormal level of creatinine and leucocyte among admission parameters seem to play a central role in the outcome of patients younger than 65 years.","Pepe, Martino; Maroun-Eid, Charbel; Romero, Rodolfo; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Fernàndez-Rozas, Inmaculada; Aparisi, Alvaro; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel; Garcìa Aguado, Marcos; Brindicci, Gaetano; Huang, Jia; Alfonso-Rodríguez, Emilio; Castro-Mejía, Alex Fernando; Favretto, Serena; Cerrato, Enrico; Albiol, Paloma; Raposeiras-Roubin, Sergio; Vedia, Oscar; Feltes Guzmãn, Gisela; Carrero-Fernández, Ana; Perez Cimarra, Clara; Buzón, Luis; Jativa Mendez, Jorge Luis; Abumayyaleh, Mohammad; Corbi-Pascual, Miguel; Macaya, Carlos; Estrada, Vicente; Nestola, Palma Luisa; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Núñez-Gil, Iván J",Clin. exp. med,,179

As yet, no satisfactory vaccine or medication has been developed that could guarantee its mitigation, though several efforts and trials are underway. Countries around the globe are striving to overcome the COVID-19 spread and while they are finding out ways for early detection and timely treatment. In this regard, healthcare experts, researchers and scientists have delved into the investigation of existing as well as new technologies. The situation demands development of a clinical decision support system to equip the medical staff ways to timely detect this disease. The state-of-the-art research inArtificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML) and cloud computing have encouraged healthcare experts to find effective detection schemes. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the role of AI & ML in investigating prediction techniques for the COVID-19. A mathematical model has been formulated to analyze and detect its potential threat. The proposed model is a cloud-based smart detection algorithm using support vector machine (CSDC-SVM) with cross-fold validation testing. The experimental results have achieved an accuracy of 98.4% with 15-fold cross-validation strategy.

METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentric survey was developed and disseminated online to various academic EDs in India and followed up over a period of 8 wk. All results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-eight academic emergency medicine departments responded to the study. Compared with pre-COVID period, COVID-19 pandemic has led to 90% of centers developing separate triage system with dedicated care areas for COVID suspected/infected in 78.6% centers with nearly 70% using separate transportation pathways. Strategizing and executing the Institutional COVID-19 treatment protocol in 80% institutes were done by emergency physicians. Training exercises for airway management and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were seen in 93% and 80% centers, respectively. Marked variation in recommended PPE use was observed across EDs in India. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the high variance in the level of preparedness response among various EDs across India during the pandemic. Preparedness for different EDs across India needs to be individually assessed and planned according to the needs and resources available.","Gopinathan, Vivek; Kunju, Sanjan Asanaru; Krishnan S, Vimal; Sirur, Freston Marc; Balakrishnan, Jayaraj Mymbilly",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,179

Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence. METHODS: We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (N = 6,172 unique participants; N = 28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modeled the interaction of time by COVID-19 burden, defined as whether the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance. RESULTS: Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster than those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002). Trends were heterogeneous between states, but there was no evidence of systematic geographic clustering of state trends.

AIM: To describe changes in loneliness, mental health problems, and attendance to scheduled medical care before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Telephone survey on a pre-existing cohort of older adults with multimorbidity in primary care. METHOD: Mental health and health service utilisation outcomes were compared with the outcomes before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong using paired t-tests, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, and McNemar's test. Loneliness was measured by the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) were measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Appointments attendance data were extracted from a computerised medical record system. Sociodemographic factors associated with outcome changes were examined by linear regression and generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: Data were collected from 583 older (&#8805;60 years) adults. There were significant increases in loneliness, anxiety, and insomnia, after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Missed medical appointments over a 3-month period increased from 16.5% 1 year ago to 22.0% after the onset of the outbreak. In adjusted analysis, being female, living alone, and having >4 chronic conditions were independently associated with increased loneliness. Females were more likely to have increased anxiety and insomnia. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial health of older patients with multimorbidity markedly deteriorated and missed medical appointments substantially increased after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Zhang, Dexing; Sit, Regina Wing Shan; Yip, Benjamin Hon Kei; Chung, Roger Yat-Nork; Wong, Carmen Ka Man; Chan, Dicken Cheong Chun; Sun, Wen; Kwok, Kin On; Mercer, Stewart W",Br J Gen Pract,,179

AIMS: To determine the user and clinician satisfaction during this period and compare to a pre-COVID-19 cohort. METHODS: A prospectively collected voluntary questionnaire following the telehealth appointment at a tertiary-level hospital with all adult and paediatric-based specialities was conducted over two time periods: COVID-19 (16 March 2020 to 15 April 2020) and pre-COVID-19 (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019). There were four groups of participants: patients; parents; adult-based clinicians; and paediatric-based clinicians. The outcomes assessed included perceived standard of care, willingness for repeat telehealth consultations, and patient and parental perceptions of safety. RESULTS: Five thousand and thirty-three telehealth consultations occurred in the COVID-19 period with 1757 questionnaires completed, compared to 1917 consultations with 271 questionnaires completed in the pre-COVID-19 period. Clinicians were more likely to have previously used telehealth in both time periods than end-users. In COVID-19, 1240 actual onsite hospital outpatients' visits were prevented. All groups reported a good overall impression of the telehealth quality; patients/parents scored higher compared to clinicians: 3.6/4 versus 3.3/4, P = 0.02 (pre-COVID-19) and 3.3/4 versus 2.8/4, P = 0.001 (COVID-19). The majority of patients and parents (90%, 1379/1528) felt safer by having a telehealth appointment compared to a face-to-face appointment in the COVID-19 pandemic. All participant groups reported an overall good standard of care, good levels of engagement and were strongly willing to use telehealth again in both of the study time periods. Patients and parents consistently rated higher than clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: During a rapid increase in its utilisation and scope due to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth was generally well accepted by patients, parents and clinicians, which was consistent with pre-COVID-19 experiences.","Bate, Nicole J; Xu, Simon C; Pacilli, Maurizio; Roberts, Lynden J; Kimber, Chris; Nataraja, Ramesh M",Intern Med J,,179
509040,COVID-19 in Lung-Transplant Recipients: A Descriptive Study,2021,"BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic. With the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 patients, it is imperative to explore the factors related to the disease to aid patient management until a definitive vaccine is ready, as the disease is not limited to the respiratory system alone. COVID-19 has been associated with various cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The infection is severe in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and a systemic inflammatory response due to a cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases can lead to acute myocardial infarction. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 56-year-old man with cardiovascular risk factors including coronary artery disease, hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperlipidemia, who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. He subsequently developed myocardial infarction during his hospitalization at our facility. He had a significant contact history for COVID-19. He was managed with emergent cardiac revascularization after COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing from a nasopharyngeal swab as per hospital policy for admitted patients. Apart from dual antiplatelet therapy, tocilizumab therapy was initiated due to the high interleukin-6 levels. His hospitalization was complicated by hemodialysis and failed extubation and intubation, resulting in a tracheostomy. Upon improvement, he was discharged to a long-term facility with a plan for outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In high-risk patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and cardiovascular risk factors, a severe systemic inflammatory response can lead to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which can manifest as acute coronary syndrome.","Sheikh, Abu Baker; Shekhar, Rahul; Javed, Nismat; Upadhyay, Shubhra",Am J Case Rep,,179
509103,Challenge in diagnosis of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patient: a case report and brief review of the literature,2021,"AIM: The present work concerns the comparison of the performances of three systems for dosimetry in RPT that use different techniques for absorbed dose calculation (organ-level dosimetry, voxel-level dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations). The aim was to assess the importance of the choice of the most adequate calculation modality, providing recommendations about the choice of the computation tool. METHODS: The performances were evaluated both on phantoms and patients in a multi-level approach. Different phantoms filled with a 177Lu-radioactive solution were used: a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, a phantom with organ-shaped inserts and two cylindrical phantoms with inserts different for shape and volume. A total of 70 patients with NETs treated by PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATOC were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: The comparisons were performed mainly between the mean values of the absorbed dose in the regions of interest. A general better agreement was obtained between Dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations results rather than between either of these two and organ-level dosimetry, both for phantoms and patients. Phantoms measurements also showed the discrepancies mainly depend on the geometry of the inserts (e.g. shape and volume). For patients, differences were more pronounced than phantoms and higher inter/intra patient variability was observed. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that voxel-level techniques for dosimetry calculation are potentially more accurate and personalized than organ-level methods. In particular, a voxel-convolution method provides good results in a short time of calculation, while Monte Carlo based computation should be conducted with very fast calculation systems for a possible use in clinics, despite its intrinsic higher accuracy. Attention to the calculation modality is recommended in case of clinical regions of interest with irregular shape and far from spherical geometry, in which Monte Carlo seems to be more accurate than voxel-convolution methods.","Finocchiaro, Domenico; Berenato, Salvatore; Bertolini, Valentina; Castellani, Gastone; Lanconelli, Nico; Versari, Annibale; Spezi, Emiliano; Iori, Mauro; Fioroni, Federica; Grassi, Elisa",PLoS One,,179

All the life cycle stages from egg to egg-producing adults were elucidated under natural conditions and successfully established in the laboratory. The life cycle took about 58 to 65 days for completion. Miracidia were released by teasing the eggs with fine needles. Sporocysts were found in the freshwater snail, Bithynia (Digoniostoma) pulchella, collected from paddy fields at Payode, Western Ghats, Wayanad region, in the months of October and November 2019. Cercariae were of the virgulate xiphidiocercous type. Metacercariae were recovered from the eyes of the damselfly naiads of the species Ischnura sp. and Copera sp., and the thorax and abdomen of the dragonfly naiads, Orthetrum sp. The metacercariae showed progenetic development. The growth and development of the metacercariae in the naiads that were exposed to cercariae, and development of the trematode in frogs that were force-fed with encysted metacercariae, have been studied at regular intervals. The prepatent period is 14-19 days.

Use of Hydroxychloroquine in a Patient with COVID-19 Infection and G6PD Deficiency",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The recent global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic with a lot of sufferers. Excessive inflammation, exaggerated immune response, with ultimate apoptosis contribute to COVID-19 pathology that progress to acute lung acute respiratory distress. OBJECTIVE: To shed a light on the likely beneï¬ts of the oral phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor adjuvant role in combating COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A literature review was performed in the PubMed/Medline database, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases using the keywords COVID-19; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors; cytokine storm; respiratory distress. RESULTS: Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, still no drugs are validated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in large-scale studies. While the progress toward a curative agent and/or vaccine is certainly hopeful, the principal limiting factor in such public health emergencies is always the time. Therefore, a preexisting licensed therapeutic(s) might offer a reprieve to the healthcare systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this context, the innovation of oral PDE5 inhibitors with their valuable effects on erection have provided a breakthrough in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and opened new fields of clinical application for this class of drugs. Oral PDE5 inhibitors have been demonstrated to possess many beneficial useful additional implications with acknowledged anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties have been elucidated through the nitric oxide/soluble guanylyl cyclase/cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway in addition to the emerged hemeoxygenase-1 enzyme as well as hydrogen sulfide pathways. These properties could support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in targeting different aspects of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Oral PDE5 inhibitors retain several acknowledged off-labeled useful implications with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties may support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in the protocols combating COVID-19 manifestations. Mostafa T.

Macrophages swallow oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to promote foam cell formation. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) has been reported to take part in atherosclerotic development. However, the effects of PAR2 in macrophages were rarely investigated. In this study, human monocyte, THP-1 was induced to macrophages by using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Subsequently, an in vitro model was arranged by using ox-LDL to treat the macrophages. The data showed that inhibition of PAR2 reduced ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Additionally, ox-LDL increased PAR2 and inhibited Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) expression, which is a Wnt signaling inhibitor. PAR2 knocked-down decreased DKK1 and enhanced expression of Wnt3a, ß-catenin. Meanwhile, DKK1 overexpression reversed the effects of PAR2 on foam cell formation, inflammation, and apoptosis. In summary, PAR2 is essential for the formation of foam cells, inflammation, and apoptosis in macrophages which plays a critical role during atherosclerosis. PAR2 plays roles in macrophages treated with ox-LDL via DKK1/Wnt/ß-catenin signaling.","Liu, Yongsheng; Wei, Mei; Liu, Gang; Song, Chunmei; Yang, Man; Cao, Zelong; Zheng, Mingq",Gen Physiol Biophys,,179
512333,Tracheoesophageal Fistula in a COVID-19 Ventilated Patient: A Challenging Therapeutic Decision,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Delays in elective surgery caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a substantial backlog of cases. In the current study, we sought to determine the estimated time to recovery for vascular surgery procedures delayed due to COVID-19 in a regional health system METHODS: Utilizing data from a 35-hospital regional vascular surgical collaborative consisting of all hospitals performing vascular surgery in the state of Michigan, a 35-hospital regional health collaborative consisting of all hospitals completing vascular surgery procedures within the state of Michigan, we estimated delayed surgical cases for adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, endovascular and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and lower extremity bypass. We utilized Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to predict surgical volume in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic and utilized historical data to predict elective surgical recovery time. RESULTS: Median statewide monthly vascular surgical volume for the study period was 439 procedures, with a maximum statewide monthly case volume of 519 procedures. For the month of April 2020, elective vascular surgery procedural volume decreased by approximately 90%. Significant variability was seen in estimated hospital capacity as well as estimated backlogged cases, with the recovery of elective cases estimated to take approximately 8 months. If hospitals across the collaborative share the burden of backlogged cases, the recovery could be shortened to approximately 3 months. CONCLUSION: In this study of vascular surgical volume in a regional health collaborative, elective surgical procedures decreased by 90% resulting in a backlog of over 700 cases. Recovery time if all hospitals in the collaborative share the burden of backlogged cases would be reduced from 8 months to 3 months, underscoring the necessity of regional and statewide policies to minimize patient harm due to delays in recovery for elective surgery.","Brown, Craig S; Albright, Jeremy; Henke, Peter K; Mansour, M Ashraf; Weaver, Mitchell; Osborne, Nicholas H",J. vasc. surg,,179

Optimal thromboprophylaxis is unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the characteristics of patients with a confirmed thrombotic complication including inflammatory and hemostatic parameters, compare patients affected by arterial vs venous events and examine differences between survivors and non-survivors. We reviewed compliance with thromboprophylaxis and explored how the implementation of a severity-adjusted protocol could have influenced outcome. METHODS: Single-cohort retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted, from March 3 to May 3 2020, to the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, epicenter of the Spanish outbreak. RESULTS: Among 1127 patients, 80 thrombotic events were diagnosed in 69 patients (6.1% of the entire cohort). Forty-three patients (62%) suffered venous thromboembolism, 18 (26%) arterial episodes and 6 (9%) concurrent venous and arterial thrombosis. Most patients (90%) with a confirmed thrombotic complication where under low-molecular-weight heparin treatment. Overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was rare. Initial ISTH DIC score and pre-event CRP were significantly higher among non-survivors. In multivariate analysis, arterial localization was an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 18, 95% CI: 2.4-142, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite quasi-universal thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 lead to a myriad of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Considering the subgroup of patients with thrombotic episodes, arterial events appeared earlier in the course of disease and conferred very poor prognosis, and an ISTH DIC score &#8805; 3 at presentation was identified as a potential predictor of mortality. Severity-adjusted thromboprophylaxis seemed to decrease the number of events and could have influenced mortality.

In this article, we lift up the long history of underlying conditions of state-sponsored and socially enacted violence, and we also problematize how social science scholarship has been designed, underlying conditions, such that anti-Black violence and gender-based violence are routinely (mis)represented as if idiosyncratic ruptures—microaggressions or battered women—in an otherwise smooth social fabric. Through the lens of decolonial feminism, we examine how the COVID-19 crisis makes public the gendering of violence, especially against Black women, as if it were a spike, obscuring how pervasive and enduring it is—a constant moan in South Africa, India, the United States, among native women in Canada, and other places around the globe. We end by calling for critical scholarship that peels back the symptom of gender-based violence, recognizes the history and ongoing structural enactment of racialized and gendered violence, and excavates the bold and relentless heartbeat of resistance narrated in quiet and loud demands for dignity, liberation, and desire.","Segalo, Puleng; Fine, Michelle",Soc.

514924,Text Messaging Real-Time COVID-19 Clinical Guidance to Hospital Employees,2021,"The authors use the COVID-19 crisis as an example to highlight two dimensions of beta instability that have been largely overlooked: First, the relative order in stock betas could change drastically when entering a crisis as the nature of market risk shifts. Second, although the relative order in beta may remain stable throughout a crisis, the absolute market risk sensitivity could also display significant changes from day to day in how individual stock returns react to the market news. These two dimensions of beta instability pose challenges for risk hedging. The authors compare the efficacy of a few approaches that hedge this systematic risk. Using a generic momentum portfolio as an illustration, the authors find that an optimized portfolio approach that maximizes/minimizes the momentum signal while matching the beta and sector exposures of the long and short legs can reduce the worst daily return and the volatility during the COVID-19 crisis by more than 60%. Their findings extend beyond this crisis period and can help investors address beta instability and hedging more broadly. TOPICS: Security analysis and valuation, quantitative methods, risk management, financial crises and financial market history Key Findings ▪ Both sector beta and relative riskiness of individual stocks within a sector could be unstable, as evidenced in the COVID-19 crisis. ▪ The magnitude of systematic reaction could also change from day to day. ▪ An optimized portfolio approach proves flexible and efficient in hedging systematic risk exposures.","Arik Ben, Dor Florig Stephan Guan Jingling Zeng Xiaming",Journal of Portfolio Management,,179

516422,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Liver Transplantation: Lessons From the First Year of the Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be less sensitive than the standard reference method - real-time PCR (RT-PCR). It has been suggested that many patients with positive RT-PCR 'missed' by antigen testing might be non-infectious. METHODS: In a real-world high-throughput setting for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, 494 patients were tested using RT-PCR as well as a single lateral flow antigen test (Ecotest, AssureTech, China). Where the results differed, virus viability was evaluated by cell culture. The test parameters were calculated with RT-PCR and RT-PCR adjusted on viability as reference standards. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the used antigen test related to the RT-PCR only was 76.2%, specificity was 97.3%. However, 36 out of 39 patients 'missed' by the antigen test contained no viable virus. After adjusting on that, the sensitivity grew to 97.7% and, more importantly for disease control purposes, the negative predictive value reached 99.2%. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that viability testing should be always performed when evaluating a new antigen test. A well-chosen and validated antigen test provides excellent results in identifying patients who are shedding viable virus (although some caveats still remain) in the real-world high-throughput setting of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals.","Homza, Miroslav; Zelena, Hana; Janosek, Jaroslav; Tomaskova, Hana; Jezo, Eduard; Kloudova, Alena; Mrazek, Jakub; Svagera, Zdenek; Prymula, Roman",Infect Dis (Lond),,179

While both myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration and myocarditis with myocyte injury have been reported in patients with fatal COVID-19, clinical-pathologic correlations remain limited. The objective was to determine the relationships between cardiac pathological changes in patients dying from COVID-19 and cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2, laboratory measurements, clinical features, and treatments. In a retrospective study, 41 consecutive autopsies of patients with fatal COVID-19 were analyzed for the associations between cardiac inflammation, myocarditis, cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2, clinical features, laboratory measurements, and treatments. Cardiac infection was assessed by in situ hybridization and NanoString transcriptomic profiling. Cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2 was present in 30/41 cases: virus+ with myocarditis (n = 4), virus+ without myocarditis (n = 26), and virus- without myocarditis (n = 11). In the cases with cardiac infection, SARS-CoV-2+ cells in the myocardium were rare, with a median density of 1 cell/cm2. Virus+ cases showed higher densities of myocardial CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ lymphocytes, as well as more electrocardiographic changes (23/27 vs 4/10; P = 0.01). Myocarditis was more prevalent with IL-6 blockade than with nonbiologic immunosuppression, primarily glucocorticoids (2/3 vs 0/14; P = 0.02). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 cardiac infection was less prevalent in patients treated with nonbiologic immunosuppression (7/14 vs 21/24; P = 0.02). Myocardial macrophage and lymphocyte densities overall were positively correlated with the duration of symptoms but not with underlying comorbidities. In summary, cardiac infection with SARS-CoV-2 is common among patients dying from COVID-19 but often with only rare infected cells. Cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with more cardiac inflammation and electrocardiographic changes. Nonbiologic immunosuppression is associated with lower incidences of myocarditis and cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Bearse, Mayara; Hung, Yin P; Krauson, Aram J; Bonanno, Liana; Boyraz, Baris; Harris, Cynthia K; Helland, T Leif; Hilburn, Caroline F; Hutchison, Bailey; Jobbagy, Soma; Marshall, Michael S; Shepherd, Daniel J; Villalba, Julian A; Delfino, Isabela; Mendez-Pena, Javier; Chebib, Ivan; Newton-Cheh, Christopher; Stone, James R",Mod Pathol,,179

Results: Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory symptoms. Three cases were confirmed by 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and antibody detection (severe type), and one with cardiac insufficiency was clinically determined (critically ill type). The previous diagnosis of hypertension was clear. Two patients took calcium channel antagonist (CCB), one patient took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and one patient took angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). After admission, ACEI or ARB were discontinued, one patient with heart failure patient was treated by aliskiren combined with diuretic; 3 patients were treated with aliskiren combined with CCB. Two patients were stopped to use CCB due to low blood pressure after 1 to 2 weeks of using CCB and aliskiren. On the basis of comprehensive therapy combined with antiviral and oxygenation treatment, aliskiren antihypertensive treatment was taken for three to four weeks. The blood pressure control of four patients was satisfactory and there was no complaint of discomfort. The condition improved, and all patients had reached the discharge standard and were discharged. Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension. Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is required with more COVID-19 patients..","Guo, Y; Zeng, J; Li, Q; Li, P; Luo, F M; Zhang, W Z; Lu, Y X; Wang, Q; Zhang, W; Zeng, Z P; Liu, L S",Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,,179
519268,Cardiovascular Disease and Use of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector encoding full-length severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein in a prefusion-stabilized conformation. METHODS: In an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adult participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 viral particles) or placebo. The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with an onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration among participants in the per-protocol population who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2-negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe-critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at &#8805;14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at &#8805;28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe-critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe-critical disease, including hospitalization and death. Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.

Methodology: Our study retrospectively analysed the demographic features and clinical admission types of patients admitted to Batman District State Hospital Emergency Service at two different time periods, one between 28 March 2019 and 28 April 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the other between 28 March 2020 and 28 April 2020 (during the Covid-19 pandemic). The results were compared between the two periods designated as the pandemic period and the pre-pandemic period. Results: The number of patients admitted to emergency service was 47,681 in the pre-pandemic period and 9455 in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients examined in green zone (non-urgent cases) was 27,701 (58%) in the pre-pandemic period and 3668 (38.7%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients admitted for trauma was 1247 (2.61%) in the pre-pandemic period and 59 (0.62%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients hospitalised to cardiology department or coronary care unit for acute coronary syndrome was 602 (1.26%) in the pre-pandemic period and 29 (0.3%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients hospitalised to neurological intensive care unit for acute cerebrovascular disease was 542 (1.13%) in the pre-pandemic period and 22 (0.2%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients hospitalised to pulmonary diseases department or intensive care unit for dyspnea was 622 (1.21%) in the pre-pandemic period and 515 (5.4%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). Conclusion: Measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection have caused a significant drop in emergency service admissions. We are of the opinion that this will lead to an increase in deaths occurring at home, and we will soon encounter patients with worse prognosis and overcrowded emergency services. We are in opinion that the public awareness about emergency conditions requiring emergency service admission should be heightened alongside of the “stay home” calls. As: “In order to reduce morbidity and mortality from non-covid-19 conditions, we call for heightened public awareness on other emergency and urgent symptoms, which should prompt urgent attendance to medical services.”.","Gormeli Kurt, Nazli; Gunes, Celal",Int.

As proposals cover also prophylactic use, the treatment could be massive, resulting in unprecedent levels of antiviral emissions to the aquatic environment. We have adapted previous models and used available information for predicting the environmental impact of representative medicinal products, covering the main groups under consideration: multitarget antiparasitic (chloroquines and ivermectin), glucocorticoids, macrolide antibiotics and antiviral drugs including their pharmacokinetic boosters. The retrieved information has been sufficient for conducting a conventional environmental risk assessment for the group of miscellaneous medicines; results suggest low concern for the chloroquines and dexamethasone while very high impact for ivermectin and azithromycin, even at use levels well below the default value of 1% of the population. The information on the ecotoxicity of the antiviral medicines is very scarce, thus we have explored an innovative pharmacodynamic-based approach, combining read-across, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), US EPA's Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) in vitro data, pharmacological modes of action, and the observed adverse effects. The results highlight fish sublethal effects as the most sensitive target and identify possible concerns.

524079,Onset of rheumatoid arthritis after COVID-19: coincidence or connected?,2021,"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) gene are relatively uncommon. The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulphate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade, B.1.I82T, defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. These M mutations are associated with younger patient age (4.6 to 6.3 years). The rapid emergence of this B.1.I82T clade, recently named Pangolin B.1.575 lineage, suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.","Shen, Lishuang; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Triche, Timothy J; Judkins, Alexander R; Biegel, Jaclyn A; Gai, Xiaowu",Emerg Microbes Infect,,179

591445,Study for cerebral central network mechanism of acupuncture stimulation quantity based on changes of cerebral functional connection of fMRI,2021-04-09,"Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of the zoonotic disease Q fever. Following uptake by alveolar macrophages, the pathogen replicates in an acidic phagolysosomal vacuole, the C. burnetii-containing vacuole (CCV). Effector proteins translocated into the host cell by the type IV secretion system (T4SS) are important for the establishment of the CCV. Here we focus on the effector protein AnkF and its role in establishing the CCV. The C. burnetii AnkF knock out mutant invades host cells as efficiently as wild-type C. burnetii, but this mutant is hampered in its ability to replicate intracellularly, indicating that AnkF might be involved in the development of a replicative CCV. To unravel the underlying reason(s), we searched for AnkF interactors in host cells and identified vimentin through a yeast two-hybrid approach. While AnkF does not alter vimentin expression at the mRNA or protein levels, the presence of AnkF results in structural reorganization and vesicular co-localization with recombinant vimentin. Ectopically expressed AnkF partially accumulates around the established CCV and endogenous vimentin is recruited to the CCV in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that AnkF might attract vimentin to the CCV. However, knocking-down endogenous vimentin does not affect intracellular replication of C. burnetii. Other cytoskeletal components are recruited to the CCV and might compensate for the lack of vimentin. Taken together, AnkF is essential for the establishment of the replicative CCV, however, its mode of action is still elusive.","Pechstein, Julian; Schulze-Luehrmann, Jan; Bisle, Stephanie; Cantet, Franck; Beare, Paul A.; Ölke, Martha; Bonazzi, Matteo; Berens, Christian; Lührmann, Anja",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.559915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282747/,179

A descriptive, cross-sectional study involving telephone interviews was executed in Peru. The Parents Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey was used. A demographic analysis was done, followed by an unadjusted exploratory subgroup analysis. Out of 552 subjects, 9.8% were considered vaccine hesitant, 70.3% had purposively delayed vaccination, 88.4% thought fewer vaccines were better and 52.2% were concerned about vaccine safety. The level of hesitancy was inversely proportional to the level of education and the number of children at home. Mothers and subjects aged ≤29 years showed a greater level of vaccine hesitancy. This population displays a vaccine-hesitant conduct. Vaccine safety and the number of vaccines to administer are important determining factors. This behavior could be influenced by variables such as level of education, number of children at home, parental relationship, and age. These results help understand local vaccination behaviors.

Therapy is aiming at symptom regression, avoidance of complications, reduction in the number of disease-related absences in school or at work, increased cost-effectiveness and improved quality of life. The purpose of this part of the guideline is to provide clinicians in any setting with a clinically focused multi-disciplinary guidance through different conservative treatment options in order to reduce inappropriate variation in clinical care, improve clinical outcome and reduce harm. Surgical management in terms of intracapsular as well as extracapsular tonsillectomy (i.e. tonsillotomy) is the subject of part II of this guideline. To estimate the probability of tonsillitis caused by β-hemolytic streptococci, a diagnostic scoring system according to Centor or McIsaac is suggested. If therapy is considered, a positive score of ≥3 should lead to pharyngeal swab or rapid test or culture in order to identify β-hemolytic streptococci. Routinely performed blood tests for acute tonsillitis are not indicated. After acute streptococcal tonsillitis, there is no need to repeat a pharyngeal swab or any other routine blood tests, urine examinations or cardiological diagnostics such as ECG. The determination of the antistreptolysin O-titer (ASLO titer) and other antistreptococcal antibody titers do not have any value in relation to acute tonsillitis with or without pharyngitis and should not be performed. First-line therapy of β-hemolytic streptococci consists of oral penicillin. Instead of phenoxymethylpenicillin–potassium (penicillin V potassium), also phenoxymethlpenicillin–benzathine with a clearly longer half-life can be used. Oral intake for 7 days of one of both the drugs is recommended. Alternative treatment with oral cephalosporins (e.g. cefadroxil, cefalexin) is indicated only in cases of penicillin failure, frequent recurrences, and whenever a more reliable eradication of β-hemolytic streptococci is desirable. In cases of allergy or incompatibility of penicillin, cephalosporins or macrolides (e.g. Erythromycin-estolate) are valuable alternatives.","Windfuhr, Jochen P.; Toepfner, Nicole; Steffen, Gregor; Waldfahrer, Frank; Berner, Reinhard",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-015-3872-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26755048/,179

The Bayesian skyline plot showed a constant population size of RSV-A and a sharp expansion of population size of RSV-B since 2005, and an obvious decrease 5 years later, then became stable again. The total population size of RSVs showed a similar tendency to that of RSV-B. Time-scaled phylogeny suggested a temporal specificity of the RSV-genotypes. Monitoring nucleotide changes and analyzing evolution pattern for RSVs could give valuable insights for vaccine and therapy strategies against RSV infection.","Yu, Jie-Mei; Fu, Yuan-Hui; Peng, Xiang-Lei; Zheng, Yan-Peng; He, Jin-Sheng",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155268/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92435-1,179
596528,Faecal Calprotectin in Assessment of Mucosal Healing in Adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis,2021-05-19,"Abstract Although a limited percentage of the genome produces proteins, approximately 90% is transcribed, indicating important roles for noncoding RNA (ncRNA). It is now known that these ncRNAs have a multitude of cellular functions ranging from the regulation of gene expression to roles as structural elements in ribonucleoprotein complexes. ncRNA is also represented at nearly every step of viral life cycles. This chapter will focus on ncRNAs of both host and viral origin and their roles in retroviral life cycles. Cellular ncRNA represents a significant portion of material packaged into retroviral virions and includes transfer RNAs, 7SL RNA, U RNA, and vault RNA. Initially thought to be random packaging events, these host RNAs are now proposed to contribute to viral assembly and infectivity. Within the cell, long ncRNA and endogenous retroviruses have been found to regulate aspects of the retroviral life cycle in diverse ways. Additionally, the HIV-1 transactivating response element RNA is thought to impact viral infection beyond the well-characterized role as a transcription activator. RNA interference, thought to be an early version of the innate immune response to viral infection, can still be observed in plants and invertebrates today. The ability of retroviral infection to manipulate the host RNAi pathway is described here. Finally, RNA-based therapies, including gene editing approaches, are being explored as antiretroviral treatments and are discussed.","Duchon, Alice A.; Musier-Forsyth, Karin",Retrovirus-Cell Interactions,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128111857000121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128111857000121,179
596970,Neutrophils as Regulators and Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Inflammation in the Context of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,2021-09-16,"BACKGROUND: Young adults’ drinking habits commonly exceed recommendations for low-risk drinking, which may have a negative effect on their mental, social, and physical health. As smartphones are highly accessible to young adults, mobile apps could be used to support young adults to develop low-risk drinking habits and improve their general health. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a self-guided mobile app based on healthy lifestyle–related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on alcohol use and its consequences for young adults. We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19–related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence. Baseline (T0), 6-week postbaseline (T1), and 3-month postbaseline (T2) assessments will be conducted and analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel mixed modeling analyses. RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2020. We received 933 registrations via our study information website; 506 participants have completed the T0 assessment, 336 participants have completed the T1 assessment, and 308 participants have completed the T2 assessment as of May 2021. The study is still in progress, and results will be reported in 2021 and 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mobile interventions based on a lifestyle approach might be an attractive approach for young adults due to their preference on self-reliance, healthy living, and increased perceived anonymity. Such interventions are yet understudied, and it is known that interventions addressing solely problem drinking are less appealing to young adults. We hypothesize that the Boozebuster mobile app will effectively reduce drinking levels compared to an alcohol educational website (control condition). If effective, our intervention could be an inexpensive and scalable public health intervention to improve drinking habits in young adults.

PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) databases were systematically searched for the following keywords from January 2010 to January 2020: including respiratory tract infection, probiotics, viral infection, COVID-19, and clinical trial. A total of 27 clinical trials conducted on 9,433 patients with RTI and 10 ongoing clinical studies of probiotics intervention in COVID-19 were reviewed. In this systematic review, were attempted to study the potency of probiotics for the hindrance and/or treatment of RTI diseases extensively, which may be practical to conflict the new coronavirus (COVID-19). Overall, probiotics could significantly increase the plasma levels of cytokines, the effect of influenzae vaccine, and quality of life as well as reducing the titre of viruses and the incidence and duration of respiratory infections. These antiviral and immune-modulating activities and their ability to stimulate interferon production recommended that to use probiotics as adjunctive therapy to prevent COVID-19. The rapid spread of the virus has affected the entire world socially and economically. Given this extensive research on RCTs, were expected probiotics to be a rational complementary treatment for RTI disease and a viable option for faster recovery.","Darbandi, Atieh; Asadi, Arezoo; Ghanavati, Roya; Afifirad, Roghayeh; Emamie, Amir Darb; kakanj, Maryam; Talebi, Malihe",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000977; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000977?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578007/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.011,179

Snakebite envenoming affects 2.7 million people globally every year, mostly the poorest and rural communities, with approximately 27,000 annual cases in Brazil. This study’s objective is to identify the most exposed racial group for snakebites in rural areas of Brazil and analyze possible differences in the outcome of an accident. A retrospective epidemiological study was conducted using a database of rural snakebite cases from Brazil’s Ministry of Health (2017). Descriptive analysis and a regression model were performed to examine the association of bad outcomes after a snakebite with several covariables. While mixed-race individuals presented the highest number of cases (61.79%), indigenous and white populations were the racial groups with the highest and lowest exposure rates (194.3 and 34.1 per 100,000 population, respectively). The fatality rate was 3.5 times higher in the indigenous population compared to the white population. In the multivariable model, the number of hours between the accident and health care received and the case classification suggested an association with a bad outcome. Snakebite is prominent in Brazil, particularly among indigenous groups. Antivenom is available in the Brazilian Health System; however, efforts need to be made for decentralization.","Schneider, Maria Cristina; Vuckovic, Myriam; Montebello, Lucia; Sarpy, Caroline; Huang, Quincy; Galan, Deise I.; Min, Kyung-Duk; Camara, Volney; Luiz, Ronir Raggio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501955/,179
598452,Antineoplastics: Recurrent COVID-19 pneumonia: case report,2021-07-31,"The increasing threats of viral diseases have gained worldwide attention in recent years. Quite a few infectious diseases are still lacking effective prevention or treatment. The pace of developing antiviral agents could be expedited by the availability of quick and efficient drug screening platforms. In this study, quantum dot (QD), an emerging probe for biological imaging and medical diagnostics, was employed to form complexes with virus and used as fluorescent imaging probes for exploring potential antiviral therapeutics. Inorganic CdSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in organic phase were encapsulated by amphiphilic alginate to attain biocompatible water-soluble QDs via phase transfer. Virus employed for this study was dengue virus which is a notorious one in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. To construct a QD–virus imaging modality capable of providing meaningful information, preservation of viral infectivity after tagging virus with QDs is of utmost importance. In order to form colloidal complexes of QD–virus, electrostatic repulsion force generated from both negatively charged virus and QDs was neutralized by various concentrations of cationic polybrene. Results showed that BHK-21 cells infected with dengue viruses incorporated with QDs exhibited bright fluorescence intracellularly within 30 min. To demonstrate the potency of QD–virus complexes as bioprobes for screening antiviral agents, BHK-21 cells were incubated for one hour with allophycocyanin purified from blue-green algae and then infected with QD–virus complexes. Based on the developed cell-based imaging assay, allophycocyanin with concentration of 125 μg/mL led to extremely weak intracellular fluorescence post-infection of QD–virus complexes for 30 min. That is, the efficacy of anti-dengue viral activity of the algae extract was clearly illustrated by the inorganic–organic hybrid platform constructed in current study.","Wang, Chung-Hao; Hsu, Yi-Shiou; Peng, Ching-An",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566308004405; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566308004405,179
599257,"The Association of COVID-19 Risk Perception, County Death Rates, and Voluntary Health Behaviors among U.S. Adult Population",2021-03-10,"Abstract: Importance: Intensity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and planning required to balance concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, could depend significantly on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is sensitive to seasonal changes. Objective: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. Setting: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. Methods: Regression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. Results: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p= 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, with the reverse true in winter months. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","Kaplin, A.

We aimed to investigate the incidence, management, and natural history of a range of infection syndromes (respiratory, gastrointestinal, mouth/dental, skin/soft tissue, urinary tract, and eye). METHODS: Bug Watch was an online prospective community cohort study of the general population in England (2018–2019) with weekly symptom reporting for 6 months. We combined symptom reports into infection syndromes, calculated incidence rates, described the proportion leading to healthcare-seeking behaviours and antibiotic use, and estimated duration and severity. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 873 individuals with 23,111 person-weeks follow-up. The mean age was 54 years and 528 (60%) were female. We identified 1422 infection syndromes, comprising 40,590 symptom reports. The incidence of respiratory tract infection syndromes was two per person year; for all other categories it was less than one. 194/1422 (14%) syndromes led to GP (or dentist) consultation and 136/1422 (10%) to antibiotic use. Symptoms usually resolved within a week and the third day was the most severe. CONCLUSIONS: Most people reported managing their symptoms without medical consultation. Interventions encouraging safe self-management across a range of acute infection syndromes could decrease pressure on primary healthcare services and support targets for reducing antibiotic prescribing.

600541,The Outcome of Six Patients with COVID-19 Infection and Multiple Myeloma,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND: With reduced community mobility, household infections may become increasingly important in SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. METHODS: We investigate the intra-household transmission of COVID-19 through the secondary-attack rate (SAR) and household reproduction number (R(h)). We estimate these using (i) data from 29 prior studies (February–August 2020), (ii) epidemiologically linked confirmed cases from Singapore (January–April 2020) and (iii) widespread-testing data from Vo’ (February–March 2020). For (i), we use a Bayesian random-effects model that corrects for reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) test sensitivity and asymptomatic cases. We investigate the robustness of R(h) with respect to community transmission rates and mobility patterns. RESULTS: The corrected pooled estimates from prior studies for SAR and R(h) are 24% (20–28%) and 0.34 (0.30–0.38), respectively. Without corrections, the pooled estimates are: SAR = 18% (14–21%) and R(h) = 0.28 (0.25–0.32). The corrected estimates line up with direct estimates from contact-tracing data from Singapore [R(h) = 0.32 (0.22–0.42)] and population testing data from Vo’ [SAR = 31% (28–34%) and R(h) = 0.37 (0.34–0.40)]. The analysis of Singapore data further suggests that the value of R(h) (0.22–0.42) is robust to community-spread dynamics; our estimate of R(h) stays constant whereas the fraction of infections attributable to household transmission (R(h)/R(eff)) is lowest during outbreaks (5–7%) and highest during lockdowns and periods of low community spread (25–30%). CONCLUSIONS: The three data-source types yield broadly consistent estimates for SAR and R(h). Our study suggests that household infections are responsible for a large fraction of infections and so household transmission may be an effective target for intervention.","Curmei, Mihaela; Ilyas, Andrew; Evans, Owain; Steinhardt, Jacob",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151970/,179

Yet, little research has been done to investigate either the infection risks associated with air travel or the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of infection control measures on aircraft and at borders. We briefly review the interface between international and national legislation, policy, and guidelines in the context of existing infection risks and possible scenarios. We have found that public health guidance and legislation, which airlines are required to follow, are often contradictory and confusing. Infection control measures for air travel need to be underpinned by coherent and enforceable national and international legislation that is based on solid epidemiological evidence.

The effect of asymptomatic viral infection on the dynamics of bacterial density and colonization of the nasopharynx has not been reported. The current study was performed to assess the presence and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the nasopharynx of 4–7-year-old children during URTI and when well. METHODS: Nasal samples were obtained during 4 surveillance periods when children were asymptomatic and whenever they had symptoms of URTI. Respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens were identified and quantified using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The proportion of children colonized with all 3 bacteria was higher during visits for acute URTI than during asymptomatic surveillance visits. Mean bacterial densities were significantly higher at all visits for all 3 pathogens when a virus was detected. The differences between the means were 1.0, 0.4, and 0.7 log(10) colony-forming unit equivalents per milliliter for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, respectively, compared with visits in which virus was not detected. The percentage of children colonized and density were also higher at asymptomatic visits in which virus was detected than at visits in which virus was not detected.

602801,Convalescent plasma as a potential therapy for COVID-19,2020-02-27,"BACKGROUND: Campylobacter jejuni is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of many food-animals including sheep without causing visible clinical symptoms of disease. However, C. jejuni has been implicated in ovine abortion cases worldwide. Specifically, in the USA, the C. jejuni sheep abortion (SA) clone has been increasingly associated with sheep abortion. In vivo studies in sheep (the natural host) are needed to better characterize the virulence potential and pathogenesis of this clone. RESULTS: Pregnant ewes intravenously (IV) or orally inoculated with ovine or bovine abortion-associated C. jejuni SA clones exhibited partial or complete uterine prolapse with retained placenta, and abortion or stillbirth, whereas delivery of healthy lambs occurred in pregnant ewes inoculated with C. jejuni 81–176 or in the uninfected group. In sheep inoculated with the SA clone, histopathological lesions including suppurative necrotizing placentitis and/or endometritis coincided with: 1) increased apoptotic death of trophoblasts, 2) increased expression of the host genes (e.g. genes encoding interleukin IL-6 and IL-15) related to cellular necrosis and pro-inflammatory responses in uterus, and 3) decreased expression of the genes encoding GATA binding protein 6, chordin, and insulin-like 3 (INSL3) that account for embryonic development in uterus. Immunohistochemistry revealed localization of bacterial antigens in trophoblasts lining the chorioallantoic membrane of ewes inoculated with the C. jejuni SA clone. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that C. jejuni SA clones are capable of causing abortion or stillbirth in experimentally infected sheep. Furthermore, down- or up-regulation of specific genes in the uterus of infected pregnant ewes might implicate host genes in facilitating the disease progression. Since the C. jejuni SA strains share genotypic similarities with clones that have been isolated from human clinical cases of gastroenteritis, these strains might represent a potential public health risk.

County health departments are trying to contain this pandemic. METHODS: This second survey of Kansas county health department directors occurred from August 7 to September 7, 2020. Since the first survey in April, there have been significant increases in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 and related deaths. Thus, the aim of the study was to re-evaluate county-level containment efforts and assess shortfalls that were identified in the April 2020 survey. RESULTS: In total, 41 out of 105 directors responded to the survey. Generally, respondents said there were increased supplies for testing, increased testing centers, shorter time to get test results, and in some cases, increased funding. However, the number of people involved in contact tracing had not increased substantially, which was one of the recommended changes for improving containment. Moreover, of those persons who were tested, only a few (18%) counties inquired if they wear masks in public. From comments reported, there was a sense of employees being overwhelmed, especially among the smaller county health departments. CONCLUSION: As the cases of and deaths from COVID-19 are increasing in the state, especially in high density areas, the respondents to our survey indicated there was continued need for additional funding with easy access, increased staffing, especially for contact tracing, and significant help for effective messaging to improve adherence to public health directives.","Raghuveer, Talkrad S.; Zackula, Rosalee E.; Wittler, Robert R.",Kans J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312412/; https://doi.org/10.17161/kjm.vol13.14675,179

Case report.,2020-07-23,"BACKGROUND: To better direct assessments and interventions toward the general population during both the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future crises with societal restrictions, data on the types of practical and emotional problems that people are experiencing are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the types of practical and emotional problems that the general population is experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic and to construct an empirically derived inventory based on the findings. METHODS: A total of 396 participants, recruited among members of the general public in Sweden who were experiencing practical and/or emotional problems during the pandemic, accessed a self-guided digital problem-solving intervention for a period of 1 week to report and solve the problems they experienced. Prior to accessing the intervention, the participants completed a short self-assessment regarding symptoms of depression and anxiety. Content analysis was used to account for the types of problems participants reported. A set of items for an inventory was later proposed based on the problem categories derived from the analysis. RESULTS: A majority of participants had clinically relevant symptoms of either depression or anxiety. The problems reported were categorized as 13 distinct types of problems. The most common problem was difficulty managing daily activities. Based on the categories, a 13-item inventory was proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The 13 types of problems, and the proposed inventory, could be valuable when composing assessments and interventions for the general population during the ongoing pandemic or similar crises with societal restrictions. The most common problem was of a practical nature, indicating the importance of including examples of such problems within assessments and interventions.

604962,Severe peripartum cardiomyopathy complicated by COVID‐19 infection and small intestinal obstruction,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that infects humans and results in chickenpox and herpes zoster. A number of VZV genes remain functionally uncharacterized and since VZV is an obligate human pathogen, rigorous evaluation of VZV mutants in vivo remains challenging. Simian varicella virus (SVV) is homologous to VZV and SVV infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely mimics VZV infection of humans. Recently the SVV genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and BAC-derived SVV displayed similar replication kinetics as wild-type (WT) SVV in vitro. METHODS: RMs were infected with BAC-derived SVV or WT SVV at 4x10(5) PFU intrabronchially (N=8, 4 per group, sex and age matched). We collected whole blood (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at various days post-infection (dpi) and sensory ganglia during latent infection (>84 dpi) at necropsy and compared disease progression, viral replication, immune response and the establishment of latency. RESULTS: Viral replication kinetics and magnitude in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and whole blood as well as rash severity and duration were similar in RMs infected with SVV BAC or WT SVV. Moreover, SVV-specific B and T cell responses were comparable between BAC and WT-infected animals. Lastly, we measured viral DNA in sensory ganglia from both cohorts of infected RMs during latent infection. CONCLUSIONS: SVV BAC is as pathogenic and immunogenic as WT SVV in vivo. Thus, the SVV BAC genetic system combined with the rhesus macaque animal model can further our understanding of viral ORFs important for VZV pathogenesis and the development of second-generation vaccines.","Meyer, Christine; Dewane, Jesse; Haberthur, Kristen; Engelmann, Flora; Arnold, Nicole; Gray, Wayne; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24010815/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-278,179
605127,Should we remain hopeful? The key 8 weeks: spatiotemporal epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 in Sichuan Province and its comparative analysis with other provinces in China and global epidemic trends,2020-11-05,"Quality of service (QoS) requirements for live streaming are most required for video-on-demand (VoD), where they are more sensitive to variations in delay, jitter, and packet loss. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is the most popular technology for live streaming and VoD, where it has been massively deployed on the Internet. DASH is an over-the-top application using unmanaged networks to distribute content with the best possible quality. Widely, it uses large reception buffers in order to keep a seamless playback for VoD applications. However, the use of large buffers in live streaming services is not allowed because of the induced delay. Hence, network congestion caused by insufficient queues could decrease the user-perceived video quality. Active Queue Management (AQM) arises as an alternative to control the congestion in a router’s queue, pressing the TCP traffic sources to reduce their transmission rate when it detects incipient congestion. As a consequence, the DASH client tends to decrease the quality of the streamed video. In this article, we evaluate the performance of recent AQM strategies for real-time adaptive video streaming and propose a new AQM algorithm using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to improve the user-perceived video quality. The LSTM forecast the trend of queue delay to allow earlier packet discard in order to avoid the network congestion. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the competing AQM algorithms, mainly in scenarios where there are congested networks.","Santos, Carlos Eduardo Maffini; da Silva, Carlos Alexandre Gouvea; Pedroso, Carlos Marcelo",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441088/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e23080948,179

OBJECTIVES: To analyze acute manifestations of Coronavirus OC43 infections and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective and monocentric study performed during a Coronavirus OC43 outbreak. We used multiplex PCR to detect an OC43 outbreak in Reunion Island during the 2016 Southern Hemisphere's winter: seven admissions to the ICU. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 71 [67;76] years, SAPS II was 42 [28;53], pneumonia severity index 159 [139;182] vs 73 [40.5;107] for patients in medical wards, and 43% required mechanical ventilation.

606311,Poor Outcomes of COVID-19 in Lung Transplant Recipients. Cohort Study in a Single Center,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Since the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrom Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV‑2) in Germany, intensive care beds have been kept free for patients suffering from Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). Also, after the number of infections had declined, intensive care beds were kept free prophylactically; however, the percentage of beds reserved for COVID-19 differ in the individual federal states in Germany. The aim of this article is to define a necessary clearance quota of intensive beds for COVID-19 patients in Germany. An escalation and de-escalation scheme was created for rising and falling numbers of infected patients. METHODS: Data from the COVID-19 resource board of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the daily situation report of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the register of COVID-19 intensive care beds of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) as well as the daily report of COVID-19 Baden-Württemberg from April to November 2020 were used for the calculation. RESULTS: At the end of November 2020 approximately 13.5% of intensive care beds in Germany were used by COVID-19 patients. Of all persons tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2, 1.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit. The hospitalization rate was 6% and the mean age of infected persons was 43 years. Based on these numbers hospitals are recommended to keep 10% of intensive care beds available for COVID-19 patients in the case of less than 35 new infections/100,000 in the catchment area, 20% should be kept free in case of an advanced warning level of 35 new infections/100,000 inhabitants and 30% for a critical limit of 50 new infections/100,000 inhabitants. Further internal hospital triggers, such as the occupancy of the intensive care beds with COVID-19 patients, should be considered. CONCLUSION: If the number of infections is low a general nationwide retention rate of more than 10% of intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients is not justified. Locally increasing numbers of infections require a local dynamic approach. If the number of infections increases, the free holding capacity should be increased according to a step by step concept in close coordination with the local health authorities and other internal hospital triggers. In order not to overwhelm hospital capacities in the event of local outbreaks, a corresponding relocation concept should be considered at an early stage.","Pfenninger, E.

The return to play of professional sports during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to analyze the hypothesized effect of home advantage in neutral settings. While recent work has examined the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on home advantage in European football, comparatively few studies have examined the effect of restrictions in the North American professional sports leagues. In this work, we infer the effect of and changes in home advantage prior to and during COVID-19 in the professional North American leagues for hockey, basketball, baseball, and American football. We propose a Bayesian multi-level regression model that infers the effect of home advantage while accounting for relative team strengths. We also demonstrate that the Negative Binomial distribution is the most appropriate likelihood to use in modelling North American sports leagues as they are prone to overdispersion in their points scored. Our model gives strong evidence that home advantage was negatively impacted in the NHL and NBA during their strongly restricted COVID-19 playoffs, while the MLB and NFL showed little to no change during their weakly restricted COVID-19 seasons.","Higgs, Nico; Stavness, Ian",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93533-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267238/,179

As a reserve agent, it will and should be used primarily in critically ill patients in the upcoming years. Due to the novelty of the substance little data on the pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with septic shock and renal failure (including continuous renal replacement therapy and cytokine adsorber therapy) is available. We performed therapeutic drug monitoring in a cohort of five patients treated with cefiderocol, to improve the knowledge on pharmacokinetics in this vulnerable patient population. As expected for a cephalosporin with predominantly renal elimination the maintenance dose could be reduced in patients with renal impairment or on continuous renal replacement therapy. The manufacturer’s dosing instructions were sufficient to achieve a drug level well above the MIC. However, the addition of a cytokine adsorber might reduce serum levels substantially, so that in this context therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment are recommended.","König, Christina; Both, Anna; Rohde, Holger; Kluge, Stefan; Frey, Otto R.; Röhr, Anka C.; Wichmann, Dominic",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071700/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10060649,179

While COVID-19 has impacted the entire world, COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted low-income countries, particularly in South America, causing not only increased mortality but also increased associated mental health complaints. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), reflecting fear of anxiety-related physical sensations, may be particularly important to understand COVID-19 mental health effects among Latinx individuals in South America (Argentina). Past work suggests that Latinx individuals report greater somatization of mental health symptoms, and AS has been specifically linked to greater mental health symptoms. Yet, to date, no work has examined AS as a vulnerability factor for the negative mental health effects of COVID-19. METHOD: Therefore, the current manuscript examined the association of AS with COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, anxiety, and symptom severity across two samples of adults in Argentina: a community sample (n = 105, M(age) = 38.58, SD = 14.07, 69.5% female) and a clinical sample comprised of individuals with an anxiety disorder (n = 99, M(age) = 34.99, SD = 10.83, 66.7% female). RESULTS: Results from the current study provide support for AS as a potential vulnerability factor for COVID-19-related mental health problems across both samples, and these effects were evident over and above the variance accounted for by age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify AS as a potential intervention target to reduce COVID-19 mental health burden among adults in Argentina.","Rogers, Andrew H.; Bogiaizian, Daniel; Salazar, Patricio López; Solari, Adrian; Garey, Lorra; Fogle, Brienna M.; Schmidt, Norman B.; Zvolensky, Michael J.",Cognit Ther Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10608-020-10194-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424059/,179

We report systemic and mucosal antibody responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying disease severity. Robust antibody responses to diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens and evidence of elevated responses to endemic CoV were observed among convalescent donors. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG responses were often negatively correlated, particularly in mucosal samples, suggesting subject-intrinsic biases in isotype switching. Assessment of antibody-mediated effector functions revealed an inverse correlation between systemic and mucosal neutralization activity and site-dependent differences in the isotype of neutralizing antibodies. Serum neutralization correlated with systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. These findings begin to map how diverse Ab characteristics relate to Ab functions and outcomes of infection, informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development efforts.","Butler, S.

A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will require mechanical ventilation. We present 2 interesting cases that demonstrate the possibility of COVID-19-associated ARDS manifesting with pulmonary barotrauma at acceptable ventilatory pressures. CASE REPORTS: The first patient was a 71-year-old man who was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 infection. His partial pressure of O2 to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was 156. He developed subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and pneumomediastinum on day 5 of mechanical ventilation at ventilatory settings of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≤15 cmH(2)O, plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤25 cmH(2)O and pulmonary inspiratory pressure (PIP) ≤30 cmH(2)O. He was managed with ‘blow-hole’ incisions, with subsequent clinical resolution of subcutaneous emphysema. The second patient was a 58-year-old woman who was also mechanically ventilated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19, with PaO2/FiO2 of 81.

Our research seeks to examine whether enterprises, which use leadership as an important “tool” to manage workers as effectively as possible, are conscious of this evolution, whether their behavior is supportive of the related needs, and how they are organizing themselves to face the problems and opportunities arising in this new context. The present study involved 15 Italian companies. Through in-depth interviews based on face-to-face meetings using a semi-structured questionnaire with enterprises’ representatives, we explored the extent of these changes. We developed the analysis across two points in time in order to verify if a change was observable with regard to the way these enterprises considered and managed e-leadership. It was also possible to enhance the role of the technologies themselves in leadership, which in the same period has seen a rapid evolution toward mobile and social developments. Our results help to illuminate that, on the one hand, awareness with regard to e-leadership has increased and, on the other hand, the pervasiveness of technologies is playing a relevant role in the change of leadership together with renewed attention toward soft competencies. We identify four different typologies of e-leadership, which summarize different ways of conceptualizing it, and indicate their main features. We should add that this topic is becoming extremely relevant because of the critical crises organizations are now facing (such as the COVID-19 emergency we are experiencing at the present time) and the urgency of adopting e-instruments, which seem now to be the main path to managing the present situation and the aftermath it inevitably will have. Despite this research being carried out before such an event has happened, we believe that its results may further enrich the current lively debate.","Torre, Teresina; Sarti, Daria",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.554253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262721/,179

In this study, four experiments were conducted to explore the role of infectious disease cues on consumers’ purchase intention for environmentally friendly products (eco-friendly products), as well as the moderating effects of consumers’ sense of power and anti-disease intervention. According to the results, infectious disease cues enhance consumers’ intent to purchase eco-friendly products, and perceived uncertainty and need to belong played a chain-mediated role in the relationship between infectious disease cues and this purchase intention. Consumers’ sense of power moderated the relationship between infectious disease cues and purchase intention. The purchase intention of consumers with a low sense of power (vs. high sense of power) was significantly enhanced when the infectious disease cues were highlighted. Anti-disease interventions also have a moderating effect on the relationship between infectious disease cues and purchase intention. When anti-disease intervention (such as wearing an anti-bacterial mask against airborne diseases) was adopted, consumers’ willingness to purchase eco-friendly products decreased.","Wang, Xingyuan; Wang, Yaming; Wang, Yi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444170/,179

A total of 150 soil/sediment samples were collected in each location. Heavy metal concentrations were detectable levels at all sites and the values of Cd of all soil/sediment samples were higher than Dutch Target and Intervention Values. Heavy metal concentration in soil/sediment was further analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). It was revealed that three components were found in two studying sites and contributed 60.2% and 75.9% of variations to reflect soil/sediment quality in CBA and GBA, respectively. Based on the results of KMO (0.52) and Bartlett’s test (p < 0.000), there are 32.1%, 15.6%, and 11.1% and 39.45%, 19.01%, and 17.52% of the variance in the first, second, and third component explained that the metal concentration of Pb, Cd, and Sn was highly correlated with the soil/sediment quality in CBA and GBA, respectively. Among these three heavy metals, Cd concentration was the common dominant factor to affect soil/sediment quality in these two study sites. It is recommended that investigation of the sources of pollution (either point or non-point source) during CBA or GBA development and management together with consideration of abiotic (soil)-biotic (organisms) interactions should be taken into account when choosing suitable remediation strategies in the future.","Leung, Ho Man; Cheung, Kwai Chung; Au, Chi Kin; Yung, Ken Kin Lam; Li, Wai Chin",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733406/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13489-2,179

While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcαR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (FcγRIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, support the clinical use of currently available antibody-based treatment including the continued study of CCP transfusion strategies.","Clark, Natasha M; Janaka, Sanath Kumar; Hartman, William; Stramer, Susan; Goodhue, Erin; Weiss, John; Evans, David T.; Connor, Joseph P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.14.460394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545365/,179

Population health technology is the umbrella term for technology applications that have a population focus and the potential to improve public health. This includes the Internet, but also other technologies such as wireless devices, mobile phones, smart appliances, or smart homes. In the context of an outbreak or bioterrorism attack, such technologies may help to gather intelligence and detect diseases early, and communicate and exchange information electronically worldwide. Some of the technologies brought forward during the SARS epidemic may have been primarily motivated by marketing efforts, or were more directed towards reassuring people that ""something is being done,"" ie, fighting an ""epidemic of fear."" To understand ""fear epidemiology"" is important because early warning systems monitoring data from a large number of people may not be able to discriminate between a biological epidemic and an epidemic of fear.

Objective: While there have been studies to describe the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in various viral conditions, there is limited information about the use of them in COVID-19. This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of chloroquine in treating coronavirus infection. Methods: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search was performed using PUBMED & Google Scholar to find articles about the role of CQ in COVID-19 patients. Results: We included 19 publications (Five published articles, three letters/correspondence, one commentary, five pre-proofs of accepted articles, one abstract of yet to be published article, and four were pre-prints (not yet peer-reviewed) articles) in this systematic review.

Different genotypes classified into species can be distinguished on the basis of sequence divergence in the VP1 capsid-coding region. Apparently new genotypes are discovered regularly, often as incidental findings in studies investigating respiratory syndromes or as part of poliovirus surveillance. Recently, some EVs have become recognized as significant respiratory pathogens, and a number of new genotypes belonging to species C have been identified. The circulation of these newly identified species C EVs, such as EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, and EV-C117, nevertheless appears to be limited. In this report, we show the results of routine genotyping of all enteroviruses detected in our tertiary care hospital between January 2008 and April 2015. We detected 365 EVs belonging to 40 genotypes. Interestingly, several newly identified species C EVs were detected during the study period.

The first biologically active thymic extract was thymosin fraction V, the fractionation of which led to the isolation of a series of immunoactive polypeptides, including prothymosin alpha (proTα). ProTα displays a dual role, intracellularly as a survival and proliferation mediator and extracellularly as a biological response modifier. Accordingly, inside the cell, proTα is implicated in crucial intracellular circuits and may serve as a surrogate tumor biomarker, but when found outside the cell, it could be used as a therapeutic agent for treating immune system deficiencies. In fact, proTα possesses pleiotropic adjuvant activity and a series of immunomodulatory effects (eg, anticancer, antiviral, neuroprotective, cardioprotective). Moreover, several reports suggest that the variable activity of proTα might be exerted through different parts of the molecule. We first reported that the main immunoactive region of proTα is the carboxy-terminal decapeptide proTα(100–109). In conjunction with data from others, we also revealed that proTα and proTα(100–109) signal through Toll-like receptor 4. Although their precise molecular mechanism of action is yet not fully elucidated, proTα and proTα(100–109) are viewed as candidate adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we present a historical overview on the discovery and isolation of thymosins with emphasis on proTα and data on some immune-related new activities of the polypeptide and smaller immunostimulatory peptides thereof.

Summary Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed a real challenge to health systems. In Spain, the heterogeneous distribution of the virus infection and the different health strategies have conditioned the morbidity and fatality rate. The aim of this study was to analyse the lethality of the infection by sex and age range in the Autonomous Communities (AC) of Spain. Material and methods. To perform the analysis, data were extracted from the Ministry of Health, Regional and Public Health Departments of the different AC. The infected population was estimated from the results of the ENE-COVID19 and the population registered on 1 January 2020 (INE) for the validity of the IgG antibody test with 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The case fatality rate (TL) (deaths/1000 estimated infected) by sex and age (<20 years, 20-64 and ≥65 years) was calculated for each AC. The standardized case fatality ratio (REL) was calculated by the exact method (EPIDAT). Results. The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain was 6% (range, 1.4% Ceuta - 14.1% Community of Madrid). The TL in Spain was 9,6/1000, ranged per AC from 1/1000 in Melilla to 26.6/1000 in La Rioja, with no correlation between case fatality and prevalence of infection. The TL was higher in men (10.2/1000, ratio 1.17 with respect to women) except in Cataluña (ratio 0.92) and especially high in those over 64 years of age in La Rioja (143.5/1000), Asturias (69.2/1000) and Basque Country (46.6/1000). Overall excess REL was found to be over 30% in La Rioja (2.91, 95% CI 2.36-3.57), Asturias (1.51, 95% CI 1.27-1.80), Basque Country (1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54) and Extremadura (1.37, 95% CI 1.20-1.57) and in those over 64 years in Madrid and the Canary Islands. Conclusions: SARs-Cov-2 virus infection has been very unevenly distributed in the different ACs, with notably differences in TL between ACs, particularly high in La Rioja, Asturias and the Basque Country.

METHODS: We conducted surveys and serology tests among students living in dormitories in September and November to examine infection risk factors and antibody presence. Using campus weekly reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results, the relationship between survey responses, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infections was assessed. RESULTS: Of 6136 students, 1197 completed the survey and 572 also completed serologic testing in September compared with 517 and 414 in November, respectively. Participation in fraternity or sorority events (adjusted Risk Ratio (aRR): 1·9 [95% CI: 1·4–2·5]) and frequent alcohol consumption (aRR: 1·6 [1·2–2·2]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mask wearing during social events (aRR: 0·6 [0·6–1·0]) was associated with decreased risk. None of the 20 students with antibodies in September tested postive for SARS-CoV-2 during the semester, while 27·8% of students who tested RT-PCR positive tested negative for antibodies in November. CONCLUSION: Frequent drinking and attending social events were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody presence in September appeared to be protective from re-infection, but this finding was not statistically significant.","Segaloff, Hannah E; Cole, Devlin; Rosenblum, Hannah G; Lee, Christine C; Morgan, Clint N; Remington, Patrick; Pitts, Collin; Kelly, Patrick; Baggott, Jake; Bateman, Allen; Somers, Tarah; Ruff, Jeanne; Payne, David; Desamu-Thorpe, Rodel; Foster, Monique A; Currie, Dustin W; Abedi, Glen R; Westergaard, Ryan; Hsu, Christopher H; Tate, Jaqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552995/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab405,179

Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive.

HKU1 virus uses its S1 subunit C-terminal domain (CTD) and not the N-terminal domain like other lineage A β-CoVs to bind to its yet unknown human receptor. Here we present the crystal structure of HKU1 CTD at 1.9 Å resolution. The structure consists of three subdomains: core, insertion and subdomain-1 (SD-1). While the structure of the core and SD-1 subdomains of HKU1 are highly similar to those of other β-CoVs, the insertion subdomain adopts a novel fold, which is largely invisible in the cryo-EM structure of the HKU1 S trimer. We identify five residues in the insertion subdomain that are critical for binding of neutralizing antibodies and two residues essential for receptor binding.

620931,Elevated Serum Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecules Expression in COVID-19 Patients,2020-06-25,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to analyze emergency ophthalmology referrals to a Canadian tertiary academic centre during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in comparison to pre-pandemic referrals. DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review looking at emergency referrals seen by the ophthalmology service between March 18 to April 17, 2020 (representing the COVID-19 period) and March 18 to April 17, 2019 (representing the pre-COVID-19 period). METHODS: Data gathered from referral records included patient demographics, timing and site of referral, and ophthalmic diagnosis. Referrals were categorized as urgent or non-urgent, with urgent indicating the need for ophthalmic assessment within 24 hours. RESULTS: The total number of referrals decreased by 54.2% in the COVID-19 period versus the pre-COVID-19 period. There was a similar bimodal age distribution in both periods, with fewer patients over 65 years of age presenting during the pandemic. Tertiary hospital referrals decreased by 62% in the pandemic period, while non-tertiary emergency department referral trends varied and outpatient clinic referrals increased by 16%. Overall, there was a significant shift in the distribution of referral sites (p=0.04). The proportion of urgent referrals increased by 14% during the pandemic; this was not statistically significant. There was no significant change in the timing of referrals nor in the distribution of diagnostic segments. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology referral patterns in a Canadian context. Moving forward, it helps to guide resource allocation and public education on the importance of seeking necessary eye care.","Schlenker, Amanda; Tadrous, Carol; Ching, Geoffrey; Iovieno, Alfonso; Nathoo, Nawaaz; Liu, Tom; Yeung, Sonia N.",Can J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjo.2021.02.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781723/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008418221000831; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008418221000831?v=s5,179

METHODS: A total of 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples and 12 peripheral venous blood samples from patients with retinoblastoma (RB) confirmed by pathological examination at Beijing Tongren Hospital were collected between May 2019 and May 2021. DNA from the samples was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed to detect the mutations in the RB1 gene by designing the targeted capture probes for exons and the flanking sequences of the gene. RESULTS: Of the 45 FFPE tissue samples, 23 were from male patients and 22 were from female patients, all aged between 4 months and 10 years, with an average age of 2.5 ± 1.3 years. Two of these patients had bilateral RB and 43 had unilateral RB (23 in the right eye and 20 in the left eye). Of the 12 peripheral venous blood samples, 7 were from male patients and 5 were from female patients, all aged between 8 months and 4 years, with an average age of 1.3 ± 0.9 years. Two of these patients had bilateral RB and 10 had unilateral RB (8 in the right eye and 2 in the left eye). Three de novo pathogenic mutations were found in the FFPE tissues, along with one de novo potentially pathogenic mutation, while three de novo potentially pathogenic mutations were found in the blood samples. CONCLUSION: Gene capture is a low-cost and efficient method for the gene sequencing of RB. A total of seven de novo mutations were identified through mutation testing of the pathogenic gene RB1 in 56 pediatric patients with RB. This complemented the mutation spectrum of the RB1 gene and helped to improve the molecular diagnosis of RB, thereby providing a basis for genetic counseling and prediction of the clinical phenotype, as well as for the genetic testing of the offspring of patients with RB.

Here, we develop two capsid-like particle (CLP)-based vaccines displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RBD antigens are displayed on AP205 CLPs through a split-protein Tag/Catcher, ensuring unidirectional and high-density display of RBD. Both soluble recombinant RBD and RBD displayed on CLPs bind the ACE2 receptor with nanomolar affinity. Mice are vaccinated with soluble RBD or CLP-displayed RBD, formulated in Squalene-Water-Emulsion. The RBD-CLP vaccines induce higher levels of serum anti-spike antibodies than the soluble RBD vaccines. Remarkably, one injection with our lead RBD-CLP vaccine in mice elicits virus neutralization antibody titers comparable to those found in patients that had recovered from COVID-19. Following booster vaccinations, the virus neutralization titers exceed those measured after natural infection, at serum dilutions above 1:10,000. Thus, the RBD-CLP vaccine is a highly promising candidate for preventing COVID-19.","Fougeroux, Cyrielle; Goksøyr, Louise; Idorn, Manja; Soroka, Vladislav; Myeni, Sebenzile K.; Dagil, Robert; Janitzek, Christoph M.; Søgaard, Max; Aves, Kara-Lee; Horsted, Emma W.; Erdoğan, Sayit Mahmut; Gustavsson, Tobias; Dorosz, Jerzy; Clemmensen, Stine; Fredsgaard, Laurits; Thrane, Susan; Vidal-Calvo, Elena E.; Khalifé, Paul; Hulen, Thomas M.; Choudhary, Swati; Theisen, Michael; Singh, Susheel K.; Garcia-Senosiain, Asier; Van Oosten, Linda; Pijlman, Gorben; Hierzberger, Bettina; Domeyer, Tanja; Nalewajek, Blanka W.; Strøbæk, Anette; Skrzypczak, Magdalena; Andersson, Laura F.; Buus, Søren; Buus, Anette Stryhn; Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard; Dalebout, Tim J.; Iversen, Kasper; Harritshøj, Lene H.; Mordmüller, Benjamin; Ullum, Henrik; Reinert, Line S.; de Jongh, Willem Adriaan; Kikkert, Marjolein; Paludan, Søren R.; Theander, Thor G.; Nielsen, Morten A.; Salanti, Ali; Sander, Adam F.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436573/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20251-8,179

The accuracy of these networks has reached such high levels that further improvement is becoming very difficult. However, this high accuracy lacks deeper semantic information, such as social roles (e.g., student, company worker, or police officer) or location-based roles (e.g., pedestrian, tenant, or construction worker). Some of these can be learned from the same set of features as the human nature of an entity, whereas others require wider contextual information from the human surroundings. The primary end-goal of developing recognition software is to involve them in autonomous decision-making systems. Therefore, it must be foolproof, which is, it must have good semantic understanding of the input. In this study, we focus on counting pedestrians in helicopter footage and introduce a dataset created from helicopter videos for this purpose. We use semantic segmentation to extract the required additional contextual information from the surroundings of an entity. We demonstrate that it is possible to increase the pedestrian counting accuracy in this manner. Furthermore, we show that crowd counting and semantic segmentation can be simultaneously achieved, with comparable or even improved accuracy, by using the same crowd counting neural network for both tasks through hard parameter sharing. The presented method is generic and it can be applied to arbitrary crowd density estimation methods.

GDM-exposure was assessed using electronic medical records. Results: Children who reported higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity or vigorous physical activity, reported lower anxiety symptoms. Children exposed to GDM in utero reported higher anxiety scores and lower engagement in vigorous physical activity compared to unexposed children. Moreover, the pathway through which children exposed to GDM in utero, reported higher anxiety was partially explained by reduced engagement in vigorous physical activity (75%, p=0.05).

623323,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis associated with coccidiomycosis infection,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) commonly cause influenza-like illness in young children. The global coronavirus pandemic beginning in 2020 altered the seasonality and prevalence of these respiratory infections in Thailand. We aimed to characterize the upsurge of HRV and the subsequent RSV infection observed among young children who sought medical care at a hospital in Bangkok. METHODS From July to December 2020, nasopharyngeal swabs from children ≤5 years of age presented with influenza-like illness were tested for RSV and HRV using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were Sanger sequenced. Genotyping was performed using sequence and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS Upsurge of HRV infection began in July and was subsequently replaced by a surge of RSV infection from September onward. In 6 months, HRV was detected in 27.5% (158/574) of the samples, of which 44% (69/158) were HRV-A, 7% (11/158) were HRV-B, and 36% (57/158) were HRV-C. Meanwhile, RSV was detected in 40.4% (232/574) of the samples, of which 78% (181/232) were RSV-A and 6% (14/232) were RSV-B. RSV peaked in October 2020, approximately 2 months later than typically seen in previous years. All RSV-A were of subgenotype ON1. Codetection of HRV and RSV was found in 5.1% (29/574). CONCLUSIONS HRV and RSV infection among young children coincided with relaxed local coronavirus public health measures, including the return to in-class schooling.

Numerous antiviral targets are being investigated, but nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) stands out as a highly conserved and yet understudied target. Nsp13 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase that translocates along and unwinds viral RNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Currently, there are no available structures of nsp13 from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 with either ATP or RNA bound, which presents a significant hurdle to the rational design of therapeutics. To address this knowledge gap, we have built models of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in Apo, ATP, ssRNA and ssRNA+ATP substrate states. Using 30 μs of a Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation (at least 6 μs per substrate state), these models were confirmed to maintain substrate binding poses that are similar to other SF1 helicases. A Gaussian mixture model and linear discriminant analysis structural clustering protocol was used to identify key structural states of the ATP-dependent RNA translocation mechanism. Namely, four RNA-nsp13 structures are identified that exhibit ATP-dependent populations and support the inchworm mechanism for translocation. These four states are characterized by different RNA-binding poses for motifs Ia, IV, and V and suggest a power stroke-like motion of domain 2A relative to domain 1A. This structural and mechanistic insight of nsp13 RNA translocation presents novel targets for the further development of antivirals.","Weber, Ryan; McCullagh, Martin",J Phys Chem B,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c04528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328740/,179

We are able to remove the lungs from the images by turning to black the center of the X-Ray scan and training our classifiers only on the outer part of the images. Hence, we deduce that several testing protocols for the recognition are not fair and that the neural networks are learning patterns in the dataset that are not correlated to the presence of COVID-19. Finally, we show that creating a fair testing protocol is a challenging task, and we provide a method to measure how fair a specific testing protocol is.

A pre- and post-test 8 weeks later measured changes in job crafting and career self-management (primary outcomes) and employability (secondary outcome) of 103 physicians that completed the pre- and post-test. RM ANOVAs showed that the intervention enhanced perceptions of career self-management and job crafting behavior to decrease hindering job demands. No support was found for the effect of the intervention on other types of job crafting and employability. This study offers novel insights into how career crafting can be enhanced through training, as this is the first empirical study to examine a career crafting intervention.

However, there is no published information about how a global pandemic affects the frequency and types of ECS encountered by veterinary team members. An online mixed methods survey was developed to determine the frequency, stressfulness and types of ECS experienced by veterinarians, animal health technicians and veterinary nurses since the advent of the global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Responses from 540 veterinary team members from 22 countries were analyzed. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median frequency of ECS encountered by respondents increased from several times per month to several times per week (Spearman Rank Correlation 0.619, P < 0.0001). The most common ECS (encountered at least several times per week) were: challenging decisions about how to proceed when clients have limited finances (64.4%), conflict between personal well-being and professional role (64.3%), conflict between the interests of clients and the interests of their animals (59.6%). These were followed by challenging decisions about what counts as an essential veterinary service (48.1%); conflict between well-being of family/household members and professional role (46.3%); and challenging decisions about whether to perform non-contact veterinary visits (46.3%). The most stressful ECS (reported to be very or maximally stressful) were: conflicts between the interests of clients and the interests of their animals (50.2%), other (42.9%), conflicts between the interests of my employer and my own interests (42.5%), challenging decisions about how to proceed when clients have limited finances (39.4%), conflict between personal well-being and professional role (38.0%), and conflict between well-being of family/household members and professional role (33.6%). Thematic analysis of free-text responses revealed biosecurity, client financial limitations, animal welfare, working conditions, and client relations as prominent themes. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to describe the impacts of the pandemic on ECS experienced by veterinary teams globally. It identifies an increase in the frequency of ECS associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and a number of stressors unique to the pandemic. We identified a number of resources and strategies that may help veterinary team members navigate ethical challenges that may emerge in their daily work, as well as in the context of global crises.","Quain, Anne; Mullan, Siobhan; McGreevy, Paul D.; Ward, Michael P.",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.647108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912607/,179

Whether camostat mesylate is able to lower disease burden in coronavirus disease 2019 sepsis is currently unknown. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. SETTING: Patient treated in ICU of University hospital Göttingen, Germany. PATIENTS: Eleven critical ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients with organ failure were treated in ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Compassionate use of camostat mesylate (six patients, camostat group) or hydroxychloroquine (five patients, hydroxychloroquine group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical courses were assessed by Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score at days 1, 3, and 8. Further, viral load, oxygenation, and inflammatory markers were determined. Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score was comparable between camostat and hydroxychloroquine groups upon ICU admission. During observation, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score decreased in the camostat group but remained elevated in the hydroxychloroquine group. The decline in disease severity in camostat mesylate treated patients was paralleled by a decline in inflammatory markers and improvement of oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 decreased upon camostat mesylate treatment within a period of 8 days and a similar effect was not observed in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine.

The risk of patients developing COVID-19 after undergoing ambulatory procedures in hospitals is unknown. This paper aims to investigate the risk of developing COVID-19 from day-case and overnight stay upper limb procedures during the peak of the pandemic in London, and to discuss the implications for the safe management of elective hand and upper limb patients in the coming months. METHODS: 56 patients underwent emergency trauma upper limb procedures as a day case or with a single overnight stay from 1st March to May 31, 2020 at two central London hospitals that were also key players in the pan-London COVID response. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical and theatre records. Patients were contacted post-operatively and answered a structured questionnaire, including whether patients had experienced any of the symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the 14 days prior or 30 days following surgery. RESULTS: Of 56 patients, one patient reported COVID-19 symptoms, which were minor and did not require hospitalisation. Five patients experienced minor post-operative complications such as stiffness and scar hypersensitivity; one patient had a superficial wound infection.

The most common operation was a distal radius open reduction and internal fixation. The average time spent in hospital was 11 h (3–34 h) and 12 patients required an overnight stay. The median length of face-to-face follow up was 38.5 days. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that, with appropriate precautions, elective upper limb ambulatory surgery can be safely restarted with a low risk of contracting COVID-19 or its complications.","Trowbridge, Samuel; Wignadasan, Warran; Davenport, Dominic; Sarker, Shahrier; Hunter, Alistair; Gidwani, Sam",J Clin Orthop Trauma,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.07.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32999543/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0976566220303477; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976566220303477,179
626223,Rapid implementation of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to investigate cases of health-care associated COVID-19: a prospective genomic surveillance study,2020-07-14,"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently put forth a Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025 with several countries having already achieved key milestones. We aimed to understand whether and how digital health technologies (DHTs) are absorbed in Africa, tracking Ethiopia as a key node. We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to 02 February 2021 for studies of any design that investigated the potential of DHTs in clinical or public health practices in Ethiopia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021240645) and it was designed to inform our ongoing DHT-enabled randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04216420). We found 27,493 potentially relevant citations, among which 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 596,128 patients, healthy individuals, and healthcare professionals. The studies involved six DHTs: mHealth (29 studies, 574,649 participants); electronic health records (13 studies, 4534 participants); telemedicine (4 studies, 465 participants); cloud-based application (2 studies, 2382 participants); information communication technology (3 studies, 681 participants), and artificial intelligence (1 study, 13,417 participants). The studies targeted six health conditions: maternal and child health (15), infectious diseases (14), non-communicable diseases (3), dermatitis (1), surgery (4), and general health conditions (15). The outcomes of interest were feasibility, usability, willingness or readiness, effectiveness, quality improvement, and knowledge or attitude toward DHTs. Five studies involved RCTs. The analysis showed that although DHTs are a relatively recent phenomenon in Ethiopia, their potential harnessing clinical and public health practices are highly visible. Their adoption and implementation in full capacity require more training, access to better devices such as smartphones, and infrastructure. DHTs hold much promise tackling major clinical and public health backlogs and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem in Ethiopia. More RCTs are needed on emerging DHTs including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, cybersecurity, telemedicine, and wearable devices to provide robust evidence of their potential use in such settings and to materialize the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health.","Manyazewal, Tsegahun; Woldeamanuel, Yimtubezinash; Blumberg, Henry M.; Fekadu, Abebaw; Marconi, Vincent C.",NPJ Digit Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404895/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00487-4,179

In the first application, Helicobacter species-infected mouse samples were detected. The primers that insert a different tag sequence in each sample were prepared, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction was carried out. Then amplification products in which a part of the sequence was different in each sample could be obtained. The target sample in which these amplification products were mixed was injected into a cassette that included the DNA chip with immobilized probes. After the cassette was set in the DNA detection system, Genelyzer, the processes of hybridization, washing, and detection were performed by the system automatically. The positive and negative concordance rates of the existing nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and this method were 100% (40/40 samples) and 97.3% (117/120 samples), respectively. This is a simple high-throughput method. Moreover, the cost per sample can be drastically lowered. Therefore, it is expected to contribute to the diagnosis of infectious agents in humans and animals.","Nakamura, Naoko; Ito, Keiko; Hashimoto, Michie; Nakamura, Akiyoshi; Hayashimoto, Nobuhito; Takakura, Akira; Hashimoto, Koji; Nikaido, Masaru; Gemma, Nobuhiro",Anal Biochem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269711005471; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21925478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269711005471,179

The interactive effects of message framing and information presentation are assessed on both static and dynamic outcome variables employing a mixed between-within group methodology utilizing two sets of data through a longitudinal 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design. The results reveal that a gain-framed messaging combined with objective climate change information and objective carbon offsetting information results in significantly more positive impacts on changes in purchase intention of carbon offsetting products and increases willingness to pay for carbon offsetting. Conversely, the combination of loss-framed messages and subjective information presentation are shown not only to be ineffective in increasing carbon offsetting behavior but results in declines in tourists’ purchase intention of carbon offsetting products and willingness to pay for carbon offsetting.","Chi, Oscar Hengxuan; Denton, Gregory; Gursoy, Dogan",Tour Manag,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517720301709; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104244; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517720301709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100457/,179

The NF-κB proteins are activated by diverse signalling pathways that originate from many different cellular receptors and sensors. Many successful pathogens have acquired sophisticated mechanisms to regulate the NF-κB signalling pathways by deploying subversive proteins or hijacking the host signalling molecules.

There is a consensus on the treatment of acute phase of CIP, but the treatment of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the acute phase is still a clinical problem to be solved. METHODS: The diagnosis and treatment of a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient with immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonia in the Stereotactic Radiotherapy Department of Qingdao Central Hospital were retrospectively analyzed, and literatures were reviewed. RESULTS: A 70-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of left lung with mediastinal lymph node metastasis T3N3M0 stage Ⅲc, EGFR/ALK/ROS1/RAF negative, PD-L1 (22c3) immunohistochemistry negative. After the progression of first-line chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed as immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonia grade 3 during second-line monotherapy with Nivolumab. After initial high-dose glucocorticoid pulse therapy, the lung computed tomography (CT) imaging and clinical symptoms of the patients were partially relieved, and then pirfenidone (300 mg tid) was given orally for more than 11 months. During the treatment of pirfenidone, the CT imaging and clinical symptoms of the patients were significantly improved, and there were no other adverse reactions except grade 1 nausea. During this period, chemotherapy and Anlotinib was given concurrently with pirfenidone and showed good safety profile.

630499,A Rare Case of Hairy Cell Leukemia with Unusual Loss of CD123 Associated with COVID-19 at the Time of Presentation,2020-12-04,"Background: The number of cancer patients is constantly growing. Both WHO and IARC report that this number may reach up to 24 million new diagnosed cases in the next two decades. The proposed treatment and especially the diagnosis can have a significant impact on an individual's approach to the disease, as well as on the patient's quality of life. Objectives: The study aimed to assess the quality of life, feelings, and fear of cancer-treating oncological patients, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: The study used the standardized WHOQOL quality of life questionnaire in a shortened version, the COVID-19 fear scale (FCV-19S), and the AIS disease acceptance scale (in terms of cancer-related sensations). The questionnaire survey was conducted among patients of cancer clinics (Poland). The study was conducted in two stages–before the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). Data from 450 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed statistically. The obtained data were statistically processed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test (p = 0.05). Results: Among the surveyed patients of the cancer clinic, the quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased by 2%, compared to the period before the pandemic. The frequency of negative feelings associated with cancer increased during the COVID-19 pandemic–by 11% more men, and 4.4% of women determined the frequency of negative feelings to be 2–3 times a week. The level of fear associated with COVID-19 was moderate (57.1%), with women having a higher level of fear (12.5% higher than men). Conclusion: The development of the epidemic is very important in terms of public health. COVID-19 should be considered as one of the factors that bring about sudden changes in the mental health of the population, which may result from the dynamic development of this disease, dramatic media coverage, and own experiences. It has been shown that the sudden appearance of such a large stressor causes a decrease in patients' quality of life and an increase in negative feelings associated with chronic disease.","Grajek, Mateusz; Działach, Eliza; Buczkowska, Marta; Górski, Michał; Nowara, Elzbieta",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986710/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647196,179

The point of departure for large portions of this literature concerns the ugliness of greed, ambition, misdemeanors, and malfeasance of corporations, their directors, and those actors who hold shares in them. This essay takes a rather different starting point. Drawing upon insights from a distant field, it uses the discussion of aesthetics in Dewey’s treatise on art to ask what motivates directors to act in ways that constitute the attention and engagement that we associate with the effectiveness of boards. Using Dewey’s thinking about aesthetic experience, this paper examines the experience of organization boards, both in the literature and in the personal experience of the author. These observations point to need to reflect on motivation when considering both the practice of corporate governance and the policy frameworks in which it operates.","Nordberg, Donald",Philos Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193793/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40926-020-00152-y,179

Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 h after infection. Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) properties. Further animal studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of auranofin for the management of SARS-COV-2 associated disease.","Rothan, Hussin A.; Stone, Shannon; Natekar, Janhavi; Kumari, Pratima; Arora, Komal; Kumar, Mukesh",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442105/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682220300817?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682220300817,179

India is second highest currently worst effected by Covid 19 pandemic with close to 12.6 million cases and 1.6K deaths reported till date. Maharahstra is the highest Covid-19 burden state in India reporting quarter of overall cases. The city of Nagpur, in Maharashtra state, ranks 4th in terms of reported COVID-19 cases, with 2.5 lakh incidences and more than 4,000 deaths As the transmission rate of COVID-19 is high, it is imperative to study its disease epidemiology in regions of high endemicity to bolster our understanding of its spread, transmission dynamics and contact tracing to undertake appropriate public health control measures.. The present study was undertaken to study the incidence and trend of COVID-19 infection from various zonal regions of Nagpur city, using real time PCR (RT PCR). A retrospective study was carried out at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved private molecular diagnostic laboratory in Nagpur from period of 4th May 2020 to 14th November 2020. A total of 51,532 samples collected from various zonal regions of the city during the study period were processed for SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR. Patient information was collected using a pre-defined study proforma which included demographic details such as name, age, gender, address, along with other information, like details of sample collected, kits used and date of sample collected and processed. The study reports an overall Covid-19 positivity of 34% in Nagpur region. The zone wise distribution of positive cases indicated high rate of COVID-19 in endemic regions of Nagpur such as Satranjipura (49%), Ashi nagar (44%), Gandhibagh (43%) & Lakadganj (43%). Rates of infection were high in economically productive age group (21-40) with males being more vulnerable than females. The result of present epidemiology study highlights important data with respect to regions of endemicity within Nagpur city zones. The present data has high public health importance and will be useful for local civic bodies and other community stake holders to undertake appropriate control measures in future epidemic waves of Covid 19. Interestingly, the Government's reduction in testing rates has been helpful in increasing testing per day. The authorization of private laboratories has also increased testing.","Tanna, J.; Singha, B.; Nayak, A. R.; Husain, A. A.; Raje, D. V.; Desai, S.; Deshmukh, M.; Mundhada, S.; Kashyap, R.

Motivated by a real-world scenario in hospitals, we introduce the no-wait two-stage flowshop scheduling problem with the first-stage machine having multi-task flexibility. In this problem, each job has two operations which are processed in order on a two-stage flowshop without preemption and time delay between or on machines. The multi-task flexibility allows the first-stage machine to process the second-stage operations. The goal is to minimize the maximum completion time of all jobs. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering work on this problem. We discover several novel structural properties, based on which we present a linear-time combinatorial algorithm with an approximation ratio [Formula: see text]. This problem and its variants can find many other meaningful applications in modern manufacturing systems, such as the robot cell scheduling with computer numerical control machines or printed circuit boards.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1,521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1,571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%).Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to built safety perception towards COVID-19 vaccines and raise vaccine uptake rates by HCP, and thus to protect the healthcare workforce and the healthcare services.","Maltezou, Helena C.; Pavli, Androula; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Georgakopoulou, Theano; Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Drositis, Ioannis; Bolikas, Emmanouil; Ledda, Caterina; Adamis, Georgios; Spyrou, Andronikos; Karantoni, Eleni; Gamaletsou, Maria N.; Koukou, Dimitra Maria; Lourida, Athanasia; Moussas, Nikolaos; Petrakis, Vasilios; Panagopoulos, Periklis; Hatzigeorgiou, Dimitrios; Theodoridou, Maria; Lazanas, Marios; Gargalianos, Panagiotis; Sipsas, Nikolaos V.",Infect Dis Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045121000171?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906828/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2021.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045121000171,179

A priori we postulated that the metabolic rate is higher in limbal as compared to bulbar conjunctiva, and that this difference is reflected in microvascular structure or function between the two locations. Two study sites, Oslo University Hospital (OUH), Norway and Cleveland Clinic (CC), USA, used the same video microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to record limbal and bulbar microcirculation in sleeping piglets. All recordings were analyzed with custom-made software to quantify functional capillary density, capillary flow velocity and microvascular oxygen saturation in measuring volumes of approximately 0.1 mm(3). The functional capillary density was higher in limbus than in bulbar conjunctiva at both study sites (OUH: 18.1 ± 2.9 versus 12.2 ± 2.9 crossings per mm line, p < 0.01; CC: 11.3 ± 3.0 versus 7.1 ± 2.8 crossings per mm line, p < 0.01).

635265,ACE2 Decreased Expression During Kidney Inflammatory Diseases: Implications to Predisposing to COVID 19 Kidney Complications,2021-08-30,"Abstract Background COVID-19 can manifest as a viral induced hyperinflammation with multi-organ involvement. Such patients often experience rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation. Currently, no prospectively validated biomarker of impending respiratory failure is available. Objective We aimed to identify and prospectively validate biomarkers that allow the identification of patients in need of impending mechanical ventilation. Methods Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from February 29th to April 09th, 2020 were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings at admission and during the disease. Data from 89 evaluable patients were available for the purpose of analysis comprising an initial evaluation cohort (n=40) followed by a temporally separated validation cohort (n=49). Results We identified markers of inflammation, LDH and creatinine as most predictive variables of respiratory failure in the evaluation cohort. Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation followed by maximal CRP. Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83. The calculated optimal cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6> 80 pg/ml and CRP> 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure. Conclusion Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation. This suggests the possibility of using IL-6 or CRP levels to guide escalation of treatment in patients with COVID-19 related hyperinflammatory syndrome.","Herold, Tobias; Jurinovic, Vindi; Arnreich, Chiara; Lipworth, Brian J.; Hellmuth, Johannes C.; von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael; Klein, Matthias; Weinberger, Tobias",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920306850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425269/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920306850?v=s5,179
635649,Myopericarditis in a teenager following first mRNA COVID vaccine dose: the role of multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance,2021-09-24,"Two potential receptors have been described for the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV): feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) and feline dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing non-integrin (fDC-SIGN). In cell lines, fAPN serves as a receptor for serotype II, but not for serotype I FIPV. The role of fAPN in infection of in vivo target cells, monocytes, is not yet confirmed. Both serotype I and II FIPVs use fDC-SIGN for infection of monocyte-derived cells but how is not known. In this study, the role of fAPN and fDC-SIGN was studied at different stages in FIPV infection of monocytes. First, the effects of blocking the potential receptor(s) were studied for the processes of attachment and infection. Secondly, the level of co-localization of FIPV and the receptors was determined. It was found that FIPV I binding and infection were not affected by blocking fAPN while blocking fDC-SIGN reduced FIPV I binding to 36% and practically completely inhibited infection. Accordingly, 66% of bound FIPV I particles co-localized with fDC-SIGN. Blocking fAPN reduced FIPV II binding by 53% and infection by 80%. Further, 60% of bound FIPV II co-localized with fAPN. fDC-SIGN was not involved in FIPV II binding but infection was reduced with 64% when fDC-SIGN was blocked. In conclusion, FIPV I infection of monocytes depends on fDC-SIGN. Most FIPV I particles already interact with fDC-SIGN at the plasma membrane. For FIPV II, both fAPN and fDC-SIGN are involved in infection with only fAPN playing a receptor role at the plasma membrane.","Van Hamme, Evelien; Desmarets, Lowiese; Dewerchin, Hannah L.; Nauwynck, Hans J.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21600938/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211001687; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211001687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.04.031,179

However, the evidence remains inconsistent and at most, makes the case for differences between rural and urban environments as a whole. Here, we propose a model of depression driven by an individual’s accumulated experience mediated by social networks. The connection between observed systematic variations in socioeconomic networks and built environments with city size provides a link between urbanization and mental health. Surprisingly, this model predicts lower depression rates in larger cities. We confirm this prediction for US cities using four independent datasets. These results are consistent with other behaviors associated with denser socioeconomic networks and suggest that larger cities provide a buffer against depression. This approach introduces a systematic framework for conceptualizing and modeling mental health in complex physical and social networks, producing testable predictions for environmental and social determinants of mental health also applicable to other psychopathologies.","Stier, Andrew J.; Schertz, Kathryn E.; Rim, Nak Won; Cardenas-Iniguez, Carlos; Lahey, Benjamin B.; Bettencourt, Luís M.

This can lead to effects on mental health of the population. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on psychological well-being and associated factors among the Pakistani general population. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 26th April and 15th May and included participants from all over the Pakistan. Attitudes and worriedness about COVID-19 pandemic were assessed using a structured questionnaire. A validated English and Urdu version of the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) was used to assess the well-being. Factor analysis was done to extract the attitude item domains. Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with poor well-being. Results: A total of 1,756 people participated in the survey. Almost half 50% of the participants were male, and a similar proportion was employed. About 41% of the participants were dependent on financial sources other than salary. News was considered a source of fear as 72% assumed that avoiding such news may reduce the fear. About 68% of the population was worried about contracting the disease. The most common coping strategies used during lockdown were spending quality time with family, eating healthy food, adequate sleep, and talking to friends on phone. Prevalence of poor well-being was found to be 41.2%. Female gender, being unemployed, living in Sindh and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), fear of COVID-19, and having chronic illness were significantly associated with poor well-being. Similarly, coping strategies during lockdown (doing exercise; spending time with family; eating healthy food; having good sleep; contributing in social welfare work and spending time on hobbies) were also significantly associated with mental well-being. Conclusion: We found a high prevalence 41.2% of poor well-being among the Pakistani general population. We also investigated risk factors of poor well-being which included female gender, unemployment, being resident of ICT and Sindh, fear, chronic illness, and absence of coping strategies. This calls for immediate action at population level in the form of targeted mass psychological support programs to improve the mental health of population during the COVID-19 crises.","Khan, Adeel Ahmed; Lodhi, Fahad Saqib; Rabbani, Unaib; Ahmed, Zeeshan; Abrar, Saidul; Arshad, Saamia; Irum, Saadia; Khan, Muhammad Imran",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.564364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33510654/,179

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has forced universities to switch from face-to-face to online instruction. Furthermore, this transfer process was planned and executed quickly, with urgent redesigns of courses originally conceived for live teaching. The aim of this work is to measure the service quality of online teaching delivered during the COVID-19 period. The methodology was based on an importance-performance analysis using a structural equations model. The data were obtained from a sample of 467 students attending a university in southern Spain. The results reveal five priority attributes of online teaching that need to be improved in order to enhance the service quality of the virtual instruction provided to students. Universities need to redefine their online format by integrating methodological and technological decisions and involving collaboration between teachers, students and administration staff and services. The results do not apply to educational institutions that exclusively teach courses online, but to those institutions that had to rapidly adapt, and shift course material originally designed for face-to-face training.","Ramírez-Hurtado, José M.; Hernández-Díaz, Alfredo G.; López-Sánchez, Ana D.; Pérez-León, Víctor E.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804546/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052403,179
637204,Waitlisted Transplant Candidates’ Attitudes and Concerns Toward Transplantation During COVID-19,2020-12-08,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually more severe and associated with worst outcomes in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension or atherothrombosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can differentially infect multiple tissues (i.e., lung, vessel, heart, liver) in different stages of disease, and in an age- and sex-dependent manner. In particular, cardiovascular (CV) cells (e.g., endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes) could be directly infected and indirectly disturbed by systemic alterations, leading to hyperinflammatory, apoptotic, thrombotic, and vasoconstrictive responses. Until now, hundreds of clinical trials are testing antivirals and immunomodulators to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection or related systemic anomalies. However, new therapies targeting the CV system might reduce the severity and lethality of disease. In this line, activation of the non-canonical pathway of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could improve CV homeostasis under COVID-19. In particular, treatments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) may help to reduce hyperinflammation and viral propagation, while infusion of soluble ACE2 may trap plasma viral particles and increase cardioprotective Ang-(1–9) and Ang-(1–7) peptides. The association of specific ACE2 polymorphisms with increased susceptibility of infection and related CV pathologies suggests potential genetic therapies. Moreover, specific agonists of Ang-(1–7) receptor could counter-regulate the hypertensive, hyperinflammatory, and hypercoagulable responses. Interestingly, sex hormones could also regulate all these RAAS components. Therefore, while waiting for an efficient vaccine, we suggest further investigations on the non-canonical RAAS pathway to reduce cardiovascular damage and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Lumpuy-Castillo, Jairo; Lorenzo-Almorós, Ana; Pello-Lázaro, Ana María; Sánchez-Ferrer, Carlos; Egido, Jesús; Tuñón, José; Peiró, Concepción; Lorenzo, Óscar",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899833/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186471,179

Various countries around the world with their diverse health care systems, have responded to the pandemic in very distinctive ways. In this paper, we: compared COVID-19 mortality rates across global geographic regions; and assessed differences in COVID-19-related case fatality rate (CFR) based on presence or absence of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). We found that as of May 6, 2020, Europe had experienced the highest CFR globally of 9.6%, followed by 5.9% in North America. Although the pandemic originated in Asia, the continent ranked second to the last in terms of CFR (3.5%). Countries with UHC had lower number of cases of 37.6%, but the CFR of countries with UHC was twice that of countries without UHC (10.5% versus 4.9%). In conclusion, UHC does not appear to protect against mortality in a pandemic environment such as with COVID-19.","Dongarwar, Deepa; Salihu, Hamisu M.",Int J MCH AIDS,https://doi.org/10.21106/ijma.389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461818/,179

METHODS: 9,386 UK Biobank study participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16(th) 2020 to June 29(th) 2020 were analyzed. A forward model building approach was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were stratified by age due to a significant first-order interaction between age and HWC. RESULTS: Approximately 17% (n = 1,577) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. BMI category had a linear association with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among participants <65 years (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17). For participants ≥65 years, only obesity class II (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10–1.74) had a significantly greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who were underweight/normal weight. While HWC was not associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in those <65 years, having an HWC was associated with an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in participants ≥65 years (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.27). CONCLUSION: The associations of BMI and HWC with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 differed by age. Notably, HWC was associated with testing positive in those ≥65 years, but not those who were younger, independent of BMI. This suggests that measures of adiposity in addition to BMI may be used to identify older individuals at greater risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.","Christensen, Rebecca A.

To better understand the impact of the pandemic on work and careers, I call for research taking a closer look at the boundaries in the career context. Specifically, both the micro (boundaries that demarcate role domains) and macro (national borders) boundaries should be considered. The pandemic changes the existing boundaries and challenges the “usual” practices; while it blurs the micro, cross-domain boundaries, it strengthens the macro, cross-country boundaries. I propose that the changes in the micro and macro boundaries are one of the important mechanisms in how COVID-19 affects many individuals' vocational behaviors and career outcomes. In this essay, I explain why we should pay more attention to the boundaries to learn about the impact of COVID-19 on vocational and career behaviors.

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of “time to clinical cure,” “virological cure,” “death or clinical worsening of disease,” “radiological progression,” and safety. RevMan was used for meta‐analysis. We searched 16 literature databases out of which seven studies (n = 1358) were included in the systematic review. In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in “time to body temperature normalization” and one study reported less “cough days” in the HCQ arm. Treatment with HCQ resulted in less number of cases showing the radiological progression of lung disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11‐0.9).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of an online clinical rotation in Obstetrics and Gynecology during the Covid-19 pandemic and to identify effective pedagogical modalities as well as obstacles to online learning. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the students and staff at the end of the 3-week online rotation. The online curriculum included synchronous learning such as problem-based learning, video demonstrations and discussions, as well as asynchronous pre-recorded lectures. Questions addressed expectations, previous experience, difficulties encountered, effectiveness of different types of pedagogy, and willingness to participate in online education in the future. RESULTS: We received 27 completed questionnaires, 77% response rate. Overall course rating was 4.14/5 from the students and 3.38/5 from the staff. Previous experience in online education had a positive correlation with higher overall course evaluations; however, low expectations of effectiveness of online learning prior to the course did not correlate with the overall course rate. Challenges identified were absence of bedside teaching and lack of feedback. Effective pedagogical modules were problem-based learning and videos. Additionally, 72% stated that online learning should be part of the formal curriculum.

There has been an immediate need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support, and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease, common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available. Objective This systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19. Methods Searches were developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies published between January 2020 and July 2020 were retrieved. Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type, setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation, ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and geographic locations were summarized. Results A primary review found 292 articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 246 were excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty-six articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on inclusion was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.79 - 0.93). When the PROBAST tool was applied, 44 of the 46 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or unclear concern for applicability. Two studied reported prediction models, 4C Mortality Score from hospital data and QCOVID from general public data from UK, and were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability. Conclusion Several prognostic models are reported in the literature, but many of them had concerning risks of biases and applicability. For most of the studies, caution is needed before use, as many of them will require external validation before dissemination. However, two articles were found to have low risk of bias and low applicability can be useful tools.","Miller, J.; Tada, M.; Goto, M.; Mohr, N.

This concept helps consider how specific social, economic and political hierarchies and policies produce and pattern poor health in two case studies: one at the USA–Mexico border and another in Djibouti. Migrants’ and providers’ various entanglements within inequitable and sometimes violent global migration systems can produce shared structural vulnerabilities that then differentially affect health and other outcomes. In response, we argue providers require specialised training and support; professional associations, healthcare institutions, universities and humanitarian organisations should work to end the criminalisation of medical and humanitarian assistance to migrants; migrants should help lead efforts to reform medical and humanitarian interventions; and alternative care models in Global South to address the structural vulnerabilities inherent to migration and asylum should be supported.","Carruth, Lauren; Martinez, Carlos; Smith, Lahra; Donato, Katharine; Piñones-Rivera, Carlos; Quesada, James",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827797/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005109,179

Each stage of the molecular procedure has been standardized and optimized, including the total white blood cells (WBCs) and RNA isolation methods. Here, we compare the performance of our current manual protocol to a newly semiautomatic method based on the Biomek i-5 Automated Workstations integrated with the CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer, followed by the automatic QIAsymphony system to facilitate high-throughput processing samples and reduce the hands-on time and the risk associated with SARS-CoV-2. The recovery efficiency was investigated in blood samples from 100 adults with CML. We observe a 100% of concordance between the two methods, with similar total WBCs isolated (median 1.137 × 10(6) for manual method vs. 1.076 × 10(6) for semiautomatic system) and a comparable quality and quantity of RNA extracted (median 103 ng/μL with manual isolation kit vs. 99.95 ng/μL with the QIAsymphony system). Moreover, by stratifying patients according to their BCR-ABL1 transcript levels, we obtained similar BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) values and ABL1 copies, and matched samples were assigned to the same group of molecular response.

To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing glycolipids/glycoproteins. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.","Hao, Wei; Ma, Bo; Li, Ziheng; Wang, Xiaoyu; Gao, Xiaopan; Li, Yaohao; Qin, Bo; Shang, Shiying; Cui, Sheng; Tan, Zhongping",Sci Bull (Beijing),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095927321000463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927321000463?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495714/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2021.01.010,179

The restrictions on movement have made some forms of physical activity harder to achieve and increased the chances of more sedentary behaviour. Independent of exercise taken, sedentary behaviour can have a negative impact upon mental health, especially by lowering mood. We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home. These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others.

644319,Peritonsillar abscess and concomitant COVID-19 in a 21-year-old male,2020-09-07,"Abstract A method is described for in vitro studies of viral humoral immune responses in the pig. After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation. Extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system, it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig.","Berthon, P.; Bernard, S.; Salmon, H.; Minns, R.

In order to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, unprecedented measures such as total/partial lockdowns and ban on public gatherings have been put in place by several governments. These measures implemented have put a halt on academic activities and schooling and have invariably affected the delivery of pharmacy education globally and Africa is no exception. In order to ensure the continuity of pharmacy education, the e-learning strategy has been utilized by several countries in the world today and Africa should not be left out. There is an urgent need for Africa to meet up with the present education demands by adopting the e-learning strategy but this is not without challenges. We examine the impact of these measures on pharmacy education as well as the challenges affecting the uptake and applicability of the e-learning strategy in pharmacy education in Africa. It is therefore essential for the government and relevant stakeholders in the pharmacy education sector to address the numerous challenges that may hinder its uptake in Africa.","Okereke, Melody; Williams, Alison Ekwere; Emmanuella, Nzeribe Chisom; Ashinedu, Nelson Ukor; Mairaj, Muhammad Waqas",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.2.23910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623594/,179

On March 18, 2021 the European Medicines Agency reported a serious and rare adverse effect of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine; most of these cases were associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). To date, there are no cases of TTS-related CVST reported after receipt of either of the 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States. We report a case of CVST with the Moderna mRNA vaccine. CASE REPORT: A healthy 45-year-old male patient without any risk factors presented with new-onset seizures 8 days after the receipt of the 2(nd) dose of Moderna (mRNA-1273), with concomitant SAH as a complication. One day prior to admission, he noted headaches and neck pain unrelieved by over-the-counter analgesics. Computed tomography (CT) scan brain without contrast revealed a left frontal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) along with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain confirmed the CT findings as well as anterior superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. He had normal platelet count with a negative thrombophilia work-up and cancer screening. He was successfully anticoagulated with heparin and discharged on warfarin without neurological sequelae or further seizures. The case was reported to the US Vaccine Surveillance System. CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccine-related CVST is an extremely rare phenomenon. More data are needed to establish causality and understand the role of vaccine-related immune response resulting in thrombotic events with or without TTS.","Syed, Khezar; Chaudhary, Haseeb; Donato, Anthony",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34478433/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.933397,179

We assessed the burden of suffering related to prolonged coughing and tried to identify further causative agents. Based on a sentinel study with 35 general practitioners in two German cities (Krefeld, Rostock), with 3,946 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, we estimated the incidence of prolonged coughing in adults. In 975 of these outpatients, PCR and/or serology for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were performed. Treatment data were extracted for a subgroup of 138 patients. Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan–Maier curves were generated. Yearly incidence ranged between 1.4 and 2.1% per population in the two cities. Adult patients sought medical attention only after a median of 3 weeks of coughing. Irrespective of smoking and unrelated to the identified pathogens, the median duration of coughing was 6 weeks, with an interquartile range of 4–11 weeks. In 48.3% of patients, possible pathogens were identified, among which adenovirus (15.1%), RSV (7.5%), B. pertussis (5.6%), and influenza viruses (4.0%) were most often found. Symptoms were not indicative of a specific agent and a total of 64% of patients received antibiotics. Prolonged adult coughing requiring medical attention prompts substantial healthcare use. Apart from B. pertussis, a broad range of pathogens was associated with the symptoms. However, patients sought medical attention too late to guide efficacious therapeutic interventions using the diagnostic tests.","Weinberger, Raphael; Riffelmann, Marion; Kennerknecht, Nicole; Hülße, Christel; Littmann, Martina; O’Brien, Judith; von Kries, Rüdiger; von König, Carl Heinz Wirsing",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29302815/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-017-3158-6,179
646559,Heart Retransplantation Following COVID-19 Illness in a Heart Transplant Recipient,2020-07-07,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Molecular docking in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulation was accomplished as they extend an ample opportunity to screen plausible inhibitors of the main protease from Leucas zeylanica. The preferential phytochemicals were identified from L. zeylanica through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The pre-eminent three identified phytochemicals exhibited toxicity by no means during the scrutinization of ADME/T prominences. Moreover, pharmacologically distinguishing characteristics and the biological activity of the lead phytochemicals were satisfying as an antiviral drug contender. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation exhibited thermal stability and a stable binding affinity of the protein–compound complex that referred to the appreciable efficacy of lead optimization. Therefore, the preferable phytochemicals are worth substantial evaluation in the biological laboratory to recommend plausible antiviral drug candidates. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a contemporary coronavirus, has impacted global economic activity and has a high transmission rate. As a result of the virus’s severe medical effects, developing effective vaccinations is vital. Plant-derived metabolites have been discovered as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is a target for therapeutic research because of its highly conserved protein sequence. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and molecular docking were used to screen 34 compounds identified from Leucas zeylanica for potential inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). In addition, prime molecular mechanics–generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) was used to screen the compound dataset using a molecular dynamics simulation. From molecular docking analysis, 26 compounds were capable of interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), while three compounds, namely 11-oxa-dispiro[4.0.4.1]undecan-1-ol (−5.755 kcal/mol), azetidin-2-one 3,3-dimethyl-4-(1-aminoethyl) (−5.39 kcal/mol), and lorazepam, 2TMS derivative (−5.246 kcal/mol), exhibited the highest docking scores. These three ligands were assessed by MM-GBSA, which revealed that they bind with the necessary M(pro) amino acids in the catalytic groove to cause protein inhibition, including Ser144, Cys145, and His41. The molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the complex rigidity and stability of the docked ligand–M(pro) complexes based on the analysis of mean radical variations, root-mean-square fluctuations, solvent-accessible surface area, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond formation. The study of the postmolecular dynamics confirmation also confirmed that lorazepam, 11-oxa-dispiro[4.0.4.1]undecan-1-ol, and azetidin-2-one-3, 3-dimethyl-4-(1-aminoethyl) interact with similar M(pro) binding pockets. The results of our computerized drug design approach may assist in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Dutta, Mycal; Tareq, Abu Montakim; Rakib, Ahmed; Mahmud, Shafi; Sami, Saad Ahmed; Mallick, Jewel; Islam, Mohammad Nazmul; Majumder, Mohuya; Uddin, Md.

646764,Rapid Cerebral Edema and Herniation in a 65-Year-Old Man With Balamuthia Mandrillaris,2021-04-15,"INTRODUCTION: During this long COVID‐19 pandemic outbreak, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are being widely used to treat patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory failure (ARF). As for now, data on the efficacy of NIV in COVID‐19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are lacking, and for this reason it is extremely important to accurately determine the outcomes of this strategy. This study aimed to evaluate clinical data and outcomes of NIV in patients with COVID‐19 ARDS. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy‐nine consecutive patients with sudden worsening of respiratory failure were evaluated. All patients (71% male) had a confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and signs, symptoms and radiological findings compatible with COVID‐19 pneumonia and all of them underwent a trial of NIV. Primary outcomes were NIV success and failure defined by intubation and mortality rate. Secondary outcome was the duration of NIV. RESULTS: NIV was successful in 38 (48.1%) patients (Table 1). EOT was necessary in 21 patients (26.6%). Death occurred in 20 patients (25.3%). In the group of patients having failed a trial with NIV and then being intubated, compared to those who continued NIV, there was no higher mortality rate. By evaluating the ICU survival outcome of the subgroup of patients intubated after NIV, 57% of the patients were discharged and 43% died. CONCLUSION: Previous studies conducted on patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation showed higher mortality rate than the present study. Our data showed that NIV can avoid intubation in almost half of the patients. Therefore, this data could reassure clinicians who would consider using NIV in COVID‐19 ARDS‐related treatment.","Menzella, Francesco; Barbieri, Chiara; Fontana, Matteo; Scelfo, Chiara; Castagnetti, Claudia; Ghidoni, Giulia; Ruggiero, Patrizia; Livrieri, Francesco; Piro, Roberto; Ghidorsi, Luca; Montanari, Gloria; Gibellini, Giorgia; Casalini, Eleonora; Falco, Francesco; Catellani, Chiara; Facciolongo, Nicola",Clin Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728822/; https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13361,179
646898,"Suggestions from Cremona, Italy - two months into the pandemic at the frontline of COVID-19 in Europe",2020-06-09,"In response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, governments around the world issued stay‐at‐home orders, which required that individuals stay at home unless they were engaging in certain activities. Often these orders would designate certain goods and services as “essential” and would permit individuals engaged in the production, delivery, and purchase of those goods and services to leave their homes to do so. Implicit in these policies, of course, is the assumption that policymakers can know ex ante which goods and services are essential. As proved true while these stay‐at‐home orders were in effect, essentialness is necessarily subjective and depends on knowledge that is often dispersed, inarticulate, and changes over time. Policymakers, however, do not and often cannot have access to the local knowledge needed to determine ex ante which goods and services are essential, and they lack the feedback mechanisms they would need to adroitly adapt when circumstances change. This paper examines these knowledge problems associated with designating certain goods and services as “essential” when crafting and implementing stay‐at‐home orders.","Storr, Virgil Henry; Haeffele, Stefanie; Lofthouse, Jordan K.; Grube, Laura E.",South Econ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821051/; https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12491,179

We assessed COVID-19-related stigma and bullying against HCW controlling for social, psychological, medical and community variables. DESIGN: We nested an analytical cross-sectional study of COVID-19-related stigma and bullying among HCW within a larger mixed-methods effort assessing COVID-19-related lived experience and impact. Adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% CIs evaluated the association between working in healthcare settings and experience of COVID-19-related bullying and stigma, controlling for confounders. Thematic qualitative analysis provided insight into lived experience of COVID-19-related bullying. SETTING: We recruited potential participants in four languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian) through Amazon Mechanical Turk’s online workforce and Facebook. PARTICIPANTS: Our sample included 7411 people from 173 countries who were aged 18 years or over. FINDINGS: HCW significantly experienced more COVID-19-related bullying after controlling for the confounding effects of job-related, personal, geographic and sociocultural variables (aOR: 1.5; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0). HCW more frequently believed that people gossip about others with COVID-19 (OR: 2.2; 95% CI 1.9 to 2.6) and that people with COVID-19 lose respect in the community (OR: 2.3; 95% CI 2.0 to 2.7), both which elevate bullying risk (OR: 2.7; 95% CI 2.3 to 3.2, and OR: 3.5; 95% CI 2.9 to 4.2, respectively). The lived experience of COVID-19-related bullying relates frequently to public identities as HCW traverse through the community, intersecting with other domains (eg, police, racism, violence). INTERPRETATION: After controlling for a range of confounding factors, HCW are significantly more likely to experience COVID-19-related stigma and bullying, often in the intersectional context of racism, violence and police involvement in community settings.","Dye, Timothy D; Alcantara, Lisette; Siddiqi, Shazia; Barbosu, Monica; Sharma, Saloni; Panko, Tiffany; Pressman, Eva",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33380488/,179

METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to compare ED volume and rates of admission for patients presenting to the ED between January and early May of 2018, 2019, and 2020. RESULTS: Immediately after California’s “safer-at-home” declaration, ED utilization dropped by 11,000 visits (37%) compared to the same nine weeks in prior years. The drop affected patients regardless of acuity, demographics, or diagnosis. Reductions were observed in the number of patients reporting symptoms often associated with COVID-19 and all other complaints. After the declaration, higher acuity, older, male, Black, uninsured or non-Medicaid, publicly insured, accounted for a disproportionate share of utilization. CONCLUSION: We show an abrupt, discontinuous impact of COVID-19 on ED utilization with a slow return as safer-at-home orders have lifted. It is imperative to determine how this reduction will impact patient outcomes, disease control, and the health of the community in the medium and long terms.","Lam, Chun Nok; Axeen, Sarah; Terp, Sophie; Burner, Elizabeth; Dworkis, Daniel A.; Arora, Sanjay; Menchine, Michael",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856306/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.12.49234,179

There is evidence that Covid-19 causes gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormalities in liver enzymes. We aimed to determine if hepatobiliary laboratory data could predict disease severity in patients with Covid-19. In this retrospective, single institution, cohort study that analyzed patients admitted to a community academic hospital with the diagnosis of Covid-19, we found that elevations of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) at any time during hospital admission increased the odds of ICU admission by 5.12 (95% CI: 1.55–16.89; p = 0.007), 4.71 (95% CI: 1.51–14.69; p = 0.01) and 4.12 (95% CI: 1.21–14.06, p = 0.02), respectively. Hypoalbuminemia found at the time of admission to the hospital was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.02), hypotension (p = 0.03), and need for vasopressors (p = 0.02), intubation (p = 0.01) and hemodialysis (p = 0.002). Additionally, there was evidence of liver injury: AST was significantly elevated above baseline in patients admitted to the ICU (54.2 ± 15.70 U/L) relative to those who were not (9.2 ± 4.89 U/L; p = 0.01). Taken together, this study found that hypoalbuminemia and abnormalities in hepatobiliary laboratory data may be prognostic factors for disease severity in patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19.","Wagner, Jason; Garcia-Rodriguez, Victor; Yu, Abraham; Dutra, Barbara; Larson, Scott; Cash, Brooks; DuPont, Andrew; Farooq, Ahmad",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986318/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89340-y,179

DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of 5 databases, and screening of eligible articles, from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We focused on quantitative and mixed-method studies that evaluated adolescent mental health literacy, appropriate package of services and provider competencies in mental health services, and that targeted depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among adolescents (10–19 years). This included adolescents exposed to interventions or strategies within mental health services. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes for Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Data were extracted and grouped based on WHO quality Standards. RESULTS: Of the 20 104 studies identified, 20 articles were included. The majority of studies came from high-income countries, with one from a low-income country. Most of the studies did not conceptualise quality. Results found that an online decision aid was evaluated to increase adolescent mental health literacy. Studies that targeted an appropriate package of services evaluated the quality of engagement between the therapist and adolescent, patient-centred communication, mental health service use, linkages to mental health services, health facility culture and intensive community treatment. Provider competencies focused on studies that evaluated confidence in managing and referring adolescents, collaboration between health facility levels, evidence-based practices and technology use. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There is limited evidence on quality measures in adolescent mental health services (as conforms to the WHO Global Standards), pointing to a global evidence gap for adolescent mental health services.

It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (~45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (~6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (~+11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level.","Ranjan, Avinash Kumar; Patra, A.

652878,Covid-19 Hyperinflammation and Post-Covid-19 Illness May Be Rooted in Mast Cell Activation Syndrome,2020-09-10,"Work with highly pathogenic material mandates the use of biological containment facilities, involving microbiological safety cabinets and specialist laboratory engineering structures typified by containment level 3 (CL3) and CL4 laboratories. Consequences of working in high containment are the practical difficulties associated with containing specialist assays and equipment often essential for experimental analyses. In an era of increased interest in biodefence pathogens and emerging diseases, immunological analysis has developed rapidly alongside traditional techniques in virology and molecular biology. For example, in order to maximise the use of small sample volumes, multiplexing has become a more popular and widespread approach to quantify multiple analytes simultaneously, such as cytokines and chemokines. The luminex microsphere system allows for the detection of many cytokines and chemokines in a single sample, but the detection method of using aligned lasers and fluidics means that samples often have to be analysed in low containment facilities. In order to perform cytokine analysis in materials from high containment (CL3 and CL4 laboratories), we have developed an appropriate inactivation methodology after staining steps, which although results in a reduction of median fluorescent intensity, produces statistically comparable outcomes when judged against non-inactivated samples. This methodology thus extends the use of luminex technology for material that contains highly pathogenic biological agents.","Dowall, Stuart D.; Graham, Victoria A.; Tipton, Thomas R.W.; Hewson, Roger",J Immunol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2009.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002217590900194X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19560467/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002217590900194X,179

Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to those of antiviral agents.

653340,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis following paracetamol ingestion in a child,2015-05-24,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities on earth, yet the repertoire of viral proteins remains poorly explored. As the number of sequenced virus genomes grows into the thousands, and the number of viral proteins into the hundreds of thousands, we report a systematic computational analysis of the point of first-contact between viruses and their hosts, namely viral transmembrane (TM) proteins. RESULTS: The complement of α-helical TM proteins in double-stranded DNA viruses infecting bacteria and archaea reveals large-scale trends that differ from those of their hosts. Viruses typically encode a substantially lower fraction of TM proteins than archaea or bacteria, with the notable exception of viruses with virions containing a lipid component such as a lipid envelope, internal lipid core, or inner membrane vesicle. Compared to bacteriophages, archaeal viruses are substantially enriched in membrane proteins. However, this feature is not always stable throughout the evolution of a viral lineage; for example, TM proteins are not part of the common heritage shared between Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. In contrast to bacteria and archaea, viruses almost completely lack proteins with complicated membrane topologies composed of more than 4 TM segments, with the few detected exceptions being obvious cases of relatively recent horizontal transfer from the host. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic differences between the membrane proteomes of cells and viruses stem from the fact that viruses do not depend on essential membranes for energy transformation, ion homeostasis, nutrient transport and signaling.

However, the expression of eIF3f in gastric cancer (GC) is not well understood to date. Therefore, the aim of this study is to detect the expression of eIF3f in GC. METHODS: The expression of eIF3f was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissues with stage I to III GC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) of 195 gastrectomy specimens; clinicopathological results, including survival, were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive expression rate of eIF3f was significantly higher in ANCT tissues than in GC. eIF3f levels were correlated with more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all P <0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f could serve as a prognosis marker for poor outcome of GC patients (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence, thus representing a promising predictive marker for the prognosis of GC.","Li, Guanghua; Wang, Na; Sun, Chuanjin; Li, Bo",World J Surg Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7819-12-72; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678890/,179

The respondents were executives of industrials firms whose factories, warehouses, and headquarters are located in Northern Italy. This is undoubtedly the European region first and most extensively affected by the pandemic, and the government implemented radical lockdown measures, banning nonessential travel and mandating the shutdown of all nonessential businesses. Several major effects on both product and service businesses are highlighted, including the disruption of field-service operations and supply networks. This study also highlights the increased importance of servitization business models and the acceleration of digital transformation and advanced services. To help firms navigate through the crisis and be better positioned after the pandemic, the authors present a four-stage crisis management model (calamity, quick & dirty, restart, and adapt), which provides insights and critical actions that should be taken to cope with the expected short and long-term implications of the crisis. Finally, this study discusses how servitization can enhance resilience for future crises—providing a set of indicators on the presumed role of, and impact on, service operations in relation to what executives expect to be the “next normal.”","Rapaccini, Mario; Saccani, Nicola; Kowalkowski, Christian; Paiola, Marco; Adrodegari, Federico",Industrial Marketing Management,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850120304247; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019850120304247,179
654020,Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia: Case Series,2021-05-11,"New vaccines are urgently needed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which kills more than 1.4 million people each year. CD4 T cell differentiation is a key determinant of protective immunity against Mtb, but it is not fully understood how host-pathogen interactions shape individual antigen-specific T cell populations and their protective capacity. Here, we investigated the immunodominant Mtb antigen, MPT70, which is upregulated in response to gamma interferon (IFN-γ) or nutrient/oxygen deprivation of in vitro-infected macrophages. Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analyzed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1(+)CX3CR1(+) CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination, and against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred protection similar to vaccination with ESAT-6. Together, our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells toward terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune balance in favor of the host.","Clemmensen, Helena Strand; Dube, Jean-Yves; McIntosh, Fiona; Rosenkrands, Ida; Jungersen, Gregers; Aagaard, Claus; Andersen, Peter; Behr, Marcel A.; Mortensen, Rasmus",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879592/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00226-21,179
654784,"Onset, duration and unresolved symptoms, including smell and taste changes, in mild COVID-19 infections. A cohort study in Israeli patients",2021-02-16,"INTRODUCTION: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is used to objectively assess the degree of parenchymal impairment in COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study on 61 COVID-19 patients (severe and non-severe; 33 men, age 63+/-15 years) who underwent a CT scan due to tachypnea, dyspnoea or desaturation. QCT was performed using VCAR software. Patients’ clinical data was collected, including laboratory results and oxygenation support. The optimal cut-off point for CT parameters for predicting death and respiratory support was performed by maximizing the Youden Index in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The analysis revealed significantly greater progression of changes: ground-glass opacities (GGO) (31,42% v 13,89%, p<0.001), consolidation (11,85% v 3,32%, p<0.001) in patients with severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Five lobes were involved in all patients with severe disease. In non-severe patients, a positive correlation was found between severity of GGO, consolidation and emphysema and sex, tachypnea, chest x-ray (CXR) score on admission and laboratory parameters: CRP, D-dimer, ALT, lymphocyte count and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. In the group of severe patients, a correlation was found between sex, creatinine level and death. ROC analysis on death prediction was used to establish the cut-off point for GGO at 24.3% (AUC 0.8878, 95% CI 0.7889–0.9866; sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 75.5%), 5.6% for consolidation (AUC 0.7466, 95% CI 0.6009–0.8923; sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 59.2%), and 37.8% for total (GGO+consolidation) (AUC 0.8622, 95% CI 0.7525–0.972; sensitivity 75%, specificity 83.7%). The cut-off point for predicting respiratory support was established for GGO at 18.7% (AUC 0.7611, 95% CI 0.6268–0.8954; sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 64.4%), consolidation at 3.88% (AUC 0.7438, 95% CI 0.6146–0.8729; sensitivity 100%, specificity 46.7%), and total at 23.5% (AUC 0.7931, 95% CI 0.673–0.9131; sensitivity 93.8%, specificity 57.8%). CONCLUSION: QCT is a good diagnostic tool which facilitates decision-making regarding intensification of oxygen support and transfer to an intensive care unit in patients severely ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. QCT can make an independent and simple screening tool to assess the risk of death, regardless of clinical symptoms. Usefulness of QCT to predict the risk of death is higher than to assess the indications for respiratory support.","Rorat, Marta; Jurek, Tomasz; Simon, Krzysztof; Guziński, Maciej",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015025/,179

The origin of these emerging respiratory viruses may be zoonotic (by crossing species barrier, after changes to RNA viruses such as avian influenza virus type A or coronaviruses), or related to the use of new identification techniques (metapneumovirus, bocavirus). The relationship between bronchiolitis and asthma is now better understood thanks to prospective follow up of birth cohorts. The role of rhinovirus has become predominant with respect to respiratory syncytial virus. The identification of predisposing factors immunological, functional, atopic and genetic, for the onset of asthma after rhinovirus infection suggests that viral infection reveals a predisposition rather than itself being a cause of asthma. The role of bacteria in the natural history of asthma is also beginning to be better understood. The results of the COPSAC Danish cohort have shown the frequency of bacterial identification during wheezy episodes before 3 years, and the impact of bacterial colonization at the age of one month on the onset of asthma by age 5 years.

The pandemic forced students into an unfamiliar learning ecosystem to which they had to quickly adapt in order to continue to be successful in their courses. Literature supports the importance of metacognition and self-regulated learning in the success of students in an online environment. More importantly, the concept of metacognitive regulation, which includes monitoring, planning, executing, and adapting learning strategies, is vital to student academic success. These strategies have been shown to close the opportunity gap observed specifically in persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) in STEM. Outlined here is the use of student-developed learning plans as a guided process to enhance students’ metacognitive regulation of their learning. These learning plans provide students a template to assist them in time management, practical study skills and planned study sessions, that are designed to increase their self-efficacy, motivation, and performance in online classes. Moreover, the iterative nature of the learning plan encourages students to continue to use and expand this plan in other academic courses.","Roberts, JoAnn S.",J Microbiol Biol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884055/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2409,179

658502,Successfully superior mesenteric artery stenting in operated type A aortic dissection complicated with delayed mesenteric malperfusion,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people’s lives at unprecedented speed and scale, including how they eat and work, what they are concerned about, how much they move, and how much they can earn. Traditional surveys in the area of public health can be expensive and time-consuming, and they can rapidly become outdated. The analysis of big data sets (such as electronic patient records and surveillance systems) is very complex. Google Trends is an alternative approach that has been used in the past to analyze health behaviors; however, most existing studies on COVID-19 using these data examine a single issue or a limited geographic area. This paper explores Google Trends as a proxy for what people are thinking, needing, and planning in real time across the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use Google Trends to provide both insights into and potential indicators of important changes in information-seeking patterns during pandemics such as COVID-19. We asked four questions: (1) How has information seeking changed over time? (2) How does information seeking vary between regions and states? (3) Do states have particular and distinct patterns in information seeking? (4) Do search data correlate with—or precede—real-life events? METHODS: We analyzed searches on 38 terms related to COVID-19, falling into six themes: social and travel; care seeking; government programs; health programs; news and influence; and outlook and concerns. We generated data sets at the national level (covering January 1, 2016, to April 15, 2020) and state level (covering January 1 to April 15, 2020). Methods used include trend analysis of US search data; geographic analyses of the differences in search popularity across US states from March 1 to April 15, 2020; and principal component analysis to extract search patterns across states. RESULTS: The data showed high demand for information, corresponding with increasing searches for coronavirus linked to news sources regardless of the ideological leaning of the news source. Changes in information seeking often occurred well in advance of action by the federal government. The popularity of searches for unemployment claims predicted the actual spike in weekly claims. The increase in searches for information on COVID-19 care was paralleled by a decrease in searches related to other health behaviors, such as urgent care, doctor’s appointments, health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Finally, concerns varied across the country; some search terms were more popular in some regions than in others. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic faced by the United States. Our research holds important lessons for both state and federal governments in a fast-evolving situation that requires a finger on the pulse of public sentiment. We suggest strategic shifts for policy makers to improve the precision and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and recommend the development of a real-time dashboard as a decision-making tool.","Mangono, Tichakunda; Smittenaar, Peter; Caplan, Yael; Huang, Vincent S; Sutermaster, Staci; Kemp, Hannah; Sgaier, Sema K",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/22933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878015/,179

METHODS: There were 308 hospital-acquired AKI and 721 non-AKI (NAKI) COVID-19 patients from Stony Brook Hospital (New York, USA) data, and 72 hospital-acquired AKI and 303 NAKI COVID-19 patients from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Demographic, comorbidities, and longitudinal (3 days before and 3 days after AKI onset) clinical variables were used to compute odds ratios for and longitudinally predict hospital-acquired AKI onset. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with AKI were more likely to die than NAKI patients (31.5% vs 6.9%, adjusted p < 0.001, OR = 4.67 [95% CI 3.1, 7.0], Stony Brook data). AKI developed on average 3.3 days after hospitalization. Procalcitonin was elevated prior to AKI onset (p < 0.05), peaked, and remained elevated (p < 0.05). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase peaked the same time as creatinine, whereas d-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide peaked a day later. C-reactive protein, white blood cell and lymphocyte showed group differences − 2 days prior (p < 0.05). Top predictors were creatinine, procalcitonin, white blood cells, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. They predicted AKI onset with areas under curves (AUCs) of 0.78, 0.66, and 0.56 at 0, − 1, and − 2 days prior, respectively. When tested on the Tongji Hospital data, the AUCs were 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Time-locked longitudinal data provide insight into AKI progression. Commonly clinical variables reasonably predict AKI onset a few days prior.

Other possible IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib and Baricinitib are then analyzed, underlying how they lack the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway.","Magro, Giuseppe",Cytokine X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421092/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590153220300094; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590153220300094?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytox.2020.100029,179
662097,Awareness and Impact of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions during COVID-19 Pandemic in Renal Transplant Recipients.,2020-07-21,"(1) Background: All deaths that occurred in a hospital of Southern Italy (“San Giuseppe Moscati” Hospital of Avellino) with medium jurisdiction (up to 425,000 citizens approximately) in the period from 9 March to 4 May 2020 were analyzed. The primary endpoint of the study was to analyze the causes of death in the period study. Secondary endpoints included: (1) the assessment of overall mortality in the emergency period compared with the same period of the past years (2018–2019) in the jurisdiction area; (2) the assessment of the amounts of deaths with positive and negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs; (3) the frequency of clinical and radiological features consistent with Covid-19 infection in negative RT-PCR cases. (2) Methods: Patients’ information and laboratory data were collected through the computerized medical record system (My Hospital, Italy) used for the clinical management of all referring patients. Epidemiological, clinical, and radiological data were reviewed along with the results of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. (3) Results: From 9 March to 4 May 2020, 140 deaths (87 males, 53 females) from all causes occurred in total at “San Giuseppe Moscati” Hospital, of which 32 deaths were Covid-19 related. (4) Conclusions: The excess of mortality could be higher than the one reported in the official epidemiological surveys. False negative cases can have a distorting effect on the assessment of the real mortality rate and the excess mortality. Furthermore, many who died from Covid-19 were likely never tested or they had false negative RT-PCR results. Other victims probably died from causes indirectly related to Covid-19.","Mascolo, Pasquale; Feola, Alessandro; Sementa, Carmen; Leone, Sebastiano; Zangani, Pierluca; Della Pietra, Bruno; Campobasso, Carlo Pietro",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503857/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020119,179

663431,COVID-19 Induced Acute Pancreatitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND: : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has extensively and rapidly spread in the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. However, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines can be used. Phillyrin (KD-1), a representative ingredient of Forsythia suspensa, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and antiviral activities. However, little is known about the antiviral abilities and mechanism of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). PURPOSE: : The study was designed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of KD-1 against the novel SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E and its potential effect in regulating host immune response in vitro. METHODS: : The antiviral activities of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E were assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect and plaque-reduction assay. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. Western blot assay was used to determine the protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, p-NF-κB p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα in Huh-7 cells, which are the key targets of the NF-κB pathway. RESULTS: : KD-1 could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E replication in vitro. KD-1 could also markedly reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1, and IP-10) at the mRNA levels. Moreover, KD-1 could significantly reduce the protein expression of p-NF-κB p65, NF-κB p65, and p-IκBα, while increasing the expression of IκBα in Huh-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: : KD-1 could significantly inhibit virus proliferation in vitro, the up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E by regulating the activity of the NF-кB signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that KD-1 protected against virus attack and can thus be used as a novel strategy for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019.","Ma, Qinhai; Li, Runfeng; Pan, Weiqi; Huang, Wenbo; Liu, Bin; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Li, Chufang; Jiang, Haiming; Huang, Jicheng; Shi, Yongxia; Dai, Jun; Zheng, Kui; Li, Xiaobo; Hui, Min; Fu, Li; Yang, Zifeng",Phytomedicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711320301288?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711320301288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890913/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153296,179

Virus infection requires the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Although studies have demonstrated anti-spike and - RBD antibodies to be protective in animal models and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes capable of blocking infection. Here, we studied spike- and RBD-specific Ig isotypes in convalescent and acute plasma/sera. We also determined virus neutralization activities in plasma/sera, and purified Ig fractions. Spike- and RBD-specific IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 were produced by all or nearly all subjects at variable levels and detected early after infection. All samples also displayed neutralizing activity. Regression analyses revealed that IgM and IgG1 contributed most to neutralization, consistent with IgM and IgG fractions’ neutralization potency. However, IgA also exhibited neutralizing activity at a lower potency. Together, IgG, IgM and IgA are critical components of convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment.","Klingler, Jéromine; Weiss, Svenja; Itri, Vincenza; Liu, Xiaomei; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y.; Stevens, Christian; Ikegame, Satoshi; Hung, Chuan-Tien; Enyindah-Asonye, Gospel; Amanat, Fatima; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Bandres, Juan C.; Kojic, Erna Milunka; Stoever, Jonathan; Jurczyszak, Denise; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Simon, Viviana; Nádas, Arthur; Liu, Sean; Lee, Benhur; Krammer, Florian; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Hioe, Catarina E.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.18.20177303v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173891/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177303,179
664033,Balancing risks and benefits in inflammatory bowel disease patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND: The longitudinal antigen-specific immunity in COVID-19 convalescents is crucial for long-term protection upon individual re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and even more pivotal for ultimately achieving population-level immunity. To better understand the features of immune memory in individuals with different disease severities at one year post-disease onset we conducted this cohort study. METHODS: We conducted a systematic antigen-specific immune evaluation in 101 COVID-19 convalescents, who had asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe disease, through two visits at months 6 and 12 post-disease onset. The SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, comprising NAb, IgG, and IgM, were assessed by mutually corroborated assays, i.e. neutralization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and microparticle chemiluminescence immunoassay (MCLIA). Meanwhile, the T-cell memory against SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins was tested through enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot), intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and tetramer staining-based flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, and also NAb can persist among over 95% COVID-19 convalescents from 6 months to 12 months after disease onset. At least 19/71 (26%) of COVID-19 convalescents (double positive in ELISA and MCLIA) had detectable circulating IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 at 12m post-disease onset. Notably, the percentages of convalescents with positive SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses (at least one of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen S1, S2, M and N protein) were 71/76 (93%) and 67/73 (92%) at 6m and 12m, respectively. Furthermore, both antibody and T-cell memory levels of the convalescents were positively associated with their disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunities are durable at least until one year after disease onset.","Zhang, Jie; Lin, Hao; Ye, Beiwei; Zhao, Min; Zhan, Jianbo; Dong, Shaobo; Guo, Yaxin; Zhao, Yingze; Li, Min; Liu, Sai; Zhang, Hangjie; Xiao, Wenling; Guo, Yuanyuan; Yue, Can; Zhang, Danni; Yang, Mengjie; Zhang, Jing; Quan, Chuansong; Shi, Weifeng; Liu, Xinxue; Liu, Peipei; Jiang, Yongzhong; Wu, Guizhen; Gao, George F; Liu, William J",Clin. infect. dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609506/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab884,179

Another calicivirus, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus, attaches to H type 2 histo-blood group oligosaccharide present on rabbit epithelial cells. Our aim was to test if, by analogy, recombinant NV-like particles (rNV VLPs) use carbohydrates present on human gastroduodenal epithelial cells as ligands. Methods: Attachment of rNV VLPs was tested on tissue sections of the gastroduodenal junction and on saliva from individuals of known ABO, Lewis, and secretor phenotypes. It was also tested on human Caco-2 cells and on animal cell lines transfected with glycosyltransferases complementary DNA (cDNA). Competition experiments were performed with synthetic oligosaccharides and anticarbohydrate antibodies. Internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy. Results: Attachment of rNV VLPs to surface epithelial cells of the gastroduodenal junction as well as to saliva was detected, yet only from secretor donors. It was abolished by α1,2fucosidase treatment, and by competition with the H types 1 and 3 trisaccharides or with anti-H type 1 and anti-H types¾ antibodies. Transfection of CHO and TS/A cells with an α1,2fucosyltransferase cDNA allowed attachment of VLPs. These transfectants as well as differentiated Caco-2 cells expressing H type 1 structures internalized the bound particles. Conclusions: rNV VLPs use H type 1 and/or H types¾ as ligands on gastroduodenal epithelial cells of secretor individuals.

As this pandemic advances and new potential pandemics are on the horizon, a precise analysis of recent fluctuations of trade becomes necessary for international decisions and controlling the world in a similar crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic made a new pattern of trade in the world and affected how businesses work and trade with each other. It means that every potential pandemic or any unprecedented event in the world can change the market rules. This research develops a novel model to have a proper estimation of the stock market values with respect to the COVID-19 dataset using long short-term memory networks (LSTM). The goal of this study is to establish a model that can predict near future regarding the variable set of features. The nature of the features in each pandemic is completely different; therefore, prediction results for a pandemic by a specific model cannot be applied to other pandemics. Hence, recognizing and extracting the features which affect the pandemic is pivotal. In this study, we develop a framework that provides a better understanding of the features and feature selection process. Although the global impacts of COVID-19 are complicated, we are trying to show how additional features like COVID-19 cases can help to forecast in a real-world scenario, rather than relying solely on the history of tickers, which is used conventionally for prediction. This study is based on a preliminary analysis of features such as COVID-19 cases and other market tickers for enhancing forecasting models’ performance against fluctuations in the market. Our predictors are based on the market value data and COVID-19 pandemic daily time-series data (i.e. the number of new cases). In this study, we selected Gold price as a base for our forecasting task which can be replaced by any other markets. We have applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) LSTM, vector sequence output LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and encoder–decoder LSTM on the dataset. The results of the vector sequence output LSTM achieved an MSE of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] on the validation set respectfully for 1 day, 2 days, and 30 days predictions in advance which are outperforming other proposed method in the literature.","Mohtasham Khani, Mahtab; Vahidnia, Sahand; Abbasi, Alireza",SN Comput Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00724-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151290/,179
665020,COVID‐19 Susceptibility in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2020-08-11,"PURPOSE: Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference. Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. RESULTS: We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46–0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.","Wolff, Greg G.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607599/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19313647; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19313647,179

Recently, a new variant of this virus called SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (or B.1.1.7 lineage), described in the United Kingdom (UK), has become highly prevalent in several countries. Its rate of transmission has been estimated to be greatly higher. B.1.1.7 lineage harbors 23 mutations co-existed for the first time in the same variant. Herein, we are interested only by the deletion mutation {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the spike protein. In the UK they were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the increase in the false negative result for the spike target of a three-target RT-PCR assay from Thermo Fisher Scientific (TaqPath kit). Later, the manufacturer announced that this false negative result is because of the deletion {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the area targeted by the TaqPath Kit. Furthermore, The European CDC recommended that the use of this kit help to track the new variant. Genome sequencing is the gold method to confirm the new variant, but observational studies provide also stronger evidence if similar models are observed in multiple countries, especially when randomized studies are not possible. In Lebanon, the highest number of confirmed cases were reported in first week of 2021.

Acute viral pharyngitis may be easily misdiagnosed as acute bacterial pharyngitis. Laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of respiratory viruses is recommended. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivities among oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and nasal wash (NW) in adults with acute pharyngitis. METHODS: OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained from each participant with acute pharyngitis. The specimens were tested for 15 respiratory viruses by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. A sample was considered to be a true positive if any of the specimens was positive. The sensitivities among samples were compared by chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred three triple samples collected consecutively by OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained. In 73 patients, one or more viruses were detected by any of the three methods. Among all viruses, the sensitivity of NPS was significantly higher than that of NW (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p < 0.01) and OPS (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p < 0.01).

Using clinical information and CT imaging features, a 10-point ordinal risk score was developed and its diagnostic potential to differentiate a severe (IV-group) from a more moderate course (non-IV-group) of the disease was tested. (3) Results: Frequent imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in both groups were ground glass opacities (91.3%), consolidations (53.6%) and crazy paving patterns (31.9%). Characteristics of later stages such as subpleural bands were observed significantly more often in the IV-group (52.2% versus 26.1%, p = 0.032). Using information directly accessible during a radiologist’s reporting, a simple risk score proved to reliably differentiate between IV- and non-IV-groups (AUC: 0.89 (95% CI 0.81–0.96), p < 0.001).

We sought to review the evidence for these manifestations. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we compiled studies published until March 31, 2021 that examined non-respiratory HEENT, central, and peripheral nervous system presentations in COVID-19 patients. We included 477 studies for qualitative synthesis and 59 studies for meta-analyses. RESULTS: Anosmia, ageusia, and conjunctivitis may precede typical upper/lower respiratory symptoms. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations include stroke and encephalopathy, potentially with brainstem or cranial nerve involvement. MRI studies support CNS para-/postinfectious etiologies, but direct neuroinvasion seems very rare, with few cases detecting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the CNS. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations include muscle damage, Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS), and its variants. There was moderate-to-high study heterogeneity and risk of bias. In random-effects meta-analyses, anosmia/ageusia was estimated to occur in 56% of COVID-19 patients (95% CI: 0.41–0.71, I2:99.9%), more commonly than in patients without COVID-19 (OR: 14.28, 95% CI: 8.39–24.29, I2: 49.0%). Neurological symptoms were estimated to occur in 36% of hospitalized patients (95% CI: 0.31–0.42, I2: 99.8%); ischemic stroke in 3% (95% CI: 0.03–0.04, I2: 99.2%), and GBS in 0.04% (0.033%–0.047%), more commonly than in patients without COVID-19 (OR[stroke]: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.16–5.50, I2: 76.4%; OR[GBS]: 3.43,1.15–10.25, I2: 89.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is mostly from retrospective cohorts or series, largely in hospitalized or critically ill patients, not representative of typical community-dwelling patients.

667697,"COVID-19 in Kidney Transplantation: Epidemiology, Management Considerations, and the Impact on Kidney Transplant Practice",2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Since the outset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, published tracheostomy guidelines have generally recommended deferral of the procedure beyond the initial weeks of intubation given high mortality as well as concerns about transmission of the infection to providers. It is unclear whether tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 infection facilitates ventilator weaning, and long-term outcomes are not yet reported in the literature. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of tracheostomy outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection at a single-center academic tertiary referral intensive care unit. Patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy at the bedside; the procedure was performed with limited staffing to reduce risk of disease transmission. RESULTS: Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, a total of 206 patients with COVID-19 infection required mechanical ventilation and 26 underwent tracheostomy at a mean of 25±5 days after initial intubation. Overall, 81% of tracheostomy patients were liberated from the ventilator at a mean of 9±6 days postprocedure, and 54% were decannulated prior to hospital discharge at a mean of 21±10 days postprocedure. Sedation and pain medication requirements decreased significantly in the week after the procedure. In-hospital mortality was 15%. Among tracheostomy survivors, 68% were discharged to a facility. DISCUSSION: The management of patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure can be challenging due to prolonged ventilator dependency. In our initial experience, outcomes post-tracheostomy in this population are encouraging, with short time to liberation from the ventilator, a high rate of decannulation prior to hospital discharge, and similar mortality to tracheostomy performed for other indications. Barriers to weaning ventilation in this cohort may be high sedation needs and ventilator dyssynchrony. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V—Therapeutic/care management.","Carmichael, Heather; Wright, Franklin L; McIntyre, Robert C; Vogler, Thomas; Urban, Shane; Jolley, Sarah E; Burnham, Ellen L; Firth, Whitney; Velopulos, Catherine G; Idrovo, Juan Pablo",Trauma Surg Acute Care Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192162/; https://doi.org/10.1136/tsaco-2020-000591,179
667996,Destructive pulmonary fibrosis after severe COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-09-16,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus is consistently evolving with mutations within the receptor binding domain (RBD) being of particular concern. To date, there is little research into protection offered following vaccination or infection against RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern (UK, South African, Mink and Southern California). To investigate this, serum and saliva samples were obtained from groups of vaccinated (Pfizer BNT-162b2), infected and uninfected individuals. Antibody responses among groups, including salivary antibody response and antibody binding to RBD mutant strains were examined. The neutralization capacity of the antibody response against a patient-isolated South African variant was tested by viral neutralization tests and further verified by an ACE2 competition assay. We found that humoral responses in vaccinated individuals showed a robust response after the second dose. Interestingly, IgG antibodies were detected in large titers in the saliva of vaccinated subjects. Antibody responses showed considerable differences in binding to RBD mutants in emerging variants of concern. A substantial reduction in RBD binding and neutralization was detected for the South African variant. Taken together our data reinforces the importance of administering the second dose of Pfizer BNT-162b2 to acquire high levels of neutralizing antibodies. High antibody titers in saliva suggest that vaccinated individuals may have reduced transmission potential. Substantially reduced neutralization for the South African variant highlights importance of surveillance strategies to detect new variants and targeting these in future vaccines.","Becker, M.; Dulovic, A.; Junker, D.; Ruetalo, N.; Kaiser, P.; Pinilla, Y.; Heinzel, C.; Haering, J.; Traenkle, B.; Wagner, T.; Layer, M.; Mehrlaender, M.; Mirakaj, V.; Held, J.; Planatscher, H.; Schenke-Layland, K.; Krause, G.; Strengert, M.; Bakchoul, T.; Althaus, K.; Fendel, R.; Kreidenweiss, A.; Koeppen, M.; Rothbauer, U.; Schindler, M.; Schneiderhan-Marra, N.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.21252958; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21252958v1?rss=1,179

669135,Commenting on the Letter (Completing the Picture in Egypt: Response to “Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in Egypt During the COVID-19 Pandemic”),2021-01-29,"By the first week of April 2020, more than 1,500,000 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 50,000 deaths had been officially reported worldwide. While developed countries such as the USA, Italy, England, France, Spain, and Germany struggle to mitigate the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Latin America, India, and Africa--territories in which the mounted infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly underdeveloped. An actual epidemic emergency does not provide the required timeframe for testing new diagnostic strategies; therefore, the first line of response must be based on commercially and readily available resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using a set of in-house designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of [~]625 to 2 x 105 DNA copies by this straightforward method. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for use during the COVID-19 pandemics, particularly in underdeveloped regions were the availability of RT-qPCR instruments may be limited. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of this strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during the pandemics.","Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Everardo; Lara-Mayorga, Itzel Montserrat; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Iram Pablo; Leon, Felipe Yee-de; Garcia-Rubio, Andres; Garciamendez-Mijares, Carlos Ezio; Guerra-Alvarez, Gilberto Emilio; Garcia-Martinez, German; Aguayo-Hernandez, Juan Andres; Marquez-Garcia, Eduardo; Zhang, Yu-Shrike; Martinez-Chapa, Sergio Omar; ZuÃ±iga, Joaquin; Santiago, Grissel Trujillo-de; Alvarez, Mario Moises",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058651,179
669317,Pleural effusion as a rare sign of anaplastic large‐cell lymphoma in a COVID‐19 patient: A case report and literature review,2021-03-24,"RNA viruses cause most of the dangerous communicable diseases. Due to their high mutation rates, RNA viruses quickly evade selective pressures and can adapt to a new host. Therefore, new antiviral approaches are urgently needed, which target more than one specific virus variant and which would optimally prevent development of viral resistance. Among the family of coronaviruses (CoV), several human pathogenic strains (HCoV) are known to cause respiratory diseases and are implied in enteric diseases. While most strains contribute to common cold-like illnesses, others lead to severe infections. One of these viruses is the newly emerged (2012), highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of zoonotic origin. MERS-CoV causes a severe respiratory infection with a high mortality rate of 35 %. There is no specific treatment or infection prevention available. Here, we show that the bacterial ribonuclease Binase is able to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV and of the low-pathogenic human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in cell culture. We demonstrate that at non-toxic concentrations, Binase decreased the titers of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E. On a molecular level, Binase treatment reduced (i) the viral subgenomic RNAs and (ii) the viral nucleocapsidprotein (N) and non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) accumulation. Furthermore, we show that the quantity of the replication/transcription complexes within the infected cells is diminished. Thus, the data obtained might allow further development of new anti-coronaviral approaches affecting viral replication, independent of the specific virus strain.","Müller, Christin; Ulyanova, Vera; Ilinskaya, Olga; Pleschka, Stephan; Shah Mahmud, Raihan",Bionanoscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219056/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12668-016-0341-7,179

Results: Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40 % (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols. Conclusion: Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population.

670050,Stigma at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-08-07,"Abstract There is uncertainty if current models for the Covid-19 pandemic should already take into account seasonality. That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.","Hoogeveen, Martijn J.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498207/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138543; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720320568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720320568?v=s5,179
670052,Infants with Atypical Presentations of Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of the Pulmonary Veins Who Underwent Bilateral Lung Transplantation,2018-03-31,"Recently, two mRNA vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become available, but there is also an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility and virulence(1–6). A major concern is whether the available vaccines will be equally effective against these variants. The vaccines are designed to induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein(7,8), which is required for viral entry to host cells(9). Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is often evaluated by antibody production, while less is known about the T-cell response. Here we developed, characterized, and implemented two standardized, functional assays to measure T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected, convalescent, and vaccinated individuals. We found that vaccinated individuals had robust T-cell responses to the wild type spike and nucleocapsid proteins, even more so than convalescent patients. We also found detectable but diminished T-cell responses to spike variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248) among vaccinated but otherwise healthy donors. Since decreases in antibody neutralization have also been observed with some variants(10–12), investigation into the T-cell response to these variants as an alternative means of viral control is imperative. Standardized measurements of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are feasible and can be easily adjusted to determine changes in response to variants.","Gallagher, Kathleen M.E.; Leick, Mark B.; Larson, Rebecca C.; Berger, Trisha R.; Katsis, Katelin; Yam, Jennifer Y.; Brini, Gabrielle; Grauwet, Korneel; Maus, Marcela V.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972942/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.442455,179

However, identifying community apprehensions towards vaccination needs to be understood in detail. This study aims to determine the factors that can predict the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was considered by systematic random sampling of 425 adults with chronic illnesses in Ho Chi Minh City. Data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021 via a self-administered, structured questionnaire. The main outcome was the acceptance of future COVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: A total of 425 eligible adults responded to the survey, whose mean age was 52.9±15.6 years; 67.8% of them were women, more than a half of them had high school education level or higher (57.4%) and received COVID-19 information mainly via television and social media accounted for 82.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Overall, knowledge of COVID-19 was reported as relatively good, with a mean score of 7.11 ± 1.77 (0–9). Determinants of vaccination acceptance were knowledge and cues to action. Accordingly, there was a 1.2-fold increase in the odds of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination for a 1-unit increase in “the total knowledge score” (AOR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.3, p<0.05), and there was a 3.2-fold increase in the odds of vaccination acceptance for a 1-unit increase in “cues to action” (AOR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7–5.8, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Determinants that influence the intention to have the COVID-19 vaccination are identified, which can be applied to future health education interventions that should focus on enhanced knowledge towards COVID-19 via mass media messages and cues to action from healthcare workers’ recommendations to promote vaccine acceptance.","Huynh, Giao; Nguyen, Tap Van; Nguyen, Dung Dang; Lam, Quang Minh; Pham, Tuan Nhat; Nguyen, Han Thi Ngoc",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012276/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s308446,179

RECENT FINDINGS: In detail, the psycho-diagnostic areas of prevention, treatment, and aftercare in the realm of IUDs are focused upon in this work. Before each of these areas is presented in more specificity, the terms digital phenotyping and mobile sensing are introduced against the background of an interdisciplinary research endeavor called Psychoinformatics. Obstacles to overcome problems in this emerging research endeavor—sensing psychological traits/states from digital footprints—are discussed together with risks and chances, which arise from the administration of online-tracking technologies in the field of IUDs. SUMMARY: Given the limited validity and reliability of traditional assessment via questionnaires or diagnostic interviews with respect to recall bias and tendencies to answer towards social desirability, digital phenotyping and mobile sensing offer a novel approach overcoming recall bias and other limitations of usual assessment approaches. This will not only set new standards in precisely mapping behavior, but it will also offer scientists and practitioners opportunities to detect risky Internet use patterns in a timely manner and to establish tailored feedback as a means of intervention.","Montag, Christian; Rumpf, Hans-Jürgen",Curr Addict Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258147/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-021-00376-6,179

However, evidence regarding risk of asymptomatic prevalence of ON among different diseases and the impact of variable steroid regimens are conflicting. We aimed to determine the prevalence of ON of femoral head in asymptomatic patients with systemic rheumatic diseases who received high-dose CS and also clarify its relationship with different dosages and regimens. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 50 consecutive patients receiving high-dose CS for rheumatic diseases who have no pelvic pain were recruited. MRI of both hips was performed on all patients using a 1.5 Tesla to diagnose ON. Results: Of 50 subjects, 18 (36%) developed ON of the femoral head. Groups with and without ON were comparable in terms of sex, age and mean starting CS dose. There was no statistical difference in the type of CS regimen including daily dose, peak dose and cumulative dose between the two groups. However, silent ON was associated with both the cumulative CS dose and the duration of CS therapy. Conclusion: According to high prevalence of ON in our selected patients with no other identifiable risk factor for ON, monitoring of high risk patients with periodic hip MRI would help diagnose necrosis in early stage.","Kianmehr, Nahid; Bidari, Ali; Mofidi, Mani; Bahar, Nasim",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26793650/,179

Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer leads to mucositis in almost all patients and severe radiation-mucositis affects their quality of life (QOL). However, little is known about the NLR for severe mucositis. Therefore, this study aimed to show the association between the NLR and severe radiation-induced mucositis in hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we determined the incidence of grade 3 mucositis in 99 patients who were receiving definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to investigate the characteristics of grade 3 mucositis. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to evaluate the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis between two groups with high (NLR > 5) or low (NLR < 5) systemic inflammation. RESULTS: The incidence of grade 3 mucositis was 39%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR (Odd ratio [OR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.16; p = 0.016) and smoking (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.03; p = 0.048) were significantly associated with grade 3 mucositis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR was independently associated with grade 3 mucositis (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.17; p = 0.021). Kaplan-Meier curves also showed that patients with higher NLR (NLR > 5) prior to radiotherapy developed grade 3 mucositis more frequently than those with lower NLR during radiotherapy (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a higher NLR is a risk factor and predictor of severe radiation-induced mucositis in hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer patients.","Kawashita, Yumiko; Kitamura, Masayasu; Soutome, Sakiko; Ukai, Takashi; Umeda, Masahiro; Saito, Thoshiyuki",BMC Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583669/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-021-08793-6,179
672626,Nonhepatic Alagille Syndrome Associated With Predominant Cardioskeletal Anomalies: A Rare Case,2021-08-25,"INTRODUCTION: The epidemiology of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) is constantly changing. We aimed to describe it using the BioFire(®) FilmArray(®) Pneumonia plus (PNplus) Panel. METHODS: In a sub-study of the PROGRESS trial, sputum samples of 90 patients with sepsis and LRTI were retrospectively studied. The primary endpoint was the comparative detection rate of pathogens between conventional microbiology and PNplus Panel; secondary endpoints were microbiology and the association with the inflammatory host response. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and another 34 patients with risk factors for MDR were studied; median pneumonia severity index (PSI) was 113 (88–135). PNplus detection rate was 72.2% compared to 10% by conventional microbiology (p < 0.001); Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen. PSI and procalcitonin were greater among patients with bacterial pathogens than viral pathogens. Median procalcitonin was 0.49 ng/ml and 0.18 ng/ml among patients with ≥ 10(5) and < 10(5) copies/ml of detected bacteria, respectively (p = 0.004). Resistance reached 14.4%. CONCLUSION: PNplus detects severe pneumonia pathogens at a greater rate than conventional microbiology. High levels of inflammation accompany bacterial detection.

This study examined the primary issues, including an absence of hospital emergency system, inadequate management and control of nosocomial infection, limited hospital laboratory capacity, and poor hospital admission capacity. Accordingly, the study put forward the following countermeasures and suggestions for hospitals to deal with future biosecurity events, such as a major epidemic: first, there is a need to build biosecurity management systems and emergency response mechanisms in hospitals; second, the investment and guarantee mechanisms for hospital biosecurity construction should be improved; third, the capacity building of biosecurity incident treatment needs attention in general hospitals; and fourth, comprehensive plans need to be developed for the integrated construction of medical treatment and prevention facilities through disease-control systems.","Ma, Hui; Zhu, Jiangong; Liu, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Liu, Yunxi; Song, Hongbin",J Biosaf Biosecur,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588933820300078?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588933820300078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835179/,179
672949,Giant Cavernous Hemangioma of the Liver in a Patient with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease,2020-11-18,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 before and shortly after the onset of symptoms suggests that only diagnosing and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to interrupt the spread of infection; therefore, public health measures such as personal distancing are also necessary. Additionally, it will be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the very “point-of-care”. Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response time, such as in case of molecular tests. The main health institutions such as the WHO, the CDC and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain propose the use of antigenic tests in a wide variety of strategies to respond to the pandemic. This document aims to support physicians involved in the care of patients with suspected SC2 infection, in the context of a growing incidence in Spain since September 2020, which already represents the second pandemic wave of COVID-19.","Candel, Francisco Javier; Barreiro, Pablo; Román, Jesús San; Abanades, Juan Carlos; Barba, Raquel; Barberán, José; Bibiano, Carlos; Canora, Jesús; Cantón, Rafael; Calvo, Cristina; Carretero, Mar; Cava, Fernando; Delgado, Rafael; García-Rodríguez, Julio; del Castillo, Juan González; de Villaumbrosia, Cristina González; Hernández, Montserrat; Losa, Juan Emilio; MartínezPeromingo, Francisco Javier; Molero, José María; Muñoz, Patricia; Onecha, Elena; Onoda, Mamiko; Rodríguez, Juan; Sánchez-Celaya, Marta; Serra, José Antonio; Zapatero, Antonio",Rev Esp Quimioter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070578/; https://doi.org/10.37201/req/120.2020,179

The degree of STS, perceived stress and burnout was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS; (3) Results: 184 HCWs (M = 90; Age mean: 46.45; SD: 11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of STS (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of STS was 47.5% in frontline HCWs while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p < 0.023); 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients’ death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p < 0.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion, and exposure to patients’ death remained as significant predictors in the final model for STS (adjusted R2 = 0.537, p < 0.001); (4) Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs facing patients’ physical pain, psychological suffering, and death are more likely to develop STS.","Orrù, Graziella; Marzetti, Francesca; Conversano, Ciro; Vagheggini, Guido; Miccoli, Mario; Ciacchini, Rebecca; Panait, Eugenia; Gemignani, Angelo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466346/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010337,179

Here, we develop a modular method for high-yield extraction of viral single-stranded nucleic acids by using “capture” ssDNA sequences attached to carbon nanotubes. Target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be captured by ssDNA-nanotube constructs via hybridization and separated from the liquid phase in a single-tube system with minimal chemical reagents, for downstream quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection. This nanotube-based extraction method enables 100% extraction yield of target SARS-CoV-2 RNA from phosphate-buffered saline in comparison to ∼20% extraction yield when using a commercial silica-column kit. Notably, carbon nanotubes enable extraction of nucleic acids directly from 50% human saliva with a similar efficiency as achieved with commercial DNA/RNA extraction kits, thereby bypassing the need for further biofluid purification and avoiding the use of commercial extraction kits. Carbon nanotube-based extraction of viral nucleic acids facilitates high-yield and high-sensitivity identification of viral nucleic acids such as the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome with a reduced reliance on reagents affected by supply chain obstacles.","Jeong, Sanghwa; González-Grandío, Eduardo; Navarro, Nicole; Pinals, Rebecca L.; Ledesma, Francis; Yang, Darwin; Landry, Markita P.",ACS Nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c02494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105936/,179

METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of UK palliative care services response to COVID-19. Quantitative data were summarised descriptively and χ2 tests used to explore relationships between categorical variables. Free text comments were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: 277 UK services responded. 168 included hospice teams (76% of all UK hospice teams). Services supporting those from ethnic minority groups were more likely to include hospital (p<0.001) and less likely to include hospice (p<0.001) or home care teams (p=0.008). 34% (93/277) of services had cared for patients with COVID-19 or families from ethnic minority groups. 66% (61/93) of these services stated no difference in how they supported or reached these groups during the pandemic.Three themes demonstrated impact of policy introduced during the pandemic, including: disproportionate adverse impact of restricted visiting, compounded communication challenges and unmet religious and faith needs. One theme demonstrated mistrust of services by ethnic minority groups, and the final theme demonstrated a focus on equal and individualised care. CONCLUSIONS: Policies introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic may have adversely impacted those from ethnic minority groups making these at-risk populations even more vulnerable. The palliative care response may have been equal but inequitable. During the para-COVID-19 period, systemic steps, including equality impact assessments, are urgently needed.","Bajwah, Sabrina; Koffman, Jonathan; Hussain, Jamilla; Bradshaw, Andy; Hocaoglu, Mevhibe B; Fraser, Lorna K; Oluyase, Adejoke; Allwin, Caitlin; Dunleavy, Lesley; Preston, Nancy; Cripps, Rachel; Maddocks, Matthew; Sleeman, Katherine E; Higginson, Irene J; Walshe, Catherine; Murtagh, Fliss E M",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511409/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-003083,179

676075,A planetary health perspective for kidney disease,2020-07-21,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called 'quasispecies'. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (~26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.","Viehweger, Adrian; Krautwurst, Sebastian; Lamkiewicz, Kevin; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Ziebuhr, John; Hölzer, Martin; Marz, Manja",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/483693,179

This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","Wieland, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.05.20146837v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146837,179

This study aims to investigate the major stressors and coping strategies reported by nurses working directly with potentially infectious patients in Alabama, United States, during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted with nursing staff working in hospital settings in the state. The questionnaire was completed by 109 nurses working in hospitals that treated COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Around 71% of the nursing staff were concerned about receiving more COVID-19 patients and exhibited heightened workload-related stress resulting from taking care of infected patients. The study found that most nurses (82%) are stressed about getting their friends and family infected. Overall, younger, less experienced nurses reported more stress levels compared to older, senior-level nurses. Findings suggest that many nurses fail to perceive protective measures as an effective coping strategy, with only 75% reporting problem-solving strategies such as hand washing and wearing a face mask, and only 60% avoiding public transportation and crowded spaces. Findings also suggest a lack of organizational support including psychiatric assistance, with no nurses reportedly seeking psychological therapy. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the stress level of the nursing staff in Alabama. The study finds that the cases in the state of AL are still increasing dramatically, which can overwhelme the healthcare system and escalate nurse stress levels.","Ali, Haneen; Cole, Astin; Ahmed, Abdulaziz; Hamasha, Sa’d; Panos, Gabriella",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408479/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s285933,179

678720,COVID-19 pandemic – A focused review for clinicians,2020-04-25,"During the course of an epidemic, one of the most challenging tasks for authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible. Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test—referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test)—is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay [Formula: see text] and risk [Formula: see text] , where [Formula: see text] is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary restrictive measures. To quantify risk, in this paper we adopt as its proxy the average occurrence rate of false alarms, in that a false alarm risks unnecessary social and economic disruption. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with the delay, [Formula: see text] , where [Formula: see text] depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to 3 weeks, much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident. Strictly from the quickest-detection perspective adopted in this paper, it turns out that countermeasures against the second epidemic wave have not always been taken in a timely manner. The developed tool can be used to support decisions at different geographic scales (regions, cities, local areas, etc.), levels of risk, instantiations of controlled/critical regime, and is general enough to be applied to different pandemic time-series.

His Graves' disease (GD) remained undiagnosed for nearly 8 months because apart from weight loss, he has not had any other symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. The presentation of thyroid storm was atypical (apathetic thyroid storm) with features of depression and extreme lethargy without any fever, anxiety, agitation, or seizure. There were no identifiable triggers for the thyroid storm. Apart from mechanical ventilation and continuous veno-venous renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit, he received propylthiouracil (PTU), esmolol, and corticosteroids, which were later switched to carbimazole and propranolol with steroids being tapered down. He was diagnosed with thyrotoxic myopathy which, like GD, remained undiagnosed for long (fatigability). A high index of suspicion and a multidisciplinary care are essential for good outcome in these patients.","Ali, Abuobeida; Mostafa, Wail; Fernandez, Cornelius; Ahmad, Habib; Htwe, Nyi",Case Rep Endocrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029436/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8896777,179
679386,Evaluating the Long-Term Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,2021-03-10,"India is one of the severely affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic at present. Within the stochastic framework of the SEQIR model, we studied publicly available data of the Covid-19 patients in India and analysed possible impacts of quarantine and social distancing as controlling strategies for the pandemic. Our stochastic simulation results clearly show that proper quarantine and social distancing should be maintained right from the start of the pandemic and continued until its end for effective control. This calls for a more disciplined social lifestyle in the future. However, only social distancing and quarantine of the exposed population are found not sufficient enough to end the pandemic in India. Therefore, implementation of other stringent policies like complete lockdown as well as increased testing of susceptible populations is necessary. The demographic stochasticity, which is quite visible in the system dynamics, has a critical role in regulating and controlling the pandemic.","Chanu, Athokpam Langlen; Singh, R. K.

679581,Significant impact of COVID-19 on HIV care in hospitals affecting the first pillar of the HIV care continuum,2021-05-16,"BACKGROUND: The objectives were to perform an analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) findings in severely ill patients with novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and to compare the accuracy with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax. METHODS: Sixty-two intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 were evaluated during their hospital stay. LUS was performed with convex and linear transducers using a designated ultrasonography machine placed in the COVID-19 ICU. The thorax was scanned in 12 areas. Initial LUS was performed on admission and follow-up LUS was done in 7 (mean) days. At the time of the initial LUS, HRCT was performed in 28/62 patients and a chest radiography in 19/62 patients. RESULTS: On admission, LUS detected pleural line thickening (>6 lung areas) in 49/62, confluent B-lines in 38/62, and separate B-lines in 34/62, consolidation in 12/62, C prime profile in 19/62, and pleural and cardiac effusions in 4/62 and 1/62, respectively. The single beam “torchlight” artifact was seen in 16/62, which may possibly be a variation of the B-line which has not been described earlier. Follow-up LUS detected significantly lower rates (P < 0.05) of abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound demonstrated B-lines, variable consolidations, and pleural line irregularities. This study also sheds light on the appearance of the C prime pattern and “torchlight” B-lines which were not described in COVID-19 earlier. LUS findings were significantly reduced by the time of the follow-up scan, insinuating at a rather slow but consistent reduction in some COVID-19 lung lesions. However, the lung ultrasound poorly correlated with HRCT as a diagnostic modality in COVID-19 patients.","Sethi, Humsheer Singh; Sen, Kamal Kumar; Agrawal, Akshat; Sharawat, Ajay; Kumar, B.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to examine the applicability of the classical hierarchy of hazard control technologies in resource-constrained health care settings. METHODS: Using a biologic and chemical hazard example, the hazard control hierarchy was applied for risk mitigation. FINDINGS: Even when resource constraints force a reordered selection of hazard control elements, risk reduction can be achieved across a variety of hazard classes. CONCLUSION: For LMICs with limited resources, the hazard control hierarchy can be effectively employed, although the selection of methods may be reordered, to achieve significant hazard control. Such prevention strategies can thereby strengthen and sustain a critical pillar of the health system, its workforce.","McDiarmid, Melissa A.",Ann Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459333/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999614000782; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999614000782; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2014.08.001,179

More than 80% variability in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is associated with pharmacogenetics. Methods: Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed in 1006 patients with dementia (591 females, 415 males) and the influence of pathogenic (APOE) and metabolic (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9) gene variants on the therapeutic outcome were analyzed after treatment with a multifactorial regime in a natural setting. Results and Conclusions: (i) Biochemical, hematological, and metabolic differences may contribute to changes in drug efficacy and safety; (ii) anxiety and depression are more frequent and severe in females than males; (iii) both females and males respond similarly to treatment, showing significant improvements in anxiety and depression; (iv) APOE-3 carriers are the best responders and APOE-4 carriers tend to be the worst responders to conventional treatments; and (v) among CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 genophenotypes, normal metabolizers (NMs) and intermediate metabolizers (IMs) are significantly better responders than poor metabolizers (PMs) and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) to therapeutic interventions that modify anxiety and depression phenotypes in dementia.

Quite recently, blood clots have emerged as the common factor unifying many of the symptoms initially attributed without an explanation to COVID-19. Cardiovascular biomarkers and particularly, D-dimer and troponin appear to be very powerful prognostic markers, signaling the need for earlier and more aggressive interventions and treatments in order to avoid and/or minimize arterial/venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarct. The ultrasound imaging patterns at both the lung and peripheral vascular level can also be very useful weapons that have the advantage of being able to monitor longitudinally the clinical picture, something that real-time PCR/nasopharyngeal swab is not able to do and that CT can only pursue with significant radiation exposure. A lesson learned in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests quitting and starting again with targeted imaging and blood vascular biomarkers.","Zamboni, Paolo",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10070440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610564/,179

The hospital is experiencing bottlenecks when balancing outpatient diagnostic procedures with inpatient and urgent ED requests in the X-Ray department, creating the need for increased overtime and missed breaks, as well as frustrations amongst patients, staff and physicians. CASE AND OUTCOMES: To alleviate these issues and improve patient flow, this case study aims to identify options for increasing efficiency, improving adaptive workflow and decreasing wait times during peak hours in X-Ray. DISCUSSION: After a literature review, key components were narrowed down to include the following Lean Methods: floor plan evaluation with spaghetti diagrams, collection of benchmarking data from similar Canadian sites, and a real-time Client Flow Analysis. The potential benefits of Technologist Assistants (TA) and DI-dedicated porters are also explored. CONCLUSION: Lean methodology is an effective way to evaluate and improve patient flow in DI.

The EV-118 from both cases was genetically closer to ISR10 strain from Israel than to PER161 strain from Peru based on VP1 gene sequences. The complete genome of the detected EV-118 consists of 7,360 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) tail. The 5′UTR contains 669 nucleotides, and 3′UTR consists of 73 nucleotides. A single open reading frame from base 670 to 7,287 that encodes a 2,206-amino-acid polyprotein was featured. The base composition of the full genome is 27.9 % A, 24.2 % C, 24.4 % G, and 23.6 % U.

This study aimed: to gauge a better understanding of patients’ key ICD-related concerns; to determine patient interest in a support group and topics deemed helpful to address in a support group; and to examine factors which affect patient inclination to attend. METHODS: One hundred and thirty nine patients completed the ICD Patient Concerns Questionnaire – Brief (ICDC-B) and a semi-structured survey. Non-parametric tests were used to examine associations and differences in the quantitative data. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 42% of respondents said they would attend a support group and inclination to attend was associated with higher ICD concerns and a shorter time since implant. Topics considered important to address in a group were information about heart conditions and devices, the impact of an ICD on daily life and coping with fear of shocks.

685374,Case report: double lung en bloc procurement from a donor after arterial switch operation,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Limited information is available regarding the ability of nerve surgery to affect medication use patterns in patients with chronic pain or neuropathy due to nerve injury. METHODS: A retrospective survey was distributed to all operative patients (N = 767) from a single nerve surgeon’s practice between 2014 and 2020. Data collected included demographics, specifics of the injury and symptoms, medication and opioid use before surgery, and medication/opioid use following surgery. RESULTS: Out of the 767 patients, 209 (27.2%) completed the survey. Average age was 48.8 (SD = 19.1) years; 68.9% female and 31.1% male. More than 50% of the patients took at least three medications. More than 50% of the patients after surgery did not need medication or had significant reduction; 54.1% of the patients took opioid medication daily, and 97.3% of patients reported that narcotic medications did not resolve their problem. Patients rated the effectiveness (Likert scale 0–10) of opioid medications in general at an average 3.25 ± 2.03. Of patients who took opioids regularly, 61.6% reported a negative effect of these medications on daily or professional activities. After surgery, more than 50% of the patients did not need opioids or had a significant reduction in opioid usage. CONCLUSIONS: Untreated nerve injuries lead to ongoing chronic pain, explaining why medications are mostly ineffective in eliminating symptoms. In this study, nerve surgery targeting the anatomical source of symptoms effectively reduced both opioid and nonopioid medication use.","Felder, John M.; Ducic, Ivica",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513538/; https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003789,179

METHOD: Panel members age 18 and over from the nationally representative Angus Reid Forum were invited to complete an online survey about their experience with COVID-19, including their intention to get vaccinated. Respondents were asked “When a vaccine against the coronavirus becomes available to you, will you get vaccinated or not?” Having no intention to vaccinate was defined as choosing “No – I will not get a coronavirus vaccination” as a response. Odds ratios and predicted probabilities are reported for no vaccine intentionality in demographic groups. FINDINGS: 14,621 panel members completed the survey. Having no intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 is relatively low overall (9%) with substantial variation among demographic groups. Being a resident of Alberta (predicted probability = 15%; OR 0.58 [95%CI 0.14-2.24]), aged 40-59 (predicted probability = 12%; OR 0.87 [0.78-0.97]), identifying as a visible minority (predicted probability = 15%; OR 0.56 [0.37-0.84]), having some college level education or lower (predicted probability = 14%) and living in households of at least five members (predicted probability = 13%; OR 0.82 [0.76-0.88]) are related to lower vaccination intention. INTERPRETATION: The study identifies population groups with greater and lesser intention to vaccinate in Canada. As the Canadian COVID-19 vaccination effort continues, policymakers may use this information to focus outreach, education, and other efforts on the latter groups, which also have had higher risks for contracting and dying from COVID-19.","Tang, Xuyang; Gelband, Hellen; Nagelkerke, Nico; Bogoch, Isaac I.; Brown, Patrick; Morawski, Ed; Tam, Teresa",Lancet Reg Health Am,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467260/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667193X21000478; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X21000478,179

Histopathology of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis in patients with severe COVID-19 confirms tracheal ulcers with tissue invasion of Aspergillus hyphae but without angioinvasion, which differs from patients with severe influenza, where early angioinvasion is observed. We argue that aggregation of predisposing factors (eg, factors that are defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium or genetic polymorphisms), viral factors (eg, tropism and lytic effects), immune defence factors, and effects of concomitant therapies will determine whether and when the angioinvasion threshold is reached. Management of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis should include reducing viral lytic effects, rebalancing immune dysregulation, and systemic and local antifungal therapy. Future study designs should involve approaches that aim to develop improved diagnostics for tissue invasion and airways involvement and identify the immune status of the patient to guide personalised immunotherapy.","van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Brüggemann, Roger J M; Vos, Shoko; De Hertogh, Gert; Wauters, Joost; Reijers, Monique H E; Netea, Mihai G; Schouten, Jeroen A; Verweij, Paul E",Lancet Respir Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(21)00138-7; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213260021001387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34051176/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260021001387,179

AIMS: We investigated how the COVID‐19 pandemic influenced surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on patients with hepatitis C virus infection who were receiving surveillance for HCC after sustained virologic response (SVR) in Japan. METHODS: Patients who achieved SVR between 1995 and 2017 and continued receiving surveillance were compared by month in terms of the rate at which they kept their scheduled visits for HCC surveillance from July 2019 to May 2020. RESULTS: The percentage of kept scheduled visits was above 97% before February 2020. By contrast, it declined sharply after March 2020 when COVID‐19 became pandemic; the percentages were 75.5% in March, 63.0% in April, and 49.1% in May 2020 (July 2019–February 2020 vs. March–May 2020, p<0.0001). Similar declines were observed in patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis and in those with a history of HCC. Whereas most patients who cancelled a scheduled visit before February 2020 did not reschedule it, the majority of patients with cancellations after March 2020 did want to reschedule. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of scheduled visits that were kept declined rapidly after COVID‐19 became pandemic in Japan, where the spread of COVID‐19 is relatively mild and the legal restriction of people’s behavior and movement is absent. Instituting measures to follow‐up with cancelled patients and resume surveillance will be necessary in the future.","Toyoda, Hidenori; Yasuda, Satoshi; Kiriyama, Seiki; Tanikawa, Makoto; Hisanaga, Yasuhiro; Kanamori, Akira; Kitabatake, Shusuke; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Shiota, Shohei; Furoi, Manabu; Koyabu, Takahiro; Furukawa, Daiju; Kumada, Takashi; Sumida, Yoshio",GastroHep,https://doi.org/10.1002/ygh2.418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837333/,179

METHODS: Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (N(study sample) = 3,540). RESULTS: About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio’s [aOR] ≤ .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26–1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45–0.67). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 2.11–3.57), heart problems (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.34–2.92) and diabetes (aOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.02–4.82) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, males and those with lower education levels.","van der Velden, Peter G.; Marchand, Miquelle; Cuelenaere, Boukje; Das, Marcel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609763/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234600,179

Aim: This study aims to analyse the growth rates of the daily confirmed cases and to provide an expected count of the peak of daily confirmed cases. Data: We retrieved data from an Application Programming Interface portal https://www.covid19india.org/ which is open access and publicly available. Methods: Exponential model was applied to estimate the growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The estimated growth rates were used for calculating the doubling time. The Lotka Euler method was applied to calculate the effective reproduction rate. SARIMA model was developed for the growth rates to predict daily confirmed cases. Results: Results show the best fit of the exponential model over the daily confirmed cases. The growth rates estimated from the exponential model shows an unsteady, modest decline. Doubling time shows a linear increase. The effective reproduction rate declined from 3.6 persons in the third week of March 2020 to 1.14 persons at the end of August 2020. The diagnosis of the developed SARIMA model confirmed no trends in the residuals, no outliers, and nearly constant variance. The forecast suggests the peak value of daily confirmed cases would waver around 105,000 counts in the last week of September 2020. The cumulative COVID-19 cases would account for approximately 105 lakhs at the end of December 2020. Conclusion: The exponential model unravels a shift and a modest decline in the growth of daily confirmed cases. The trends in R(t) show analogue with the trends in growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The study shows that the SARIMA model is suitable for projecting daily confirmed cases. The results shed light on the understanding of the trends and epidemiological stage of COVID-19 disease, in the cognisance of the peak. Contribution: This study based on moments of the distribution of the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease unravels the uncertainty about the peak and curvature of COVID-19 disease.

690179,COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Patient Knowledge and Perceptions in a Single Center Survey,2020-08-13,"With the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 patient worldwide and associated mortality, it is critical to come up with an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2. Studies suggest that mortality due to COVID 19 is mainly attributed to the hyper inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and ARDS in infected patients. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) analogs, AAL-R and RP-002, have earlier provided in-vivo protection from the pathophysiological response during H1N1 influenza infection and improved mortality. Recently, it was shown that the treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 analog, CYM5442, resulted in the significant dampening of the immune response upon H1N1 challenge in mice and improved survival of H1N1 infected mice in combination with an antiviral drug, oseltamivir. Hence, here we suggest to investigate the possible utility of using S1P analogs to treat COVID-19.","Naz, Farha; Arish, Mohd",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32670273/,179

In this study, a homogeneous polysaccharide (LRP-S2A) with the potential of promoting osteoblast differentiation was obtained from the fruits of Lycium ruthenicum, a traditional herb for treatment of postmenopausal metabolic disorders. Structural identification indicated that LRP-S2A, with a relative molecular weight of 2.65 × 106 Da and an uronic acid content of 41.8%, contained Rha, Ara, Gal, Glc and GlcA in a molar ratio of 1.00 : 2.07 : 0.57 : 2.59 : 4.33 and was composed of a backbone consisting of 6-O-Me-α-(1â4)-D-GlcpA, 2-O-acetyl-α-(1â4)-D-Glcp, α-(1â2,4)-L-Rhap, ß-(1â3)-D-Galp andα-(1â3,5)-L-Araf, and some branches consisting of 6-O-Me-α-(1â4)-D-GlcpA and terminal α-L-Araf. These results suggested that LRP-S2A with the potential of promoting osteoblast differentiation was a new acidic polysaccharide.","Wang, Shu-Qi; Liu, Bing; Liu, Su; Xie, Song-Zi; Pan, Li-Hua; Zha, Xue-Qiang; Li, Qiang-Ming; Luo, Jian-Ping",Nat Prod Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29553828/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.1452014,179
