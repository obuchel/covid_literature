219145,Smoking and comorbidities are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality in 565 patients treated in Turkey: a retrospective observational study,2020,"The ankylosis of permanent incisors is usually caused by trauma. In a growing patient, the ankylosed tooth fails to move along with the vertical growth of the remaining alveolar process, which results in an infraoccluded tooth, gingival margin disharmony and unaesthetic smile.This case report presents an 23-year-old female patient whose maxillary right central incisor (tooth number 11) had been traumatised eight years earlier. A vertical discrepancy of about 4 mm was exhibited between teeth 11 and 12. To reposition the crown and gingival margins of the ankylosed tooth to an ideal level, single-tooth dento-osseous osteotomy and distraction of the block of bone containing the tooth was planned. In order to separate the roots of adjacent teeth for opening a space for osteotomy incision, fixed orthodontic treatment with multibracket appliances was initiated on her maxilla. After five weeks, a single-tooth dento-osseous osteotomy was performed using a piezoelectric device. To move the tooth in occlusal and buccal directions, two temporary anchorage devices (miniscrews) on her mandible and interarch elastics were applied. Approximately three weeks later, the ankylosed tooth successfully had an ideal position-relative to the adjacent teeth-and a harmonious gingival margin was achieved by minor gingivoplasty on all incisors.","Shahroudi, Atefe Saffar; Golmohammadi, Shima",J Orthod,,957
236462,A pragmatic approach and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in intensive care unit,2020,"The Ontario Integrated Supervised Injection Services cohort in Toronto, Canada (OiSIS-Toronto) is an open prospective cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID). OiSIS-Toronto was established to evaluate the impacts of supervised consumption services (SCS) integrated within three community health agencies on health status and service use. The cohort includes PWID who do and do not use SCS, recruited via self-referral, snowball sampling, and community/street outreach. From 5 November 2018 to 19 March 2020, we enrolled 701 eligible PWID aged 18+ who lived in Toronto. Participants complete interviewer-administered questionnaires at baseline and semi-annually thereafter and are asked to consent to linkages with provincial healthcare administrative databases (90.2% consented; of whom 82.4% were successfully linked) and SCS client databases. At baseline, 86.5% of participants (64.0% cisgender men, median ([IQR] age= 39 [33-49]) had used SCS in the previous 6 months, of whom most (69.7%) used SCS for <75% of their injections. A majority (56.8%) injected daily, and approximately half (48.0%) reported fentanyl as their most frequently injected drug. As of 23 April 2021, 291 (41.5%) participants had returned for follow-up. Administrative and self-report data are being used to (1) evaluate the impact of integrated SCS on healthcare use, uptake of community health agency services, and health outcomes; (2) identify barriers and facilitators to SCS use; and (3) identify potential enhancements to SCS delivery. Nested sub-studies include evaluation of ""safer opioid supply"" programs and impacts of COVID-19.","Scheim, Ayden I; Sniderman, Ruby; Wang, Ri; Bouck, Zachary; McLean, Elizabeth; Mason, Kate; Bardwell, Geoff; Mitra, Sanjana; Greenwald, Zoë R; Thavorn, Kednapa; Garber, Gary; Baral, Stefan D; Rourke, Sean B; Werb, Dan",J. urban health,,957
245882,The diagnostic process of covid-19 in the emergency department: laboratory and imaging methods,2020,"The WTO Global Trade Model, a quantitative trade model, is employed to project the impact on the global economy of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the profound uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and the containment measures, three scenarios are constructed, V-shaped, U-shaped and L-shaped recovery, corresponding with a duration of the pandemic of 3 months, 6 months and more than a year. The pandemic and containment measures are assumed to lead to a general reduction of labour supply, a rise in trade costs, and reductions in both demand and supply in sectors most affected by the containment measures. GDP and trade are projected to fall by, respectively, 5% and 11% in the V-shaped and L-shaped scenarios and trade by, respectively, 8% and 20%. The response of trade to the reduction in GDP, measured by the trade-to-GDP elasticity, is projected to rise as the crisis lasts longer. The reason is that a longer duration will lead to a larger drop in spending on durables which are highly tradable.","Bekkers, Eddy; Koopman, Robert B",World econ,,957

373854,The effect of abo and rh blood group antigens on admission to intensive care unit and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection,2020,"E-commerce in trade companies during the course of the pandemic crisis has become more than a technology;it includes a whole range of activities such as business processes, business organization, communication, customer relationship management, the E-sales orientation and business progress through the Information and Communication technologies. The consequences of the pandemic COVID-19 are reflected on the various spheres of social life, including the businesses of the companies. New strategies and techniques in business have positively contributed to the survival of trading companies on the market in the new situation. Therefore, trading companies were forced to adjust their way of working, doing business and maintaining contacts with the customers and suppliers in the new situation. E-commerce in trading companies has become much more than the E-sales. Digitalising business leads to the implementation of E-commerce of the supply chain management that leads to speeding up and maintaining of the business processes. Due to rapid technological changes, E-commerce needs to follow new trends on the Information and Communication technologies market in order to remain effective. E-commerce can also help to organize communication processes. Online sales in the situation of the pandemic crisis have proven to be an effective sales method with which trading companies can maintain their sales in contactless customer relations. With the E-commerce can be improved all the company's business relations by the introduction of opportunities that it provides in business, by building architecture of E-commerce and by implementation of applications for business enterprises taking into account the potential costs and benefits of introducing this kind of business. However, with the introduction of E-commerce, both of the marketing strategies and the market expansions can be improved. In the paper are listed and analysed changes in the trade operations of the two companies due to the pandemic crisis;one deals with the sale of agricultural machinery and the other with the sale of food products: at this point we examine and compares the differences in the business processes management with the customers and suppliers in the normal way of doing business also in the new occasions, that is the consequential business adjustment in the course of pandemic.","Madarac, Sandra Mrvica Filipović Zvonimir Eljuga Marko",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,957

459165,Smell and taste alterations in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the coming years, mental health care may come into contact with patients who developed psychological complaints related to their critical illness and stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) as a result of COVID-19. However, the experiences of these patients are to date rarely documented. AIM: Gaining insight into the experiences of COVID-ICU-survivors. METHODS 19 COVID-ICU survivors answered a written survey four months after admission. Screening lists measured psychological complaints and sleeping disorders. Visual analogue scales (VAS) measured the influence of the pandemic context and the quality of life. A written survey mapped patient experiences. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and qualitative data by means of thematic analysis. RESULTS: 50% of the participants experienced psychological complaints or sleeping disorders. A limited social network and media coverage of COVID-19 complicated the recovery process of patients. 19% of the participants experienced a reduced quality of life. A weak social network caused feelings of hopelessness. Still, patients showed great resilience. CONCLUSION: Most COVID-ICU survivors are resilient enough to integrate their experiences into their lives, despite the challenges the pandemic context poses on their rehabilitation. It is therefore important not to overmedicalise psychological complaints that occur during rehabilitation. Our attention needs to be directed to those with a weak social network.","Berends, K.; Claus, L.; De Waele, E.; Crunelle, C. L.; Matthys, F.; Vanderbruggen, N.",Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie,,957

596540,Possible role of exogenous melatonin in preventing more serious COVID-19 infection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,2021,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the knowledge of dental professionals in Saudi Arabia regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A questionnaire was developed to assess various dental professionals from both governmental and private sectors through online and social media outlets. RESULTS: A total of 1,033 questionnaires were collected (273 dental students, 193 dental auxiliary personnel, 544 dentists). In all, 63.4% of the respondents worked in hospitals. Of all the respondents, 44.9%, 33.4%, and 21.7% worked in governmental clinics, academia, and the private sector, respectively. Overall knowledge of the incubation period and route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was consistent across all dental professions. Knowledge of hand-soap cleaning time was significantly different among dental professionals (p < 0.001). Dental professionals displayed significant disagreement on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside the host (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 75.1% of the respondents were reluctant to treat a suspected COVID-19 patient, and 92% of the participants believed that the mode of transmission was droplet inhalation. Fever, coughing, and shortness of breath were identified as the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Most standard methods of prevention in the dental office were selected by at least 50% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Dental professionals seem to be consistent regarding their knowledge of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. However, knowledge of viral survivability and recommended hand-soap washing time was significantly variable among the professionals. A high degree of apprehension toward suspected COVID-19 patients existed among all dental professionals. Pandemic-awareness campaigns are essential among healthcare providers.","Shahin, Suliman Y.; Bugshan, Amr S.; Almulhim, Khalid S.; AlSharief, Mishali S.; Al-Dulaijan, Yousif A.; Siddiqui, Intisar; al-Qarni, Faisal D.",BMC Oral Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-020-01361-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349250/,957
