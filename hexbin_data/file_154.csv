330,Multiple lung abscesses due to acinetobacter infection: a case report,2009-12-18,"Acinetobacter species are well-known causes of nosocomial infections. Recent increasing evidence emphasize on the role of these pathogens in community-acquired infections. We report a case of a 16-yr-old female with fever, sore throat, productive cough, malaise and the presence of lung consolidation with multiple abscesses on radiographic examination. The patient had no significant medical history. After a detailed diagnostic work-up the diagnosis of community acquired Acinetobacter pneumonia with multiple lung abscesses was made. The Acinetobacter stain was susceptible to a variety of antimicrobial agents and the patient's condition improved rapidly. A new computed tomography chest scan, three months later, confirmed full recovery. The presence of lung abscesses due to Acinetobacter infection is an extremely uncommon manifestation of the disease. This case underlines the emergent role which these, often multi-drug resistant, bacteria may play in the future, perhaps in community infections as well.","Kokkonouzis, Ioannis; Christou, Ioannis; Athanasopoulos, Ioannis; Saridis, Nikolaos; Skoufaras, Vasilios",Cases J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804000/,154
1166,Microarray analysis of MicroRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of critically ill patients with influenza A (H1N1),2013-06-03,"BACKGROUND: With concerns about the disastrous health and economic consequences caused by the influenza pandemic, comprehensively understanding the global host response to influenza virus infection is urgent. The role of microRNA (miRNA) has recently been highlighted in pathogen-host interactions. However, the precise role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in humans, especially in critically ill patients is still unclear. METHODS: We identified cellular miRNAs involved in the host response to influenza virus infection by performing comprehensive miRNA profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from critically ill patients with swine-origin influenza pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus infection via miRNA microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of severe H1N1 influenza virus infection. Furthermore, an integrative network of miRNA-mediated host-influenza virus protein interactions was constructed by integrating the predicted and validated miRNA-gene interaction data with influenza virus and host-protein-protein interaction information using Cytoscape software. Moreover, several hub genes in the network were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Forty-one significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were found by miRNA microarray; nine were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. QRT-PCR assay and ROC curve analyses revealed that miR-31, miR-29a and miR-148a all had significant potential diagnostic value for critically ill patients infected with H1N1 influenza virus, which yielded AUC of 0.9510, 0.8951 and 0.8811, respectively. We subsequently constructed an integrative network of miRNA-mediated host-influenza virus protein interactions, wherein we found that miRNAs are involved in regulating important pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, during influenza virus infection. Some of differentially expressed miRNAs via in silico analysis targeted mRNAs of several key genes in these pathways. The mRNA expression level of tumor protein T53 and transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 were found significantly reduced in critically ill patients, whereas the expression of Janus kinase 2, caspase 3 apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase, interleukin 10, and myxovirus resistance 1 were extremely increased in critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the dysregulation of miRNAs in the PBMCs of H1N1 critically ill patients can regulate a number of key genes in the major signaling pathways associated with influenza virus infection. These differentially expressed miRNAs could be potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for severe influenza virus infection.","Song, Hao; Wang, Qi; Guo, Yang; Liu, Shunai; Song, Rui; Gao, Xuesong; Dai, Li; Li, Baoshun; Zhang, Deli; Cheng, Jun",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679792/,154
2107,"Arthralgias, fatigue, paresthesias and visceral pain: can joint hypermobility solve the puzzle? A case report",2016-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Joint hypermobility syndrome describes a disorder in which musculoskeletal pain occurs in a generalized joint hypermobility substrate. The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person’s lifetime. CASE PRESENTATION: Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient’s physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked. CONCLUSION: Exploring the patient’s articular features in her clinical context led us to diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome, a complex and often ignored condition. The case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach and coordinated interventions to define and manage this clinical entity.","Folci, Marco; Capsoni, Franco",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4743317/,154
2539,The dangers of accepting a single diagnosis: case report of concurrent Plasmodium knowlesi malaria and dengue infection,2017-01-03,"BACKGROUND: Dengue and malaria are two common, mosquito-borne infections, which may lead to mortality if not managed properly. Concurrent infections of dengue and malaria are rare due to the different habitats of its vectors and activities of different carrier mosquitoes. The first case reported was in 2005. Since then, several concurrent infections have been reported between the dengue virus (DENV) and the malaria protozoans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Symptoms of each infection may be masked by a simultaneous second infection, resulting in late treatment and severe complications. Plasmodium knowlesi is also a common cause of malaria in Malaysia with one of the highest rates of mortality. This report is one of the earliest in literature of concomitant infection between DENV and P. knowlesi in which a delay in diagnosis had placed a patient in a life-threatening situation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year old man staying near the Belum-Temengor rainforest at the Malaysia–Thailand border was admitted with fever for 6 days, with respiratory distress. His non-structural protein 1 antigen and Anti-DENV Immunoglobulin M tests were positive. He was treated for severe dengue with compensated shock. Treating the dengue had so distracted the clinicians that a blood film for the malaria parasite was not done. Despite aggressive supportive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient had unresolved acidosis as well as multi-organ failure involving respiratory, renal, liver, and haematological systems. It was due to the presentation of shivering in the ICU, that a blood film was done on the second day that revealed the presence of P. knowlesi with a parasite count of 520,000/μL. The patient was subsequently treated with artesunate-doxycycline and made a good recovery after nine days in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: This case contributes to the body of literature on co-infection between DENV and P. knowlesi and highlights the clinical consequences, which can be severe. Awareness should be raised among health-care workers on the possibility of dengue-malaria co-infection in this region. Further research is required to determine the real incidence and risk of co-infection in order to improve the management of acute febrile illness.","Chong, Soon Eu; Mohamad Zaini, Rhendra Hardy; Suraiya, Siti; Lee, Kok Tong; Lim, Jo Anne",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210313/,154
2596,Pulmonary toxicity after intraperitoneal mitomycin C: a case report of a rare complication of HIPEC,2017-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) has become a common treatment approach for disseminated appendiceal neoplasms. Systemic absorption of intraperitoneal chemotherapeutics may lead to drug-induced toxicity, most commonly neutropenia. Mitomycin C has been the most commonly used chemotherapeutic in HIPEC for the past several decades. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a rare pulmonary complication secondary to intraperitoneal administration of mitomycin C. CONCLUSIONS: While rare, intraperitoneal mitomycin C has the potential to cause serious pulmonary toxicity that should be considered with administration. To our knowledge, this report represents only the second case described in the literature.","Abel, Melissa L.; Kokosis, George; Blazer, Dan G.",World J Surg Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319179/,154

In 2016, the definition and diagnostic criteria for AE-IPF were updated by an international working group. The new definition includes any acute, clinically significant respiratory deterioration (both idiopathic and triggered events) characterized by evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormality in patients with IPF. There are no currently proven beneficial management strategies for idiopathic and triggered AE-IPF. This is the first report describing AE-IPF triggered by Aspergillus empyema, which was improved by a combination of corticosteroid, systemic antifungal therapy, local antifungal therapy, and additional pharmacological therapies.

4267,Infection prevention practices in the Netherlands: results from a National Survey,2020-01-06,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which acute care hospitals in the Netherlands have adopted recommended practices to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). METHODS: Between 18 July 2017 and 31 October 2017, we surveyed the infection prevention teams of all acute care hospitals in the Netherlands. The survey instrument was based on the ‘Translating Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Research into Practice’ (TRIP) questionnaire and adapted to the Dutch context. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the reported regular use of CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI prevention practices as well as the hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Out of 72 eligible hospitals, 47 (65.3%) responded. Surveillance systems for monitoring CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI were present in 17.8, 95.4, 26.2, and 77.3% of hospitals, respectively. Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been established in 91.5% of participating hospitals. For CAUTI, the majority of hospitals regularly used aseptic technique during catheter insertion (95%) and portable bladder ultrasound scanners (86.1%). Intermittent catheterization and catheter stop-orders were regularly used by 65.8 and 62.2% of hospitals. For CLABSI, all hospitals regularly used maximum sterile barrier precautions and chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis. Avoidance of the femoral site for central line insertions was regularly used by 65.9% of hospitals. Urinary catheters and central-lines impregnated with antibiotics or antiseptics were rarely used (≤ 5%). Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of hospitals. With the exception of disposable thermometers (31.8%), all prevention practices to prevent CDI were regularly used by more than 80% of hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Most Dutch hospitals report regular use of recommended practices for preventing CLABSI and CDI. Several specific practices to prevent CAUTI and VAP were less frequently used, however, providing an opportunity for improvement.","Huis, Anita; Schouten, Jeroen; Lescure, Dominique; Krein, Sarah; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay; Hulscher, Marlies; Greene, M.

5085,Macrophage activation syndrome in a patient with axial spondyloarthritis on adalimumab,2018-12-07,"Several pathways increase the concentrations of cellular free zinc(II) ions. Such fluctuations suggest that zinc(II) ions are signalling ions used for the regulation of proteins. One function is the inhibition of enzymes. It is quite common that enzymes bind zinc(II) ions with micro- or nanomolar affinities in their active sites that contain catalytic dyads or triads with a combination of glutamate (aspartate), histidine and cysteine residues, which are all typical zinc-binding ligands. However, for such binding to be physiologically significant, the binding constants must be compatible with the cellular availability of zinc(II) ions. The affinity of inhibitory zinc(II) ions for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β is particularly high (K (i) = 21 pM, pH 7.4), indicating that some enzymes bind zinc almost as strongly as zinc metalloenzymes. The competitive pattern of zinc inhibition for this phosphatase implicates its active site cysteine and nearby residues in the coordination of zinc. Quantitative biophysical data on both affinities of proteins for zinc and cellular zinc(II) ion concentrations provide the basis for examining the physiological significance of inhibitory zinc-binding sites in proteins and the role of zinc(II) ions in cellular signalling. Regulatory functions of zinc(II) ions add a significant level of complexity to biological control of metabolism and signal transduction and embody a new paradigm for the role of transition metal ions in cell biology.","Maret, Wolfgang",Biometals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087665/,154
5115,Contrasting Inflammatory Responses in Severe and Non-severe Community-acquired Pneumonia,2014-02-21,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a form of acute myeloid leukemia, is characterized by cell differentiation arrest at the promyelocyte stage. Current therapeutic options include administration of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), but this treatment produces many side effects. ATRA is known to induce differentiation of leukemic cells into granulocytes, but the mechanism of this process is poorly studied. We performed comparative proteomic profiling of HL-60 promyelocytic cells at different stages of ATRA-induced differentiation to identify differentially expressed proteins by high-resolution mass spectrometry and relative quantitative analysis without isotope labels. A total of 1162 proteins identified by at least two unique peptides were analyzed, among them 46 and 172 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the nuclear and cytosol fractions, respectively. These differentially expressed proteins can represent candidate targets for combination therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","Vakhrushev, I. V.; Novikova, S. E.; Tsvetkova, A. V.; Karalkin, P.

5632,"Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and TNF-308, IL6, and IL8 polymorphisms in Egyptian population: a case–control study",2019-11-21,"Approximately one third of patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu-positive breast cancer respond to trastuzumab monotherapy, a humanized anti-HER-2/neu antibody. However, de novo and acquired antibody resistance is one of the major limitations of trastuzumab therapy warranting the search for other therapeutic strategies. One of the most remarkable features of adenovirus (AdV)-based vaccine is its ability to induce exceptionally high and sustained frequencies of transgene product-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. In this study, we constructed two recombinant AdVs (AdV(OVA) and AdV(HER-2)) expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and HER-2/neu, and assessed AdV-induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses and preventive/therapeutic antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that AdV(OVA) stimulates efficient OVA-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer responses, leading to preventive long-term immunity against OVA-expressing BL6-10ova melanoma in wild-type C56BL/6 mice. We further demonstrate that AdV(HER-2) stimulates HER-2/neu-specific CD8(+) CTL responses, leading to a significant reduction in breast carcinogenesis in transgenic FVBneuN mice (P<0.05), but has little therapeutic effect on pre-existing Tg1-1 tumor even at early stage (15 mm(3)). In contrast, the anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy is capable of completely inhibiting Tg1-1 tumor growth at early stage, but fails to eradicate well-established Tg1-1 breast tumor (100 mm(3)). Interestingly, a combinatorial immunotherapy of anti-HER-2/neu antibody with AdV(HER-2) vaccine was capable of curing 4 of 10 studied mice bearing well-established Tg1-1 breast tumors and significantly delaying in death of the remaining six tumor-bearing mice (P<0.05). Taken together, our results suggest an adjuvant effect of AdV(HER-2) on anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy for well-established breast tumor in transgenic FVBneuN mice, and this combinatorial immunotherapy of trastuzumab with AdV(HER-2) vaccine may be used as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of advanced HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer.","Chen, Y; Xie, Y; Chan, T; Sami, A; Ahmed, S; Liu, Q; Xiang, J",Cancer Gene Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091910/,154

To detect VTE, multi-detector computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. Of 363 patients assessed, the incidence of symptomatic VTE was 12.4% (45 patients), and the incidence of symptomatic PE was 5.2% (19 patients). For the risk-factor analysis, a higher Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.037), and a history of external fixator application (p = 0.007) were associated with increased VTE risk. Among patients who had VTE, male sex (p = 0.017), and above-the-knee fractures (p = 0.035) were associated with increased pulmonary embolism (PE) risk. In conclusions, the incidence of VTE in post-traumatic patients is not low after chemoprophylaxis.

Age-related changes in multiple aspects of the adaptive immune response to influenza have been well-documented including a decline in antibody responses to influenza vaccination and changes in the cell-mediated response associated with immune senescence. This review will focus on T cell responses to influenza and influenza vaccination in older adults, and how increasing frailty or coexistence of multiple (≥2) chronic conditions contributes to the loss of vaccine effectiveness for the prevention of hospitalization. Further, dysregulation of the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators contributes to a decline in the generation of an effective CD8 T cell response needed to clear influenza virus from the lungs. Current influenza vaccines provide only a weak stimulus to this arm of the adaptive immune response and rely on re-stimulation of CD8 T cell memory related to prior exposure to influenza virus. Efforts to improve vaccine effectiveness in older adults will be fruitless until CD8 responses take center stage.","McElhaney, Janet E.; Verschoor, Chris P.; Andrew, Melissa K.; Haynes, Laura; Kuchel, George A.; Pawelec, Graham",Immun Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204009/,154

11595,Response to “Visualization of Putative Coronavirus in Kidney”,2020-05-16,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant economic impact on radiology with markedly decreased imaging case volumes. The purpose of this study was to quantify the imaging volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic across patient service locations and imaging modality types. METHODS: Imaging case volumes in a large health care system were retrospectively studied, analyzing weekly imaging volumes by patient service locations (emergency department, inpatient, outpatient) and modality types (x-ray, mammography, CT, MRI, ultrasound, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine) in years 2020 and 2019. The data set was split to compare pre-COVID-19 (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) periods. Independent-samples t tests compared the mean weekly volumes in 2020 and 2019. RESULTS: Total imaging volume in 2020 (weeks 1-16) declined by 12.29% (from 522,645 to 458,438) compared with 2019. Post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) revealed a greater decrease (28.10%) in imaging volumes across all patient service locations (range 13.60%-56.59%) and modality types (range 14.22%-58.42%). Total mean weekly volume in 2020 post-COVID-19 (24,383 [95% confidence interval 19,478-29,288]) was statistically reduced (P = .003) compared with 33,913 [95% confidence interval 33,429-34,396] in 2019, across all patient service locations and modality types.

13023,The clinical characteristics of coronavirus-associated nephropathy,2020-09-02,Given the medical and cultural perspectives on deafness it is important to determine if genetic counselors’ attitudes toward deaf people can affect counseling sessions for deafness genes. One hundred fifty-eight genetic counselors recruited through the National Society of Genetic Counselors Listserv completed an online survey assessing attitudes toward deaf people and scenario-specific comfort levels discussing and offering genetic testing for deafness. Respondents with deaf/Deaf friends or who work in prenatal or pediatric settings had more positive attitudes toward deaf people than those without deaf/Deaf friends or those working in ‘other’ settings. More positive attitudes toward deaf people correlated with higher comfort level talking about genetic testing for the two scenarios involving culturally Deaf clients; and correlated with higher comfort level offering genetic testing to culturally Deaf clients wishing to have a deaf child. Attitudes and comfort level were not correlated in the scenarios involving hearing or non-culturally deaf clients. These results suggest that genetic counselors’ attitudes could affect information provision and the decision making process of culturally Deaf clients. Cultural sensitivity workshops in genetic counseling training programs that incorporate personal interactions with culturally Deaf individuals are recommended.

The mission of a broad-spectrum prevention strategy clearly favors multivalent vaccines. The development of multivalent vaccines was attempted via the simple combination of potent monovalent vaccines or the construction of chimeric vaccines comprised of epitopes derived from different virus serotypes. The present review summarizes recent advances in HFMD vaccine development and discusses the next steps toward a safe and effective HFMD vaccine that is capable of establishing a cross-protective antibody response.","He, Xiangchuan; Zhang, Miaomiao; Zhao, Chen; Zheng, Peiyong; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7525078/,154

BSTARS addresses barriers to breastfeeding support for Black women and women of color, including lack of support from the mother's partner, family, or health care provider, generational myths, unawareness of public health programs to support breastfeeding, educational gaps, and embarrassment. This program incorporates critical partnerships, including health care providers, birth workers, and other supporters, into the organization to offer comprehensive support for the mother's continuity of care. The environment and educational support for breastfeeding and women's health issues are addressed under the lens of health equity and eliminating barriers experienced by the mother's color, or socioeconomic status. A mother's socioeconomic status often unjustly hinders her from receiving the lactation and social support needed for healthier outcomes. In 2019, the breastfeeding initiation rate in Tennessee increased to 71.3% among non-Hispanic Blacks. BSTARS has reached >500 families since its inception. BSTARS focuses their specific intervention on all facets of the family dyad, through teaching the importance of breastfeeding and breast milk now and sustainable for the future.","Pyles, Tiana Esther Helen; Umi, Shukura Ayoluwa; Madubuonwu, Sandra; Stiles, Allison; Devane-Johnson, Stephanie; Scott, Helen; Rhoads, Sarah; Russell, Jennifer H.",Breastfeed Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7891194/,154
15574,Core components of infection prevention and control programs at the facility level in Georgia: key challenges and opportunities,2021-02-24,"Squalene epoxidase (SQE) is a crucial regulatory enzyme for the biosynthesis of several important classes of compounds including sterols and triterpenoids. The present paper identified and characterised five SQE genes (GgSQE1 to GgSQE5) from Glycyrrhiza glabra through transcriptome data mining and homology-based cloning, for the first time. The phylogenetic analysis implied their functional divergence. The ORF corresponding to one of the five SQEs, namely, GgSQE1, was cloned and studied for its function in a heterologous system, following transient and stable expressions. The transient expression followed by GgSQE1 encoding protein purification suggested approximately 58.0-kDa protein following the predicted molecular mass of the deduced protein. The gene expression profiling based on qRT-PCR indicated its highest expression (6.4-folds) in the 10-month-old roots. Furthermore, ABA (12.4-folds) and GA(3) (2.47) treatments upregulated the expression of GgSQE1 in the shoots after 10 and 12 hours, respectively, which was also reflected in glycyrrhizin accumulation. The inductive effects of ABA and GA(3) over GgSQE1 expression were also confirmed through functional analysis of GgSQE1 promoters using GUS fusion construct. Stable constitutive expression of GgSQE1 in Nicotiana tabacum modulated the sterol contents. The study could pave the way for understanding the metabolic flux regulation concerning biosynthesis of related sterols and triterpenoids.

Based on the established relationship between altered membrane dipole potential and transmembrane protein conformation and function, we investigate here polyphenols' ability to induce changes in cell membrane dipole potential. Ultimately, we are interested in finding a tool to prevent polyphenol PAINS-type behavior and produce compounds less prone to untargeted and promiscuous interactions with the cell membrane. Di-8-ANEPPS fluorescence ratiometric measurements suggest that planar lipophilic polyphenols—phloretin, genistein and resveratrol—act by decreasing membrane dipole potential, especially in cholesterol-rich domains such as lipid rafts, which play a role in important cellular processes. These results provide a mechanism for their labelling as PAINS through their ability to disrupt cell membrane homeostasis. Aiming to explore the role of C-glucosylation in PAINS membrane-interfering behavior, we disclose herein the first synthesis of 4-glucosylresveratrol, starting from 5-hydroxymethylbenzene-1,3-diol, via C-glucosylation, oxidation and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination, and resynthesize phloretin and genistein C-glucosides. We show that C-glucosylation generates compounds which are no longer able to modify membrane dipole potential. Therefore, it can be devised as a strategy to generate bioactive natural product derivatives that no longer act as membrane dipole potential modifiers. Our results offer a new technology towards rescuing bioactive polyphenols from their PAINS danger label through C–C ligation of sugars.","de Matos, Ana Marta; Blázquez-Sánchez, Maria Teresa; Sousa, Carla; Oliveira, Maria Conceição; de Almeida, Rodrigo F.

Data were collected from 24 women withs lived experience of domestic abuse using mixed methodological approaches and analysed using relevant analytic techniques. Results from this pilot study show that patients want to be asked about their experience of domestic abuse. Although there were barriers to disclosing to the dentist, evidence from this pilot study highlights that the dental practice is an avenue that can be used for appropriately signposting patients to relevant services. Evidence from this pilot study contributes to the existing knowledge on the need to raise awareness among the patient population with lived experience of DVA that the dental team can support them. In addition, there is a need for on-going training to enhance the capacity of the dental team for appropriately supporting their adult patients with lived experience of DVA.","Femi-Ajao, Omolade",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922980/,154

Cardiovascular risk is further increased among individuals with polyvascular disease, where either cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease is present in addition to PAD. In this review, we present common clinical scenarios encountered when managing patients with PAD and provide an evidence-based approach to prescribing optimal antithrombotics in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: The COMPASS trial recently demonstrated that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID + ASA daily significantly reduces major adverse cardiac and limb events in patients with PAD. Despite these advances, morbidity following MALE events remains high. SUMMARY: With widespread approval by federal health regulators, the COMPASS regimen should be strongly considered in PAD patients who do not have a high bleeding risk. Implementing the COMPASS regimen in patients with PAD, along with other vascular risk reduction strategies, will have a substantial impact on reducing atherothromboembolic risk in patients with established vascular disease.","McClure, Graham R.; Kaplovitch, Eric; Narula, Sukrit; Bhagirath, Vinai C.; Anand, Sonia S.",Curr Cardiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6717183/,154

Here we describe a mutation in the L-type Ca(2+) channel Ca(V)1.4 leading to T lymphocyte dysfunction, including several hallmarks of immunological exhaustion. Ca(V)1.4-deficient mice exhibited an expansion of central and effector memory T lymphocytes, and an upregulation of inhibitory receptors on several T cell subsets. Moreover, the sustained elevated levels of activation markers on B lymphocytes suggest that they are in a chronic state of activation. Functionally, T lymphocytes exhibited a reduced store-operated Ca(2+) flux compared to wild-type controls. Finally, modifying environmental conditions by herpes virus infection exacerbated the dysfunctional immune phenotype of the Ca(V)1.4-deficient mice. This is the first example where the mutation of a Ca(V) channel leads to T lymphocyte dysfunction, including the upregulation of several inhibitory receptors, hallmarks of T cell exhaustion, and establishes the physiological importance of Ca(V) channel signaling in maintaining a nimble immune system.","Fenninger, Franz; Han, Jeffrey; Stanwood, Shawna R.; Nohara, Lilian L.; Arora, Hitesh; Choi, Kyung Bok; Munro, Lonna; Pfeifer, Cheryl G.; Shanina, Iryna; Horwitz, Marc S.; Jefferies, Wilfred A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6833481/,154
17120,Combined brain and thoracic trauma surgery in a hybrid emergency room system: a case report,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, more and more reports are focused on the application of traditional Chinese medicine injection (TCMJ) for the treatment of viral pneumonia. There are about 200 million cases of viral pneumonia worldwide every year, half of which are children. At present, many kinds of TCMJ are created for the treatment of viral pneumonia in children, with good therapeutic effects. However, there are many kinds of TCMJ, and the treatment advantages are different, thus bringing difficulties to the selection of clinical drugs. In order to provide evidence-based evidence support for the clinical selection of TCMJ for the treatment of viral pneumonia in children, this study selected the commonly used TCMJ for clinical treatment of viral pneumonia for meta-analysis to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: The Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Viper information databases, Cochran library Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE will be searched. The literature will be searched, with language restriction in English and Chinese. The related reference will be retrieved as well. Two reviewers will independently extract data and perform quality assessment of included studies. Review Manager 5.3 will be applied to conduct this meta-analysis. RESULTS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal once we finish this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reliable evidence-based evidence for the efficacy of TCMJ in the treatment of viral pneumonia in children.

This study sought to understand if parents would be receptive to learning about the HPV vaccine from other parent experiences, and what format this information should take on social media. In May 2020, we conducted a qualitative study of six online focus groups across the U.S. with parents (n = 48) of children ages 9–14. Using a text-based discussion format, we discussed their experiences getting information about the HPV vaccine and using Twitter to learn about health topics. Four coders structured qualitative findings by themes including content, delivery, and source of information. An accompanying survey was used to describe participant Twitter use and HPV vaccine knowledge and attitudes. The average participant age was 44.6 years old, 63% were mothers, and the majority had high HPV vaccine knowledge. Parents indicated that they want to hear from other parents about their experiences with the HPV vaccine. However, it was hard to know where to find this information. When experiences are shared on social media, the negative ones are more memorable and more personal. Parents thought Twitter could be an important space to communicate about the HPV vaccine if it was done in a credible, verifiable, and authentic way. Parents want to learn about the HPV vaccine through other parent experiences, especially when this aligns with science supporting the vaccine. Public health and medical communities must embrace this mix of evidence and lived experiences to deliver and discuss health information.","Massey, Philip M.; Togo, Elikem; Chiang, Shawn C.; Klassen, Ann C.; Rose, Meredith; Manganello, Jennifer A.; Leader, Amy E.",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8281599/,154

20268,Describing global pediatric RSV disease at intensive care units in GAVI-eligible countries using molecular point-of-care diagnostics: the RSV GOLD-III study protocol,2021-08-23,"Salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) is a contagious disease caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis, an intracellular bacterium. SRS causes an estimated economic loss of $700 million USD to the Chilean industry annually. Vaccination and antibiotic therapy are the primary prophylactic and control measures used against SRS. Unfortunately, commercially available SRS vaccines have not been shown to have a significant effect on reducing mortality. Most vaccines contain whole inactivated bacteria which results in decreased efficacy due to the limited ability of the vaccine to evoke a cellular mediated immune response that can eliminate the pathogen or infected cells. In addition, SRS vaccine efficacy has been evaluated primarily with Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon). Vaccine studies using Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) are scarce, despite SRS being the leading cause of infectious death for this species. In this study, we evaluate an injectable vaccine based on P. salmonis proteoliposome; describing the vaccine security profile, capacity to induce specific anti-P. salmonis IgM and gene expression of immune markers related to T CD8 cell-mediated immunity. Efficacy was determined by experimental challenge with P. salmonis intraperitoneally. Our findings indicate that a P. salmonis proteoliposome-based vaccine is able to protect O. mykiss against challenge with a P. salmonis Chilean isolate and causes a specific antibody response. The transcriptional profile suggests that the vaccine is capable of inducing cellular immunity. This study provides new insights into O. mykiss protection and the immune response induced by a P. salmonis proteoliposome-based vaccine.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether this combination would exert distinct effects as synbiotics in vivo. Synbiotics combinations of LP, pullulan, and PPNs were used as experimental treatments in a dysbiosis-induced murine model, and their restorative effect was assessed using pathogen Escherichia coli K99 challenge. Our results showed that the E. coli infection was suppressed markedly in the experimental group fed with synbiotics containing PPNs. In addition, the decrease in serum endotoxin level after synbiotics treatment suggested the reinforcement of the gut barrier. Comparison of treatment groups, including a normal control group, showed that synbiotics containing PPNs increased microbial diversity, which is a representative parameter of healthy status. Furthermore, distinct from probiotics treatment alone, synbiotics showed additive effects of enrichment of several well-known beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and other butyrate-producing bacteria including Faecalibacterium. Collectively, our results indicate that synbiotics containing PPNs are effective at restoring gut dysbiosis, suppressing pathogenic infection, and increasing microbial diversity, suggesting that synbiotics with nanoprebiotics have the potential to be a novel strategy for ameliorating gut dysbiosis and infectious diseases.","Hong, Liang; Lee, Sang-Mok; Kim, Whee-Soo; Choi, Yun-Jaie; Oh, Seo-Ho; Li, Yu-Ling; Choi, Seung-Hoon; Chung, Dong Hyen; Jung, Eunkyoung; Kang, Sang-Kee; Cho, Chong-Su",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406803/,154

Multiple studies have suggested that adults with influenza who are underweight, overweight, or obese have increased risk of hospitalization compared with those of normal weight. We sought to determine whether risk of hospitalization among patients infected with influenza or other respiratory viruses differs by BMI among patients in Puerto Rico. METHODS: We analyzed data from patients enrolled in the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue Surveillance System (SEDSS), a prospective study of patients with acute febrile illness (AFI), from May 2012 to September 2018. We evaluated those older than 24 months, who had height, weight, and clinical disposition recorded, and tested positive by RT–PCR for infection with influenza A (n = 1253), influenza B (n = 844), adenovirus (n = 435), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 289), parainfluenza virus (n = 361), metapneumovirus (n = 247), or coronavirus (n = 15). BMI categories were determined using standard cutoffs in adults and BMI-for-age percentiles for children and adolescents. Risk of hospitalization by BMI category was calculated using multivariate Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the 3,388 patients included, 675 (20%) were overweight, 926 (27%) were obese, 405 (12%) were underweight, and 1382 (41%) were normal weight. Median age was 13.4 (range: 2–100 years), and 50% were male. Risk of hospitalization was not significantly different in children and adult patients infected with a respiratory virus who were overweight relative to those that had normal BMI; however, once hospitalized, obese individuals of any age had a mean length of hospital stay 1.7 days longer than normal weight persons (95% CI: 0.27–3.17 days). Among adult patients, underweight patients were nearly 3 times more likely to be hospitalized compared with normal weight patients (relative risk 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4–5.9). Underweight children were not at increased risk of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Among patients infected with a respiratory virus, risk of hospitalization was higher among underweight adult patients, and obese patients had a longer mean length of stay once hospitalized. Body mass index should be considered when evaluating risk and managing these patients.

22646,Therapeutic effect of integrative traditional Chinese and western medicine on 51 SARS patients and its influence on their T lymphocyte subsets,2003,"Background: During the past two years, 5% of patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Hamad General Hospital (HGH) had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio less than 100 mmHg. The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg to PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 ± 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 ± 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 ± 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2. Conclusion: • Sustaining and standardizing the accomplished work of data collection. • Implementing the prone positioning technique across other critical care units of Hamad Medical Corporation. • Keeping a record of minor complications associated with prone positioning and resolving them in further sessions. • Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning.","Akbar, Anzila; Albadw, Naseem; Racela, Brian; Damodaran, Chokkalinga; Mustafa, Emad; Coria, Roopa; Hassan, Ali; Saif Ibrahim, Abdulsalam",Qatar Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6984011/,154

23891,Treatment of Perianal Crohn Disease Fistulae,2008,"Liver transplantation has become an important treatment modality for patients with end-stage liver disease/cirrhosis, acute liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens for liver transplantation have improved significantly over the past 20 years, infectious complications continue to contribute to the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. The use of standardized screening protocols for both donors and recipients, coupled with targeted prophylaxis against specific pathogens, has helped to mitigate the risk of infection in liver transplant recipients. Patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis have immunological deficits that place them at increased risk for infection while awaiting liver transplantation. The patient undergoing liver transplantation is prone to develop healthcare-acquired infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms that could potentially affect patient outcomes after transplantation. The complex nature of liver transplant surgery that involves multiple vascular and hepatobiliary anastomoses further increases the risk of infection after liver transplantation. During the early post-transplantation period, healthcare-acquired bacterial and fungal infections are the most common types of infection encountered in liver transplant recipients. The period of maximal immunosuppression that occurs at 1–6 months after transplantation can be complicated by opportunistic infections due to both primary infection and reactivation of latent infection. Severe community-acquired infections can complicate the course of liver transplantation beyond 12 months after transplant surgery. This chapter provides an overview of liver transplantation including indications, donor-recipient selection criteria, surgical procedures, and immunosuppressive therapies. A focus on infections in patients with chronic liver disease/cirrhosis and an overview of the specific infectious complications in liver transplant recipients are presented.","Mohanraj, B.

24814,Common Infections Following Lung Transplantation,2018-08-31,"This chapter discusses the interrelatedness between intellectual property and human security. There are two sides of this interrelationship. In the first place, IP issues are closely related to the hard security of nations. In the second place, the application of the regime of international intellectual property laws can help promote economic and social development and, at the same time, can result in major hardships when it comes to protection of the right to life and realization of the rights to health, food, and education. In the pages that follow, different aspects of these issues are explored.","Ramcharan, Robin",International Intellectual Property Law and Human Security,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121255/,154
25023,Lung Transplantation,2008,"Developing countries, especially those in the tropical regions of the world, are known for poverty and infectious diseases (ID). People in developing countries carry on their day-to-day living amongst these two challenges. Between the years 1940–2004, over 300 emerging human ID have been reported worldwide. Infectious diseases have resulted in high mortality and morbidity in developing countries. Affecting more than 1 billion of the world’s population, neglected tropical diseases (NTD) are a group of infectious diseases that are endemic in the poorest regions of the world. Most of the affected populations live in rural areas with very minimal resources but at high risk of disease due to their livelihood. Non-communicable diseases are also on the increase in developing countries, further exacerbating public health challenges in these regions. With nearly 15 million people dying each year as a result of ID, most of them living in developing countries, there is need to find solutions to prevent and tackle infectious diseases in these communities. This book is devoted to infectious diseases and livelihoods in developing countries.","Mphande, Fingani Annie",Infectious Diseases and Rural Livelihood in Developing Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121515/,154

Since the most infectious diseases spread through human contacts, we focus on modeling the diffusion of diseases by analyzing the social relationship among individuals. In other words, we try to capture the interaction pattern among human beings using the social contact information, and investigate its impact on the spread of diseases. Particularly, we investigate the problem of minimizing the expected number of infected persons by treating a small fraction of the population with vaccines. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and propose an approximate algorithm representing a preventive disease control strategy based on the social patterns. Simulation results confirm the superiority of our strategy over existing ones.","Zhang, Bowu; Li, Pei; Cheng, Xiuzhen; Bie, Rongfang; Chen, Dechang","Wireless Algorithms, Systems, and Applications",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121601/,154

Analyzing the immediate reactions to the events, as well as the ensuing responses, is only possible where there is dependable evidence. Two case studies offer eyewitness accounts of disaster, as well as archaeological and scientific studies. These are the plague that struck Athens in 430 BCE during the Peloponnesian War, described by Thucydides who witnessed and suffered from it, and the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE, recorded in letters by Pliny the Younger, who saw it and fled from it during its height. The victims of these disasters were plunged into confusion and uncertainty about what to do to survive. In many cases, social cohesion dissolved, and individuals broke norms and traditions. Some sought help from the gods, and others felt there were no gods. In the aftermath, leaders responded with measures intended to help people, restore the body politic, and rebuild. Although frustrated by physical and social barriers, they achieved a degree of success.","Hughes, J.

With the increasing incidence with ageing, the full impact of these diseases is yet to be realised. For most chronic lung diseases there are limited treatments options, with the existing approaches mainly addressing symptom relief. Little progress has been made, in recent years, in the development of new therapeutic strategies for managing these burdensome pathologies. There is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Endogenous progenitor cells (stem cells) have been recognised in many organs, including the lungs where they are suggested to maintain a population of cells that are able to facilitate the endogenous repair processes. Emerging knowledge of how these repair processes are disrupted in chronic lung diseases and the potential to capitalise upon the regenerative capacity of stem cell populations raise the hopes of the field worldwide for innovative treatment approaches for these devastating diseases in the future. This chapter outlines the series of diseases that may benefit from these emerging new therapeutic outlooks.","de Hilster, Roderick; Li, Minghui; Timens, Wim; Hylkema, Machteld; Burgess, Janette K.",Stem Cell-Based Therapy for Lung Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122311/,154

These processes can be analysed in several ways by using different histological, virological and immunological methods. Viral infections can be with or without symptoms (also called apparent or inapparent infection courses). In both cases, the host organism responds with immunological defence responses, which usually lead to overcoming the primary disease symptoms and to the elimination of the virus. The immune response may also contribute in the context of immunopathogenesis to specific disease symptoms and either temporary or permanent damage to the host.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123358/,154

For the research purpose, this study analyzed the data from passengers of a major international airline. The results suggest that traveler groups with different characteristics (gender, airline seat class, travel purpose, travel destination, travel duration, travel companion, and income level) respond differently to some risk factors, while they show the same response to other risk factors. The results also show that each risk factor affects travel satisfaction and repurchase intention differently.

Most of the existing methods learn network embedding based on distributional similarity hypothesis while ignoring adjacency similarity property, which may cause distance bias problem in the network embedding space. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework to encode distributional similarity and measure adjacency similarity simultaneously, named DDNE. The proposed DDNE trains a siamese neural network which learns a set of non-linear transforms to project the node pairs into the same low-dimensional space based on their first-order proximity. Meanwhile, a distance constraint is used to make the distance between a pair of adjacent nodes smaller than a threshold and that of each non-adjacent nodes larger than the same threshold, which highlight the adjacency similarity. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets in three social network analysis tasks, including network reconstruction, attribute prediction and recommendation. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive and superior performance of our approach in generating effective network embedding vectors over baselines.","Li, Xiaoxue; Li, Yangxi; Shang, Yanmin; Tong, Lingling; Fang, Fang; Yin, Pengfei; Cheng, Jie; Li, Jing",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302248/,154

Zambia has experienced a slow but steady increase in contraceptive prevalence, with slight decline in total fertility rate (TFR), over the past 20 years. Drawing from the Zambian context, including a review of current policy solutions, we present a case for making investments in voluntary family planning (FP), underpinned by a human rights framework, as a pillar for accelerating development and socio-economic advancement.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 59 patients aged 21–53 years who underwent transthoracic device closure of VSDs from January 2019 to September 2019. According to the different anesthesia strategies, the patients were divided into the R group (using remifentanil-based anesthesia, n = 33) and the S group (using sufentanil-based anesthesia, n = 26). Patient-related clinical data, postoperative analgesia, and sedation scores were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, gender, body weight, and operation time between the group R and the group S (P > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in intraoperative hemodynamic changes, BIS scores, postoperative analgesia, and sedation scores between the two groups (P > 0.05).

This has serious implications, especially for patients with acute HIV infection (AHI) presenting with symptoms suggesting COVID-19 infection. This is a high priority population for rapid linkage to care (LTC) and initiation of HAART. METHODS: We reviewed data from our eXpanded HIV Testing and LTC (X-TLC) Program, a collaboration effort between 13 healthcare centers on the South and West Sides of Chicago. Since 2016, most sites had 4(th) or 5(th) generation HIV Ag/Ab testing available. RESULTS: Most sites experienced reductions in HIV screens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Advanced planning by our ED incorporated blood draws for HIV screens as part of COVID-19 evaluations. UCM performed 19,111 HIV screens (11,133 in the ED) between 1/1/20 and 8/17/20, along with 100,635 COVID PCRs (14,754 in ED) between 3/17/20 and 8/17/20. Nine patients were diagnosed with AHI after the first case of COVID-19 in Chicago (1/24/20), and 7 were diagnosed after the first case of community transmission in Cook County (3/8/20). All cases of AHI were diagnosed in the ED. The rate of AHI was significantly higher in 2020 versus the prior 4 years (14.4 vs 6.8 per year, p < 0.05). AHI patients comprised 25.7 % (9/35) of all new diagnoses, the highest percent ever. There were 7 men (6 identified as MSM) and 2 cis-gender women, median age of 25 years (21 to 28 years). The median viral load was 6 million (115,000 to > 6 million) copies/mL. Eight of 9 patients presented with an illness indistinguishable from COVID-19, including 1co-infected patient. All were LTC and started on HAART from time of PCR result within a median of 1 day (0–38), but 3 days (range 1–41) from sample collection as a result of delayed reflex PCR confirmatory testing due to high demands on lab personnel and scarcity of reagents due to COVID-19 PCR volumes (since resolved). HIV Screening and COVID-19 Testing in the ED During COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Continued HIV screening in our ED during the COVID-19 pandemic identified an increased number of patients with AHI. These individuals may be more likely to present for care due to fear of COVID-19 infection. We achieved rapid LTC and initiation of HAART without any incremental increases in resources. All HIV screening programs should incorporate blood-based HIV screening into their COVID-19 testing programs.

Many recent prediction tools developed upon the deep learning algorithms and mass spectrometry data have indeed showed improvement on the average predicting power for class I HLA-peptide interaction. However, their prediction performances show great variability over individual HLA alleles and peptides with different lengths, which is particularly the case for HLA-C alleles due to the limited amount of experimental data. To meet the increasing demand for attaining the most accurate HLA-peptide binding prediction for individual patient in the real-world clinical studies, more advanced deep learning framework with higher prediction accuracy for HLA-C alleles and longer peptides is highly desirable. RESULTS: We present a pan-allele HLA-peptide binding prediction framework—MATHLA which integrates bi-directional long short-term memory network and multiple head attention mechanism. This model achieves better prediction accuracy in both fivefold cross-validation test and independent test dataset. In addition, this model is superior over existing tools regarding to the prediction accuracy for longer ligand ranging from 11 to 15 amino acids. Moreover, our model also shows a significant improvement for HLA-C-peptide-binding prediction. By investigating multiple-head attention weight scores, we depicted possible interaction patterns between three HLA I supergroups and their cognate peptides. CONCLUSION: Our method demonstrates the necessity of further development of deep learning algorithm in improving and interpreting HLA-peptide binding prediction in parallel to increasing the amount of high-quality HLA ligandome data.","Ye, Yilin; Wang, Jian; Xu, Yunwan; Wang, Yi; Pan, Youdong; Song, Qi; Liu, Xing; Wan, Ji",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787246/,154

Outcome measures were occurrence of DCI, defined as new focal neurological deficit or a deterioration of consciousness; and/or a new infarct on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging that was not visible initially. Occurrence of poor functional outcome at follow-up were measured by modified Rankin Scale or Glasgow outcomes scale. Fifteen studies analyzing data of 3268 patients with aSAH were included. Meta-analysis revealed early increase in CRP was significantly associated with higher risk of occurrence of DCI (pooled OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10–1.54; P = 0.002), whereas not with poor functional outcome (pooled OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.04, P = 0.052). No significant associations between early increase in WBC and DCI (pooled OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95–1.34; P = 0.179) were observed, whereas increase in WBC was significantly associated with increased risk of poor functional outcome (pooled OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07–1.28, P = 0.001). Early increase in blood CRP appears to correlate with DCI after SAH, while increase in WBC correlates with poor functional outcome. However, strong conclusion cannot be made due to the small study number, between-study heterogeneity and suspicion of uncontrolled factors. Whether early phase CRP and WBC may serve as prognostic markers for aSAH needs more investigation.

Teaching mathematics in this way required a very different approach to the lecture-exam based model prevalent in most engineering degrees. In order to ensure all students developed the fundamental skills and knowledge required of engineers, a micro-credential based curriculum was developed where micro-credentials were mapped to projects and delivered “just-in-time”. The curriculum contained forty-eight explicit mathematical micro-credentials in the areas of measurement and geometry, algebra, calculus, and statistics and probability as well as many more micro-credentials in other areas of curriculum that contain mathematical skills, from physics to project budgeting. Mathematical competencies were used as a framework in the design and analysis of the micro-credentials.

Availability of vaccine could prevent the Shigella infection and reduce the mortality. Conventional approaches of vaccine development against shigellosis have not resulted in desirable vaccine. As shigellosis may be caused by multiple strains and serotypes, there is a need to develop a multivalent vaccine, capable of providing protection against multiple Shigella strains. To develop broad spectrum vaccine, we had previously derived a pool of conserved epitopes against Shigella by using multiple immunoinformatic tools. In this study, the identified conserved epitopes derived from the Outer Membrane Proteins A and C of Shigella were chemically synthesized, and the EpiMix made up of 5 epitopes coupled to a carrier protein, ovalbumin was developed and validated for its immunogenicity. The intramuscular immunization with EpiMix in Balb/c mice led to increase in EpiMix specific serum IgG, and significant increase in fecal IgA as well as in IL-4, IL-2and IFN-γ levels. Further, the EpiMix immunized mice showed protection when challenged against S. flexneri ATCC 12022 using the intraperitoneal route. Moreover, the analysis of cytokine profile and IFN-γ/IL4 ratio in post Shigella challenge immunized mice suggested the high levels of IFN-γ levels and possible dominance of Th1 response, playing pivotal role in the elimination of Shigella. Collectively, the results demonstrate the immunogenic potential and protective efficacy of the EpiMix in the murine shigellosis model. However, the detailed study and further optimisation of epitopes would substantiate the prospective use of EpiMix as a prophylactic candidate for vaccination.","Padh, Harish; Yagnik, Bhrugu; Sharma, Drashya; Desai, Priti",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7846920/,154
45427,Immunosuppressants: COVID-19 infection: 10 case reports,2021-02-06,"Uncertainty in business environments is promoting learning as an organizational value. Organizations need to implement knowledge management (KM) processes as well as organizational mechanisms transforming collective knowledge into a learning organizational capability. Literature identifies knowledge sharing (KS) as a fundamental KM process. Moreover, KM was found to be a prerequisite to a learning organization. Unfortunately, organizational initiatives promoting KS are challenged with the hoarding wisdom, “knowledge is power.” Literature has researched intrinsic and extrinsic motivations affecting KS intention. The rational action theory (RAT) explains the embedded utility function merging these motivations. Despite many studies, the dynamics of KS behavior needs further examination. This paper is an attempt to frame the KS behavior using game theory and RAT. We represent individuals’ perceived utility in two functions: knowledge and trustworthiness. This limits the perceived utility to personal enjoyment and reciprocity, which could be viewed as establishing a baseline KS behavior. We use the assurance game framework to incubate the two utility functions. Finally, we argue that KS intention is actually a dynamic state within a KS strategy. We identify five KS strategies: cooperation, defection, tit-for-tat, unforgiving, and random. It is the performance of these strategies that needs to be studied. Several scenarios are simulated to observe the progression of knowledge within each strategy. Interestingly, two strategies start with positive KS intention yet end up converging with those who started with negative KS intention. On the long run, only cooperatives seem to be contributing to collective knowledge. Empirical data from a teaching hospital is collected and analyzed for comparison.","Al-Gharaibeh, Rami S.; Ali, Mostafa Z.",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847298/,154

Objective characterization of the acute neurological damage in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 has not yet been reported. METHOD: We performed a prospective observational study of plasma brain biomarkers in critically ill patients with respiratory failure that were diagnosed with (COVID‐19) or without (ICU control) COVID‐19. Demographics, co‐morbidities, daily clinical physiologic and laboratory data were collected. Plasma samples were drawn for measurement of neurofilament‐light chain (NF‐L), total tau (t‐tau), ubiquitin carboxy‐terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH‐L1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The primary neurological outcome was delirium as defined by the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC, scale 1 ‐ 8). Associations between brain biomarkers and markers of respiratory failure of COVID‐19 were analyzed. RESULT: 27 patients with COVID‐19 and 19 ICU controls were enrolled. The concentration of plasma GFAP, UCH‐L1 and NF‐L levels was higher in both groups compared to healthy controls. Compared to ICU controls, patients with COVID‐19 had significantly higher GFAP (272 [150‐555] pg/ml vs 118 [78.5‐168] pg/ml, p=0.0009). In patients with COVID‐19, GFAP (rho=0.5115, p=0.0064), UCH‐L1 (rho=0.4056, p=0.0358) and NF‐L (rho=0.6223, p=0.0005) were positively correlated with the ICDSC score and were higher in patients diagnosed with delirium (ICDSC ≥4) in the COVID‐19 group but not ICU controls. There were no associations between PaO2/FiO2 or diagnosis of ARDS and plasma concentration of GFAP, t‐tau, UCH‐L1, or NF‐L in patients with COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Plasma GFAP is 2‐fold higher in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 compared to ICU controls, and higher concentrations of GFAP, UCH‐L1 and NF‐L are associated with delirium specifically in patients with COVID‐19.","Cooper, Jennifer; Stukas, Sophie K; Hoiland, Ryan; Thiara, Sonny; Foster, Denise; Mitra, Anish; Panenka, William J; Sekhon, Mypinder S; Wellington, Cheryl L",Alzheimers Dement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883192/,154

47959,92 Acetaminophen-Induced Renal Tubular Injury With Concurrent Hepatotoxicity: A Case Report,2021-03-19,"In this work we introduce a new Bounding-Box Free Network (BBFNet) for panoptic segmentation. Panoptic segmentation is an ideal problem for proposal-free methods as it already requires per-pixel semantic class labels. We use this observation to exploit class boundaries from off-the-shelf semantic segmentation networks and refine them to predict instance labels. Towards this goal BBFNet predicts coarse watershed levels and uses them to detect large instance candidates where boundaries are well defined. For smaller instances, whose boundaries are less reliable, BBFNet also predicts instance centers by means of Hough voting followed by mean-shift to reliably detect small objects. A novel triplet loss network helps merging fragmented instances while refining boundary pixels. Our approach is distinct from previous works in panoptic segmentation that rely on a combination of a semantic segmentation network with a computationally costly instance segmentation network based on bounding box proposals, such as Mask R-CNN, to guide the prediction of instance labels using a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) approach. We benchmark our proposal-free method on Cityscapes and Microsoft COCO datasets and show competitive performance with other MoE based approaches while outperforming existing non-proposal based methods on the COCO dataset. We show the flexibility of our method using different semantic segmentation backbones and provide video results on challenging scenes in the wild in the supplementary material.

We retrospectively analyzed participants who were engaged in ACP consultations from January 2019 to January 2020. The characteristics, motivations, content, and satisfaction of participants are reported. Factors associated with refusing life-sustaining treatments (LST) or artificial nutrition/hydration (ANH) were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Of the 178 participants, 123 completed the ACP. The majority were female (64.2%), aged 61 on average and more than 80% had never signed a do-not-resuscitate order.

Weaknesses of current vaccines include low effectiveness against mismatched strains, lack of mucosal and other effective tissue-resident immune responses, weak cellular immune responses, and insufficiently durable immune responses. The safety and immunogenicity of NasoVAX, a monovalent intranasal influenza vaccine based on a replication-deficient adenovirus type 5 platform, were evaluated in a placebo-controlled single ascending-dose study. Sixty healthy adults (18–49 years) received a single intranasal dose of 1×10(9) viral particles (vp), 1 × 10(10) vp, or 1 × 10(11) vp of NasoVAX or placebo. NasoVAX was well-tolerated and elicited robust influenza-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses. The highest NasoVAX dose and the approved Fluzone(®) influenza vaccine elicited comparable hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (152.8 vs. 293.4) and microneutralization (MN) geometric mean titers (142.5 vs. 162.8), with NasoVAX HAI titers maintained more than 1-year on average following a single dose. Hemagglutinin-specific T cells responses were also documented in peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations. Consistent with the intranasal route of administration, NasoVAX elicited antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in the nasopharyngeal cavity with an increase of approximately 2-fold over baseline GMT at the mid- and high-doses. In summary, NasoVAX appeared safe and elicited a broad immune response, including humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity, with no impact of baseline anti-adenovirus antibody at the most immunogenic dose.","Tasker, Sybil; Wight O’Rourke, Anna; Suyundikov, Anvar; Jackson Booth, Peta-Gay; Bart, Stephan; Krishnan, Vyjayanthi; Zhang, Jianfeng; Anderson, Katie J.; Georges, Bertrand; Roberts, M.

However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID) pandemic has changed surgical practice. New practices in the COVID era have changed the rate of negative appendicectomies. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients admitted with appendicitis from March 2020 to June 2020. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS: 58 patients were identified, 43 (74%) were adults and 15 (26%) were children. The median age of the adults was 33 (range 18-80) and the median American Society of Anaesthetists (ASA) grading was 1. The median age of children was 11 (range 4-17) and all were ASA grade 1. RESULTS: 73.8% (31) of adult patients had a Computerised Tomography (CT) scan as part of their workup. 40% of paediatric patients underwent an ultrasound scan of the abdomen whilst the remaining 60% were diagnosed clinically. The open approach was favoured in both cohorts (39.5% and 46.7% respectively). No negative appendicectomies were performed. CONCLUSION: COVID19 has changed practice resulting in better outcomes for colorectal units. Further studies (COVID SURG and COVID HAREM) are needed to fully assess the role of imaging in reducing the number of negative appendicectomies.","Fernando, Sherwin; Sarma, Diwakar Ryali; Fernando, Sherwin",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030131/,154

The gravity model of international trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative, revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration.","Saeed, Naima; Cullinane, Kevin; Gekara, Victor; Chhetri, Prem",Marit Econ Logist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8103428/,154

METHODS: We included participants from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application enrolled in March 2020 from the UK and the US who provided information about their sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 at baseline, and subsequently reported any symptoms they were experiencing over follow-up. We administered a supplementary diet and lifestyle survey between August and September 2020 to ascertain diet quality before the pandemic using a validated 35-item short food frequency questionnaire. We defined incident predicted cases of COVID-19 over follow-up using a validated symptom-based model and a severe case of COVID-19 as a report of hospitalization with requirement of oxygen support. We used Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for predicted COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 after adjusting for potential sociodemographic and behavioral confounders. RESULTS: Over 4,044,344 person-months of follow-up, we recorded 33,360 incident COVID-19 cases. Compared with individuals in the lowest quartile of the diet quality score, high diet quality was associated with a reduced risk of predicted COVID-19 (adjusted HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.97) and reduced risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99). We found evidence of significant interactions between diet quality and socioeconomic status on COVID-19 risk, in which the attributable risk proportion of the joint effect due to the interaction was 30% (95% CI 2.8 to 57.2). Among participants with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation, COVID-19 incidence rate per 1,000 person-months was 7.5% for those with low diet quality (95% CI 7.1 to 7.8) compared with 5.5% for those with a high diet quality (95% CI 5.2 to 5.9). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that adherence to a healthy diet is associated with lower risk of COVID-19 infection and severity. The apparent beneficial association of a high-quality diet may be particularly evident among individuals with a higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation.

METHODS: A total of 455 students, aged 18–23, from two residential colleges in the midwestern United States participated in the study during April 2021. An online questionnaire that included the National Cancer Institute Dietary Screener, State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety, and an adapted version of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire was used. Stepwise multiple regression analyses was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The mean score for GI symptoms was 5.57 ± 5.25. Moderate to severe symptoms of abdominal bloating (31.8%), nausea (16.2%), passing gas (29.1%), abdominal rumbling (28.1%), abdominal cramping (20.4%), diarrhea (18.8%), and constipation (14.7%) were reported by our participants. High rates of State-somatic, State-cognitive, and Trait-somatic anxiety were present in our study population.

The risk is heightened among NHR for several reasons, including unhealthy body composition and poor nutrition. Previously, we showed high prevalence of osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA; concomitant osteoporosis, sarcopenia and adiposity) in NRH. Objective of this study was to assess body composition and dietary intake of NHR in one Croatian nursing home. METHODS: Participants, n = 84 (81.2 ± 6.8 y), were 82.1% females. Body composition, assessed with bio-impedance, BIA-ACC (BioTekna®, Marcon, Italy), yielded fat, lean/muscle tissue and volumetric bone mineral density (BMD g/cm(3)). Dietary intake, estimated via 24-hour recall, was analyzed with “Nutrition” (Infosistem, d.d., Croatia). All NHR signed the informed consent. RESULTS: Both women and men were overweight with corresponding BMI of 29.6 ± 5.2 and 27.2 ± 3.2 kg/m(2) (P = 0.027). Women, compared to men, had higher body fat (42.1 ± 5.9% vs. 36.6 ± 5.4%; ranking as obese), but lower skeletal muscle (11.3 ± 3.3 kg vs. 17.3 ± 3.1 kg). The respective BMD (1.006 ± 0.012 vs. 1.018 ± 0.012 g/cm3) was also low (all P ≤ 0.001) influencing high OSA prevalence (>50%). There was no difference in energy and macronutrient intake between women and men. Protein (0.71 and 0.68 g/kg for women and men) and fiber (∼16 g/day) were below recommendation. Fat intake was ∼35% of energy, with high saturated fatty acids (∼14%); cholesterol was within recommendations. Most of the minerals (calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron) were below, while sodium and phosphorus were above recommendations for both women and men. About 42% women were taking vitamin supplements which increased the average intake above recommendations except for vitamin A. Men were below recommendations for all vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: High body fat and low muscle and bone mass leading to high prevalence of OSA, as well as poor dietary intake placed these NHR at higher risk for COVID-19.

During August–October 2020, the veterinary clinic on the Caribbean island of Nevis reported 64 household dogs with CPV-2-like clinical signs (hemorrhagic/non-hemorrhagic diarrhea and vomiting), of which 27 animals died. Rectal swabs/fecal samples were obtained from 43 dogs. A total of 39 of the 43 dogs tested positive for CPV-2 antigen and/or DNA, while 4 samples, negative for CPV-2 antigen, were not available for PCR. Among the 21 untested dogs, 15 had CPV-2 positive littermates. Analysis of the complete VP2 sequences of 32 strains identified new CPV-2a (CPV-2a with Ser297Ala in VP2) as the predominant CPV-2 on Nevis Island. Two nonsynonymous mutations, one rare (Asp373Asn) and the other uncommon (Ala262Thr), were observed in a few VP2 sequences. It was intriguing that new CPV-2a was associated with an outbreak of gastroenteritis on Nevis while found at low frequencies in sporadic cases of diarrhea on the neighboring island of St. Kitts. The nearly complete CPV-2 genomes (4 CPV-2 strains from St. Kitts and Nevis (SKN)) were reported for the first time from the Caribbean region. Eleven substitutions were found among the SKN genomes, which included nine synonymous substitutions, five of which have been rarely reported, and the two nonsynonymous substitutions. Phylogenetically, the SKN CPV-2 sequences formed a distinct cluster, with CPV-2b/USA/1998 strains constituting the nearest cluster. Our findings suggested that new CPV-2a is endemic in the region, with the potential to cause severe outbreaks, warranting further studies across the Caribbean Islands. Analysis of the SKN CPV-2 genomes corroborated the hypothesis that recurrent parallel evolution and reversion might play important roles in the evolution of CPV-2.","Gainor, Kerry; Bowen, April; Bolfa, Pompei; Peda, Andrea; Malik, Yashpal S.; Ghosh, Souvik",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227521/,154

Discerning when desaturation and resultant hypoxemia correlates to tissue hypoxia is challenging in the perioperative setting and requires a thorough understanding of the physiology of oxygen delivery and tissue utilization. RECENT FINDINGS: Oxygen delivery is not directly correlated with peripheral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing one-lung ventilation, emphasizing the importance of hemoglobin concentration and cardiac output in avoiding tissue hypoxia. While healthy humans can tolerate acute hypoxemia without long-term consequences, there is a paucity of evidence from patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Increasingly recognized is the potential harm of hyperoxic states, particularly in the setting of complex patients with comorbid diseases. SUMMARY: Anesthesiologists are left to determine an acceptable oxygen saturation nadir that is individualized to the patient and procedure based on an understanding of oxygen supply, demand, and the consequences of interventions.","Durkin, Chris; Romano, Kali; Egan, Sinead; Lohser, Jens",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8263011/,154

57435,Dimethyl fumarate: COVID-19 respiratory infection and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: case report,2021-09-04,"Migration and remittances have always been an exciting arena of research for economists around the globe. Remittance flows have evolved as a significant economic variable over the past decade. In several developing countries, remittances exceed the other capital inflows and value of total exports. Thus, it is widely recognised as a potential funding source for economic development in emerging economies. The inflow of remittances to India has increased tremendously in the recent past making the country the highest recipient of remittances across the globe. Remittances are an essential component that contributes to narrowing the Current Account Deficit and has always been a stable constituent of the Balance of Payment. This paper is an attempt to explore the vital macroeconomic variables which determine the remittance flows to India. Notably, we enquire into the dominant motives of remittances in the Indian context. We employ an ARDL approach to cointegration to identify the macroeconomic determinants of remittances and find those crucial variables such as exchange rate, oil price, and domestic GDP substantially impact the flow of remittances. The results also indicate that the migrants are more vulnerable to the oil price shocks in host countries. The overall findings of our study are that (1) remittances are not countercyclical in the Indian context (2) remittances are subject to weak investment motive as opposed to the altruistic motive.","Jijin, P.; Mishra, Alok Kumar; Nithin, M.",Econ Change Restruct,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8409263/,154

In particular, the growing interest in preclinical evaluation of anti-angiogenic agents alone or in combination with other drugs requires a complete understanding of the associated physiological consequences. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Technescan™ PYP™, a clinically utilized radiopharmaceutical, was used to measure tissue vascular volumes in beige nude mice that were naïve or administered a single intravenous bolus dose of a murine anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody (10 mg/kg) 24 h prior to assay. Anti-VEGF had no significant effect (p>0.05) on the fractional vascular volumes of any tissues studied; these findings were further supported by single photon emission computed tomographic imaging. In addition, apart from a borderline significant increase (p = 0.048) in mean hepatic blood flow, no significant anti-VEGF-induced differences were observed (p>0.05) in two additional physiological parameters, interstitial fluid volume and the organ blood flow rate, measured using indium-111-pentetate and rubidium-86 chloride, respectively. Areas under the concentration-time curves generated by a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model changed substantially (>25%) in several tissues when model parameters describing compartmental volumes and blood flow rates were switched from literature to our experimentally derived values. However, negligible changes in predicted tissue exposure were observed when comparing simulations based on parameters measured in naïve versus anti-VEGF-administered mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These observations may foster an enhanced understanding of anti-VEGF effects in murine tissues and, in particular, may be useful in modeling antibody uptake alone or in combination with anti-VEGF.","Boswell, C Andrew; Ferl, Gregory Z; Mundo, Eduardo E; Bumbaca, Daniela; Schweiger, Michelle G; Theil, Frank-Peter; Fielder, Paul J; Khawli, Leslie A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436893/,154

In the studied group, 16 procedures of percutaneous translumbar catheterization were performed. Complications connected with the presence of catheter, such as hematoma, thrombosis, infection, catheter movement or unsuccessful catheterization, were analyzed. Moreover, another aspect of our report was to evaluate the adequacy of HD treatment performed by lumbar catheter. RESULTS The total time of translumbar catheter observation was 4,169 days. Average time of their functioning was 261 days. The most frequent reason for termination of the use of translumbar HD catheters was spontaneous/idiopathic removal - 2 cases. Episodes of infection and thrombosis per 1,000 days of catheter observation were 2.2 and 1.2, respectively.

THE ISSUES Referencing the Australian context, the current article considers some of the study's reported hospital administrative and coded data categories within the context of Australian hospitals' health information management practices. It highlights potential risks associated with the collection and interpretation of 'big' health data. IMPLICATIONS This article identifies pitfalls that confront researchers undertaking multi-country studies and the need to consider country-specific: (i) collected administrative data items; (ii) health information-related ethical, legal and management policy constraints on the use of confidential hospital records and derived data; and (iii) differences in health classification systems and versions used in the coding of diagnoses and related procedures, interventions and health behaviours.

62940,A novel approach in retrieving retained pulmonary bullet injury.,2019,"Horses with inflammatory and infectious disorders are often treated with injectable heparin anticoagulants to prevent thrombotic complications. In humans, a new class of direct oral acting anticoagulants (DOAC) appear as effective as heparin, while eliminating the need for daily injections. Our study in horses evaluated apixaban, a newly approved DOAC for human thromboprophylaxis targeting activated factor X (Xa). Our goals were to: (1) Determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban after oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) administration in horses; (2) Detect any inhibitory effects of apixaban on ex vivo Equid herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)-induced platelet activation, and (3) Compare an anti-Xa bioactivity assay with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) for measuring apixaban concentrations. In a blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study, five horses received a single dose (0.2 mg/kg) of apixaban or placebo PO or IV. Blood was collected before and at 3 (IV) or 15 (PO) min, 30 and 45 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after dosing for measuring apixaban UPLC-MS concentrations and anti-Xa activity. Pharmacodynamic response was measured in a dilute prothrombin time (dPT) assay. Flow cytometric EHV-1-induced platelet P-selectin expression and clinical pathologic safety testing were performed at baseline, 2 and 24 h and baseline and 24 h, respectively. We found no detectable apixaban in plasma PO administration. After IV administration, plasma apixaban levels followed a two-compartment model, with concentrations peaking at 3 min and decreasing to undetectable levels by 8 h. The elimination half-life was 1.3 ± 0.2 h, with high protein binding (92-99%). The dPT showed no relationship to apixaban UPLC-MS concentration and apixaban did not inhibit EHV-1-induced platelet activation after IV dosing. Apixaban anti-Xa activity showed excellent correlation to UPLC-MS (r 2 = 0.9997). Our results demonstrate that apixaban has no apparent clinical utility as an anticoagulant for horses due to poor oral availability.","Serpa, Priscila B S; Brooks, Marjory B; Divers, Thomas; Ness, Sally; Birschmann, Ingvild; Papich, Mark G; Stokol, Tracy",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564584/,154

The ability of tracheal palpation was the single criteria to perform PCT. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. METHODS A retrospective study analyzing adult PCTs performed by otolaryngologists at 2011-2012 were reviewed. All PCTs were performed using the Ciaglia blue-rhino-tracheostomy kit and Shiley's tracheostomy cannulas. Most procedures were performed with the same anesthesiologist. RESULTS A total of 60 PCTs were identified with subject ages 18-91. None were converted to open tracheostomy. No bronchoscopic guidance was used. PCT was performed for the following CI: two bleeding disorder, four goiters, four cervical rigidity (surgical, traumatical and constitutional), five emergent tracheostomies, one head and neck cancer and nine short necks. Complications recorded were one wound bleeding and one pneumomediastinum both controlled locally. Pertinent anatomy revealed that the intubation tube was withdrawn to the level of 14 cm and 16 cm from incisor level in women and men respectively. CONCLUSIONS PCT is a safe procedure. When performed by an otolaryngologist, even the relative CI can be overcome. Tracheal palpation and experienced anesthesiologist are mandatory for the procedure's success. The otolaryngologists' advantage is a better anatomical understanding with the ability to convert the procedure to a formal tracheostomy as needed and avoidance of hypercarbia due to a bronchoscope use.

65153,The dietary practices and beliefs of British South Asian people living with inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter study from the United Kingdom.,2021-01-06,"INTRODUCTION Bile duct injury (BDI) remains the dreaded complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) over the last two decades. Although the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) certification is now required for new applicants by the American Board of Surgery, the impact of FLS on procedure-specific outcomes is unknown. Moreover, the FLS content centers on fundamental education and not procedure-specific complication reduction such as BDI, magnifying the importance of understanding the educational impact of FLS on specific case types. This study reviewed the impact of FLS certification and other factors on the incidence of bile duct injury in a large insurance claims database. METHODS In total, 53,632 LCs were reviewed from July 2009 to December 2010 from a large private payer claims database. Surgeon National Provider Identifier (NPI), FLS certification status, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) were available for each event. Each record was analyzed for evidence of any bile duct injury based on associated CPT or ICD-9 data in the claim record. Characteristics of the FLS+ and FLS- surgeon groups were analyzed by a separate reviewer blinded to clinical outcome on a large scale. RESULTS A total of 53,632 LCs were reviewed; 1748 LC were performed by 441 FLS+ surgeons; and 58,870 LCs by 10,851 FLS- surgeons. (Some procedures involved more than one surgeon). Eighty-two BDIs were identified: 8 in the FLS+ and 74 in the FLS- group. The FLS+ group had a higher rate of BDI than the FLS- group (0.47 vs. 0.14 %, p = 0.0013); however, the FLS+ group was also younger (mean age 38.2 FLS+ vs. 50.4 years) and had significantly fewer years in practice (FLS+ = 6.1 vs. FLS- = 20.7, p = 0.0012). No other complications showed differences between the groups. CONCLUSION NPI can be used as a linking intermediary between skills certification and outcomes on claims databases. FLS certification was not associated with a reduction in bile duct injury in this analysis, but FLS+ surgeons were also younger and less experienced overall. Since FLS lacks content specific to BDI, large-scale validated training and assessment programs targeted at BDI prevention are needed to impact the rate of this complication during cholecystectomy.","Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Scott, Daniel J; Jones, Daniel B; McKinley, Sophia K; Castrillion, Johanna; Hunter, Tina D; Michael Brunt, L",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3580-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902815/,154

To evaluate molecular affinities between antiviral drug candidates and SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins such as spike protein (S) and main protease (Mpro ), a molecular interaction simulation was performed using MD software and subsequently the applicability score was calculated by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the STITCH algorithm was used to predict the pharmacology network involving multiple pathways of active drug candidate(s). Pharmacophores feature of active drug(s) molecules was also determined to predict structure activity relationship. The molecular interaction analysis showed that cordycepin has strong binding affinities with S protein (-180) and Mpro proteins (-205) which were relatively highest among other drug candidates used. Interestingly, compounds with low IC50 showed high binding energy. Furthermore, machine learning algorithm also revealed high applicability scores (0.42-0.47) of cordycepin. It is worth mentioning that the pharmacology network depicted the involvement of cordycepin in different pathways associated with bacterial and viral diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, influenza A, viral myocarditis and herpes simplex infection. The embedded pharmacophore features with cordycepin also suggested strong structure-activity relationship (SAR). Cordycepin's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity indicated 65% (E-gene) and 42% (N-gene) viral replication inhibition after 48h of treatment. Since cordycepin has both pre-clinical and clinical evidence on antiviral activity, in addition the present findings further validate and suggest repurposing potential of cordycepin against COVID-19.","Verma, Akalesh K; Aggarwal, Rohit",Chemical biology & drug design,https://doi.org/10.1111/cbdd.13812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33289334/,154

65572,Can multiple-dose activated charcoal induce elevation in blood lactate concentration? A case report.,2020-11-27,"BACKGROUND Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are laboratory-produced molecules derived from the B cells of an infected host. They are being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs for treating patients with COVID-19, compared to an active comparator, placebo, or no intervention. To maintain the currency of the evidence, we will use a living systematic review approach. A secondary objective is to track newly developed SARS-CoV-2-targeting mAbs from first tests in humans onwards. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and three other databases on 17 June 2021. We also checked references, searched citations, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Between submission and publication, we conducted a shortened randomised controlled trial (RCT)-only search on 30 July 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that evaluated SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs, alone or combined, compared to an active comparator, placebo, or no intervention, to treat people with COVID-19. We excluded studies on prophylactic use of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2). Prioritised outcomes were all-cause mortality by days 30 and 60, clinical progression, quality of life, admission to hospital, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We identified six RCTs that provided results from 17,495 participants with planned completion dates between July 2021 and December 2031. Target sample sizes varied from 1020 to 10,000 participants. Average age was 42 to 53 years across four studies of non-hospitalised participants, and 61 years in two studies of hospitalised participants. Non-hospitalised individuals with COVID-19 Four studies evaluated single agents bamlanivimab (N = 465), sotrovimab (N = 868), regdanvimab (N = 307), and combinations of bamlanivimab/etesevimab (N = 1035), and casirivimab/imdevimab (N = 799). We did not identify data for mortality at 60 days or quality of life. Our certainty of the evidence is low for all outcomes due to too few events (very serious imprecision). Bamlanivimab compared to placebo No deaths occurred in the study by day 29. There were nine people admitted to hospital by day 29 out of 156 in the placebo group compared with one out of 101 in the group treated with 0.7 g bamlanivimab (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.33), 2 from 107 in the group treated with 2.8 g (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.47) and 2 from 101 in the group treated with 7.0 g (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.56). Treatment with 0.7 g, 2.8 g and 7.0 g bamlanivimab may have similar rates of AEs as placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.50; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.38; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.27). The effect on SAEs is uncertain. Clinical progression/improvement of symptoms or development of severe symptoms were not reported. Bamlanivimab/etesevimab compared to placebo There were 10 deaths in the placebo group and none in bamlanivimab/etesevimab group by day 30 (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81). Bamlanivimab/etesevimab may decrease hospital admission by day 29 (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), may result in a slight increase in any grade AEs (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.59) and may increase SAEs (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.37). Clinical progression/improvement of symptoms or development of severe symptoms were not reported. Casirivimab/imdevimab compared to placebo Casirivimab/imdevimab may reduce hospital admissions or death (2.4 g: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.19; 8.0 g: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.79). We are uncertain of the effect on grades 3-4 AEs (2.4 g: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.37; 8.0 g: RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.73) and SAEs (2.4 g: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.37; 8.0 g: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.65). Mortality by day 30 and clinical progression/improvement of symptoms or development of severe symptoms were not reported. Sotrovimab compared to placebo We are uncertain whether sotrovimab has an effect on mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.18) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) requirement or death (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.76). Treatment with sotrovimab may reduce the number of participants with oxygen requirement (RR 0.11, 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.45), hospital admission or death by day 30 (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.48), grades 3-4 AEs (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.60), SAEs (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63) and may have little or no effect on any grade AEs (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.16). Regdanvimab compared to placebo Treatment with either dose (40 or 80 mg/kg) compared with placebo may decrease hospital admissions or death (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.42; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60, 206 participants), but may increase grades 3-4 AEs (RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 13.12; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.70). 80 mg/kg may reduce any grade AEs (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22) but 40 mg/kg may have little to no effect (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.43). There were too few events to allow meaningful judgment for the outcomes mortality by 30 days, IMV requirement, and SAEs. Hospitalised individuals with COVID-19 Two studies evaluating bamlanivimab as a single agent (N = 314) and casirivimab/imdevimab as a combination therapy (N = 9785) were included. Bamlanivimab compared to placebo We are uncertain whether bamlanivimab has an effect on mortality by day 30 (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83) and SAEs by day 28 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.14). Bamlanivimab may have little to no effect on time to hospital discharge (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.20) and mortality by day 90 (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.43). The effect of bamlanivimab on the development of severe symptoms at day 5 (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.85) is uncertain. Bamlanivimab may increase grades 3-4 AEs at day 28 (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.98). We assessed the evidence as low certainty for all outcomes due to serious imprecision, and very low certainty for severe symptoms because of additional concerns about indirectness. Casirivimab/imdevimab with usual care compared to usual care alone Treatment with casirivimab/imdevimab compared to usual care probably has little or no effect on mortality by day 30 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.02), IMV requirement or death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04), nor alive at hospital discharge by day 30 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04). We assessed the evidence as moderate certainty due to study limitations (lack of blinding). AEs and SAEs were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for each comparison is based on single studies. None of these measured quality of life. Our certainty in the evidence for all non-hospitalised individuals is low, and for hospitalised individuals is very low to moderate. We consider the current evidence insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions regarding treatment with SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs. Further studies and long-term data from the existing studies are needed to confirm or refute these initial findings, and to understand how the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may impact the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs. Publication of the 36 ongoing studies may resolve uncertainties about the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising mAbs for the treatment of COVID-19 and possible subgroup differences.","Kreuzberger, Nina; Hirsch, Caroline; Chai, Khai Li; Tomlinson, Eve; Khosravi, Zahra; Popp, Maria; Neidhardt, Miriam; Piechotta, Vanessa; Salomon, Susanne; Valk, Sarah J; Monsef, Ina; Schmaderer, Christoph; Wood, Erica M; So-Osman, Cynthia; Roberts, David J; McQuilten, Zoe; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013825.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473343/,154

In addition to the primary threat of infection, widespread secondary stressors associated with the pandemic have included social isolation, financial insecurity, resource scarcity, and occupational difficulties. OBJECTIVE The current study examined the impact of these disruptions on psychological distress during the initial adjustment phase to the pandemic in North America. METHOD A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. RESULTS Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION Findings from the present study can help to identify key groups at risk for mental health problems during the pandemic, and indicate actionable areas for targeted intervention.","Zheng, Jason; Morstead, Talia; Sin, Nancy; Klaiber, Patrick; Umberson, Debra; Kamble, Shanmukh; DeLongis, Anita",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465600/,154
65862,A family case of COVID-19 pneumonia with different chest CT features and duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding: a case report from Japan.,2021-03-31,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer has low rates of morbidity and mortality and achieves comparable pathologic outcomes. With improved instruments and surgical techniques, many surgeons have recently begun using single-access laparoscopic surgery (SALS) to minimize scars and pain. Since 2011, most reports of SALS for rectal cancer have shown comparable pathologic outcomes to those of conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS). However, SALS is said to be superior to CLS in reducing complications, producing less discomfort, and faster recovery rates. This study aimed to compare the technical feasibility and early postoperative outcomes of these approaches. METHODS From January 2011 to January 2014, 78 cases of adenocarcinoma of the rectum and anal canal were enrolled in the study. Anterior, low anterior, intersphincteric, and abdominoperineal resections were performed. Data collected included technical feasibility and outcomes of operation, such as morbidity, mortality, severity of pain, analgesic usage, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS SALS was performed on 35 patients, and CLS was performed in 36 cases. Demographic data, including age, sex, BMI, ASA classification and clinical staging, were similar between the groups. Operative time, blood loss, and conversion rate were similar (P > 0.05). Postoperatively, the only significant difference between the groups was pain score, which was significantly lower in the SALS group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION SALS and CLS for rectal and anal cancer had the same intraoperative, pathologic, and early postoperative results. However, SALS patients had slightly better pain scores in the first 24 and 48 h postoperatively.","Sirikurnpiboon, Siripong",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26565739/,154
65885,Fracture of a femoral hemodialysis catheter during placement in a man with metastatic cancer.,2018,"Efficient immune responses against viral infection are determined by sufficient activation of nucleic acid sensor-mediated innate immunity1,2. Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains an ongoing global pandemic. It is an urgent challenge to clarify the innate recognition mechanism to control this virus. Here we show that retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) sufficiently restrains SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells in a type I/III interferon (IFN)-independent manner. RIG-I recognizes the 3' untranslated region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome via the helicase domains, but not the C-terminal domain. This new mode of RIG-I recognition does not stimulate its ATPase, thereby aborting the activation of the conventional mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein-dependent pathways, which is in accordance with lack of cytokine induction. Nevertheless, the interaction of RIG-I with the viral genome directly abrogates viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediation of the first step of replication. Consistently, genetic ablation of RIG-I allows lung cells to produce viral particles that expressed the viral spike protein. By contrast, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was restored by all-trans retinoic acid treatment through upregulation of RIG-I protein expression in primary lung cells derived from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, our findings demonstrate the distinctive role of RIG-I as a restraining factor in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells.","Yamada, Taisho; Sato, Seiichi; Sotoyama, Yuki; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Yamauchi, Hajime; Sasaki, Michihito; Takaoka, Akinori",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-021-00942-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976430/,154
66126,Extraction of a Micra Transcatheter Pacing System: First-in-human experience.,2016,"OBJECTIVE We introduce a technique that uses intraoperative flat-panel detector computed tomography (FD-CT) and three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) acquired in the hybrid operative suite to provide full neuronavigation capabilities during cerebrovascular surgery without the use of preoperative imaging studies. METHODS An Artis Zeego FD system (Siemens AG, Forchheim, Germany), mounted on a robotic C-arm was used during the clipping of an aneurysm to acquire intraoperative FD-CT and 3D-RA images. These images were then fused via the use of BrainLab iPlan 3.0 software and sent to a Vector Vision Sky neuronavigation system (NNS; BrainLAB, Heimstetten, Germany) to provide intraoperative image guidance. RESULTS The use of intraoperative FD-CT and 3D-RA with a NNS allowed for accurate visualization of the vascular anatomy and localization of pathology. In a case of a patient harboring two aneurysms, one that was surgically clipped and a second that was treated endovascularly, the 3D-RA clearly showed neck remnants at both aneurysms. Use of the NNS assisted in further clip placement for obliteration of these neck remnants. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid operating suites equipped with FD-CT, 3D-RA, and NNS capabilities can be used to provide intraoperative 3D image guidance during cerebrovascular surgery with excellent accuracy and without the need for preoperative angiography. Furthermore, this technique required less than 15 minutes for image acquisition and utilizes digitally subtracted angiographic images that are superior to conventional CT or MRI for the imaging of cerebrovascular pathology.","Leng, Lewis Z; Rubin, David G; Patsalides, Athos; Riina, Howard A",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2011.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22120274/,154

In the present study, a tandemly arranged multiepitope peptide (named SEMN) was designed with four antigenic regions derived from four major structural proteins of IBV. Then, we performed codon optimization of SEMN gene by changing the codon-adaptation index from 0.45 to 0.94 and expressed the optimized gene in codon bias-adjusted Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3), followed by determination of the immunoreactivity of the purified protein. Bioinformatics analysis of SEMN showed a high antigenicity, surface probability and hydrophilicity. The recombinant protein rSEMN was expressed both in soluble forms and as inclusion bodies, and the molecular weight of rSEMN was about 39 kDa. The preliminary diagnostic performance of rSEMN was confirmed by Western blotting analysis using chicken anti-IBV polyclonal antibodies. Further studies are needed to evaluate the immunogenicity in animal models and to give a final assessment of the diagnostic utility of this recombinant multi-epitope antigen.","Liu, Qing; Li, Jin; Li, Run-Li; Ma, Ye-Ting; Zhou, Peng-Lai; Gao, Wen-Wei; Ma, Hai-Li",3 Biotech,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-2079-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32089981/,154
68847,General anesthesia of a Japanese infant with Barber-Say syndrome: a case report.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Temporary epicardial pacing wires (TEPW) are used in the immediate postoperative cardiac surgery period for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of acute arrhythmias. They are usually removed before discharge, but are sometimes clipped and left to retract into the skin and are thus retained. Rare complications from these retained wires have been documented in numerous case reports. We describe a case of a 57-year-old man with chronically draining wounds due to infected retained pacing wires. This case prompted a systematic review of these patients to delineate complications and to create a novel treatment algorithm. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases and retrieved relevant, English-language articles published between 1986 and 2018. Two reviewers critically appraised the studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS Thirty-one articles met inclusion criteria with a total of 35 patients included. The existing articles represent either level IV or level V evidence. Mean ± SD time of presentation from initial TEPW placement was 4.9 ± 5.9 years, with a range of 1 month to 24 years and 77% of patients were symptomatic. The TEPW wire migration occurred in 74% of patients, with invasion into vasculature, visceral organs, and subcutaneous tissue. Most of the patients who underwent wire removal had complete recovery. The relevant literature suggests that there is a wide range of complications, and migration is more often associated with need for surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS In patients with severe symptoms or evidence of migration, surgical intervention and removal should be strongly considered to prevent potentially deadly complications. We propose an algorithm to minimize these complications based on a literature analysis in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.","Wald, Gal; Van, Y-Vu Robert; Pain, Kevin J; Otterburn, David M",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205495/,154

Mechanisms and processes outside student experience present particular challenges. While instruction typically involves visualizations, students usually explain in words. Because visual explanations can show parts and processes of complex systems directly, creating them should have benefits beyond creating verbal explanations. We compared learning from creating visual or verbal explanations for two STEM domains, a mechanical system (bicycle pump) and a chemical system (bonding). Both kinds of explanations were analyzed for content and learning assess by a post-test. For the mechanical system, creating a visual explanation increased understanding particularly for participants of low spatial ability. For the chemical system, creating both visual and verbal explanations improved learning without new teaching. Creating a visual explanation was superior and benefitted participants of both high and low spatial ability. Visual explanations often included crucial yet invisible features. The greater effectiveness of visual explanations appears attributable to the checks they provide for completeness and coherence as well as to their roles as platforms for inference. The benefits should generalize to other domains like the social sciences, history, and archeology where important information can be visualized. Together, the findings provide support for the use of learner-generated visual explanations as a powerful learning tool.","Bobek, Eliza; Tversky, Barbara",Cognitive research: principles and implications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-016-0031-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28180178/,154
70513,Endoscopic Gastrojejunostomy for Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome Using Magnetic Compression Anastomosis.,2019-12-01,"The coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are (deliberately) disregarded by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p < .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.","Plohl, Nejc; Musil, Bojan","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1772988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32479113/,154

However, the degree to which the methodology of clamp studies is standardised is unclear. This systematic review examines how hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamps have been performed and elucidates potential important differences. METHODS A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE was conducted. Articles in English published between 1980 and 2018, involving adults with or without diabetes, were included. RESULTS A total of 383 articles were included. There was considerable variation in essential methodology of the hypoglycaemic clamp procedures, including the insulin dose used (49-fold difference between the lowest and the highest rate), the number of hypoglycaemic steps (range 1-6), the hypoglycaemic nadirs (range 2.0-4.3 mmol/l) and the duration (ranging from 5 to 660 min). Twenty-seven per cent of the articles reported whole blood glucose levels, most venous levels. In 70.8% of the studies, a dorsal hand vein was used for blood sampling, with some form of hand warming to arterialise venous blood in 78.8% of these. Key information was missing in 61.9% of the articles. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION Although the hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp procedure is considered the gold standard to study experimental hypoglycaemia, a uniform standard with key elements on how to perform these experiments is lacking. Methodological differences should be considered when comparing results between hypoglycaemic clamp studies.

As with any surgical procedure, this too has a significant learning curve. The management of renal hilum is the most critical part of this surgery. It requires a meticulous intra-hilar dissection to identify the renal artery and vein. The kidneys are extremely vascular structures and any injury to these vessels during dissection can result in life-threatening bleeding. Hence, it is obvious that beginners most often face difficulty and apprehension at this step of the laparoscopic nephrectomy. We describe a simple technique of laparoscopic nephrectomy which includes the creation of two windows, one at the lower pole and the second at the upper pole, isolation of the hilum, and en bloc stapling of the renal hilar vessels. This method safeguards against collateral damage to the surrounding structures. It also avoids the need for intra-hilar dissection, hence decreasing the chances of vascular injuries.","Jindal, Tarun; Mukherjee, Satyadip; Koju, Rajan; S, Nitesh; Phom, Denchu",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34345564/,154

Nutrition is the most important factor determining human health and the functioning of all mechanisms to protect a person from negative environmental factors. For the prevention and treatment of new coronavirus infection COVID-19, a significant role is played by the correction of eating disorders, including vitamin and micronutrient deficiency. Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology, together with Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor), prepared Recommendations on nutrition for children and adults, requiring a self-isolation regime or quarantine at home in connection with COVID-19. In order to promptly inform and advise the population on nutrition optimization in the early days of anti-epidemic measures, an information reference Contact Center was created and is continuously functioning on the basis of the Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology. Equally important is the implementation of measures aimed at the prevention of food contamination with COVID-19 agent. In this regard, the Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology, together with Rospotrebnadzor prepared guidelines on measures to prevent the transmission of a new coronavirus infection through foods. Another aspect that the medical community has faced in connection with the pandemic is the need to reorient specialized medical organizations that have not previously worked with patients with infectious diseases in order to create Clinical centers for the treatment of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19.

Increased electronic data sharing among healthcare providers may be a barrier for clients of STI clinics where expectations of privacy and confidentiality are heightened. METHODS A survey to assess attitudes towards sharing of personal health information through a provincial EHR was conducted with a convenience sample of clients attending an STI clinic in Vancouver. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to examine the association between the primary outcome variable, whether a client would be less likely to take the test for an STI or HIV if their clinic records were made part of a provincial EHR, and independent variables of interest. RESULTS A total of 1004 clients completed the survey, and 31% stated that they would be less likely to get tested for STI/HIV if their records were made part of a provincial EHR. Participants who were more likely to agree that they might avoid testing had the expectation that no other clinician would review their chart (adjusted OR (AOR)=3.55), or expected their records would not be shared beyond the clinic (AOR=2.81). DISCUSSION While most participants thought an EHR was acceptable, a large minority expressed that they might avoid testing if their records were made part of a provincial EHR. The introduction of a provincial EHR should be considered with caution in STI healthcare settings to ensure that screening, case detection and treatment are not negatively impacted.","Pedersen, Heather; Taylor, Darlene; Gilbert, Mark; Achen, Melanie; Lester, Richard; Ogilvie, Gina",Sexually transmitted infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2014-051804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480149/,154

74408,Embolization is essential in the treatment of leg varicosities due to pelvic venous insufficiency.,2015,"OBJECT Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty for Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a common pediatric neurosurgery procedure. Published series report a complication rate ranging from 3% to 40% for this procedure. Historically, many dural substitutes have been used, including bovine grafts, human cadaveric pericardium, synthetic dura, and autologous pericranium. The authors hypothesized that a recently observed increase in complications was dependent on the graft used. METHODS Between January 2004 and January 2008, 114 consecutive patients ≤ 18 years old underwent primary CM-I decompression using duraplasty. Records were retrospectively reviewed for short- and intermediate-term complications and operative technique, focusing on the choice of duraplasty graft with or without application of a tissue sealant. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 8.6 years. The dural graft used was variable: 15 were treated with cadaveric pericardium, 12 with Durepair, and 87 with EnDura. Tisseel was used in 75 patients, DuraSeal in 12, and no tissue sealant was used in 27 patients. The overall complication rate was 21.1%. The most common complications included aseptic meningitis, symptomatic pseudomeningocele, or a CSF leak requiring reoperation. The overall complication rates were as follows: cadaveric pericardium 26.7%, Durepair 41.7%, and EnDura 17.2%; reoperation rates were 13%, 25%, and 8.1%, respectively. Prior to adopting a different graft product, the overall complication rate was 18.1%; following the change the rate increased to 35%. Complication rates for tissue sealants were 14.8% for no sealant, 18.7% for Tisseel, and 50% for DuraSeal. Nine patients were treated with the combination of Durepair and DuraSeal and this subgroup had a 56% complication rate. CONCLUSIONS Complication rates after CM-I decompression may be dependent on the dural graft with or without the addition of tissue sealant. The complication rate at the authors' institution approximately doubled following the adoption of a different graft product. Tissue sealants used in combination with a dural substitute to augment a duraplasty may increase the risk of aseptic meningitis and/or CSF leak. The mechanism of the apparent increased inflammation with this combination remains under investigation.","Parker, Stephen R; Harris, Peggy; Cummings, Thomas J; George, Timothy; Fuchs, Herbert; Grant, Gerald",Journal of neurosurgery.

74647,Acute dacryocystitis retention: a case report and literature review.,2021-09-10,"The significance of microbiology and immunology with regard to caries and periodontal disease gained substantial clinical or research consideration in the mid 1960's. This enhanced emphasis related to several simple but elegant experiments illustrating the relevance of bacteria to oral infections. Since that point, the understanding of oral diseases has become increasingly sophisticated and many of the original hypotheses related to disease causality have either been abandoned or amplified. The COVID pandemic has reminded us of the importance of history relative to infectious diseases and in the words of Churchill ""those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it."" This review is designed to present an overview of broad general directions of research over the last 60 years in oral microbiology and immunology, reviewing significant contributions, indicating emerging foci of interest, and proposing future directions based on technical advances and new understandings. Our goal is to review this rich history (standard microbiology and immunology) and point to potential directions in the future (omics) that can lead to a better understanding of disease. Over the years, research scientists have moved from a position of downplaying the role of bacteria in oral disease to one implicating bacteria as true pathogens that cause disease. More recently it has been proposed that bacteria form the ecological first line of defense against ""foreign"" invaders and also serve to train the immune system as an acquired host defensive stimulus. While early immunological research was focused on immunological exposure as a modulator of disease, the ""hygiene hypothesis,"" and now the ""old friends hypothesis"" suggest that the immune response could be trained by bacteria for long-term health. Advanced ""omics"" technologies are currently being used to address changes that occur in the host and the microbiome in oral disease. The ""omics"" methodologies have shaped the detection of quantifiable biomarkers to define human physiology and pathologies. In summary, this review will emphasize the role that commensals and pathobionts play in their interaction with the immune status of the host, with a prediction that current ""omic"" technologies will allow researchers to better understand disease in the future.","Cugini, Carla; Ramasubbu, Narayanan; Tsiagbe, Vincent K; Fine, Daniel H",Frontiers in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.617485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763040/,154

75439,Training in critical appraisal skills: Authors' reply.,2020-03-28,"Tuberculosis was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993. Following the declaration and the promotion in 1995 of directly observed treatment short course (DOTS), a cost-effective strategy to contain the tuberculosis epidemic, nearly 7 million lives have been saved compared with the pre-DOTS era, high cure rates have been achieved in most countries worldwide, and the global incidence of tuberculosis has been in a slow decline since the early 2000s. However, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, and more recently, totally drug-resistant tuberculosis pose a threat to global tuberculosis control. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a man-made problem. Laboratory facilities for drug susceptibility testing are inadequate in most tuberculosis-endemic countries, especially in Africa; thus diagnosis is missed, routine surveillance is not implemented, and the actual numbers of global drug-resistant tuberculosis cases have yet to be estimated. This exposes an ominous situation and reveals an urgent need for commitment by national programs to health system improvement because the response to MDR tuberculosis requires strong health services in general. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and XDR tuberculosis greatly complicate patient management within resource-poor national tuberculosis programs, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the cost of treatment to the extent that it could bankrupt healthcare financing in tuberculosis-endemic areas. Why, despite nearly 20 years of WHO-promoted activity and >12 years of MDR tuberculosis-specific activity, has the country response to the drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic been so ineffectual? The current dilemmas, unanswered questions, operational issues, challenges, and priority needs for global drug resistance screening and surveillance, improved treatment regimens, and management of outcomes and prevention of DR tuberculosis are discussed.","Zumla, Alimuddin; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Raviglione, Mario; Hoelscher, Michael; Ditiu, Lucica; McHugh, Timothy D; Squire, S Bertel; Cox, Helen; Ford, Nathan; McNerney, Ruth; Marais, Ben; Grobusch, Martin; Lawn, Stephen D; Migliori, Giovanni-Battista; Mwaba, Peter; O'Grady, Justin; Pletschette, Michel; Ramsay, Andrew; Chakaya, Jeremiah; Schito, Marco; Swaminathan, Soumya; Memish, Ziad; Maeurer, Markus; Atun, Rifat",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jir858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22476720/,154

Several clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of repurposed drugs that have demonstrated antiviral efficacy in vitro. Among these candidates, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been given to thousands of individuals worldwide but definitive evidence for HCQ efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 is still missing6,7,17,18. We evaluated the antiviral activity of HCQ both in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. HCQ showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells (VeroE6) but not in a model of reconstituted human airway epithelium. In macaques, we tested different treatment strategies in comparison to placebo, before and after peak viral load, alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZTH). Neither HCQ nor HCQ+AZTH showed a significant effect on the viral load levels in any of the tested compartments. When the drug was used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HCQ did not confer protection against acquisition of infection. Our findings do not support the use of HCQ, either alone or in combination with AZTH, as an antiviral treatment for COVID-19 in humans.","Maisonnasse, Pauline; Guedj, Jérémie; Contreras, Vanessa; Behillil, Sylvie; Solas, Caroline; Marlin, Romain; Naninck, Thibaut; Pizzorno, Andres; Lemaitre, Julien; Gonçalves, Antonio; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Terrier, Olivier; Fang, Raphael Ho Tsong; Enouf, Vincent; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Brisebarre, Angela; Touret, Franck; Chapon, Catherine; Hoen, Bruno; Lina, Bruno; Calatrava, Manuel Rosa; van der Werf, Sylvie; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Le Grand, Roger",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2558-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698191/,154

PURPOSE This study will describe the occupational and personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncologist well-being and patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four virtual focus groups were conducted with US ASCO member oncologists (September-November 2020). Inquiry and subsequent discussions centered on self-reported accounts of professional and personal COVID-19 experiences affecting well-being, and oncologist recommendations for well-being interventions that the cancer organization and professional societies (ASCO) might implement were explored. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using Framework Analysis. RESULTS Twenty-five oncologists were interviewed: median age 44 years (range: 35-69 years), 52% female, 52% racial or ethnic minority, 76% medical oncologists, 64% married, and an average of 51.5 patients seen per week (range: 20-120). Five thematic consequences emerged: (1) impact of pre-COVID-19 burnout, (2) occupational or professional limitations and adaptations, (3) personal implications, (4) concern for the future of cancer care and the workforce, and (5) recommendations for physician well-being interventions. Underlying oncologist burnout exacerbated stressors associated with disruptions in care, education, research, financial practice health, and telemedicine. Many feared delays in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Oncologists noted personal and familial stressors related to COVID-19 exposure fears and loss of social support. Many participants strongly considered working part-time or taking early retirement. Yet, opportunities arose to facilitate personal growth and rise above pandemic adversity, fostering greater resilience. Recommendations for organizational well-being interventions included psychologic or peer support resources, flexible time-off, and ASCO and state oncology societies involvement to develop care guidelines, well-being resources, and mental health advocacy. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected oncologist burnout, fulfillment, practice health, cancer care, and workforce. It illuminates where professional organizations could play a significant role in oncologist well-being.","Hlubocky, Fay J; Back, Anthony L; Shanafelt, Tait D; Gallagher, Colleen M; Burke, John M; Kamal, Arif H; Paice, Judith A; Page, Ray D; Spence, Rebecca; McGinnis, Molly; McFarland, Daniel C; Srivastava, Piyush",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.21.00147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152789/,154

A retrospective search of archives at the New York Animal Health Diagnostic Center revealed 57 culture-confirmed Salmonella Dublin cases from New York and Pennsylvania in which detailed histology of multiple tissues was available. Tissues routinely submitted by referring veterinarians for histologic evaluation included sections of heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Of the 57 S almonella Dublin-positive cases, all were Holstein breed, 53 were female (93%), and 49 (86%) were <6 mo of age.

The risk of ischemic stroke may be higher in patients with COVID-19 infection similar to those with other respiratory tract infections. We present a comprehensive set of practice implications in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS The practice implications were prepared after review of data to reach the consensus among stroke experts from 18 countries. The writers used systematic literature reviews, reference to previously published stroke guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate practice implications. All members of the writing group had opportunities to comment in writing on the practice implications and approved the final version of this document. RESULTS This document with consensus is divided into 18 sections. A total of 41 conclusions and practice implications have been developed. The document includes practice implications for evaluation of stroke patients with caution for stroke team members to avoid COVID-19 exposure, during clinical evaluation and performance of imaging and laboratory procedures with special considerations of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS These practice implications with consensus based on the currently available evidence aim to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke who are suspected of, or confirmed, with COVID-19 infection. Under certain circumstances, however, only limited evidence is available to support these practice implications, suggesting an urgent need for establishing procedures for the management of stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Abd-Allah, Foad; Alsenani, Fahmi; Aytac, Emrah; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin; Ciccone, Alfonso; Gomez, Camilo R; Gurkas, Erdem; Hsu, Chung Y; Jani, Vishal; Jiao, Liqun; Kobayashi, Adam; Lee, Jun; Liaqat, Jahanzeb; Mazighi, Mikael; Parthasarathy, Rajsrinivas; Steiner, Thorsten; Suri, M Fareed K; Toyoda, Kazunori; Ribo, Marc; Gongora-Rivera, Fernando; Oliveira-Filho, Jamary; Uzun, Guven; Wang, Yongjun",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493020923234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362244/,154

In this study, uPAR PET imaging using a 68Ga-labeled version of the uPAR-targeting peptide (AE105) was investigated in a group of patients with BC, PC, and UBC. The aim of this first-in-human, phase I clinical trial was to investigate the safety and biodistribution in normal tissues and uptake in tumor lesions. Methods: Ten patients (6 PC, 2 BC, and 2 UBC) received a single intravenous dose of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 (154 ± 59 MBq; range, 48-208 MBq). The biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were assessed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans (10 min, 1 h, and 2 h after injection). Safety assessment included measurements of vital signs with regular intervals during the imaging sessions and laboratory blood screening tests performed before and after injection. In a subgroup of patients, the in vivo stability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 was determined in collected blood and urine. PET images were visually analyzed for visible tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, and SUVs were obtained from tumor lesions by manually drawing volumes of interest in the malignant tissue. Results: No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were found. The radioligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from tissue compartments primarily by renal excretion. The effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq, leading to a radiation burden of 3 mSv when the clinical target dose of 200 MBq was used. In addition, radioligand accumulation was seen in primary tumor lesions as well as in metastases. Conclusion: This first-in-human, phase I clinical trial demonstrates the safe use and clinical potential of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 as a new radioligand for uPAR PET imaging in cancer patients.","Skovgaard, Dorthe; Persson, Morten; Brandt-Larsen, Malene; Christensen, Camilla; Madsen, Jacob; Klausen, Thomas Levin; Holm, Søren; Andersen, Flemming Littrup; Loft, Annika; Berthelsen, Anne Kiil; Pappot, Helle; Brasso, Klaus; Kroman, Niels; Højgaard, Liselotte; Kjaer, Andreas","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.116.178970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609788/,154

Several formulas have been proposed for this purpose. Our goal is to analyse weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy, with or without antrum preservation through different measurement formulas. METHODS A prospective randomised study of 60 patients (30 patients with initial section at 3 cm from pylorus and 30 patients at 8 cm from the pylorus). We calculate the following variables at 3, 6 and 12 months from surgery: BMI, excess weight loss (%EWL), percentage of excess of BMI loss (%PEBMIL), expected BMI, % PEBMIL corrected by EBMI and percentage of total weight loss (%TWL). RESULTS Weight evolution is similar in both groups, reaching a mean BMI of 33.62 ± 4.35 and 34.48 ± 4.23 kg/m2 respectively 12 months after surgery, closer to expected BMI. TWL follows the same trend, with losses exceeding 30%, although 3 cm group is above the tables of percentiles made with our series. Regarding PEBMIL, the 3 cm group reaches 67.8% classified as excellent, while 8 cm group reaches 62.8% classified as a good result. EWL situates the best results for 3 cm group.

78725,Single oblique osteotomy for correction of congenital radial head luxation with concurrent complex angular limb deformity in a dog: a case report.,2020-07-01,"Importance Vulvar melanosis is a common pigmentary change that accounts for most pigmented vulvar lesions. It presents as single or multiple asymptomatic macules or patches of varying size and color that may be asymmetric with poorly defined borders. The differential diagnosis of melanocytic lesions includes melanoma, which creates anxiety for patients and the physicians who diagnose the condition and treat the patients. Objective To evaluate the clinical and dermoscopic features of vulvar melanosis and their changes over time. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, patients with vulvar melanosis were recruited and followed up in the Department of Dermatology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy, between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2019. Data on patient characteristics and on both the clinical and dermoscopic features of the vulvar lesions were collected. Each lesion was photographed clinically and dermoscopically at initial evaluation and at annual follow-up visits. Main Outcomes and Measures The clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic features of vulvar melanosis and their changes over time. Results This cohort study included 129 women (mean age at diagnosis, 46 years [range, 19-83 years]) with vulvar melanosis. A total of 87 patients (67%) with vulvar melanotic lesions were premenopausal, and 84 patients (65%) had received some type of hormone therapy. The most frequent location for vulvar melanosis was the labia minora (55 [43%]), followed by the labia majora (33 [26%]). In 39 of 129 cases (30%), the lesions increased in size and changed color after initial evaluation but ultimately stabilized. No malignant evolution was documented in any patient during a median follow-up of 13 years (range, 5-20 years). Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that vulvar melanosis was a benign entity, and changes in lesions over time did not signify malignant transformation. An association between hormonal status and vulvar melanosis may be hypothesized.","De Giorgi, Vincenzo; Gori, Alessia; Salvati, Lorenzo; Scarfì, Federica; Maida, Pierandrea; Trane, Luciana; Silvestri, Flavia; Portelli, Francesca; Venturi, Federico; Covarelli, Piero; Massi, Daniela",JAMA dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.2528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32785609/,154
79172,The role of osmotic self-inflatable tissue expanders in intestinal transplant candidates.,2016,"Enveloped viruses exploit the endomembrane system to enter host cells. Through a cascade of membrane-trafficking events, virus-bearing vesicles fuse with acidic endosomes and/or lysosomes mediated by SNAREs triggering viral fusion. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we found that UV-radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), an autophagic tumor suppressor, is required for the entry of the prototypic negative-strand RNA virus, including influenza A virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, by a mechanism independent of IFN and autophagy. UVRAG mediates viral endocytic transport and membrane penetration through interactions with the class C vacuolar protein sorting (C-Vps) tethering complex and endosomal glutamine-containing SNAREs [syntaxin 7 (STX7), STX8, and vesicle transport through t-SNARE homolog 1B (Vti1b)], leading to the assembly of a fusogenic trans-SNARE complex involving vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP8), but not VAMP7. Indeed, UVRAG stimulates VAMP8 translocation to virus-bearing endosomes. Inhibition of VAMP8, but not VAMP7, significantly reduces viral entry. Our data indicate that UVRAG, in concert with C-Vps, regulates viral entry by assembling a specific fusogenic SNARE complex. Thus, UVRAG governs downstream viral entry, highlighting an important pathway capable of potential antiviral therapeutics.","Pirooz, Sara Dolatshahi; He, Shanshan; Zhang, Tian; Zhang, Xiaowei; Zhao, Zhen; Oh, Soohwan; O'Connell, Douglas; Khalilzadeh, Payam; Amini-Bavil-Olyaee, Samad; Farzan, Michael; Liang, Chengyu",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320629111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550300/,154

They require engagement of ER-resident chaperones and foldases that assist in their folding and maturation. Since protein homeostasis in the ER is crucial for cellular function, the protein-folding status in the organelle's lumen is continually surveyed by a network of signaling pathways, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Protein-folding imbalances, or ""ER stress,"" are detected by highly conserved sensors that adjust the ER's protein-folding capacity according to the physiological needs of the cell. We review recent developments in the field that have provided new insights into the ER stress-sensing mechanisms used by UPR sensors and the mechanisms by which they integrate various cellular inputs to adjust the folding capacity of the organelle to accommodate to fluctuations in ER protein-folding demands.","Karagöz, G Elif; Acosta-Alvear, Diego; Walter, Peter",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a033886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670466/,154

However, this process remains time-consuming and burdensome, and it remains unclear how much of the medical record must be made available. Online access to notes offers a way to overcome these challenges and in around 10 countries worldwide, via secure web-based portals, many patients are now able to read at least some of the narrative reports written by clinicians ('open notes'). However, even in countries that have implemented the practice many clinicians have resisted the idea remaining doubtful of the value of opening notes, and anticipating patients will be confused or anxious by what they read. Against this scepticism, a growing body of qualitative and quantitative research reveals that patients derive multiple benefits from reading their notes. We address the contrasting perceptions of this practice innovation, and claim that the divergent views of patients and clinicians can be explained as a case of epistemic injustice. Using a range of evidence, we argue that patients are vulnerable to (oftentimes, non-intentional) epistemic injustice. Nonetheless, we conclude that the marginalisation of patients' access to their health information exemplifies a form of epistemic exclusion, one with practical and ethical consequences including for patient safety.","Blease, Charlotte; Salmi, Liz; Rexhepi, Hanife; Hägglund, Maria; DesRoches, Catherine M",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990427/,154

On necropsy, the kidneys were found swollen with its parenchyma and ureters stuffed with urate flakes. Histopathologically, the renal tubular damage and inflammatory response were severe in concurrently infected birds compared to the cases infected only with ANV, which had direct correlation with significantly (p < 0.001) increased expression of IL-1 β, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, iNOS and IFN-γ transcripts in the kidneys of concurrently infected birds. Relative decrease in IFN-β transcript levels in the concurrently infected birds indicates suppression of antiviral response; the iNOS level was manifold increased which can be attributed to the enhanced macrophage response. Nucleotide sequencing of S1-spike glycoprotein gene of IBV and RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene of ANV confirmed etiologies as Igacovirus of Gammacoronavirus and ANV-2 of Avastrovirus 2, respectively. Both ANV and IBV virus affect kidneys. Our findings suggested that concurrent infections of these two viruses might have enhanced the transcripts of Th1, Th2 and proinflammatory cytokines with reduced IFN-β transcripts resulting in decreased host innate antiviral mechanisms leading to exacerbated renal lesions. Future experimental co-infection studies could throw more lights on pathology and pathogenesis during concurrent infections of ANV and IBV in poultry.","Munuswamy, Palanivelu; Ramakrishnan, Saravanan; Latheef, Shyma K; Kappala, Deepthi; Mariappan, Asok Kumar; Kaore, Megha; Anbazhagan, Karthikeyan; Puvvala, Bhavani; Singh, Karampal; Dhama, Kuldeep",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33691178/,154

A total of 11 patients underwent surgery by the RPTS approach for the following conditions: thymoma (n = 2), bronchogenic cyst (n = 2), metastatic pleural tumor, thymic cyst, solitary fibrous tumor, pulmonary sequestration, pericardial cyst, neurinoma, and malignant lymphoma (n = 1). An Endo Relief forceps (Hope Denshi Co, Ltd, Chiba, Japan) was used for three of the surgical procedures. The elements of the data set consisted of gender, age, duration of operation, drain placement, hospital stay, mass location, and mass size. The median surgical time was 45 min (range, 40-78 min). There were no intraoperative complications and no need for a second surgery to open additional ports. The duration until chest tube removal was 1 day for all the cases. The median hospital stay was 4 days (range, 3-6 days). The median mass size was 2.2 cm (range, 1.2-4.2 cm). The median length of skin incision was 2.0 cm (range, 2.0-3.5 cm). In conclusion, RPTS for mediastinal and pleural disease may be a possible alternative approach to conventional multiportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Although it is technically plausible and feasible for selected cases, the issues of patient acceptability and cosmetic and oncological results remain to be determined in the future with randomized-controlled trials and long-term follow-up.","Tamura, Masaya; Shimizu, Yosuke; Hashizume, Yasuo",The Indian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-015-1333-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27358509/,154
83519,A multi-center nested case-control study on hospitalization costs and length of stay due to healthcare-associated infection.,2018,"The current standard of treating early Barrett's neoplasia is resection of visible lesions using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) followed by ablative therapy to the Barrett's segment. There is increasing evidence to support the use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) where en-bloc resection and lower recurrence rates may be achieved. However, ESD is associated with deep submucosal dissection when compared to EMR. This may increase the risk of complications including stricture formation with subsequent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of RFA following EMR and ESD as well as when RFA was used without prior endoscopic resection. The primary outcome measure was complication rates. Clearance of dysplasia (CRD) and clearance of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) were secondary outcomes. A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 91 patients referred for RFA from a single academic tertiary center was performed. The choice of endoscopic resection method was tailored according to the lesion type and morphology. Focal and circumferential ablation was performed after initial follow up endoscopy postresection. Patients proceeded straight to RFA in the absence of any visible lesions. In this study, the ESD group had a higher proportion of cancers compared to the EMR cohort (74.1% vs. 30.2%, P < 0.01) prior to RFA. All complications post RFA occurred in the groups with previous endoscopic resection. There was no significant difference in the total complication rate (7.4% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.78) and stricture formation rate (3.7% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.38) between the ESD and EMR groups. CRD was achieved in 96.3% in the ESD group, 88.4% in the EMR group, and all patients in the RFA alone group. CRIM rates were similar in the EMR and ESD groups (81.4% vs. 85.2%) but higher in the RFA alone group (90.5%). In conclusion, RFA following ESD is very effective and not associated with an increased risk of complications compared to EMR. This supports the application of RFA in the treatment algorithm of patients undergoing ESD for Barrett's neoplasia.","Subramaniam, S; Kandiah, K; Chedgy, F; Meredith, P; Longcroft-Wheaton, G; Bhandari, P",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,https://doi.org/10.1093/dote/dox133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211875/,154

This review summarizes age-, sex- and type-specific malignant cancer risks for PHTS patients, which is urgently needed for clinical management. A PubMed literature search for Standardized Incidence Ratios or Cumulative Lifetime cancer risks (CLTRs) resulted in nine cohort studies comprising four independent PHTS cohorts, including mainly index cases and prevalent cancer cases. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Reported CLTRs for any cancer varied from 81% to 90%. The tumor spectrum included female breast cancer (CLTRs including sex-specific estimates at age 60-70: 67% to 85%), endometrium cancer (19% to 28%), thyroid cancer (6% to 38%), renal cancer (2% to 24%), colorectal cancer (9% to 32%), and melanoma (0% to 6%). Although these estimates provide guidance for clinical care, discrepancies between studies, sample sizes, retrospective designs, strongly ascertained cases, and lack of pediatric research emphasizes that data should be interpreted with great caution. Therefore, more accurate and more personalized age-, sex- and cancer-specific risk estimates are needed to enable counseling of all PHTS patients irrespective of ascertainment, and improvement of cancer surveillance guidelines.

This systematic review aimed to identify tools to assess physical literacy and its physical, cognitive and affective domains within children aged 7-11.9 years, and to examine the measurement properties, feasibility and elements of physical literacy assessed within each tool. METHODS Six databases (EBSCO host platform, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Education Research Complete, SPORTDiscus) were searched up to 10th September 2020. Studies were included if they sampled children aged between 7 and 11.9 years, employed field-based assessments of physical literacy and/or related affective, physical or cognitive domains, reported measurement properties (quantitative) or theoretical development (qualitative), and were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. The methodological quality and measurement properties of studies and assessment tools were appraised using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments risk of bias checklist. The feasibility of each assessment was considered using a utility matrix and elements of physical literacy element were recorded using a descriptive checklist. RESULTS The search strategy resulted in a total of 11467 initial results. After full text screening, 11 studies (3 assessments) related to explicit physical literacy assessments. Forty-four studies (32 assessments) were relevant to the affective domain, 31 studies (15 assessments) were relevant to the physical domain and 2 studies (2 assessments) were included within the cognitive domain. Methodological quality and reporting of measurement properties within the included studies were mixed. The Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy-2 and the Passport For Life had evidence of acceptable measurement properties from studies of very good methodological quality and assessed a wide range of physical literacy elements. Feasibility results indicated that many tools would be suitable for a primary PE setting, though some require a level of expertise to administer and score that would require training. CONCLUSIONS This review has identified a number of existing assessments that could be useful in a physical literacy assessment approach within PE and provides further information to empower researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate assessment for their needs, purpose and context. The review indicates that researchers and tool developers should aim to improve the methodological quality and reporting of measurement properties of assessments to better inform the field.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Nvision VLE system. DESIGN Prospective, multicenter study. SETTING Tertiary-care medical centers. PATIENTS One hundred patients with suspected Barrett's esophagus, including 52 patients with prior endotherapy. INTERVENTIONS The first-generation Nvision VLE Imaging System, a balloon-centered, rotating optical probe provided images of the mucosa and submucosa through a 6-cm segment length and 360° scan of the distal esophagus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Acquisition of a complete, 6-cm scan from the distal esophagus, demographic and procedural data, and final histologic diagnosis. RESULTS VLE imaging was successfully performed in 87 cases. After VLE imaging, biopsy specimens were obtained in 77 patients and mucosal resection was performed in 20 patients. The final pathologic diagnoses of the patients studied were adenocarcinoma (4 patients), high-grade dysplasia (10 patients), low-grade dysplasia (11 patients), indefinite (5 patients), intestinal metaplasia (29 patients), and normal squamous cells (18 patients). VLE was not completed in 13 of 100 (13%) because of optical probe and console issues. There were 2 minor adverse events (mucosal lacerations not requiring therapy). LIMITATIONS This was a feasibility study with a first-generation device. There was no direct histopathologic correlation with the VLE images or any comparative analysis with white-light endoscopy or narrow-band imaging findings. CONCLUSION VLE is a safe procedure for patients with suspected or confirmed Barrett's esophagus. Real-time VLE images enabled visualization of the mucosa and submucosa in 87% of cases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the in vivo diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of VLE.","Wolfsen, Herbert C; Sharma, Prateek; Wallace, Michael B; Leggett, Cadman; Tearney, Guillermo; Wang, Kenneth K",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2015.03.1968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25956472/,154

This review focuses on what the new literature has provided in terms of more general information about the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RECENT FINDINGS Measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have caused a significant drop in influenza worldwide. Improvements in imaging, especially ultrasound, and especially in the application of rapid molecular diagnosis are likely to have significant impact on the management of CAP. Therapeutic advances are so far limited. SUMMARY COVID-19 has taught us that we can do far more to prevent seasonal influenza and its associated mortality, morbidity and economic cost. Improvements in imaging and pathogen diagnosis are welcome, as is the potential for secondary benefits of anti-COVID-19 therapies that may have reach effect on respiratory viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As community-transmission is likely to persist for many years, recognition and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will need to be incorporated into CAP guidelines moving forward.","Waterer, Grant W",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492003/,154

DESIGN Prospective observational crossover study. METHODS Thirteen healthy subjects were recruited. Each wore a cloth, surgical, or N95 mask in randomized order. The number of air particles were quantified using a particle counter suspended over the right eye while each subject breathed normally, deeply, or spoke using a standardized script. Particle counts were obtained with the top of each mask taped and untaped. The main outcome measurements were particle counts in the size classes of 0.3 μm, 0.5 μm, 1 μm, 3 μm, 5 μm, 10 μm, and total particle count. RESULTS Taping cloth masks while subjects were speaking significantly reduced particle counts for the size classes of 0.3 μm (p=0.03), 0.5 μm (p=0.01), 1 μm (p=0.03), and total particle counts (p=0.008) compared to no taping. Taping the top of cloth masks during normal or deep breathing did not significantly affect particle counts compared to no taping. Taping the top of surgical or N95 masks did not significantly alter particle counts for any breathing condition tested. CONCLUSIONS Taping the top of cloth masks prior to simulated intravitreal injections significantly reduced air particle counts directed toward the eye when subjects were speaking compared to no taping. This may have implications for decreasing air particles reaching the eye during intravitreal injections, including aerosolized droplets from a patient's mouth that may carry oral pathogens.","Schultheis, William G; Sharpe, James E; Zhang, Qiang; Patel, Samir N; Kuriyan, Ajay E; Chiang, Allen; Garg, Sunir J; Hsu, Jason",American journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2021.01.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535060/,154

A case report and review of literature.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Aortic stenosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in older patients. The advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) offers an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at high or intermediate risk of adverse events. Existing evidence highlights the importance of frailty as a predictor of poor outcomes post-TAVI. The objective of this study is to review the operationalisation of frailty instruments for TAVI recipients and determine clinical outcomes and the change in quality of life in frail patients undergoing TAVI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Methods are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 checklist. We will search relevant databases to identify published, completed but unpublished and ongoing studies. We will include studies of patients with aortic stenosis, diagnosed as frail and who underwent a TAVI procedure that report mortality, clinical outcomes or health-related quality of life. Retrospective or prospective cohort studies, randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials will be eligible for inclusion. Two researchers will independently screen articles for inclusion, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. One researcher will extract data with audit by a second researcher. The risk of bias in studies will be evaluated using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Meta-analysis of mortality, survival curve and the change in quality of life will be performed if appropriate. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression will be performed if necessary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Due to the nature of this study, no ethical issues are foreseen.

This study aims to characterize the lipid mediator profile including oxygenated lipids, endocannabinoids, and ceramides/sphingoid bases in sweat and identify differences in these profiles between sweat collected from nonlesional sites on the unflared volar forearm of subjects with and without atopic dermatitis (AD). Adapting routine procedures developed for plasma analysis, over 100 lipid mediators were profiled using LC-MS/MS and 58 lipid mediators were detected in sweat. Lipid mediator concentrations were not affected by sampling or storage conditions. Increases in concentrations of C30-C40 [NS] and [NdS] ceramides, and C18:1 sphingosine, were observed in the sweat of study participants with AD despite no differences being observed in transepidermal water loss between study groups, and this effect was strongest in men (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc HSD). No differences in oxylipins and endocannabinoids were observed between study groups. Sweat mediator profiling may therefore provide a noninvasive diagnostic for AD prior to the presentation of clinical signs.","Agrawal, Karan; Hassoun, Lauren A; Foolad, Negar; Pedersen, Theresa L; Sivamani, Raja K; Newman, John W",Journal of lipid research,https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.m071738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27875258/,154

During the COVID-19 outbreak, it has been reported a decrease in the incidence of acute coronary syndrome, but few data are available about pacemaker implantation rates. This study aimed to analyse patients referred to our centre with permanent cardiac pacing indication during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS We compared the number, the characteristics and the outcomes of patients who underwent urgent pacemaker implantation between March and April 2019 (Group I) with those performed in the corresponding 2020 period (Group II). RESULTS A total of 27 patients (Group I) were implanted in March-April 2019 and 34 patients (Group II) in the corresponding 2020 period. In both groups, about half of the patients received a dual-chamber pacemaker. No significant differences in baseline patients' characteristics were observed. The most frequent indication was advanced atrio-ventricular block with a prevalence of 78% and 62% in Group I and II, respectively. The rate of procedural complications, the in-hospital and 1-month mortality were also similar between the two groups.

More evidence is needed to guide patient selection, timing of high-flow nasal cannula initiation, and resource allocation. We aimed to assess time to discharge and time to death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 in patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula compared with matched controls. We also evaluated the ability of the respiratory rate-oxygenation ratio to predict progression to invasive mechanical ventilation. DESIGN Time-dependent propensity score matching was used to create pairs of individuals who were then analyzed in a Cox proportional-hazards regression model to estimate high-flow nasal cannula's effect on time to discharge and time to death. A secondary analysis excluded high-flow nasal cannula patients intubated within 6 hours of admission. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess risk of invasive mechanical ventilation among high-flow nasal cannula patients stratified by respiratory rate-oxygenation. SETTING The five hospitals of the Johns Hopkins Health System. PATIENTS All patients who were admitted with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 were eligible for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS High-flow nasal cannula was associated with longer median time to discharge: 10.6 days (interquartile range, 7.1-15.8 d) versus 7.8 days (interquartile range, 4.9-12.1 d). Respiratory rate-oxygenation index performed poorly in predicting ventilation or death. In the primary analysis, there was no significant association between high-flow nasal cannula and hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.09). Excluding patients intubated within 6 hours of admission, high-flow nasal cannula was associated with reduced hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99). CONCLUSIONS Among unselected patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, high-flow nasal cannula was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in hazard of death. However, in patients not mechanically ventilated within 6 hours of admission, high-flow nasal cannula was associated with a significantly reduced hazard of death.","Burnim, Michael S; Wang, Kunbo; Checkley, William; Nolley, Eric P; Xu, Yanxun; Garibaldi, Brian T",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637419/,154

PROCEDURES We investigated the cellular uptake of (99m)Tc-1-TG, (99m)Tc-5-TG, and 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose((18)F-FDG) in a human colorectal carcinoma and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (HCT-116, A549) at different time points and varying glucose/insulin concentrations and under transporter blockage by cytochalasin-B and phloretin. Cell compartment analysis was performed. RESULTS A significant uptake and time dependency thereof, a significant uptake dependency on glucose and insulin and a significant uptake inhibition by cytochalasin-B for (99m)Tc-1-TG and (99m)Tc-5-TG, was shown. Albeit substantial, the uptake was less pronounced in (99m)Tc-1-TG and (99m)Tc-5-TG compared with (18)F-FDG. (99m)Tc-1-TG and (99m)Tc-5-TG showed a higher accumulation in the cell membranes compared with (18)F-FDG.

RECENT FINDINGS Ophthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent single-incision vs multiport laparoscopic colectomies. DESIGN Consecutive patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomies were case matched to patients who underwent multiport laparoscopic colectomies by age, operation, surgeon, diagnosis, and body mass index. Data from a prospective database and the medical records of patients treated were reviewed. SETTINGS This study took place at 2 tertiary care hospitals. PATIENTS Forty-six consecutive patients with a body mass index of 24 underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomies (24 right, 18 sigmoid, 4 low anterior resection). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perioperative outcomes and cosmesis and body image scores at 90 days were compared. RESULTS The largest incision length was significantly shorter for the single-incision group. Two patients with single incisions were converted to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery and 4 required placement of a 5-mm trocar. A significantly greater portion of the operation was performed by the attending surgeons in the single-incision group. For right colectomies, operative times were similar. For left colectomies, operative time (149 ± 30 vs 126 ± 21 min) was significantly longer for the single-incision group. Time to flatus and bowel movements were significantly shorter for the single-incision group, but length of stay was similar. Cosmetic score was higher for the single-incision group (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS Single incision is equivalent to multiport laparoscopic colectomy with regard to safety and efficacy with smaller incision size and higher cosmetic scores. Operative times were equivalent, although a greater portion of the operation was performed by the attending surgeons in the single-incision group. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the advantages of single-incision laparoscopic colectomy.","Lee, Sang W; Milsom, Jeffrey W; Nash, Garrett M",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e31822c8d41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21979178/,154

We aimed to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and different volumes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on changes in circulating IL-22. Methods This was a sub-study of the ""Exercise in the prevention of Metabolic Syndrome"" (EX-MET) a multi-center, randomized trial. This study used data collected at the Brisbane site. Thirty-nine individuals with MetS were randomized to one of three 16-wk interventions: 1) MICT (n=10, 30min at 60-70% HR peak, 5x/wk); 2) 4HIIT (n=13, 4x4min at 85-95% HR peak, interspersed with 3min of active recovery at 50-70% HR peak, 3x/wk); or 3) 1HIIT (n=16, 1x4min at 85-95% HR peak, 3x/wk). Serum IL-22 concentration was measured following a 12-hr fast via an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, before and after the intervention. MetS severity, insulin resistance (IR), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were also measured via MetS z-score, HOMA-IR, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and indirect calorimetry (maximal exercise test), respectively. Results The median (IQR) IL-22% changes from pre- to post-intervention in the MICT, 4HIIT, and 1HIIT groups were -17% (-43.0% to 31.3%), +16.5% (-18.9% to 154.9%), and +15.9% (-28.7% to 46.1%), respectively. Although there were no significant between-group differences in IL-22 concentration change, there was a medium-to-large group × time interaction effect [F(2,35)=2.08, p=0.14, η2=0.14]. Conclusion Although there was no statistically significant between-group difference in IL-22 change, the study suggests that different exercise intensities may have opposing effects on IL-22 concentration in individuals with MetS.","Ramos, Joyce S; Dalleck, Lance C; Stennett, Rebecca C; Mielke, Gregore I; Keating, Shelley E; Murray, Lydia; Hasnain, Sumaira Z; Fassett, Robert G; McGuckin, Michael; Croci, Ilaria; Coombes, Jeff S","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s251567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765023/,154

We first introduce the relevance of CB2r as a key component of the endocannabinoid system. We discuss CB2r interest as a possible novel target in the treatment of pain. This receptor has also raised interest as a potential target for neurodegenerative disorders treatment, as we then discussed. Finaly, we underline studies revealing a novel potential CB2r interest in mental disorders treatment. EXPERT OPINION In spite of the interest of targeting CB2r for pain, clinical trials evaluating CB2r agonist analgesic efficacy have currently failed. The preferential involvement of CB2r in preventing the development of chronic pain could influence the failure of clinical trials designed for the treatment of already established pain syndromes. Specific trials should be designed to target the prevention of chronic pain development.","Cabañero, David; Martín-García, Elena; Maldonado, Rafael",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2021.1971196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424117/,154
98580,Ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistula with unusual drainage route treated by transarterial embolization.,2014,"Routine surveillance for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infections is crucial for the epidemiological control of this disease. Antibody tests are widely used but cannot differentiate between vaccination and reinfection. We developed a PRRSV antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of North American and European PRRSV. This antigen assay detected purified N protein from both genotypes at levels as low as 0.4 and 0.8 ng, respectively. The specificity and sensitivity of the N antigen assay were evaluated with ground lung tissues from 8 PRRSV-infected and 16 healthy swine, and culture supernatants from six PRRSV isolates as well as other swine viruses were confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Antigen assays were positive in all eight infected tissues and with six different PRRSV isolates, with no false positives among healthy tissues and other swine viruses (i.e., pseudorabies and foot and mouth disease viruses). A number of sera, field collected from 466 vaccinated and asymptomatic pigs in Guangdong, China, between 2008 and 2009, tested positive by the N antigen assay (12.45%), RT-PCR (15.02%), and a commercial test for antibodies against PRRSV (78.97%). Of the 466 sera, 47 were positive by both antigen and RT-PCR tests, 11 by antigen test only, and 23 by RT-PCR only; the two assays had an overall agreement of 92.7%, indicating a significant percentage of active PRRSV in asymptomatic pigs despite previous immunization. These findings suggest that the antigen assay is a valuable field tool for the epidemiological control of PRRSV that can be used for rapid screening, particularly in asymptomatic animals.","Cai, Jian-Piao; Wang, Ya-Di; Tse, Herman; Xiang, Hua; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Che, Xiao-Yan",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00244-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828768/,154
98585,Imaging findings after radiofrequency ablation of adrenal tumors.,2011,"BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium is a common complication associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer hospital stays, and greater health care expenditures. Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) slowing has been associated previously with postoperative delirium, but the relationship between intraoperative EEG suppression and postoperative delirium has not been investigated. METHODS In this observational cohort study, 727 adult patients who received general anesthesia with planned intensive care unit admission were included. Duration of intraoperative EEG suppression was recorded from a frontal EEG channel (FP1 to F7). Delirium was assessed twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 5 with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. Thirty days after surgery, quality of life, functional independence, and cognitive ability were measured using the Veterans RAND 12-item survey, the Barthel index, and the PROMIS Applied Cognition-Abilities-Short Form 4a survey. RESULTS Postoperative delirium was observed in 162 (26%) of 619 patients assessed. When we compared patients with no EEG suppression with those divided into quartiles based on duration of EEG suppression, patients with more suppression were more likely to experience delirium (χ(4) = 25, P < 0.0001). This effect remained significant after we adjusted for potential confounders (odds ratio for log(EEG suppression) 1.22 [99% confidence interval, 1.06-1.40, P = 0.0002] per 1-minute increase in suppression). EEG suppression may have been associated with reduced functional independence (Spearman partial correlation coefficient -0.15, P = 0.02) but not with changes in quality of life or cognitive ability. Predictors of EEG suppression included greater end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration and lower intraoperative opioid dose. CONCLUSIONS EEG suppression is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium. Future studies should investigate whether anesthesia titration to minimize EEG suppression decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium. This is a substudy of the Systematic Assessment and Targeted Improvement of Services Following Yearlong Surgical Outcomes Surveys (SATISFY-SOS) surgical outcomes registry (NCT02032030).","Fritz, Bradley A; Kalarickal, Philip L; Maybrier, Hannah R; Muench, Maxwell R; Dearth, Doug; Chen, Yulong; Escallier, Krisztina E; Ben Abdallah, Arbi; Lin, Nan; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26418126/,154

AIMS To evaluate the efficiency of endotherapy in the case of neoplastic BE relapse after successful complete endoscopic eradication of neoplastic BE and metaplastic BE. METHODS Retrospective review of medical records was collected in a computerized and prospective manner between 2000 and 2015, in a single tertiary care center. Recurrence was defined by histological presence of high-grade dysplasia or superficial adenocarcinoma at least 6 months after the end of successful initial endotherapy. RESULTS Eighteen patients were assessed (1F/17 M). Delay between initial treatment and relapse was 16.6 months (range 6-33). Endotherapy for relapse obtained a sustained and complete remission for 8/18 (44%) patients, with an average endoscopic follow-up of 28 months. The complication rate of endotherapy was 6%. Surgical management was required in 33% (2 pT2N0M0, 2 pTisN0M0, 1 pTm2N0M0 and 1 pTm3N0M0) and salvage radiochemotherapy in 17% (3/18). One patient treated by 6 sessions of ER was considered as a failure given the multiple sessions of endotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that length of BE (>5 cm), late stenosis adverse events and the quality of vertical margin during initial ER are predictive factors for disease-free survival (p value < 0.01, Hazard Ratio up to 0.076). CONCLUSION Endotherapy could be a treatment for management of neoplastic BE relapse, but should be carefully used, with strict follow-up.","Godat, Sébastien; Caillol, Fabrice; Autret, Aurélie; Bories, Erwan; Pesenti, Christian; Ratone, Jean Philippe; De Cassan, Chiara; Poizat, Flora; Giovannini, Marc",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5409-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28078459/,154
99531,"Menkes disease, a diagnosis to consider in case of severe epilepsy with hyperlactacidemia: a case report.",2020-07-06,"Background There is limited evidence regarding the patient-related factors that influence treatment outcomes after an acute Achilles tendon rupture. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of functional and patient-reported outcomes 1 year after an acute Achilles tendon rupture using a multicenter cohort and to determine patient characteristics for reporting within the top and bottom 10% of the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) and heel-rise height outcomes. The hypothesis was that older age, greater body mass index (BMI), and female sex would lead to inferior outcomes. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Patients were selected by combining 5 randomized controlled trials from 2 different centers in Sweden. Functional outcomes were assessed using validated heel-rise tests (height, number of repetitions, total work, and concentric power) for muscular endurance and strength, and the relationship between injured and uninjured legs was calculated as the limb symmetry index (LSI). Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the ATRS. All outcomes were collected at the 1-year follow-up. Independent predictors included were patient sex, smoking, BMI, age, and surgical versus nonsurgical treatment. Results Of the 391 included patients, 307 (79%) were treated surgically. The LSI of heel-rise height at the 1-year follow-up decreased by approximately 4% for every 10-year increment in age (beta, -3.94 [95% CI, -6.19 to -1.69]; P = .0006). In addition, every 10-year increment in age resulted in a 1.79-fold increase in the odds of being in the lowest 10% of the LSI of heel-rise height. Moreover, a nonsignificant superior LSI of heel-rise height was found in patients treated surgically compared with nonsurgical treatment (beta, -4.49 [95% CI, -9.14 to 0.16]; P = .058). No significant predictor was related to the ATRS. Smoking, patient sex, and BMI did not significantly affect the 1-year results for the LSI of the heel-rise tests. Conclusion Older age at the time of injury negatively affected heel-rise height 1 year after an Achilles tendon rupture. Irrespective of age, a nonsignificant relationship toward the superior recovery of heel-rise height was seen in patients treated surgically. None of the factors studied affected patient-reported outcomes.","Westin, Olof; Svedman, Simon; Senorski, Eric Hamrin; Svantesson, Eleonor; Nilsson-Helander, Katarina; Karlsson, Jón; Ackerman, Paul; Samuelsson, Kristian",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967118813904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30627587/,154

METHODS The subjects were singleton primiparae delivered in a Teaching Hospital between 1995 and 2002. We studied the odds of developing pre-eclampsia across months and investigated the association between the pre-eclamptic rates based on the months of conception and the mean monthly heat index. RESULTS A total of 245 (1.6%) women were diagnosed pre-eclampsia and eclampsia during the study period. There was a significant association between the seasons of conception and rate of pre-eclampsia (logistic regression Wald chi(2) = 9.2, p = 0.03). Conceptions during summer had a higher risk of pre-eclampsia than those during autumn (2.3 vs. 1.6%, OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5). Women who conceived in June had the highest risk of developing pre-eclampsia (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.2) while women who conceived in October had the lowest after adjusting for age. A 2-month time lag was observed between the peak pre-eclamptic rate in women who conceived in June and the peak heat index in August. CONCLUSION Singleton primiparous women who conceived in summer and had a longer exposure to higher ambient temperature were at a greater risk of pre-eclampsia.","Tam, Wing Hung; Sahota, Daljit S; Lau, Tze Kin; Li, Chi Yin; Fung, Tak Yuen",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000114252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18230912/,154

101683,Reply.,2016,"BACKGROUND Pandemic mortality rates in 1918 and in 2009 were highest among those with the lowest socioeconomic status (SES). Despite this, low SES groups are not included in the list of groups prioritized for pandemic vaccination, and the ambition to reduce social inequality in health does not feature in international and national pandemic preparedness plans. We describe plans for a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between SES and pandemic outcomes during the last five pandemics. METHOD The planned review will cover studies of pandemic influenza that report associations between morbidity, hospitalization, or mortality with socioeconomic factors such as education and income. The review will include published studies in the English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish languages, regardless of geographical location. Relevant records were identified through systematic literature searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cinahl, SocIndex, Scopus, and Web of Science. Reference lists of relevant known studies will be screened and experts in the field consulted in order to identify other additional sources. Two investigators will independently screen and select studies, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion until consensus is reached. Covidence will be used. Results will be summarized narratively and using three meta-analytic strategies: coefficients expressing the difference between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups reported will be pooled using (a) fixed and random effects meta-analysis where studies involve similar outcome and exposure measures and (b) meta-regression where studies involve similar outcome measures. In addition, we will attempt to use all reported estimates for SES differences in (c) a Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate the underlying SES gradient and how it differs by outcome and exposure measure. DISCUSSION This study will provide the first systematic review of research on the relation between SES and pandemic outcomes. The findings will be relevant for health policy in helping to assess whether people of low socioeconomic status should be prioritized for vaccines in preparedness plans for pandemic influenza. The review will also contribute to the research literature by providing pooled estimates of effect sizes as inputs into power calculations of future studies.

Comparing AIS data from February 2019 and from February 2020, it is found that the merchant ship count and utilization frequency are reduced during the epidemic period. The epidemic could result in longer ship turnaround times because of more operation time for berthing and anchoring activities. Ship emission comparison results reveal that the cargo ship emissions are significantly reduced while container ships and tankers produce a slightly decreased emissions resulting by strict COVID-19 quarantine measures. In addition, the unit ship emission intensity is greatly reduced for ships which are under the normal cruising status while berthing and anchoring operations are associated with increased ship emissions. This implies that it is urgent to promote the use of shore power equipment for merchant ships during the epidemic period.","Shi, Kun; Weng, Jinxian",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098281/,154

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Compared to their male counterparts, Black/African American (AA) women remain significantly underrepresented among senior surgical faculty and department leadership. The impact of racial and gender bias on the academic and professional trajectory of Black/AA women surgeons has not been well-studied. METHODS A cross-sectional survey regarding demographics, employment, and perceived barriers to career advancement was distributed via email to faculty surgeon members of the Society of Black American Surgeons (SBAS) in September 2019. RESULTS Of 181 faculty members, 53 responded (29%), including 31 women (58%) and 22 men (42%). Academic positions as a first job were common (men 95% vs women 77%, p = 0.06). Men were more likely to attain the rank of full professor (men 45% vs women 7%, p = 0.01). Reports of racial bias in the workplace were similar (women 84% vs men 86%, NS); however, reports of gender bias (women 97% vs men 27%, p < 0.001) and perception of salary inequities (women 89% vs 63%, p = 0.02) were more common among women.

103474,Pharmacotherapeutic considerations in solid organ transplant patients with COVID-19.,2020-07-13,"Dietary protein sources have profound effects on children and young animals, and are important for the gut barrier function and immune resilience. Milk and soy are the main sources of protein for children and young animals after weaning. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of dairy and soy proteins on the intestinal barrier in early development. Weanling C57BL/6 mice were fed AIN-93G diets prepared with casein or soy protein isolate (SPI) for 21 days. Compared with those fed with the casein diet, mice fed with the SPI diet did not change their body weight and organ coefficients, but increased their feed intake and ratio of feed to gain. SPI lowered the level of luminal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and downregulated the levels of IL-4, IL-13, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (Pigr), Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6), and transforming growth factor-β (Tgfb) in the mouse ileum. Western blotting of ileal proteins confirmed that SPI suppressed the activation of the JAK1/STAT6 signaling pathway. Furthermore, SPI attenuated intestinal mucin production, as demonstrated by the decreased numbers of intestinal goblet cells and the reduced relative expression levels of mucin 1 (Muc1), mucin 2 (Muc2), trefoil factor 3 (Tff3), glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94), and anterior gradient homolog 2 (Agr2). The results indicated that the SPI diet could attenuate mouse intestinal immunity, as demonstrated by decreased SIgA and mucin production in the intestine. Therefore, we suggest that our findings should be of consideration when SPI or casein are used as dietary protein sources.","Zeng, Bin; Wang, Dongyang; Wang, Hailong; Chen, Ting; Luo, Junyi; Xi, Qianyun; Sun, Jiajie; Zhang, Yongliang",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911830/,154

After the start of carbon dioxide-induced pneumoperitoneum, the patient's end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure and heart rate suddenly increased. The surgery was then paused, and a chest X-ray revealed a right pneumothorax accompanied by pneumomediastinum. After a thoracostomy tube was inserted, these symptoms immediately improved. After conversion to an open procedure, the surgery was completed. The thoracostomy tube was removed the next day, and the patient was discharged without any complications. As the pneumothorax occurred on the opposite side to the operative field and there was no evidence of diaphragmatic injury, it is suspected to have been caused by a pneumomediastinum-induced rupture of the barrier between the mediastinum and pleural space. This may have occurred due to the insufflated carbon dioxide gas passing directly into the mediastinum and then the pleural space.","Matsushita, Yuto; Miyake, Hideaki; Motoyama, Daisuke; Sugiyama, Takayuki; Nagata, Masao; Otsuka, Atsushi; Furuse, Hiroshi; Ozono, Seiichiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303679/,154

AREAS COVERED The literature was searched for: ""dabigatran"", ""rivaroxaban"", ""edoxaban"", or ""apixaban"" and drugs, affecting platelet function, CYP3A4-, CYP2C9- or P-Gp-activity. Pharmacodynamic DDI of NOAC with drugs affecting platelet function like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and antiplatelet agents occur most frequently. Pharmacokinetic DDI with NOAC were found for 37 of 117 drugs. Reports about DDI with NOAC were found for 51% of P-gp-affecting, 38% for CYP2C9-affecting and 27% for CYP3A4-affecting drugs. Reports about DDI of cardiovascular drugs with NOAC were the most prevalent, followed by anti-infective and nervous system drugs. NOAC plasma levels were measured in retrospective and cohort studies and were associated with concomitant medication. Reports about DDI of NOAC were found in 71 patients ≥75 years. EXPERT OPINION : Despite being frequently prescribed, the knowledge about DDI of NOAC in elderly patients is very limited. Studies should be carried out to investigate the role of drugs potentially interacting with NOAC, which until now have not been investigated.

However, it is unclear if NA can be safely stopped in such patients after cytotoxic therapies or during immunosuppressive therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 133 patients who initiated NA therapy between 2007 and 2018. A total of 103 patients were positive for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) at baseline, and NA therapy was started before cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (preventive group). Thirty patients with resolved HBV infection were treated with NA therapy after HBV reactivation (on-demand group). Virological relapse was defined as a serum HBV DNA level >20 IU/mL. RESULTS NA therapy was stopped in 12 (12%) patients (preventive group), and in 16 (53%) patients (on-demand group). After the cessation of NA therapy, the cumulative rates of relapse were 36% and 39% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. High levels of HBsAg both at baseline and at the cessation of NA therapy were related to the occurrence of relapse. Relapse did not occur in patients with HBsAg levels <20 IU/mL (preventive group). HBV relapse occurred in five (33%) patients in the on-demand group. Relapse occurred only in anti-HBs-negative patients at the cessation of NA therapy. There were no cases of hepatitis flare after the cessation of NA therapy. CONCLUSION HBsAg predicted HBV relapse after the cessation of NA therapy in HBsAg-positive patients. Anti-HBs could be a predictive marker for NA therapy cessation in patients with resolved HBV. This article is protected by copyright.

107911,Septic shock due to refractory severe clostridioides difficile colitis rapidly resolving after faecal microbiota transplantation.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND The aim of this observational study is to analyze the results of patients with large hiatal hernia and upside-down stomach after surgical closure with a biological mesh (Permacol(®), Covidien, Neustadt an der Donau, Germany). Biological mesh is used to prevent long-term detrimental effects of artificial meshes and to reduce recurrence rates. METHODS A total of 13 patients with a large hiatal hernia and endothoracic stomach, who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2014, were included. Interviews and upper endoscopy were conducted to determine recurrences, lifestyle restrictions, and current complaints. RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 26 ± 18 months (range: 3-58 months), 10 patients (3 men, mean age 73 ± 13, range: 26-81 years) were evaluated. A small recurrent axial hernia was found in one patient postoperatively. Dysphagia was the most common complaint (four cases); while in one case, the problem was solved after endoscopic dilatation. In three cases, bloat and postprandial pain were documented. In one case, an explantation of the mesh was necessary due to mesh migration and painful adhesions. In one further case with gastroparesis, pyloroplasty was performed without success. The data are compared to the available literature. It was found that dysphagia and recurrence rates are unrelated both in biological and in synthetic meshes if the esophagus is encircled. In series preserving the esophagus at least partially uncoated, recurrences after the use of biological meshes relieve dysphagia. After the application of synthetic meshes, dysphagia is aggravated by recurrences. CONCLUSION Recurrence is rare after encircling hiatal hernia repair with the biological mesh Permacol(®). Dysphagia, gas bloat, and intra-abdominal pain are frequent complaints. Despite the small number of patients, it can be concluded that a biological mesh may be an alternative to synthetic meshes to reduce recurrences at least for up to 2 years. Our study demonstrates that local fibrosis and thickening of the mesh can affect the outcome being associated with abdominal discomfort despite a successful repair. The review of the literature indicates comparable results after 2 years with both biologic and synthetic meshes embracing the esophagus. At the same point in time, reconstruction with synthetic and biologic materials differs when the esophagus is not or only partially encircled in the repair. This is important since encircling artificial meshes can erode the esophagus after 5-10 years.","Antonakis, Filimon; Köckerling, Ferdinand; Kallinowski, Friedrich",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2016.00016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27014698/,154

In this study we evaluate the potential role of myoglobin in predicting poor outcome in patients with Sars-Cov2 pneumonia. METHOD One hundred and twenty-one Sars-Cov 2 patients with average age of 69.9±13.2 years, and symptoms duration of 8.8±7.9 days were enrolled in the study. At the admission, the serum levels of myoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, fibrinogen, d-dimers, lactic dehydrogenase, troponin (Tn-I), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), complement fractions C3 and C4, immunoglobulins, interleukin 6 were evaluated. We also assessed the patients' complete clinical history and performed a thorough physical examination including age, disease history and medications. RESULTS Twenty-four (20%) patients died, and 18 (15%) patients required intensive care. The mean time between symptoms onset and death was 12.4 days ± 9.1. Univariate analysis of the patients' data highlighted some independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19, including higher neutrophils rate (HR: 1.171), lower lymphocytes rate (HR: 0.798), high CK-MB serum levels (HR: 1.6), high Tn-I serum levels (HR: 1.03), high myoglobin serum levels (HR: 1.014), Alzheimer (HR 5.8), and higher CRP values (HR: 1.011). Cox regression analysis model revealed that higher serum values of myoglobin (HR 1.003; 95%CI: 1.001-1.006; p=0.01), and CRP (HR 1.012; 95% CI: 1.001 - 1.023; p=0.035) could be predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients.The value of myoglobin level for predicting 28 days-mortality using ROC curve was 121.8 ng/dL. Lower survival rate was observed in patients with serum levels of myoglobin>121.8 ng/dL (84% vs 20% respectively, p=0.0001). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that higher serum levels of myoglobin could be considerable an effective predictor of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients; a careful follow-up in these patients is strongly suggested. The possibility of enhancing these findings in other cohorts of COVID-19 patients could validate the clinical value of myoglobin as a biomarker for worse prognosis in COVID-19.","Rotondo, Cinzia; Corrado, Addolorata; Colia, Ripalta; Maruotti, Nicola; Sciacca, Stefania; Lops, Lucia; Cici, Daniela; Mele, Angiola; Trotta, Antonello; Lacedonia, Donato; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; Cantatore, Francesco Paolo",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1949211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176427/,154

Its effectiveness has been examined in thousands of randomised control trials that have been synthesised into hundreds of systematic reviews. The aim of this overview is to map, synthesise and assess the reliability of evidence generated from these systematic reviews of the effectiveness of CBT across all health conditions, patient groups and settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will run our search strategy, to identify systematic reviews of CBT, within the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, and OpenGrey between January 1992 and 25 April 2018. Independent reviewers will sift, perform data extraction in duplicate and assess the quality of the reviews using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (V.2) tool. The outcomes of interest include: health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, psychosis and physical/physiological outcomes prioritised in the individual reviews. The evidence will be mapped and synthesised where appropriate by health problem, patient subgroups, intervention type, context and outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this is an overview of published systematic reviews. We plan to publish results in peer-reviewed journals and present at international and national academic, clinical and patient conferences.

The hydrophilic amino-pillar[5]arene was synthesized, which could form vesicles with the hydrophobic long-chain guest. This host-guest complex decreased the surface tension, which greatly promotes the spreading of droplets.

Analysis of gene transcription in virus-infected animal cells is problematic because virus infection often results in modified or fluctuating gene transcription patterns of conventionally used housekeeping genes, such as the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene and the β-actin gene. It has been demonstrated that the host 28S ribosomal gene can be used as a housekeeping gene in qRT-PCR in virus-infected insect cells. The stability of the human 28S rRNA gene transcription during the infection of HeLa cells with adenovirus has been confirmed, and this method has been extended to the use of the human 28S rRNA gene as a housekeeping gene in adenovirus-infected HeLa cells. Step-by-step instructions are described for use of this control in analysis of gene transcription in both types of virus-infected animal cells.","Xue, Jian-Li; Cheng, Xiao-Wen",Current protocols in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/9780471729259.mc01d02s19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21053249/,154
111843,Gut-brain actions underlying comorbid anxiety and depression associated with inflammatory bowel disease.,2018,"BACKGROUND The incidence and outcomes of respiratory viral infections in lung transplant recipients (LTR) are not well defined. The objective of this prospective study conducted from June 2008 to March 2011 was to characterise the incidence and outcomes of viral respiratory infections in LTR. METHODS Patients were seen in three contexts: study-specific screenings covering all seasons; routine post-transplantation follow-up; and emergency visits. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected systematically and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed when clinically indicated. All specimens underwent testing with a wide panel of molecular assays targeting respiratory viruses. RESULTS One hundred and twelve LTR had 903 encounters: 570 (63%) were screening visits, 124 (14%) were routine post-transplantation follow-up and 209 (23%) were emergency visits. Respiratory viruses were identified in 174 encounters, 34 of these via BAL. The incidence of infection was 0.83 per patient-year (95% CI 0.45 to 1.52). The viral infection rates upon screening, routine and emergency visits were 14%, 15% and 34%, respectively (p<0.001). Picornavirus was identified most frequently in nasopharyngeal (85/140; 60.7%) and BAL specimens (20/34; 59%). Asymptomatic viral carriage, mainly of picornaviruses, was found at 10% of screening visits. Infections were associated with transient lung function loss and high calcineurin inhibitor blood levels. The hospitalisation rate was 50% (95% CI 30% to 70.9%) for influenza and parainfluenza and 16.9% (95% CI 11.2% to 23.9%) for other viruses. Acute rejection was not associated with viral infection (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.3). CONCLUSIONS There is a high incidence of viral infection in LTR; asymptomatic carriage is rare. Viral infections contribute significantly to this population's respiratory symptomatology. No temporal association was observed between infection and acute rejection.","Bridevaux, Pierre-Olivier; Aubert, J-D; Soccal, P M; Mazza-Stalder, J; Berutto, C; Rochat, T; Turin, L; Van Belle, S; Nicod, L; Meylan, P; Wagner, G; Kaiser, Laurent",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24025442/,154

Obturator hernias, first described by Arnaud de Ronsil in 1724, are an uncommon type of hernia where intra-abdominal contents protrude through the obturator foramen. The following case highlights a rare presentation of bilateral obturator hernias with right femoral and inguinal hernia in an 82-year-old woman post-PD. This patient presented with 5 months of bilateral thigh pain and swelling and was found to only have a right-sided obturator hernia on computer tomography (CT) scan. Intraoperatively, bilateral obturator hernias were found along with right inguinal and femoral hernias, which were all repaired laparoscopically with polypropylene mesh. Postoperatively, the patient developed a self-limiting port site hematoma and resumed PD 1 month post-surgery. Due to the high morbidity and mortality from obturator hernias, prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative. Compared with open hernia repair, laparoscopic hernia repairs are associated with quicker return to usual activities and less persisting pain and numbness. This case portrays that laparoscopic approach to bilateral obturator hernias can be considered in patients post-PD.","Ramkumar, Jonathan; Lu, Daphne; Scott, Tracy",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.3747/pdi.2018.00203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692236/,154

Its application for coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms was investigated. METHODS Between December 2008 and January 2010, 150 aneurysms were treated with endovascular methods. In 18 cases of small aneurysms and/or increased parent vessel tortuosity, the DAC was used for additional support. Merits and complications related to the use of this catheter are reviewed. RESULTS The mean aneurysm size was 7.1 mm (range 3.5-25). In each case, the DAC was used as an intracranial platform catheter in close proximity to the target aneurysm. This catheter (outer diameter 3.9 or 4.3 French) increased the stability and reduced the redundancy of the microcatheter. As a result, handling and control of the microcatheter were improved. In three cases, the coiling procedure could not be completed because of difficulties not related to the DAC. Aneurysms in the remaining patients were treated successfully with complete (n=12) or near complete (n=3) angiographic occlusion. CONCLUSION For smaller or distal intracranial aneurysms with difficult access, use of the DAC as an additional platform in close proximity to the target aneurysm subjectively enhanced microcatheter control and safety.","Hauck, Erik F; Tawk, Rabih G; Karter, Nicholas S; Binning, Mandy J; Khalessi, Alexander A; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/jnis.2010.002535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21990813/,154

Our objective was to characterize motor activities throughout the entire colon that possessed persistent rhythmicity and spanning at least 5 cm. METHODS High-resolution colonic manometry using an 84-channel water-perfused catheter was performed in 19 healthy volunteers. Rhythmic activity was assessed during baseline, proximal balloon distention, meal, and bisacodyl administration. KEY RESULTS Throughout the entire colon, a cyclic motor pattern occurred either in isolation or following a high-amplitude propagating pressure wave (HAPW), consisting of clusters of pressure waves at a frequency centered on 11-13 cycles/min, unrelated to breathing. The cluster duration was 1-6 minutes; the pressure waves traveled for 8-27 cm, lasting 5-8 seconds. The clusters itself could be rhythmic at 0.5-2 cpm. The propagation direction of the individual pressure waves was mixed with >50% occurring simultaneous. This high-frequency cyclic motor pattern co-existed with the well-known low-frequency cyclic motor pattern centered on 3-4 cpm. In the rectum, the low-frequency cyclic motor pattern dominated, propagating predominantly in retrograde direction. Proximal balloon distention, a meal and bisacodyl administration induced HAPWs followed by cyclic motor patterns. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES Within cyclic motor patterns, retrograde propagating, low-frequency pressure waves dominate in the rectum, likely keeping the rectum empty; and mixed propagation, high-frequency pressure waves dominate in the colon, likely promoting absorption and storage, hence contributing to continence. Propagation and frequency characteristics are likely determined by network properties of the interstitial cells of Cajal.","Pervez, Maham; Ratcliffe, Elyanne; Parsons, Sean P; Chen, Ji-Hong; Huizinga, Jan D",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32124528/,154

The bleeding is caused by tension on the closing sutures, whether or not pledgets have been used. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman who underwent an uneventful mitral valve replacement. After cardiopulmonary bypass was terminated, brisk bleeding started from high in the posterior left ventricular wall, typical of a type III defect. We undertook external repair, placing a plug of Teflon felt into the cavity of the rupture and sandwiching it into place with pledgeted mattress and figure-of-8 sutures. The space occupied by the plug decreased the distance needed to obliterate the defect and thereby reduced the tension on the sutures necessary to achieve hemostasis. This simple technique enabled closure of the defect and avoided collateral tears that would have compromised an otherwise successful repair. Two years postoperatively, the patient had normal mitral valve function and no left ventricular aneurysm. In addition to reporting the patient's case, we review the types of left ventricular rupture that can occur during mitral valve replacement and discuss the various repair options.","Lee, Myles E; Tamboli, Mallika; Lee, Anthony W",Texas Heart Institute journal,https://doi.org/10.14503/thij-12-2931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808783/,154

New-generation Penumbra catheters (MAX series) and stent retrievers were introduced in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The aim of this study was to clarify the general status and trends in endovascular reperfusion therapy for stroke in Japan from 2010 to 2014. We extracted a total of 3705 patients (72.1 ± 12.2 years, 1482 women) from a nationwide study of patients receiving any neuroendovascular treatment, the Japanese Registry of NeuroEndovascular Therapy 3. Reperfusion therapy resulted in a successful reperfusion rate of 59%, and 31% of patients achieved a favorable outcome at 30 days of onset. The frequency of Merci-including procedures increased to 52% in the first half of 2011, but conversely decreased to 1% in the second half of 2014. The frequency of Penumbra-including procedures increased from 18% in the second half of 2011 to 67% in the first half of 2014, decreasing to 38% in the second half of 2014. The reperfusion rate and 30-day clinical outcomes remained almost unchanged until June 2013, and started to improve thereafter, coincident with the introduction and spread of newer-generation devices. The rate of successful reperfusion reached 71-76%, and 36-38% of patients achieved a favorable outcome in 2014. After multivariate adjustment for preprocedure variables, the calendar period from 2013 to 2014 was significantly associated with improvement in reperfusion rates and clinical outcomes.","Hayakawa, Mikito; Matsumaru, Yuji; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Satow, Tetsu; Iihara, Koji; Sakai, Nobuyuki",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.2176/nmc.oa.2019-0267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009126/,154
118045,Clinical Reasoning: A 64 year-old woman with progressive leg weakness and ophthalmoplegia.,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) is a widely used minimally invasive surgery. Following LDG, Billroth-I (B-I) provides physiological reconstruction by preserving the duodenal passage but results in a high incidence of reflux esophagitis that decreases postoperative quality of life. Because of this, Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction is often considered the first choice after LDG. However, very few studies have investigated differences in physiological function between B-I and R-Y after LDG. We hypothesized that B-I would outperform R-Y in clinical and physiological outcomes, including nutrition parameters. METHODS We compared hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, Vitamin B12, 25(OH)-Vitamin D (V-D), body weight, and gastric emptying after LDG in patients with either B-I or R-Y reconstruction. RESULTS The levels of hemoglobin in the B-I group were significantly higher than that in the R-Y group at all time points later than 6 months postsurgery. The ferritin levels were significantly higher in the B-I group at all time points later than 9 months postsurgery. The concentration of serum V-D in the B-I group was significantly higher than that in the R-Y group at 1 year 6 months, 1 year 9 months, and 2 years after surgery. Gastric emptying in the R-Y group was significantly slower than in the B-I group. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that B-I leads to less postsurgical iron deficiency anemia and V-D deficiency compared with R-Y reconstruction. Furthermore, gastric emptying was preserved in B-I reconstruction compared with R-Y reconstruction. In conclusion, after LDG, B-I reconstruction seems to cause fewer nutritional complications than R-Y reconstruction.","Toyomasu, Yoshitaka; Ogata, Kyoichi; Suzuki, Masaki; Yanoma, Toru; Kimura, Akiharu; Kogure, Norimichi; Ohno, Tetsuro; Kamiyama, Yoichi; Mochiki, Erito; Kuwano, Hiroyuki","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180143/,154
118401,Exploration of CT manifestations of different clinical types of novel coronavirus pneumonia.,2020-12-02,"OBJECTIVE To compare our initial robotic-assisted nephroureterectomy (RAN) experience with a well-established practice of performing laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LN) to treat upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). METHODS We reviewed our prospectively maintained minimally invasive surgery database. Patients who underwent RAN from April 2009 to December 2011 were matched by pathologic tumor stage and age (± 10 years) to those who underwent LN. RESULTS Twenty-two matched pairs were evaluated. Mean operative time (298 vs 251 minutes) and estimated blood loss (EBL, 380 vs 233 mL) were significantly higher for RAN, with a greater need for transfusion in this group. Complication rates were similar. The RAN group trended toward more frequent lymph node dissection and greater median node count when lymph node dissection was performed (59% vs 27% [P = .07] and 5.5 vs 1.0 [P = .13]). After a median follow-up of 10 months for RAN and 15 months for LN, no significant difference was seen in the rate of bladder (36% vs 37%) or distant (32% vs 23%) recurrence, with similar median time to any recurrence (9 months vs 4 months, P = .32). CONCLUSION RAN was associated with higher operative time and blood loss likely because of more frequent use of node dissection, robot repositioning, and technical inexperience. Lymph node dissection was more frequently performed with RAN, which reflects surgeon practice patterns. When a lymph node dissection was performed, the median node count was greater with RAN. Our initial experience with RAN suggests that this is an acceptable approach for the management of UTUC.","Ambani, Sapan N; Weizer, Alon Z; Wolf, J Stuart; He, Chang; Miller, David C; Montgomery, Jeffrey S",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2013.07.079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24315310/,154

118938,Mild and moderate Mannose Binding Lectin deficiency are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis in Brazilian patients.,2016,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, procedural results, and 6-month outcomes of a novel transfemoral transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) system (Cephea) in patients with complex primary mitral regurgitation (MR). BACKGROUND TMVI is emerging as an alternative to surgery in patients with severe MR. To date, the great majority of TMVI systems use the transapical surgical approach. METHODS This study included consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TMVI with the Cephea valve system. All patients were suboptimal candidates for catheter-based repair for anatomic reasons. Patients underwent clinical, echocardiographic, and computed tomographic angiographic follow-up at 6 months. Main outcomes were procedural success, peri-procedural complications, and valve hemodynamic status early and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS Three patients with severe primary MR (2 women, mean age 79 ± 3 years) at prohibitive surgical risk (mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score 13.8 ± 2.4%) were included. The valves were successfully implanted in all patients, with no procedural complications. Post-procedural echocardiography showed normal valve function in all patients (mean transvalvular gradient 3 mm Hg; range: 2 to 4 mm Hg), no moderate to severe valvular or paravalvular leak, and no clinically significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. At 6 months, all patients had improved quality of life (mean improvement vs. baseline 16.4 ± 12 points). All valve hemodynamic parameters were maintained. Computed tomographic angiography confirmed annular stability, proper valve geometry and no structural failure. CONCLUSIONS The transfemoral delivery of a purposely designed mitral prosthesis (Cephea valve) was safe and feasible in prohibitive risk patients. Valve performance was sustained, and clinical outcomes improved at 6 months. Larger clinical studies are required.","Alperi, Alberto; Dagenais, François; Del Val, David; Bernier, Mathieu; Vahl, Torsten P; Khalique, Omar K; Modine, Thomas; Granada, Juan F; Rodés-Cabau, Josep",JACC.

119152,Senile-onset Tourette Syndrome: A Case Report.,2020,"OBJECTIVE To directly compare the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction (smell and taste) in geographically distinct regions with the same questionnaires. METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (older than 18 years) who underwent COVID-19 testing at an ambulatory assessment center in Canada and at a hospital in Israel between March 16, 2020, and August 19, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction (anosmia/hypomsia and dysgeusia/ageusia). Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the prevalence of chemosensory deficits among the outpatients. RESULTS We identified a total of 350 COVID-19-positive patients (138 Canadians and 212 Israelis). The overall prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction was 47.1%. There was a higher proportion of chemosensory deficits among Canadians compared to Israelis (66.7% vs 34.4%, P < .01). A subgroup analysis for outpatients (never hospitalized) still identified a higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction among Canadians compared to Israelis (68.2% vs 36.1%, P < 0.01). A majority of patients recovered their sense of smell after 4 weeks of symptom onset. CONCLUSION Although the prevalence of chemosensory deficit in COVID-19 was found to be similar to previously published reports, the prevalence can vary significantly across different geographical regions. Therefore, it is important to obtain regionally specific data so that the symptom of anosmia/dysgeusia can be used as a guide for screening for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.","Lee, Daniel J; Daliyot, Daniella; Wang, Ri; Lockwood, Joel; Das, Paul; Zimlichman, Eyal; Lee, John M","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/01455613211000170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729897/,154
119196,"Osteomyelitis, diabetic foot ulcers and the role of the community nurse.",2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to assess locality of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in cervical carcinoma and examine factors affecting bilateral SLN detection. METHODS This was a retrospective review of SLN data (anatomical location, count and laterality) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion to stage IIA) using intraoperative gamma probe and blue dye. The preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography was used to detect laterality, number of the SLNs, and rare locations. Patients were treated between January 2005 to January 2015 at the West Kent Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Maidstone Hospital, Maidstone, United Kingdom. RESULTS A total of 132 women were investigated. The most common SLN location was the external iliac (38.6%) followed by obturator (25.3%) and internal iliac (23.6%) regions. A small percentage was identified in presacral (1.4%) and para-aortic regions (0.7%). Older age (P = 0.01) and an elevated body mass index (P = 0.03) were associated with decreased SLN count by preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography, and only age affected SLN count by gamma probe (P = 0.01). Initial surgery, large loop excision of the transformation zone, or cone biopsy of the cervix had no effect on SLN count. There was no difference observed in bilateral detection with respect to surgical approach (open: n = 48/laparoscopic: n = 84). However, older age was independently associated with a decrease in bilateral SLN detection (P = 0.003). In these patients who underwent unilateral full pelvic lymphadenectomy, all the nonsentinel nodes were negative. CONCLUSIONS The majority of SLNs were located in the external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac regions. Both older age and an elevated body mass index were associated with a reduced SLN count. Unilateral detection of SLN was independently associated with older age, which may be due to sclerosis in the lymphatic vessels or reduced perfusion in the pelvis in these women. If no SLN is detected on one side, the consensus is to perform a full pelvic lymphadenectomy on that side of the pelvis.","Wuntakal, Rekha; Papadopoulos, Andreas John; Montalto, Stephen Attard; Perovic, Milica; Coutts, Michael; Devaja, Omer",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0000000000000539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270124/,154

We considered psychological distress, quarantine status, social distancing and self-medication in China and the UK. METHODS We conducted online surveys in China (N=1135) and the UK (N=1293), beginning in March 2020. Participants indicated demographics, whether they were in quarantine, relationship status, social distancing, use of vitamins/traditional medicines and completed the K6 scale of psychological distress. RESULTS 19.1% of the respondents in China were at risk of severe mental illness (SMI: 95% CI 16.9% to 21.6%) and 16.6% (95% CI 14.6% to 18.8%) in the UK. Risk of SMI was among those in quarantine (OR 11.18 (95% CI 4.08 to 30.62); p=0.001) and in younger respondents (OR 2.61 (95% CI 1.01 to 6.79); p=0.048) although the latter effect was significant only in the UK. Risk of SMI was positively associated with self-medication (βs=0.17, p=0.001) and negatively with social distancing in China (country×SMI β=0.51, p=0.001), with further interactions for age and sex (social distancing), age, marital status and quarantine (self-medication). DISCUSSION Across the countries, quarantine was associated with poorer mental health, while greater psychological distress was associated with greater self-medication rate. Future work should explore further cross-national variations in psychological health and behaviours during pandemics.","Goodwin, Robin; Hou, Wai Kai; Sun, Shaojing; Ben-Ezra, Menachem",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967892/,154

Bacterial meningitis is usually lethal unless appropriate antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier are given. Clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis begins when patients present with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, and meningismus. RECENT FINDINGS New technologies are being developed for more rapid identification of the bacterial species causing meningitis. When appropriate, administration of adjunctive dexamethasone with the antibiotics often lessens neurologic sequelae in survivors, which may include aphasia, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment. SUMMARY Confirmation of the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis comes mainly from examination and culture of CSF obtained from a lumbar puncture. Typically, the CSF shows an elevated neutrophil count, elevated protein, depressed glucose, positive Gram stain, and growth of the bacteria on appropriate culture media. Antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria determine the appropriate antibiotics, although an educated guess of the best antibiotics to be given promptly must be made until the antibiotic sensitivities return, usually in a few days.","Davis, Larry E",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000000660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30273239/,154

The need for oxygen therapy is an important factor determining hospital admission of these patients. Our retrospective study was designed to identify risk factors associated with the progression to oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients. A total of 133 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital from February 22, 2020, to August 23. After excluding asymptomatic, non-Japanese, pediatric, pregnant patients and also those who needed oxygen immediately at admission, data of the remaining 84 patients were analyzed. The patients were separated into those who required oxygen after admission and those who did not, and their characteristics were compared. Age, body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis identified four significant and independent risk factors of oxygen requirement, including advanced age, obesity, glucose intolerance and lymphocytopenia. Dividing the patients into subgroups according to the number of these risk factors found in each patient indicated that the need for oxygen increased with higher number of these risk factors in the same individual. Our results suggest that the presence of higher number of these risk factors in COVID-19 patients is associated with future oxygen requirement and that this index can be potentially useful in triaging COVID-19 patients staying home in the context of need for hospitalization.","Okauchi, Yukiyoshi; Matsuno, Kanae; Nishida, Tsutomu; Sawada, Koichi; Kawasaki, Akiko; Ito, Naohiko; Morimura, Osamu; Otani, Yasushi; Yokoe, Masaru; Abe, Kinya; Iwahashi, Hiromi",Endocrine journal,https://doi.org/10.1507/endocrj.ej20-0784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762519/,154
121689,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induced pneumonitis in an immunocompetent adult: A case report.,2020,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive syndrome presenting with retinal dystrophy, cognitive impairment, and obesity. BBS is characterized by elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the early stages of adipocyte and retinal development. BBS expression in the CNS and indications of hippocampal dysgenesis suggest neural development abnormalities. However, the role of BBS in ER stress in neuronal cells has not yet been studied. Therefore, we aimed at studying the role of BBS4 in neuronal development under normal and ER stress conditions. ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) were studied in BBS4-silenced (SiBBS4) SH-SY5Y cells during differentiation under normal and stress states, using molecular and biochemical markers. ER stress was demonstrated at early neural differentiation, with significantly augmented expression of UPR markers corresponding to BBS4 expression. In the undifferentiated state, BBS4 silencing resulted in significantly reduced ER-stress markers' expression under normal and ER-stress states. Independent of ER stress, SiBBS4 cells demonstrated significant reduction in activated phospho-IRE1α. Under BBS4 silencing, both sXBP-1 and activated ATF6α p50 failed to translocate to the nucleus. Transcript levels of apoptosis markers were upregulated under BBS4 depletion and ER-stress induction, corresponding to decreased viability. BBS4 depletion in neuronal cells results in reduced sensitivity to ER stress during differentiation and under ER-stress induction, partly due to failure in translocation of ER-transcription factors (TF) sXBP-1 and ATF6α p50 to the nucleus. Hence, BBS4 is essential for nuclear transport under ER-stress response in neuronal cells during early differentiation. Our studies shed light on molecular mechanisms through which BBS4 malfunction alters neuronal ER stress response.","Horwitz, Avital; Birk, Ruth",Molecular neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-020-02104-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894499/,154

Previous studies have shown that the BAC improves the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by subsequent coagulation by decreasing non-coagulable dissolved organic carbon (NC-DOC). However, the actual mechanism of such observation or optimising strategies of NC-DOC removal is unknown. The impact of backwashing on BAC reactor performance in terms of NC-DOC removal and microbial community structure was investigated. A laboratory scale BAC column was operated for more than five months with backwashing at once every five days, but in one cycle it was operated without backwashing for 14 days and the effluent collected at different times from the last backwash was subjected to enhanced coagulation (EC). All the effluent of BAC collected at different days depicted better floc forming characteristics than the feed water which is raw surface water. The effluent collected on day three from the last backwash (BAC-3d) contained the least amount (1.64 mg/L) of NC-DOC despite the highest DOC (3.89 mg/L) of all effluents. The coagulant requirement (5 mg-Fe3+/mg-DOC) was minimal for BAC-3d effluent among raw water and all other BAC effluent water samples. This is remarkable given the raw water contained 2.76 mg/L of NC-DOC. The microbial community on BAC granules on day three contained a higher abundance of biodegradable organic matter (BOM) removing microorganisms and low abundance of opportunistic pathogens. Similar performance in terms of DOC removal with the backwash was also observed in the continuous operation of other BAC columns. Possible backwash frequency that optimises the BAC/EC and derives many other benefits is proposed. The BAC/EC combination could help solve many emerging issues cost-effectively hence, needs further investigation.","Korotta-Gamage, Shashika Madushi; Sathasivan, Arumugam; Bal Krishna, K C",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932678/,154

By January 2021, number of confirmed cumulative cases crossed ∼104 million worldwide. Till date, no effective treatment or drug is available for this virus. Availability of X-ray structures of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro) provides the potential opportunity for structure-based drug designing. Here, we have made an attempt to do computational drug design by targeting main protease of SARS-CoV2. High-throughput virtual screening of million molecules and natural compounds databases were performed followed by docking. After that, the protein-ligand complexes were optimized and rescoring of binding energies were accomplished through molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area approaches, respectively. In addition, conformational effect of various ligands on protein was also examined through essential dynamics simulation. Three compounds namely ZINC14732869, ZINC19774413, and ZINC19774479 were finally filtered that displayed better binding affinities than N3 (known) inhibitor and formed conformationally stable complexes.

Phenylephrine is however reported to reduce the near infrared spectroscopy-determined frontal lobe oxygenation (ScO2) but whether that is the case for patients exposed to spinal anesthesia is not known. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of phenylephrine vs. ephedrine on ScO2during caesarean section with spinal anesthesia in a single center, open-label parallel-group study with balanced randomization of 24 women (1:1). Secondary aims were to compare the effect of the two drugs on maternal hemodynamics and fetal heart rate. INTERVENTION Ephedrine (0.8-3.3 mg/min) vs. phenylephrine infusion (0.02-0.07 mg/min). RESULTS For the duration of surgery, administration of ephedrine maintained ScO2 (compared to baseline +2.1 ± 2.8%; mean ± SE, while phenylephrine reduced ScO2 (-8.6 ± 2.8%; p = 0.005) with a 10.7% difference in ScO2between groups (p = 0.0106). Also maternal heart rate was maintained with ephedrine (+3 ± 3 bpm) but decreased with phenylephrine (-11 ± 3 bpm); difference 14 bpm (p = 0.0053), but no significant difference in mean arterial pressure (p = 0.1904) or CO (p = 0.0683) was observed between groups. The two drugs also elicited an equal increase in fetal heart rate (by 19 ± 3 vs. 18 ± 3 bpm; p = 0.744). CONCLUSION In the choice between phenylephrine and ephedrine for maintenance of blood pressure during caesarean section with spinal anesthesia, ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation and maternal heart rate with a similar increase in fetal heart rate as elicited by phenylephrine.

128192,Prehabilitation for kidney transplant candidates: Is it time?,2017,"BACKGROUND The knot configurations used in clinical practice often are based on tradition and previous training. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that knot quality improves with the addition of a single throw in two-throw and three-throw knots. We tested this hypothesis by using commonly used knot configurations and suture materials. METHODS Three suture materials, SURGIPRO, BIOSYN and POLYSORB, of 3-0 caliber were used. The break force and integrated force of each material, a single-hitch throw on each material, and 2160 knots of six configurations were measured by using tensiometry. The knot quality scores (KQS) of the different knot configurations were compared by using nonparametric tests. RESULTS A single-hitch throw on the suture material reduced the break force by up to 40%. The addition of an extra throw improved KQS in 2 x 1 x 1, 2 x 2, and 2 x 2 x 1 knots. The four-throw knot configurations resulted in high KQS and low slippage rates. The 2 x 2 knots were most likely to slip and had the lowest KQS. CONCLUSIONS If a double-hitch throw is used in the first throw, two to three further throws are recommended. The four-throw knot configurations have the best knot qualities and should generally be used.","Lee, Alex C H; Fahmy, Ramy R R; Hanna, George B",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-008-9764-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843441/,154
129022,Robot-assisted combined pancreatectomy/hepatectomy for metastatic pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma: case report and review of the literature.,2020-06-25,"PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Osteoarthritis, a degenerative non-inflammatory joint disease, is common in cats, usually causing gradual changes in behavior and lifestyle rather than severe lameness. Inflammatory arthritis occurs much less frequently and is nearly always associated with debilitating lameness. It may have an infectious or immune-mediated cause - but, unlike the canine disease, is much more likely to be infectious in origin. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Cats with inflammatory joint disease are presented for evaluation of lethargy, anorexia, reluctance to walk or fever. Synovial fluid collection and analysis is required to confirm joint inflammation, but this is a procedure many veterinarians are not comfortable performing in cats. Once inflammatory arthritis is confirmed, extensive testing is required to diagnose infectious causes and determine appropriate treatment. Immune-mediated polyarthritis can be treated with immunosuppressive drugs only after all infectious possibilities are eliminated. Radiographs are used to characterize the arthritis as erosive or nonerosive, but radiographic changes in cats are often subtle compared with those described in canine rheumatoid-like arthritis. AUDIENCE This review, aimed at all veterinarians who treat cats, describes the general clinical approach to feline joint disease, the collection and analysis of synovial fluid, and the diagnosis and management of inflammatory joint diseases affecting cats. The diagnostic approach to an unusual case of erosive polyarthritis is discussed in the Case Notes. EVIDENCE BASE To date, the veterinary literature on inflammatory joint disease in cats has been limited to older reviews of immune-mediated disorders and multiple single case reports or small case series describing infectious disorders. This article offers a current comprehensive review of these disorders.","Lemetayer, Julie; Taylor, Susan",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x14539086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24966280/,154

This work concentrates on weakening the interaction of Fe-La in an A-site-deficient perovskite (La0.8FeO3-δ) via Ni partial substitution. After reductive treatment, the catalysts were employed for thermocatalytic synthesis of CNTs from plastics. Following the structural, morphological and chemical changes, the catalytic activities of the reductive La0.8NixFe1-xO3-δ (H-LNxF1-x, x = 0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) were correlated with the degree of MSI. Compared with H-LF sample, the H-LN0.15F0.85 sample exhibited the highest catalytic activity, which was attributable to the highest surface coverage of metals as well as the synergistic effect of Fe and Ni species. The yield of CNTs produced from low density polyethylene was 1.44 g/gcatalyst over the H-LN0.15F0.85 sample, which was much higher than that over H-LF sample (0.38 g/gcatalyst).","Jia, Jingbo; Veksha, Andrei; Lim, Teik-Thye; Lisak, Grzegorz",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818833/,154
129279,Iatrogenic haemoperitoneum requiring transfusion after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement: case report.,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND Prior studies have shown peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to have lower or equivalent mortality to patients who receive in-center hemodialysis (HD). Medicare's 2011 bundled dialysis prospective payment system encouraged expansion of home-based PD with unclear impacts on patient outcomes. This paper revisits the comparative risk of mortality between HD and PD among patients with incident end-stage kidney disease initiating dialysis in 2006-2013. RESEARCH DESIGN We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing 2-year all-cause mortality among patients with incident end-stage kidney disease initiating dialysis via HD and PD in 2006-2013, using data from the US Renal Data System and Medicare. Analysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazards models fit with inverse probability of treatment weighting that adjusted for measured patient demographic and clinical characteristics and dialysis market characteristics. RESULTS Of the 449,652 patients starting dialysis between 2006 and 2013, the rate of PD use in the first 90 days increased from 9.3% of incident patients in 2006 to 14.2% in 2013. Crude 2-year mortality was 27.6% for patients dialyzing via HD and 16.7% for patients on PD. In adjusted models, there was no evidence of mortality differences between PD and HD before and after bundled payment (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.04; P=0.33). CONCLUSIONS Overall mortality for HD and PD use was similar and mortality differences between modalities did not change before versus after the 2011 Medicare dialysis bundled payment, suggesting that increased use of home-based PD did not adversely impact patient outcomes.","Wang, Virginia; Coffman, Cynthia J; Sanders, Linda L; Hoffman, Abby; Sloan, Caroline E; Lee, Shoou-Yih D; Hirth, Richard A; Maciejewski, Matthew L",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33234917/,154
129299,How should we define and classify exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,2013,"AIM To report the clinical and radiographic outcomes of implant-supported fixed dental prostheses with cantilever extensions (FDPCs) after a function time ≥ 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with FDPCs in posterior areas were clinically and radiographically re-evaluated. Mesial and distal radiographic marginal bone levels (mBLs) from baseline (i.e. delivery of FDPC) to the follow-up examination were calculated and compared between implant surfaces adjacent to and distant from the cantilever extension. Implant survival rate, pocket probing depth (PPD), presence/absence of bleeding on probing (BoP) and presence/absence of mechanical/technical and biological complications were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-six patients with 30 FDPCs supported by 60 implants were re-evaluated after a mean loading time of 13.3 ± 2.7 years (range: 10-18.6 years). One diameter-reduced implant carrying a cantilever extension fractured, yielding a patient-based survival rate of 96.2% (95% CI: 0.95/1.0). The mean marginal bone level change was not statistically significantly different from baseline to follow-up (1.2 mm ± 0.9 to 1.6 mm ± 1.7; 95% CI: -0.1/0.9; p>0.05). The mean PPD changed statistically significantly from 3.4 mm ± 0.7 to 3.7 mm ± 0.7 (95% CI: 0.04/0.6; p=0.02). Loss of retention occurred ≥ 1x in 9 patients (34.6%, 95% CI: 0.44/0.83). At follow-up, peri-implant health was diagnosed in 12 (46.2%), peri-implant mucositis in 7 (26.9%) and peri-implantitis in 7 (26.9%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION Despite a high rate of loss of retention, the use of implant-supported FDPCs in posterior areas represents a reliable long-term treatment option with a high implant survival rate and minimal peri-implant bone level changes irrespective of the location of the cantilever extension.","Schmid, Eric; Morandini, Michele; Roccuzzo, Andrea; Ramseier, Christoph A; Sculean, Anton; Salvi, Giovanni E",Clinical oral implants research,https://doi.org/10.1111/clr.13672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991763/,154

PATIENTS A 80-year-old man was referred to our department because of a visual defect in his right eye. His best corrected decimal visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.7 (Snellen equivalent [SE], 20/30). METHODS A fundus examination revealed clustered temporal juxafoveal microaneurysms and foveal CME. The patient refused to undergo conventional treatments, including direct retinal photocoagulation for microaneurysms, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection, and intravitreal triamcinolone injection. However, he provided consent to undergo cystotomy and en bloc removal of the fibrinogen-rich component of the cystoid lesion. RESULTS His BCVA was 0.2 (SE, 20/100) just before the surgery. A 27-gauge vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling was performed. Cystotomy was performed during the surgery, and the fibrinogen clot visible in the cystoid cavity was also removed. CME rapidly disappeared after the surgery. Three years postoperatively, the patient had BCVA of 0.5 (SE, 20/40) at the last medical examination, and the CME had not recurred. CONCLUSION Cystotomy and en bloc removal of the fibrinogen-rich component of the cystoid lesion could be valid treatment options for CME secondary to MacTel type 1.","Maki, Hitomi; Imai, Hisanori; Yamada, Hiroko; Tetsumoto, Akira; Hayashida, Mayuka; Otsuka, Keiko; Miki, Akiko; Nakamura, Makoto",Retinal cases & brief reports,https://doi.org/10.1097/icb.0000000000001117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411468/,154

Postgraduate (PG) training in general medicine requires reorientation to meet the healthcare needs of India. In this pilot study, we designed a secondary hospital (SH) posting for medicine PGs to sensitize them to the practice of medicine and challenges in a rural SH setting. Methods. PG trainees in general medicine were sent for a 2-week rotation to select SHs. A faculty coordinator from the teaching hospital facilitated the programme. The SH faculty used qualitative tools to assess the performance of the trainees. The trainees also evaluated the programme using open- and close-ended questionnaires. Results Eighteen PG trainees in general medicine were posted to six rural SHs. Data analysis showed that the training exposure provided sensitization to the challenges of medical practice in such settings and the need to be multicompetent. Seventeen (94%) trainees felt that they gained insight into the issues that are specific for practice at an SH and >80% expressed confidence about the knowledge and skills gained during that exposure to enhance medical practice in a resource-limited setting. They were also sensitized to various issues of secondary care including skills of multi-competence, the ability to handle a wide variety of cases with limited investigations, a cost-effective approach, decision-making on referrals, procedural competence and flexibility to adapt to new situations. Conclusion. A short SH posting can positively sensitize PGs to the practice of medicine and challenges in secondary care settings.","Victor, Punitha; Chandy, Gina; George, Krupa; Zachariah, Anand",The National medical journal of India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0970-258x.295959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985449/,154

132495,Drugs and the renin-angiotensin system in covid-19.,2020-04-02,"PURPOSE Most cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas (CSDAVF) are unilateral; however, simultaneous bilateral CSDAVFs occasionally may be found. This article reports on 141 patients and compares the angioarchitecture and outcomes of embolization of bilateral CSDAVFs with those of unilateral CSDAVFs, with reference to limited demographics (sex and age) of the patients. METHOD From January 2010 to February 2018 a total of 141 consecutive patients with CSDAVFs were referred for transvenous embolization. Bilateral CSDAVFs were found in 20 patients (14.2%, with a mean age of 62.2 years). The angioarchitecture of the 141 patients with CSDAVFs were evaluated by conventional cerebral angiography. We compared the angioarchitecture and treatment outcomes of 20 bilateral and 121 unilateral CSDAVFs, and in relation to the patients' sex and age. RESULTS Female patients significantly dominated the bilateral CSDAVFs (90%, p = 0.043). Bilateral eye symptoms were significantly more common in bilateral CSDAVFs (p = 0.011), with dominant orbital and cavernous symptoms, and showed statistical significance (p = 0.049 and 0.011, respectively). Occlusion of one CSDAVF may significantly decrease the fistula flow of the other untreated side (n = 13, 65%), leading to less coil utilization for embolization in bilateral CSDAVFs (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance in the occurrence of occlusion of the inferior petrous sinus(s), in pial vein reflux, and treatment outcomes in the unilateral and bilateral CSDAVFs. CONCLUSION Bilateral CSDAVFs were more dominant in female patients and frequently presented with orbital and cavernous symptoms. Fewer coils were used per lesion in the bilateral CSDAVFs. There was no statistical significance in bilateral and unilateral CSDAVFs in terms of impact of venous drainage, pial vein reflux and treatment outcomes.","Fay, Li-Yu; Luo, Chao-Bao; Chen, Liang-Wei; Wu, Jau-Ching; Wu, Chieh-Hsin; Chang, Feng-Chi; Lin, Chung-Jung",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-019-00868-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31853611/,154

Excavating antiviral active components from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a promising anti-IAV strategy. Our previous studies have demonstrated that 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (DAP), a major ingredient of a TCM herb called Andrographis paniculata, shows anti-IAV activity that is mainly effective against A/chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1), A/duck/Hubei/XN/2007 (H5N1), and A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying anti-IAV molecular mechanism of DAP needs further investigation. In the present work, we found that DAP can significantly inhibit the apoptosis of human lung epithelial (A549) cells infected with A/chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1). After DAP treatment, the protein expression levels of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9, and the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in H5N1-infected A549 cells were all obviously downregulated. However, DAP had no inhibitory effect on caspase-8 activity and cleaved caspase-8 production. Meanwhile, the efficacy of DAP in reducing the apoptotic cells was lost after using the inhibitor of caspase-3 or caspase-9 but remained intact after the caspase-8 inhibitor treatment. Moreover, DAP efficiently attenuated the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and decreased the protein expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial fraction. Furthermore, the silencing of caspase-9 reduced the yield of nucleoprotein (NP) and disabled the inhibitory ability of DAP in NP production in A549 cells. Overall results suggest that DAP exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting H5N1-induced apoptosis on the caspase-9-dependent intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway, which may be one of the anti-H5N1 mechanisms of DAP.","Cai, Wentao; Wen, Haimei; Zhou, Qinyang; Wu, Lei; Chen, Yong; Zhou, Hongbo; Jin, Meilin",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702348/,154

It obviates prior knowledge of CTL and Th epitopes in the antigen and leads to the presentation of multiple epitopes for several HLA alleles. Here we studied the migration capacity and the antigen expression of mRNA-electroporated DC (mRNA-DC) in lymph nodes after vaccination in melanoma patients. DC were electroporated with mRNA encoding gp100 or tyrosinase, labeled with indium-111 and superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, and injected intranodally in melanoma patients 24 to 48 hours before scheduled dissection of regional lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical analysis of the lymph nodes after surgery revealed that mRNA-DC migrated from the injection site into the T-cell areas of the same and subsequent lymph nodes, where they expressed the antigen encoded by the electroporated mRNA. Furthermore, vaccine-related CD8(+) T-cell responses could be detected in 7 of 11 patients vaccinated with mRNA-DC. Together these data show that mature DC electroporated with mRNA encoding TAA migrate and express antigens in the lymph nodes and induce specific immune responses.","Schuurhuis, Danita H; Verdijk, Pauline; Schreibelt, Gerty; Aarntzen, Erik H J G; Scharenborg, Nicole; de Boer, Annemiek; van de Rakt, Mandy W M M; Kerkhoff, Marieke; Gerritsen, Marie-Jeanne P; Eijckeler, Femke; Bonenkamp, Johannes J; Blokx, Willeke; van Krieken, J Han; Boerman, Otto C; Oyen, Wim J G; Punt, Cornelis J A; Figdor, Carl G; Adema, Gosse J; de Vries, I Jolanda M",Cancer research,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-08-3920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19318559/,154

AIM To evaluate the technical aspects and results of single port cholecystectomy. METHOD Were analyzed 170 patients between 18-74 years submitted to videolaparoscopic cholecystectomies by single port, regardless of elective or urgent indication, without restriction of patient selection. RESULTS Among the 170 operations, 158 were exclusively performed by single port, and the conversion rate was 7% (inclusion of other accessory trocars or conversion to multiportal). Conversion to open surgery occurred in three cases (1.76%). The mean surgical time was 67.97 min, showing a marked decrease when was reached close to 50 cases and a stabilization after 100 surgeries. The overall complication rate was 10%, with minor complications such as: incisional pain, hematomas, granulomas, port access hernias (9.41%). CONCLUSION Single port cholecystectomy can, after standardization and surgical team training, be a safe surgical procedure associated with a recognized aesthetic advantage.","Favaro, Murillo de Lima; Gabor, Silvio; Pedroso, Ruy Francisco Pimentel; Ribeiro, Ligia; Rosa, Otto Mauro; Ribeiro-Junior, Marcelo Augusto Fontenelle",Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-672020180001e1388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133680/,154
136037,The Sequelae of Metallosis Resulting in Skin Pigmentation and Tattooing: A Case Presentation and Literature Review.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE MRI is routinely performed following brain AVM after treatment in children. Our aim was to determine the predictive values of contrast-enhanced MR imaging and TOF-MRA for brain AVM recurrence in children, compared with conventional angiography and the role of 3D rotational angiography-MR imaging fusion in these cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included all pediatric patients with brain AVMs during an 18-year period with angiographically documented obliteration after treatment. Patients underwent 3T MR imaging, including contrast-enhanced MR imaging, TOF-MRA, and conventional angiography, with a subset undergoing 3D rotational angiography. The predictive values of contrast-enhanced MR imaging and TOF-MRA for brain AVM recurrence were determined. CTA sections reconstructed from 3D rotational angiography were coregistered with and fused to 3D-T1WI for analysis. RESULTS Thirty-nine children (10.8 ± 3.9 years of age; range, 2-17 years; male/female ratio, 19:20; mean Spetzler-Martin grade, 1.9 ± 0.6) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 had angiographically confirmed brain AVM recurrence, 8 following surgery and 5 following embolization. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for recurrence were the following: contrast-enhanced MR imaging: 84.6%, 38.5%, 40.7%, 81.8%; TOF-MRA: 50.0%, 96.1%, 85.7%, 79.3%; both: 75.0%, 90.9%, 85.7%, 83.3%. 3D rotational angiography-MR imaging fused images confirmed or excluded recurrence in all available cases (13/13). Embolization-only treatment was a significant predictor of recurrence (OR = 32.4, P = .006). MR imaging features predictive of recurrence included a tuft of vessels on TOF-MRA and nodular juxtamural/linear enhancement with a draining vein on contrast-enhanced MR imaging. CONCLUSIONS MR imaging is useful for surveillance after brain AVM treatment in children, but conventional angiography is required for definitive diagnosis of recurrence. TOF-MRA and contrast-enhanced MR imaging provide complementary information for determining brain AVM recurrence and should be interpreted in conjunction. 3D rotational angiography-MR imaging fusion increases the diagnostic confidence regarding brain AVM recurrence and is therefore suited for intraoperative neuronavigation.","Jhaveri, A; Amirabadi, A; Dirks, P; Kulkarni, A V; Shroff, M M; Shkumat, N; Krings, T; Pereira, V M; Rea, V; Muthusami, P",AJNR.

The great impact of EV71 and HCV on public health highlights the need to further our understanding of the biology of these two viruses and develop effective therapeutic antivirals. Here, we evaluated a total of 32 lycorine derivatives and demonstrated that 1-acetyllycorine suppressed the proliferation of multiple strains of EV71 in various cells. The results of the drug resistance analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine targeted a phenylalanine (F76) in EV71 2A protease (2A(pro)) to stabilize the conformation of a unique zinc finger. Most interestingly, the zinc binding site in EV71 2A(pro) is the exclusive homolog of HCV NS3 among all viruses. Further analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine also inhibits HCV with high efficacy, and the mutation on R118 in HCV NS3, which corresponds to F76 in EV71 2A(pro), confers the resistance of HCV to 1-acetyllycorine. These results revealed a conserved mechanism of 1-acetyllycorine against EV71 and HCV through targeting viral proteases. We also documented the significant synergistic anti-EV71 and anti-HCV effects of 1-acetyllycorine with reported inhibitors, supporting potential combination therapy for the treatment of EV71 and HCV infections.","Guo, Yu; Wang, Yaxin; Cao, Lin; Wang, Peng; Qing, Jie; Zheng, Qizhen; Shang, Luqing; Yin, Zheng; Sun, Yuna",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.02274-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26596952/,154

Unvaccinated birds showed clinical signs of varying severity, predominantly affecting the upper respiratory tract. Vaccinated birds appeared healthy, with the exception of a very mild conjunctivitis affecting a limited number of the broilers. Vaccination fully protected specific pathogen free birds, since no histopathological lesions were observed, nor was virus detected following challenge. In broilers, replication of the challenge virus was not prevented but was significantly reduced. This study confirms that vaccination at 1 day old and at 14 days of age using the Ma5 and 4/91 IB vaccines may be instrumental in reducing the economic impact of QX IB virus infections in layer and broiler farms.","Terregino, Calogero; Toffan, Anna; Beato, Maria Serena; De Nardi, Roberta; Vascellari, Marta; Meini, Amelio; Ortali, Giovanni; Mancin, Marzia; Capua, Ilaria",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450802356938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18798022/,154
138278,Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy in an Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Patient without Removal of the PD Catheter: A Case Report.,2014,"Whether the brain operates at a critical ""tipping"" point is a long standing scientific question, with evidence from both cellular and systems-scale studies suggesting that the brain does sit in, or near, a critical regime. Neuroimaging studies of humans in altered states of consciousness have prompted the suggestion that maintenance of critical dynamics is necessary for the emergence of consciousness and complex cognition, and that reduced or disorganized consciousness may be associated with deviations from criticality. Unfortunately, many of the cellular-level studies reporting signs of criticality were performed in non-conscious systems (in vitro neuronal cultures) or unconscious animals (e.g. anaesthetized rats). Here we attempted to address this knowledge gap by exploring critical brain dynamics in invasive ECoG recordings from multiple sessions with a single macaque as the animal transitioned from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anaesthetics (ketamine and propofol). We use a previously-validated test of criticality: avalanche dynamics to assess the differences in brain dynamics between normal consciousness and both drug-states. Propofol and ketamine were selected due to their differential effects on consciousness (ketamine, but not propofol, is known to induce an unusual state known as ""dissociative anaesthesia""). Our analyses indicate that propofol dramatically restricted the size and duration of avalanches, while ketamine allowed for more awake-like dynamics to persist. In addition, propofol, but not ketamine, triggered a large reduction in the complexity of brain dynamics. All states, however, showed some signs of persistent criticality when testing for exponent relations and universal shape-collapse. Further, maintenance of critical brain dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.","Varley, Thomas F; Sporns, Olaf; Puce, Aina; Beggs, John",PLoS computational biology,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347455/,154
138775,Using non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure ventilator via tracheostomy in children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: two case reports.,2015,"BACKGROUND Preterm infants with a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) are at risk for fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, but it is unclear how different hsPDA treatment strategies may affect cerebral oxygenation. OBJECTIVE To compare regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with a hsPDA treated with conservative management, indomethacin, or surgical ligation. METHODS This prospective observational study enrolled 33 VLBW infants with a hsPDA diagnosed by echocardiogram and 12 control VLBW infants without a hsPDA. Infants had NIRS cerebral monitoring applied prior to conservative treatment, indomethacin, or surgical ligation. Cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging data were also collected. RESULTS Infants undergoing surgical ligation had a greater time period with >20% change in rSO(2) from baseline (30%) compared to those receiving indomethacin (7.4%, p = 0.001) or control infants without a hsPDA (2.6%, p = 0.0004). NIRS measures were not associated with abnormal neuroimaging in this small cohort. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that infants requiring surgical ligation for a hsPDA are at high risk for significant changes in cerebral oxygenation, whereas those receiving either indomethacin or conservative management maintain relatively stable cerebral oxygenation levels. Additional research is necessary to determine if NIRS monitoring identifies infants with a hsPDA at highest risk for brain injury.","Chock, Valerie Y; Ramamoorthy, Chandra; Van Meurs, Krisa P",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000325149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701212/,154
138906,"Clinical Features of Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.",2020-05-22,"In this paper, we report a high power single frequency 1030 nm fiber laser with near-diffraction-limited beam quality based on a polarization-maintaining tapered Yb-doped fiber (T-YDF). The T-YDF has advantages of effectively suppressing stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) while maintaining good beam quality. As a result, a record output power of 379 W single frequency, linearly polarized, nearly single-mode fiber amplifier operating at 1030 nm is demonstrated. The polarization extinction ratio is as high as 16.3 dB, and the M2 is measured to be 1.12. Further, the dependence of the thermal-induced mode instability (TMI) threshold on the polarization state of an input signal laser is investigated for the first time. By changing the polarization state of the injected seed laser, the output power can increase to 550 W while the beam quality can be maintained well (M2=1.47). The slope efficiency of the whole amplifier is about 80%. No sign of SBS appears even at the highest output power and the further brightness scaling of both situations is limited by the TMI effect. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the highest output power of all-fiberized single frequency fiber amplifiers.","Lai, Wenchang; Ma, Pengfei; Liu, Wei; Huang, Long; Li, Can; Ma, Yanxing; Zhou, Pu",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.395619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680141/,154
140360,Non-office-hours admission affects intravenous thrombolysis treatment times and clinical outcome.,2018,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 28,285,700 with mortality that appears higher than for seasonal influenza. About 20% of COVID-19 patients have experienced cardiac involvement and myocardial infarction in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a worse prognosis. Furthermore, the widespread use of antiviral drugs can be linked to a worsening of heart function. Arrhythmias and hypertension have also been reported in patients with Covid-19. On the other hand, previous cardiac diseases are present in 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is uncertainty in the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists in the COVID-19 era. The mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 has been elucidated. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the downregulation of ACE2 that may contribute to the severity of lung pathologies as well as the cardiac function. ACE2, a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts Ang II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) that with its vasodilatory, antifibrotic, antihypertrophic effects counterbalances the negative effects of Ang II. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT1R blockers have been shown to upregulate the expression of ACE2. Based on the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was questioned although all scientific societies did not recommend discontinuation when clinically recommended. The BRACE CORONA, a phase 4, randomized study tested two strategies: temporarily stopping the ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for 30 days versus continuing ACE inhibitors/ARBs in patients who were taking these medications chronically and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was also discussed. Therefore, the goal of this review is to summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations concerning the use of ACEi and ARBs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The available data, based also on a randomized trial, suggest that ACEIs or ARBs, when clinically indicated, should be regularly used in the COVID-19 era.","Spaccarotella, Carmen; Mazzitelli, Maria; Migliarino, Serena; Curcio, Antonio; De Rosa, Salvatore; Torti, Carlo; Indolfi, Ciro",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795584/,154

We analyzed the incidence, mechanisms, and physiologic implications of double cycling during volume- and pressure-targeted mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Three general ICUs in Spain. PATIENTS Sixty-seven continuously monitored adult patients undergoing volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow, volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow, or pressure control-continuous mandatory mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We analyzed 9,251 hours of mechanical ventilation corresponding to 9,694,573 breaths. Double cycling occurred in 0.6%. All patients had double cycling; however, the distribution of double cycling varied over time. The mean percentage (95% CI) of double cycling was higher in pressure control-continuous mandatory ventilation 0.54 (0.34-0.87) than in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow 0.27 (0.19-0.38) or volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow 0.11 (0.06-0.20). Tidal volume in double-cycled breaths was higher in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow and volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow than in pressure control-continuous mandatory ventilation. Double-cycled breaths were patient triggered in 65.4% and reverse triggered (diaphragmatic contraction stimulated by a previous passive ventilator breath) in 34.6% of cases; the difference was largest in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with decelerated flow (80.7% patient triggered and 19.3% reverse triggered). Peak pressure of the second stacked breath was highest in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow regardless of trigger type. Various physiologic factors, none mutually exclusive, were associated with double cycling. CONCLUSIONS Double cycling is uncommon but occurs in all patients. Periods without double cycling alternate with periods with clusters of double cycling. The volume of the stacked breaths can double the set tidal volume in volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow. Gas delivery must be tailored to neuroventilatory demand because interdependent ventilator setting-related physiologic factors can contribute to double cycling. One third of double-cycled breaths were reverse triggered, suggesting that repeated respiratory muscle activation after time-initiated ventilator breaths occurs more often than expected.","de Haro, Candelaria; López-Aguilar, Josefina; Magrans, Rudys; Montanya, Jaume; Fernández-Gonzalo, Sol; Turon, Marc; Gomà, Gemma; Chacón, Encarna; Albaiceta, Guillermo M; Fernández, Rafael; Subirà, Carles; Lucangelo, Umberto; Murias, Gastón; Rué, Montserrat; Kacmarek, Robert M; Blanch, Lluís",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000003256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29985211/,154

Genomic studies revealed that two viral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), process the polyproteins encoded by the MERS-CoV genomic RNA. We previously reported that SARS-CoV PLpro acts as both deubiquitinase (DUB) and IFN antagonist, but the function of the MERS-CoV PLpro was poorly understood. In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV PLpro, which is a protease and can recognize and process the cleavage sites (CS) of nsp1-2, nsp2-3 and nsp3-4. The LXGG consensus cleavage sites in the N terminus of pp1a/1ab, which is generally essential for CoV PLpro-mediated processing, were also characterized in MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV PLpro, like human SARS-CoV PLpro and NL63-CoV PLP2, is a viral deubiquitinating enzyme. It acts on both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination and ISG15-linked ISGylation. We confirmed that MERS-CoV PLpro acts as an IFN antagonist through blocking the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). These findings indicate that MERS-CoV PLpro acts as a viral DUB and suppresses production of IFN-β by an interfering IRF3-mediated signalling pathway, in addition to recognizing and processing the CS at the N terminus of replicase polyprotein to release the non-structural proteins. The characterization of proteolytic processing, DUB and IFN antagonist activities of MERS-CoV PLpro would reveal the interactions between MERS-CoV and its host, and be applicable to develop strategies targeting PLpro for the effective control of MERS-CoV infection.","Yang, Xingxing; Chen, Xiaojuan; Bian, Guangxing; Tu, Jian; Xing, Yaling; Wang, Yayun; Chen, Zhongbin",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.059014-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362959/,154

The Drosophila tracheal system, an established tubulogenesis model, contains branched terminal cells with subcellular tubes formed by apical plasma membrane invagination. We show that apical endocytosis and late endosome-mediated trafficking are required for membrane allocation to the apical and basal membrane domains. Basal plasma membrane growth stops if endocytosis is blocked, whereas the apical membrane grows excessively. Plasma membrane is initially delivered apically and then continuously endocytosed, together with apical and basal cargo. We describe an organelle carrying markers of late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that is abolished by inhibiting endocytosis and which we suggest acts as transit station for membrane destined to be redistributed both apically and basally. This is based on the observation that disrupting MVB formation prevents growth of both compartments.","Mathew, Renjith; Rios-Barrera, L Daniel; Machado, Pedro; Schwab, Yannick; Leptin, Maria",The EMBO journal,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657472/,154

142897,"Composite Hemangioendothelioma With Neuroendocrine Marker Expression: Report of a ""Paraganglioma-Like"" Paravertebral Case.",2020-05-18,"INTRODUCTION In older patients, life expectancy is determined by a complex interaction of multiple geriatric domains. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) captures different geriatric domains. Yet, if and how components of the CGA are related to mortality in an outpatient geriatric setting is unknown. In the Amsterdam Ageing Cohort, we therefore studied distribution and accumulation of geriatric domain deficits in relation to mortality. METHODS All patients received a CGA as part of standard care, independent of referral reason. We summarized deficits on the CGA, using predefined cutoffs, in 5 geriatric domains: somatic, mental, nutritional, physical, and social domain. Information on mortality was obtained from the Dutch municipal register. We used age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses to relate the separate domains and accumulation of impaired domains to overall mortality. RESULTS From the 1,055 geriatric outpatients (53% female; age 79 ± 7 years), 172 patients (16%) had died after 1.7 ± 1.1 years. In 626 patients (59%), 3 or more domains were impaired. All domains were independently associated with mortality, with the highest hazard for the somatic domain (HR 3.7 [1.7-8.0]) and the lowest hazard for the mental domain (HR 1.5 [1.1-12.0]). In addition, accumulation of impaired domains showed a gradually increased mortality risk, ranging from HR 2.2 (0.8-6.1) for 2 domains to HR 9.6 (3.7-24.7) for all 5 domains impaired. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that impairment in multiple geriatric domains is highly prevalent and independently and cumulatively associated with mortality in an outpatient geriatric setting.","Rhodius-Meester, Hanneke Frederica Maria; van de Schraaf, Sara A J; Peters, Mike J L; Kleipool, Emma E F; Trappenburg, Marijke C; Muller, Majon",Gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000512048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440389/,154

This study assessed the clinical outcome and determinants of survival and local recurrence in patients undergoing multivisceral resection for clinical T4 primary rectal cancer. METHODS This was a cohort study of consecutive multivisceral resections carried out in a single centre from 2000 to 2009. Determinants of local recurrence and survival were examined by means of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The study included 42 patients, with a median age of 62 (range 41-83) years, who underwent surgery with a median follow-up of 30 (range 2-102) months. Thirty-one patients had preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Seven patients had rectal resection with en bloc radical prostatectomy. The 30-day mortality rate was zero. Thirty-nine of the 42 patients had a negative circumferential resection margin. The 5-year overall survival rate for those who had complete resection was 48 per cent. Local recurrence was predicted by metastatic disease (P < 0.001) and nodal disease (P < 0.001), but not positive resection margins (P = 0.077). CONCLUSION An aggressive surgical strategy with complete resection is predictive of long-term survival in selected patients with T4a rectal carcinoma.

We developed a rapid immunochromatographic test (RICT) for the diagnosis of rabies. The efficacy of the RICT was compared with that of the FAT. Brain samples were collected from humans, dogs, cats, and other animals in Sri Lanka (n = 248), Bhutan (n = 27), and Thailand (n = 228). The sensitivity (0.74-0.95), specificity (0.98-1.0), positive predictive value (0.98-1.0), negative predictive value (0.75-0.97), accuracy (0.91-0.98), and kappa measure of agreement (0.79-0.93) were all satisfactory for animal samples and samples preserved in 50% glycerol saline solution.

If one family member is exposed to the virus they could serve as a source of transmission or, if they fall ill, the resources they provide to others could be severed. These risks may be especially heightened for family members who work outside the home and provide care, or for those family members who care for multiple generations. Policies have the potential to help families bear the burden of these decisions. This essay argues that policies that address health, employment, and other social issues have implications for families, and that policies aimed at families and caregivers can affect the health, employment, and the general well-being of the nation.","Stokes, Jeffrey E; Patterson, Sarah E",Journal of aging & social policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/08959420.2020.1770031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32489144/,154

148412,Audio Interview: Vaccinology and Covid-19.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND A major drawback of liquid embolic agents (LEAs) is the generation of imaging artifacts (IA), which may represent a crucial obstacle for the detection of periprocedural hemorrhage or subsequent radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This study aimed to compare the IAs of Onyx, Squid and PHIL in a novel three-dimensional in vitro AVM model in conventional computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT). METHODS Tubes with different diameters were configured in a container resembling an AVM with an artificial nidus at its center. Subsequently, the AVM models were filled with Onyx 18, Squid 18, PHIL 25% or saline and inserted into an imaging phantom (n = 10/LEA). Afterwards CT and CBCT scans were acquired. The degree of IAs was graded quantitatively (Hounsfield units in a defined region of interest) and qualitatively (feasibility of defining the nidus)-Onyx vs. Squid vs. PHIL vs. saline, respectively. RESULTS Quantitative density evaluation demonstrated more artifacts for Onyx compared to Squid and PHIL, e.g. 48.15 ± 14.32 HU for Onyx vs. 7.56 ± 1.34 HU for PHIL in CT (p < 0.001) and 41.88 ± 7.22 density units (DU) for Squid vs. 35.22 ± 5.84 DU for PHIL in CBCT (p = 0.044). Qualitative analysis showed less artifacts for PHIL compared to Onyx and Squid in both imaging modalities while there was no difference between Onyx and Squid regarding the definition of the nidus (p > 0.999). CONCLUSION In this novel three-dimensional in vitro AVM model, IAs were higher for the EVOH/tantalum-based LEAs Onyx and Squid compared to iodine-based PHIL. Onyx induced the highest degree of IAs with only minor differences to Squid.","Schmitt, Niclas; Floca, Ralf O; Paech, Daniel; El Shafie, Rami A; Neuberger, Ulf; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Vollherbst, Dominik F",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-021-01013-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852036/,154
148631,Electronic Cigarettes and Vaping Associated Lung Injury (EVALI): Rural Appalachian Experience.,2020-11-02,"Cysteine disulfides, which constitute an important component in biological redox buffer systems, are highly reactive toward the hydroxyl radical (•OH). The mechanistic details of this reaction, however, remain unclear, largely due to the difficulty in characterizing unstable reaction products. Herein, we have developed a combined approach involving mass spectrometry (MS) and theoretical calculations to investigate reactions of •OH with cysteine disulfides (Cys-S-S-R) in the gas phase. Four types of first-generation products were identified: protonated ions of the cysteine thiyl radical (+Cys-S•), cysteine (+Cys-SH), cysteine sulfinyl radical (+Cys-SO•), and cysteine sulfenic acid (+Cys-SOH). The relative reaction rates and product branching ratios responded sensitively to the electronic property of the R group, providing key evidence to deriving a two-step reaction mechanism. The first step involved •OH conducting a back-side attack on one of the sulfur atoms, forming sulfenic acid (-SOH) and thiyl radical (-S•) product pairs. A subsequent H transfer step within the product complex was favored for protonated systems, generating sulfinyl radical (-SO•) and thiol (-SH) products. Because sulfenic acid is a potent scavenger of peroxyl radicals, our results implied that cysteine disulfide can form two lines of defense against reactive oxygen species, one using the cysteine disulfide itself and the other using the sulfenic acid product of the conversion of cysteine disulfide. This aspect suggested that, in a nonpolar environment, cysteine disulfides might play a more active role in the antioxidant network than previously appreciated.","Adhikari, Sarju; Crehuet, Ramon; Anglada, Josep M; Francisco, Joseph S; Xia, Yu",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006639117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680962/,154

Outcomes of various breast augmentation approaches in Asia have not been comprehensively studied. In the past, the inframammary approach to breast augmentation was not popular because of conspicuous scarring. In this article, the authors review academic articles related to the use of an inframammary incision for breast augmentation in Asian women and present our recommendations for the available techniques. METHODS A literature search was performed for articles published after 2015 on Asian women with augmentation mammoplasty describing techniques, incision sites, outcomes, and complications. The search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. We also included our own technique to demonstrate the outcome of augmentation mammoplasty through inframammary incision. RESULTS Eight articles satisfied our inclusion criteria. Evidence indicates that with proper preoperative design and surgical techniques, scarring resulting from the inframammary approach is not inferior to that resulting from the transaxillary approach in Asian patients. Long-term satisfaction with the inframammary approach to breast augmentation is high in Asian patients.Eight articles reported the outcomes of 1168 women receiving breast augmentation. Inframammary incisions were used in 45.29% of patients (529 patients). After the 2015 publication of Zelken's review paper on Asian breast augmentation, the rate of inframammary incisions increased from 3.1% to 45.29%. CONCLUSIONS With precise design of the new inframammary fold, accurate wound suture fixation, and postoperative scar care, the inframammary approach to breast augmentation offers optimal operative visualization, reduced pain, fewer complications, and desirable esthetic outcomes even in Asian patients. This study demonstrates that the percentage of inframammary fold approach of Asian esthetic mammoplasty grows rapidly after 2015.","Lai, Ya-Wei; Huang, Shu-Hung; Lee, Youngdae; Chen, Fang-Ming; Lai, Chung-Sheng",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346556/,154
150568,Endoscopic Mucosal Healing Predicts Favorable Clinical Outcomes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-analysis.,2016,"OBJECTIVE Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a less invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy, but it is essential to prevent thromboembolic complications during CAS and to suppress in-stent restenosis (ISR) after CAS because of the relatively high risk of periprocedural and follow-up stroke events. Clinical trials have demonstrated the strong relationship of carotid plaque vulnerability with the subsequent risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke and thromboembolic complications during CAS. Recent studies demonstrated that both low eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and low docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were significantly associated with lipid-rich coronary and carotid plaques, but little is known about the effect of administration of omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs) containing EPA and DHA before and after CAS for stabilizing carotid plaque, preventing thromboembolic complications, and suppressing ISR. In this study, the efficacy of pretreatment with and ongoing daily use of O-3FA in addition to statin treatment was evaluated in patients undergoing CAS. METHODS This study was a nonrandomized prospective trial with retrospective analysis of historical control data. From 2012 to 2015, there were 100 consecutive patients with hyperlipidemia undergoing CAS for carotid artery stenosis who were divided into two groups. Between 2012 and 2013 (control period), 47 patients were treated with standard statin therapy. Between 2014 and 2015 (O-3FA period), patients were treated with statin therapy and add-on oral O-3FA ethyl esters containing 750 mg/d DHA and 1860 mg/d EPA from 4 weeks before CAS, followed by ongoing daily use for at least 12 months. In all patients, the plaque morphology by virtual histology intravascular ultrasound, the incidence of new ipsilateral ischemic lesions on the day after CAS, the slow-flow phenomenon during CAS, and ISR within 12 months after CAS were compared between the periods. RESULTS The slow-flow phenomenon during CAS with filter-type embolic protection devices decreased in the O-3FA period (1 of 53 patients [2%]) compared with the control period (7 of 47 patients [15%]; P = .02). Furthermore, ISR for 12 months after CAS was significantly decreased in the O-3FA period (1 of 53 patients [2%]) compared with the control period (10 of 47 patients [21%]; P = .01). On virtual histology intravascular ultrasound analysis, the fibrofatty area was significantly smaller and the fibrous area was significantly greater in the O-3FA period. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a low EPA/arachidonic acid ratio and a symptomatic lesion were the factors related to vulnerable plaque (P = .01 [odds ratio, 5.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-16.63] and P = .01 [odds ratio, 11.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.93-46.86], respectively). CONCLUSIONS Pretreatment with O-3FA reduces the slow-flow phenomenon generated by plaque vulnerability during CAS, and on-going daily use of O-3FA suppresses ISR after CAS.","Nakagawa, Ichiro; Park, Hun Soo; Yokoyama, Shohei; Wada, Takeshi; Yamada, Syuichi; Motoyama, Yasushi; Kichikawa, Kimihiko; Nakase, Hiroyuki",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2016.12.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28359716/,154

Itaconate has emerged as a mediator of macrophage function, but its role during fibrosis is unknown. Here, we reveal that itaconate is an endogenous antifibrotic factor in the lung. Itaconate levels are reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage, and itaconate-synthesizing cis-aconitate decarboxylase expression (ACOD1) is reduced in AMs from patients with IPF compared with controls. In the murine bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, Acod1-/- mice develop persistent fibrosis, unlike wild-type (WT) littermates. Profibrotic gene expression is increased in Acod1-/- tissue-resident AMs compared with WT, and adoptive transfer of WT monocyte-recruited AMs rescued mice from disease phenotype. Culture of lung fibroblasts with itaconate decreased proliferation and wound healing capacity, and inhaled itaconate was protective in mice in vivo. Collectively, these data identify itaconate as critical for controlling the severity of lung fibrosis, and targeting this pathway may be a viable therapeutic strategy.","Ogger, Patricia P; Albers, Gesa J; Hewitt, Richard J; O'Sullivan, Brendan J; Powell, Joseph E; Calamita, Emily; Ghai, Poonam; Walker, Simone A; McErlean, Peter; Saunders, Peter; Kingston, Shaun; Molyneaux, Philip L; Halket, John M; Gray, Robert; Chambers, Daniel C; Maher, Toby M; Lloyd, Clare M; Byrne, Adam J",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abc1884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33097591/,154

Most of these neonates are referred from maternity ward of the hospital. However, there is no recent evidence on the prevalence and specific determinants of birth asphyxia at DTGH. Besides, public health importance of factors like birth spacing weren't addressed in the prior studies. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 240 newborns at delivery ward. The collected data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi -data version 4.2 and exported to Stata version 14. Binary logistic regression model was considered and statistical significance was declared at P< 0.05 using adjusted odds ratio. Results The prevalence of asphyxia neonatorum was 6.7 % based on the fifth minute APGAR score. From multi-variable logistic regression analysis, antenatal obstetric complications (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 3.75, 14.29), fetal malpresentation (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.21, 15.20), premature rupture of fetal membranes (AOR = 6.56, 95% CI: 3.48, 18.12) and meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.76, 14.59) were significant predictors. Conclusion The prevalence of fifth minute asphyxia neonatorum was relatively low. Fortunately, its predictors are modifiable.

The concept of skill decay must be considered during inactivity of elective practice. The purpose of this study was to provide an evidence-based curriculum in association with immersive virtual reality (iVR) to prevent skill decay during periods of training cessation and beyond. METHODS A review of pertinent literature for orthopaedic surgical skill decay was performed. Early experience by faculty instructors and residency and fellowship program directors was gathered from multiple institutions with experience in virtual training methods including iVR. A proposed curriculum for cognitive and manual skill acquisition during COVID-19 was produced from qualitative narrative group opinion. RESULTS Skill decay can occur on the order of days to months and is dependent on the initial skill level. A novel curriculum for structured continuing medical education during and after periods of surgical disruption including e-learning, virtual meetings, and iVR simulators was produced from expert opinion and based on competency-based curriculum standards. CONCLUSION Skill decay mitigation strategies should use best available evidence technologies and course structures that satisfy advanced learning concepts. The virtual curriculum including iVR simulators may provide cost-effective solutions to training.","Lohre, Ryan; Warner, Jon J P; Morrey, Bernard R; Athwal, George S; Morrey, Mark E; Mazzocca, Augustus D; Goel, Danny P",Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

Existential threats can raise perceptions of social benefit and can lower animal-welfare thresholds. The rush to develop new research models may also undermine progress in reducing or replacing animal models. By circumventing the barrier posed by animal models that are poorly matched to human conditions, new technologies like CRISPR can enhance the refinement component while undermining reduction and replacement.

Postoperative delirium (POD) is a major complication for elderly patients who undergo surgery, and postoperative pain is a common inducer of POD. We reported previously that single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SLS) significantly reduces postoperative pain compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS). Data are lacking about the effect of SLS on POD. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical benefits of SLS for POD in elderly patients with colon cancer. METHODS This retrospective case-control study included colon cancer patients (n = 134) over 75 years old who underwent elective surgery from 2009 to 2015 at Osaka University Hospital. Of these patients, 110 were evaluated using the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) before surgery and were classified into lower or higher risk groups based on their scores. RESULTS The rate of POD was significantly lower in the SLS group than the CLS group (13.8% vs. 30.0%; p = 0.0161). In the CGA-based higher risk group, the rate of POD was significantly higher in the CLS group than the SLS group (p = 0.0153).

The movements can be horizontal, vertical, torsional or a combination of these movements. It starts by a slow movement of the eye away from the visual target. The second movement brings the eye back to the visual target. If this second movement is quick, the nystagmus is called jerk nystagmus. If the second movement is slow, the nystagmus is said to be pendular. Maintaining steady gaze is dependent upon visual fixation, the vestibulo-ocular reflex and the gaze-holding neural integrator system. Pathological nystagmus typically presents with the symptom of oscillopsia, which is the illusory movement of the surrounding environment. Nystagmus that develops outside of early infancy is termed acquired nystagmus. There may be serious underlying pathology that will require further investigation and management. This article reviews the terminology, pathophysiology, causes and treatment of acquired nystagmus.","Panthagani, Jesse; Virdee, Jasvir; MacDonald, Trystan; Bruynseels, Alice; Batra, Ruchika",British journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12968/hmed.2020.0320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263469/,154

Our aim was to compare outcomes of thoracoscopic (VATS) versus robotic-assisted thoracoscopic (RATS) lobectomy early in a program's adoption of robotic surgery, including perioperative outcomes, cost, and long-term quality of life. A prospective database was retrospectively reviewed for all patients undergoing minimally invasive lobectomy by either VATS or RATS techniques from 2010 to 2012. Patients' operative, post-operative complications, cost (operating room and hospital) and quality of life were compared between the two resection techniques. Long-term follow-up including assessment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire was documented. During the first 25 RATS lobectomies, there were 73 VATS lobectomies performed, for a total of 98 cases. There was no significant difference in cancer stage, operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node count, or hospital length of stay. The RATS resections had significantly higher operative and total hospital cost (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05). At a median of 65-month follow-up, 29 patients (9 robotic; 20 VATS) completed the EORTC questionnaire. The global health status and symptom scale median scores were similar to the general population and did not significantly differ between groups. While transitioning from thoracoscopic to robotic lobectomy incurs increased operative and total hospital cost, equivalent operative outcomes, length of hospitalization, and long-term quality of life can be maintained during this transition. With increasing patient and surgeon interest in robotic resection, it appears both safe and feasible to adopt this approach while maintaining outcomes.","Worrell, Stephanie G; Dedhia, Priya; Gilbert, Catherine; James, Chrystina; Chang, Andrew C; Lin, Jules; Reddy, Rishindra M",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-018-0844-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29995222/,154

A robust strategy to coordinate digital communications is vital at times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic - and will be needed as part of an effective HHS campaign to motivate individuals who are hesitant to accept coronavirus vaccines. Using science-based principles of systems change, a four-phase approach was developed in alignment with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA). Phase I involved announcing a plan for creating and implementing the HHS Digital Communications Strategy, including support for it from the HHS Secretary. Phase II involved gathering information and stakeholder support, with an interview research study as the central component for providing input and encouraging stakeholder engagement. Phase III focused on building the Strategy through an iterative process. Phase IV, which is ongoing, concentrates on implementing the Strategy, measuring the impact of digital communications and supporting the budget required to modernize Federal digital communications approaches to meet the American public's needs.

This unprecedented and stressful time can be even more detrimental for young adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. The purpose of this study is to investigate potential risk factors (i.e., current mental health symptoms, and COVID-19-related grief and worry) on sleep quality of U.S. young adults during the initial months of the global pandemic. METHOD This cross-sectional study examined 908 young adults in the weeks following the declaration of the coronavirus pandemic as a national emergency by the United States. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses examined depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as COVID-19-related grief and worry as predictors of young adults' sleep quality. RESULTS Young adults experienced high rates of sleep problems during the first two months (April to May 2020) of the pandemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms appear to be predictors of sleep quality regardless of any pre-existing diagnosis. Furthermore, high levels of PTSD symptoms and COVID-19-related worry were associated with young adults' poor sleep. CONCLUSIONS Our findings point to possible psychological factors that uniquely explain young adults' poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. This study shed new light on how the COVID-19 pandemic might affect the sleep behaviors of young adults without a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Implications for supporting young adults sleep and well-being during the pandemic are addressed.","Hyun, Sunah; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Wong, Ga Tin Fifi; Zhang, Emily; Liu, Cindy H",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385779/,154

Sea surface samples were collected from 2014 to 2020, using a catamaran swimmer body/neuston net trawl and evaluated for the presence of microplastics. Microplastics were present in the surface waters of all Scottish Marine Regions (SMR) and Offshore Marine Regions (OMR) though almost 35% of sample sites contained no microplastics. Concentrations ranged from 0 to 91,128 microplastics km-2 sea surface. Potential hotspots were identified in the Clyde (0-77,168 microplastics km-2), Forth & Tay (0-83,729 microplastics km-2) and the Solway (607-91,128 microplastics km-2). Fragmented plastics accounted for almost 50% of the microplastics recovered and this may suggest that the microplastics in Scotland's seas are predominantly from the breakdown of larger items.

164829,COVID-19 in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2021,"Smart parking is one of the most interesting applications of vehicular ad hoc networks, since drivers looking for free parking slots seriously impact traffic conditions and road congestion. The pandemic experience affecting the world with COVID-19 virus since 2020 has radically changed the citizens lives and their habits. Any sector, from sanitary to economics, had to adapt itself to a new approach to everyday-life. Mobility is included in such a change and researchers in this field should contribute in this direction. In this work, we propose an innovative smart technique for parking detection, which takes care of anti-covid standards: indeed, such a parking schema maps vehicles in the available slots with the aim of reducing assembly, after the vehicle has been parked. After analyzing the parking process, we conclude that the arrival to the parking area, and the moment when one leaves that area can be source of crowd. In order to reduce this phenomenon, we perform a user profiling with the aim of reducing the probability that drivers are in the same place at the same time. We achieve the goal by computing a risk factor for any pair of vehicles populating the car parking. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Balzano, W.; Stranieri, S.","15th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, CISIS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79725-6_12,154

Although various strains of MHV have been isolated, they are generally excreted in the feces and transmitted oronasally via aerosols and contaminated bedding. In this study, we attempted to determine the basic reproduction numbers of three strains of MHV to improve our understanding of MHV infections in mice. Five-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intranasally with either the Y, NuU, or JHM variant strain of MHV and housed with two naive mice. After 4 weeks, the presence or absence of anti-MHV antibody in the mice was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also examined the distribution of MHV in the organs of Y, NuU, or JHM variant-infected mice. Our data suggest that the transmissibility of MHV is correlated with viral growth in the gastrointestinal tract of infected mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to address the basic reproduction numbers among pathogens in laboratory animals.","Nakayama, Masataka; Kyuwa, Shigeru",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461643,154

For this study, we have conducted a cross-sectional inquiry using the Web based random sampling method during the pandemic which began in Turkey on March 2020. At first sight, the inquiry can be thought in the form of four main elements (categories): (1) Demographic features of the participants, (2) Risk and danger perception of the pandemic, (3) Individual and social protection from the pandemic, and (4) Examination of the physiological and psychological effects of the pandemic. Before carrying out simply statistical modeling analysis from the data, we have observed easily that there is a multidirectional and complicated pressure psychology ruling in the community.

On January 30, 2020, the world health organization (WHO) officially announced this new virus as an international health emergency. While many biological and mechanisms of pathogenicity of this virus are still unclear, it seems that cytokine storm resulting from an immune response against the virus is considered the main culprit of the severity of the disease. Despite many global efforts to control the SARS-CoV-2, several problems and challenges have been posed in controlling the COVID-19 infection. These problems include the various mutations, the emergence of variants with high transmissibility, the short period of immunity against the virus, the possibility of reinfection in people improved, lack of specific drugs, and problems in the development of highly sensitive and specific vaccines. In this review, we summarized the results of the current trend and the latest research studies on the characteristics of the structure and genome of the SARS-CoV- 2, new mutations and variants of SARS-CoV-2, pathogenicity, immune response, virus diagnostic tests, potential treatment, and vaccine candidate.","Salimi-Jeda, Ali; Abbassi, Sina; Mousavizadeh, Atieh; Esghaie, Maryam; Bokharaei-Salim, Farah; Jeddi, Farhad; Shafaati, Maryam; Abdoli, Asghar",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921008687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921008687?v=s5,154

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is shed in the stool of infected individuals and aggregated in public sewers, where it can be quantified to provide information on population-level disease incidence that is unbiased by access to clinical testing. In this study, we present results from the largest nationwide wastewater monitoring system in the United States reported to date. We profile 55 locations with at least six months of sampling and highlight their wastewater data from April 2020 through May 2021. These locations represent over 12 million individuals across 19 states. Samples were collected approximately weekly by wastewater treatment utilities as part of a regular wastewater surveillance service and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (copies/mL) were normalized to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a stable and persistent indicator of feces concentrations in wastewater. Here, we show that wastewater data reflects temporal and geographic trends in clinical COVID-19 cases, demonstrating that wastewater surveillance is a feasible approach for nationwide population-level monitoring of COVID-19 disease. We also provide key lessons learned from our broad-scale implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology, which can be used to inform wastewater-based epidemiology approaches for future emerging diseases. With an evolving epidemic and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, wastewater-based epidemiology can serve as an important passive surveillance approach to detect changing dynamics or resurgences of the virus.","Duvallet, C.; Wu, F.; McElroy, K.

Artemis is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs and acts to open DNA hairpin intermediates generated during V(D)J and class-switch recombination. Consistently, Artemis deficiency leads to radiosensitive congenital severe immune deficiency (RS-SCID). Artemis belongs to a structural superfamily of nucleases that contain conserved metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) and β-CASP (CPSF-Artemis-SNM1-Pso2) domains. Here, we present crystal structures of the catalytic domain of wild type and variant forms of Artemis that cause RS-SCID Omenn syndrome. The truncated catalytic domain of the Artemis is a constitutively active enzyme that with similar activity to a phosphorylated full-length protein. Our structures help explain the basis of the predominantly endonucleolytic activity of Artemis, which contrast with the predominantly exonuclease activity of the closely related SNM1A and SNM1B nucleases. The structures also reveal a second metal binding site in its β-CASP domain that is unique to Artemis. By combining our structural data that from a recently reported structure we were able model the interaction of Artemis with DNA substrates.

175916,Severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia may cause lung bullae and bronchiectasis: A case report and concise literature review,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, has resulted in high mortalities and global socio-economic disruptions. As knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 evolves, the public requires up to date and appropriate information in order to keep safe in the absence of a proven vaccine. This review of the literature was written to provide the latest information on the virus and the disease. SARS-CoV-2 bears a higher genomic homology to SARS-CoV-1 than MERS-CoV-1. Globally, COVID-19 has caused more than 4.07 million deaths and infected over 188 million people by 16th July, 2021. In Africa, more than 4.5 million and over 106,000 people have been infected and died, respectively. In Kenya, over 191,000 have been infected and 3,746 people have died from COVID-19 by the date. The figure for Kenya is much lower than the over 150,000 deaths from the Spanish flu of 1918-20. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through expiratory droplets and direct contact, while faecal and airborne transmission have been documented, but not confirmed. It enters the body through nasal passages, conjunctiva or mouth. It can survive on bank notes, vinyl plastic, mobile phone, glass, cardboard, cloth fabric and stainless steel for varying periods. At 50% Rh, it can survive on stainless steel, vinyl plastic and glass at 20, 30 and 40oC for 28, 7 days and less than a day, respectively. On cotton fabrics, it can survive for 7, 3 days and less than 24 hr at 20, 30 and 40oC, respectively. Age, late hospitalization, diabetes co-morbidity, obesity, chronic lung disease and hypertension are the major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. Age and laboratory indicators are predictors of mortality. Vaccines allowed for emergency use include the Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/Biontech, Moderna, Sinopharm, SINOVAC, Sputnik V and Johnson and Johnson. Although they all have shown high efficacy against the original COVID-19 strains globally, they have lower efficacy against the Brazilian P.1, the UK B.1.1.7, Finnish FIN-796H, the New Jersey/New York B.1.526, the South African B.1.351 and the Indian Delta mutant. Regular hand washing, face masking, avoiding overcrowding, physical distancing, outdoor communing, seeking immediate medical attention and isolating when infected, all can minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Potential infection from frozen foods packaging, frozen foods and food preparation surfaces has been demonstrated. However, good hygiene practices can minimize infection from foods, shopping bags, take-out containers and groceries. Animal foods should not be consumed raw, while groceries require thorough washing with potable water during preparation. Despite concerns posed by the continuing evolution of virulent mutants of SARS-CoV-2, researchers are working to develop effective vaccines in order to eliminate the threat of the virus.","Lokuruka, M.","African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development",https://doi.org/10.18697/ajfand.101.20975,154

Therefore, there is an increased need to use alternate methods to assess A1c, including continuous glucose monitoring-derived Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) and home kit A1c. The University of Minnesota's home kit A1c (n=59), GMI (n=56), and POC A1c (n=16) were collected from youth with T1D (age 10.0 [5.3, 13.0] years, 42% female, and baseline A1c 12.4 ± 2.2%). Matched pairs were used for Bland Altman analyses and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (pc) to evaluate the agreement between A1c measures. GMI data (up to 90 days) was captured using Dexcom Clarity. In relation to POC A1c, both home kit A1c (panel A) and GMI (panel B) showed a slight positive bias (mean difference 0.13 and 0.22%, respectively). Home kit A1c and GMI showed strong concordance to POC A1c (pc = 0.987 [0.963, 0.995] and 0.930 [0.835, 0.971], respectively). GMI (panel C) also showed a slight positive bias (mean difference 0.26%) and good concordance (pc = 0.803 [0.703, 0.871]) to home kit A1c.

178902,Evidence-based Recommendations on Periodontal Practice and the Management of Periodontal Patients During and After the COVID-19 Era: Challenging Infectious Diseases Spread by Airborne Transmission,2021,"Purpose: The article aims at examining the ethical limits and risks of servant leadership. During the Second World War, the German army officer Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a loyal servant to his nation and homeland. But when he learns about the Nazis’ mass murders and crimes, he begins to have doubts about whom he should serve. Being confronted with numerous moral dilemmas, he finally decides to join a resistance group. Of course, Stauffenberg's situation as colonel and leader was an extreme case. Time and again, however, managers and leaders are faced with similar dilemmas. Indeed, the current COVID-19-crisis shows that even today’s leaders are repeatedly faced with almost insoluble dilemmas. The recent literature about ethics and leadership suggests a philosophy which is almost portrayed as a panacea to any ethical issues: servant leadership (SL). This study, however, questions the commonly held view that SL is always ethical. The purpose of our historical case study is twofold. First, this study explores the ethical challenges Stauffenberg (and other officers) faced and how they dealt with them. Second, this study elaborates on what responses (if any) SL would provide to these challenges. Design/methodology/approach: The applied method is a historical case study, in which the authors draw on a plethora of secondary literature, including books, reports, and articles. Findings: By analyzing the historical case of “Operation Valkyrie,” this study elaborated and identified risks and limitations of SL and pointed out ways to address these risks. In particular, SL poses risks in the case of a too narrow understanding of the term “service.” Originality/value: While other leadership styles, e.g. transformational leadership or charismatic leadership, have been extensively studied with regard to ethical risks, in the case of SL possible risks and limitations are still largely unexplored. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Langhof, J.

179084,CSF rhinorrhea after nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19: A case report and review of literature,2021-10-09,"SARS-CoV-2 epidemics has resulted in an unprecedented global health crisis causing a high number of deaths with pneumonia being the most common manifestation. Chest CT is the best imaging modality to identify pulmonary involvement, but unfortunately there are no pathognomonic features for COVID-19 pneumonia, since many other infectious and non-infectious diseases may cause similar alterations. The adoption of artificial intelligence in biomedical imaging has the potential to revolutionize the identification, management, and the patient’s outcome. If adequately validated, it could be used as a support with predictive and prognostic purposes in symptomatic patients but also as a screening test in asymptomatic patients in COVID-19 epidemics. Some studies have already shown the potential adoption of artificial intelligence for detection of COVID-19 infection, or even to differentiate from community-acquired pneumonia, but at present artificial intelligence cannot routinely applied for COVID-19 due to several limitations. This book chapter will first revise the basics of radiomics with a short practical and easy guide for radiologists;then, the main radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia will be presented with the most relevant information that are assessed to evaluate extent of the disease;finally, the main current literature on potential clinical application of radiomics and artificial intelligence for COVID-19 will be presented together with limitations and perspectives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Vernuccio, F.; Cutaia, G.; Cannella, R.; Vernuccio, L.; Lagalla, R.; Midiri, M.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74761-9_3,154

184495,Prospective multicenter study of children with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation.,2012,"A thorough understanding of complex spatial host-disease interactions in situ is necessary in order to develop effective preventative measures and therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed Protein And Nucleic acid IN situ Imaging (PANINI) and coupled it with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) to sensitively and simultaneously quantify DNA, RNA, and protein levels within the microenvironments of tissue compartments. The PANINI-MIBI approach was used to measure over 30 parameters simultaneously across large sections of archival lymphoid tissues from non-human primates that were healthy or infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a model that accurately recapitulates human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). This enabled multiplexed dissection of cellular phenotypes, functional markers, viral DNA integration events, and viral RNA transcripts as resulting from viral infection. The results demonstrated immune coordination from an unexpected upregulation of IL10 in B cells in response to SIV infection that correlated with macrophage M2 polarization, thus conditioning a potential immunosuppressive environment that allows for viral production. This multiplexed imaging strategy also allowed characterization of the coordinated microenvironment around latently or actively infected cells to provide mechanistic insights into the process of viral latency. The spatial multi-modal framework presented here is applicable to deciphering tissue responses in other infectious diseases and tumor biology.","Jiang, Sizun; Chan, Chi Ngai; Rovira-Clave, Xavier; Chen, Han; Bai, Yunhao; Zhu, Bokai; McCaffrey, Erin; Greenwald, Noah F.; Liu, Candace; Barlow, Graham L; Weirather, Jason L.; Oliveria, John Paul; Philips, Darci; Mukherjee, Nilanjan; Busman-Sahay, Kathleen; Nekorchuk, Michael; Terry, Margaret; Younger, Skyler; Bosse, Marc; Demeter, Janos; Golstev, Yury; McIlwain, David Robert; Angelo, Michael; Estes, Jacob D.; Nolan, Garry P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.444548,154
186068,Trends in hospital admissions and mortality from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Australia.,2008,"A model for immunologically T cell-mediated hepatitis was established in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The severity of hepatitis was monitored histologically and by determination of changes in serum levels of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Kinetics of histological disease manifestations, increases of liver enzyme levels in the serum, and cytotoxic T cell activities in livers and spleens all correlated and were dependent upon several parameters: LCMV-isolate; LCMV-WE caused extensive hepatitis, LCMV-Armstrong virtually none. Virus dose. Route of infection; i.v. or i.p. infection caused hepatitis, whereas infection into the footpad did not. The general genetic background of the murine host; of the strains tested, Swiss mice and A-strain mice were more susceptible than C57BL or CBA mice; BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were least susceptible. The degree of immunocompetence of the murine host; T cell deficient nu/nu mice never developed hepatitis, whereas nu/+ or +/+ mice always did. B cell-depleted anti-IgM-treated mice developed immune-mediated hepatitis comparably or even more extensively than control mice. Local cytotoxic T cell activity; mononuclear cells isolated from livers during the period of overt hepatitis were two to five times more active than equal numbers of spleen cells. Adoptive transfer of nylon wool-nonadherent anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-Lyt-2 plus C- sensitive, anti-L3T4 plus C-resistant lymphocytes into irradiated mice preinfected with LCMV-WE caused a rapid time- and dose-dependent linear increase of serum enzyme levels. This increase was caused by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes if immune cell donors and recipient mice shared class I, but not when they shared class II histocompatibility antigens. The donor cell dose-dependent increase of these enzymes was first measurable 6-18 h after transfer with 2 X 10(8) cells or 3 X 10(6) cells, respectively. The time-dependent increase caused by the adoptive transfer of 1-2 X 10(8) cells was strictly linear during a period of up to 25-40 h. These results indicate single-hit kinetics of liver cell death and suggest that effector T cells destroy infected liver cells via direct contact rather than via soluble toxic mediators. The results may represent the best in vivo correlate of the in vitro 51Cr-release assay that has been analyzed so far, and strongly support the view that antiviral cytotoxic T cells are directly cytolytic in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188412/,154

Administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma is a method of passive specific immunization with an expected therapeutic response. CP can also be used for production a specific immunoglobulin. Experience from previous epidemic infections, caused by the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, shows that CP contains neutralizing antibodies against the virus, which are probably the main source of its therapeutic potential. However, other immune mechanisms cannot be ruled out, such as antibody-induced cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. The use of CP for the treatment of COVID-19 spread during the first half of year 2020 in many countries worldwide and relatively common is also in the Czech Republic, where, at the end of August 2020, about 100 patients were treated with CP. The production and use of CP is governed by the national multidisciplinary guidelines from April 2020 and the recommended therapeutic dose are 2 TU RP (400-450 mL), resp. 4-6 mL/kg. CP is indicated mainly in severe cases of COVID-19, which require oxygen support, ideally within 2-3 days after diagnosis, but our and foreign experience shows a beneficial effect of CP even in moderately severe cases that do not need oxygen treatment.","Bohoněk, Miloš; Řezáč, David; Holub, Michal",Casopis lekaru ceskych,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297703/,154

OBJECTIVE To calculate the costs associated with BSI in intensive care units (ICUs) in Mexico City. DESIGN An 18-month (June 2002 through November 2003), prospective, nested case-control study of patients with and patients without BSI. SETTING Adult ICUs in 3 hospitals in Mexico City. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 55 patients with BSI (case patients) and 55 patients without BSI (control patients) were compared with respect to hospital, type of ICU, year of hospital admission, length of ICU stay, sex, age, and mean severity of illness score. Information about the length of ICU stay was obtained prospectively during daily rounds. The daily cost of ICU stay was provided by the finance department of each hospital. The cost of antibiotics prescribed for BSI was provided by the hospitals' pharmacy departments. RESULTS For case patients, the mean extra length of stay was 6.1 days, the mean extra cost of antibiotics was US dollars 598, the mean extra hospital cost was US dollars 11,591, and the attributable extra mortality was 20%. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the duration of ICU stay for patients with central venous catheter-associated BSI was significantly longer than that for control patients, resulting in increased healthcare costs and a higher attributable mortality. These conclusions support the need to implement preventive measures for hospitalized patients with central venous catheters in Mexico.","Higuera, Francisco; Rangel-Frausto, Manuel Sigfrido; Rosenthal, Victor Daniel; Soto, Jose Martinez; Castañon, Jorge; Franco, Guillermo; Tabal-Galan, Natividad; Ruiz, Javier; Duarte, Pablo; Graves, Nicholas",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17315338/,154

Expert conferences established the need for a pro-active approach and concluded that the introduction of a pathogen inactivation/reduction technology requires a thorough safety profile, a comprehensive pre-clinical and clinical development and an ongoing hemovigilance program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The INTERCEPT Blood System utilizes amotosalen and UVA light and enables for the treatment of platelets and plasma in the same device. Preclinical studies of pathogen inactivation and toxicology and a thorough program of clinical studies have been conducted and an active he-movigilance-program established. RESULTS: INTERCEPT shows robust efficacy of inactivation for viruses, bacteria (including spirochetes), protozoa and leukocytes as well as large safety margins. Furthermore, it integrates well into routine blood center operations. The clinical study program demonstrates the successful use for very diverse patient groups. The hemovigilance program shows safety and tolerability in routine use. Approximately 700,000 INTERCEPT-treated products have been transfused worldwide. The system is in clinical use since class III CE-mark registration in 2002. The safety and efficacy has been shown in routine use and during an epidemic. CONCLUSION: The INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets and plasma offers enhanced safety for the patient and protection against transfusion-transmitted infections.","Irsch, Johannes; Lin, Lily",Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21779203/,154
190165,Form and representation in clinical case reports.,2006,"This review evaluates studies published between January 1997 and August 2003 comparing clinical outcome and bacteriological eradication rates for patients with acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis treated with penicillin or other antimicrobial agents. Studies were identified using MEDLINE, and clinical outcome and bacteriological eradication at end of treatment and 2 weeks after end of treatment were ascertained. Any longer-term follow-up was also noted, along with treatment-related adverse events and compliance. Clinical efficacy rates between penicillin and comparator antibiotics were generally high and similar. Bacterial eradication rates were more variable and, 2 weeks after treatment, ranged from 64% to 93% for penicillin and 31% to 98% for comparators. Simpler dosing schedules and shorter therapy durations produced higher compliance rates. This review highlights the similarities and differences between treatment with penicillin and a wide range of comparator antibiotics. Therapy for acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis should combine excellent clinical efficacy, high bacteriological eradication rates, good tolerance and a simple, convenient dosing regimen.","Schaad, U B",The Journal of international medical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14997699/,154
190312,BK virus vireamia and viruria among a group of post kidney transplant patients in Sri Lanka,2017,"OBJECTIVES Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) significantly impacted cardiac care delivery in a manner that has not been previously experienced in the United States. Attention and resources have focused on physicians, patients, and healthcare systems with little information regarding the effects on nurses and technologists in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). METHODS A national, online survey was conducted for nurses and technologists working in the CCL in the United States. The survey was self administered, anonymous, and included 45 questions assessing baseline demographics, logistical changes to workflow and responsibilities, staff preparedness, and mental health. RESULTS A total of 450 respondents completed the survey, including 283 nurses (63%) and 167 technologists (37%). A total of 349 (78%) were female and mean age range was 41-50 years. Responses indicated that 68% were the primary financial provider for their families, and 74% experienced >75% decrease in case volume despite a low inpatient COVID-19 census (54% of respondents with census <10%). There were high rates of direct care for COVID-19 patients (47%), relocation (45%), lay-off/furloughs of part-time or per diem staff (42%), lay-offs of full-time staff (12%), and decreased work hours (65%). A total of 95% expressed decreased morale with an increase in mental distress, including depression (36%). Predictors of depression included relocation status, staff preparedness, and work hours. CONCLUSION Logistical changes to CCL staffing resulted in relocation, lay-offs, furloughs, and diminished work hours, with financial and emotional ramifications. Particular attention should be paid to those in large urban hospitals, those at risk for relocation, layoffs, and furloughs, and when preparedness and administrative communication is perceived as poor.","Estes, Bailey Ann; Varghese, Joji J; Jacques, Jared; Naidu, Srihari S",The Journal of invasive cardiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33279880/,154

191589,Necrotizing fasciitis: case report and review of literature.,2007,"Human coronaviruses (HuCV) are recognized respiratory pathogens. Data accumulated by different laboratories suggest their neurotropic potential. For example, primary cultures of human astrocytes and microglia were shown to be susceptible to an infection by the OC43 strain of HuCV (A. Bonavia, N. Arbour, V. W. Yong, and P. J. Talbot, J. Virol. 71:800-806, 1997). We speculate that the neurotropism of HuCV will lead to persistence within the central nervous system, as was observed for murine coronaviruses. As a first step in the verification of our hypothesis, we have characterized the susceptibility of various human neural cell lines to infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen, infectious virus progeny, and viral RNA were monitored during both acute and persistent infections. The astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG, U-373 MG, and GL-15, as well as neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, neuroglioma H4, oligodendrocytic MO3.13, and the CHME-5 immortalized fetal microglial cell lines, were all susceptible to an acute infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen and RNA and release of infectious virions were observed during persistent HuCV-OC43 infections ( approximately 130 days of culture) of U-87 MG, U-373 MG, MO3.13, and H4 cell lines. Nucleotide sequences of RNA encoding the putatively hypervariable viral S1 gene fragment obtained after 130 days of culture were compared to that of initial virus input. Point mutations leading to amino acid changes were observed in all persistently infected cell lines. Moreover, an in-frame deletion was also observed in persistently infected H4 cells. Some point mutations were observed in some molecular clones but not all, suggesting evolution of the viral population and the emergence of viral quasispecies during persistent infection of H4, U-87 MG, and MO3.13 cell lines. These results are consistent with the potential persistence of HuCV-OC43 in cells of the human nervous system, accompanied by the production of infectious virions and molecular variation of viral genomic RNA.","Arbour, N; Côté, G; Lachance, C; Tardieu, M; Cashman, N R; Talbot, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10074188/,154

Viral infections may trigger acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, and exacerbation of heart failure, due to a combination of effects including significant systemic inflammatory responses and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque level. Indonesian clinical practice guideline stated that (hydroxy)chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin may be used to treat for COVID-19. However, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin all prolong the QT interval, raising concerns about the risk of arrhythmic death from individual or concurrent use of these medications. To date, there is still no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.

Health security has been viewed as an essential part of human security. Policymakers and health professionals, however, do not share a common definition of health security. This article aims to characterize the notions of health security in order to clarify what constitutes the nexus of health and security. The concept of health security has evolved over time so that it encompasses many entities. Analyzing the health reports of four multilateral organizations (the United Nations, World Health Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the European Union) produced eight categories of most significant relevance to contemporary health security, allowing comparison of the definitions. The four categories are: emerging diseases; global infectious disease; deliberate release of chemical and biological materials; violence, conflict, and humanitarian emergencies. Two other categories of common concern are natural disasters and environmental change, as well as chemical and radioactive accidents. The final two categories, food insecurity and poverty, are discussed less frequently. Nevertheless, food security is emerging as an increasingly important issue in public health. Health security is the first line of defence against health emergencies. As globalization brings more complexities, dealing with the increased scale and extent of health security will require greater international effort and political support.","Chiu, Ya-Wen; Weng, Yi-Hao; Su, Yi-Yuan; Huang, Ching-Yi; Chang, Ya-Chen; Kuo, Ken N",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19965365/,154
192829,Anesthesia for the child with an upper respiratory tract infection: still a dilemma?,2005,"BACKGROUND The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is now widespread in Southeast Asia and which diffused recently in some areas of the Balkans region and Western Europe, has raised a public alert toward the potential occurrence of a new severe influenza pandemic. Here we study the worldwide spread of a pandemic and its possible containment at a global level taking into account all available information on air travel. METHODS AND FINDINGS We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We investigated the effect of the use of AV drugs in the event that therapeutic protocols can be carried out with maximal coverage for the populations in all countries. In view of the wide diversity of AV stockpiles in different regions of the world, we also studied scenarios in which only a limited number of countries are prepared (i.e., have considerable AV supplies). In particular, we compared different plans in which, on the one hand, only prepared and wealthy countries benefit from large AV resources, with, on the other hand, cooperative containment scenarios in which countries with large AV stockpiles make a small portion of their supplies available worldwide. CONCLUSIONS We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20% of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.","Colizza, Vittoria; Barrat, Alain; Barthelemy, Marc; Valleron, Alain-Jacques; Vespignani, Alessandro",PLoS medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17253899/,154

The subjects included free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Parc National des Volcans, Rwanda, and a group of orphan mountain and Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla heringei graueri) housed nearby in a temporary holding facility. Three collection methods were used to recover saliva from discarded forest food: swabbing, soaking, and washing. Saliva was also collected from orphan gorillas maintained in a captive setting by using dental ropes inside mesh bags. The presence of gorilla saliva in each sample was confirmed by using a salivary s-amylase assay and forensic press test paper. The recovery of gorilla DNA was verified by polymerase chain reaction by using primers specific to mountain and Grauer's gorillas. Of the three collection techniques used to recover saliva from forest food, directly swabbing plant bite marks was the most effective. Wild celery (Peucedanum linderi) provided for the most consistent saliva recovery and is eaten year round by mountain gorillas in Rwanda. This study shows that gorilla saliva can be recovered easily and noninvasively from known individual free-ranging gorillas by collecting pieces of wild celery discarded as the gorillas forage and from captive gorillas by offering them juice-soaked dental ropes inside mesh bags. Both methods can be used to recover gorilla DNA for genetic studies. Saliva collected from free-ranging and captive gorillas may prove to be a useful biologic sample for the development of new diagnostic tests and hormonal analysis.","Smiley, Tierra; Spelman, Lucy; Lukasik-Braum, Magdalena; Mukherjee, Jean; Kaufman, Gretchen; Akiyoshi, Donna E; Cranfield, Michael",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20597210/,154
195512,Traditional Chinese medicine--is the grass always greener?,2007,"Exposure of bobcats (Lynx rufus) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) to a range of common canine and feline pathogens was assessed in urban and rural zones of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, a National Park in the San Francisco Bay Area, (California, USA) from 1992 to 1995. Testing included serology for canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus, Leptospira interrogans, feline calicivirus (FCV), feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella henselae. Testing was also performed for Dirofilaria immitis. Significantly more gray foxes were seropositive for CPV in the urban zone than in the rural zone. In addition, radio-tracking of gray foxes in the rural zone indicated that all three of the rural CPV-seropositive foxes had traveled into adjoining small towns, whereas only one of the 11 seronegative animals had done so. Significantly more bobcats were seropositive for FCV in the rural zone than in the urban zone. Individual bobcats with positive FCV antibody titers had patterns of movement that intercepted park inholdings where domestic cats lived. Bobcat samples were seronegative for all five of the other viral feline pathogens, with the exception of a FECV-seropositive bobcat. High seroprevalence was detected for B. henselae and T. gondii in both zones. Variation in the seroprevalence for different pathogens might be related to differences in the exposure of bobcats and foxes to domestic animals: in the urban zone, gray foxes were located in residential areas outside the park, whereas bobcats were not. Although for most of the pathogens examined there was no relationship between urbanization and exposure, our results for CPV in foxes and FCV in bobcats indicated that proximity to urban areas or contact with humans can increase the risk of disease exposure for wild carnivore populations. Combining behavioral information from radio-tracking with data on pathogen exposure or disease incidence can provide valuable insights into the ecology of wildlife disease that might be missed with broad-scale, population-level comparisons alone.","Riley, Seth P D; Foley, Janet; Chomel, Bruno",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15137484/,154

METHODS SARS-associated coronavirus N protein gene was amplified from its genomic RNA by reverse transcript nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR) and cloned into pBAD/Thio-TOPO prokaryotic expression vector. The recombinant N fusion protein was expressed and purified, and its antigenicity and specificity was analyzed by Western Blot, to establish the recombinant N protein-based ELISA for detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-associated coronavirus, and SARS-associated coronavirus lysates-based ELISA was compared parallelly. RESULTS The recombinant expression vector produced high level of the N fusion protein after induction, and that protein was purified successfully by affinity chromatography and displayed higher antigenicity and specificity as compared with whole virus lysates. CONCLUSION The recombinant SARS-associated coronavirus N protein possessed better antigenicity and specificity and could be employed to establish a new, sensitive, and specific ELISA for SARS diagnosis.","Lu, Jian; Zhou, Bai-ping; Zhou, Yu-sen; Jiang, Xiao-ling; Wen, Li-xia; Le, Xiao-hua; Li, Bing; Xu, Liu-mei; Li, Li-xiong",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16201478/,154

Results were compared with those of FeLV-infected cats without intestinal alterations. Other viral infections and specific bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections were excluded by standard microbiologic methods, histopathology, immunohistology, and in situ hybridization. In FeLV-associated enteritis, FeLV gp70 and p15E were strongly expressed in intestinal crypt epithelial cells. In contrast, FeLV-positive cats without intestinal alterations showed only faint staining for gp70 and p15E and comparatively strong p27 expression in these cells. Findings suggest a direct relation between FeLV infection and alterations in intestinal crypt epithelial cells that may be attributed to the envelope proteins gp70 and p15E and/or their precursor protein. Distinct similarities to the intestinal changes in the experimentally induced FeLV-feline AIDS syndrome are obvious, suggesting that naturally occurring feline AIDS variants may be responsible for FeLV-associated enteritis.","Kipar, A; Kremendahl, J; Grant, C K; von Bothmer, I; Reinacher, M",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10714641/,154

The isolated IgG, IgA, and IgM(A) had specific virus-neutralizing activities of 1:7.6, 1:342, and 1:302 per milligram of protein, respectively. Each Ig was fed to groups of hysterectomy-derived colostrum-deprived neonatal pigs before and after exposure (challenge) with virulent TGE virus. The 7 pigs fed IgG survived the challenge exposure, but 2 of 7 fed IgA and 1 of 7 fed IgM(A) died of TGE. Three of the survivor pigs that had been fed IgG and 2 of the survivor pigs that had been fed IgA had increased serum antibody titers between 8 and 19 days after challenge exposure, but none of the survivor pigs fed IgM(A) had TGE antibody. In contrast, 12 of 14 virus-control pigs died of TGE and the 2 survivors had antibody conversion. The data show that all 3 Ig classes in immune colostrum will protect neonatal pigs against exposure with virulent TGE virus.","Stone, S S; Kemeny, L J; Woods, R D; Jensen, M T",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/921021/,154

METHOD We evaluated 271 HCWs from SARS units and 342 healthy control subjects, using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to assess stress levels and a structured list of putative psychological effects of SARS to assess its psychological effects. Healthy control subjects were balanced for age, sex, education, parenthood, living circumstances, and lack of health care experience. RESULTS Stress levels were raised in both groups (PSS = 18) but were not relatively increased in the HCWs. HCWs reported significantly more positive (94%, n = 256) and more negative psychological effects (89%, n = 241) from SARS than did control subjects. HCWs declared confidence in infection-control measures. CONCLUSIONS In HCWs, adaptive responses to stress and the positive effects of infection control training may be protective in future outbreaks. Elevated stress in the population may be an important indicator of future psychiatric morbidity.","Chua, Siew E; Cheung, Vinci; Cheung, Charlton; McAlonan, Grainne M; Wong, Josephine W S; Cheung, Erik P T; Chan, Marco T Y; Wong, Michael M C; Tang, Siu W; Choy, Khai M; Wong, Meng K; Chu, Chung M; Tsang, Kenneth W T",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Joint Bone Spine. 2020;87:191-93",2020,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic hepatic resection (LHR) is still a challenging and developing surgical modality because of technical difficulty and a lack of training opportunities and experience. In this study, we present the results of our initial experiences of LHR, focusing on technical evolution in the management of LHR. METHODS Between April 2011 and March 2012, a total of 12 LHRs were performed. The first 5 of these LHRs were performed under laparoscopic assistance (hybrid-LHR), while the last 7 LHRs were performed totally laparoscopically (pure-LHR). Indications for LHR were hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 9) and metastatic liver cancer (n = 3). LHR procedures consisted of partial resection (n = 2), left lateral segmentectomy (n = 2), and left lobectomy (n = 1) in the hybrid-LHR group, and partial resection (n = 4), left lateral segmentectomy (n = 2), and right lobectomy (n = 1) in the pure-LHR group. Operative outcomes were compared between the groups and technical modifications were evaluated. RESULTS The mean operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay in the hybrid- and pure-LHR groups were 3.8 and 6.1 hours, 220 and 611 ml, and 9.4 and 7.4 days, respectively. There were no postoperative complications in both groups. Tumor margins were negative in all cases. CONCLUSIONS LHR is a feasible and effective procedure for patients with various types of liver tumors, although technical challenges still need to be overcome.","Soejima, Yuji; Ikegami, Toru; Ijichi, Hideki; Ikeda, Tetsuo; Shirabe, Ken; Yoshizumi, Tomoharu; Uchiyama, Hideaki; Yamashita, Yoichi; Harimoto, Norifumi; Toshima, Takeo; Matsuura, Hiroshi; Okadome, Kenichiro; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Fukuoka igaku zasshi = Hukuoka acta medica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397877/,154

METHODS Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.","Wang, Jincheng; Liu, Jinpeng; Wang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Wei; Chen, Xiaoqun; Sun, Chao; Shen, Xiaoyong; Wang, Qidong; Wu, Yaping; Liang, Wenjie; Ruan, Lingxiang",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

200202,International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement for the standardization of bronchoalveolar lavage in lung transplantation,2020,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially contributed to increased anxiety rates among the general population worldwide. Pandemic-related health anxiety and worries about getting COVID-19 can lead to generalized anxiety and anxiety somatization, which, together with insalubrious daily life habits, are risk factors of worsening somatic health in people with SARS-Cov-2 infection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The current study is a part of the COMET-G project (40 countries, n=55589; approved by the Ethics Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), which represents an intermediate analysis of data collected anonymously via online links from a national sample of the Russian general population (n=9936, 31.09±12.16 y.o., 58.7% females) to estimate anxiety using STAI-S and self-reported changes in anxiety and life habits (physical activity, nutrition and weight, internet use, sleep) during the lockdown. All statistical calculations (descriptive statistics, between group comparisons using chi-square test, MANOVA, ANOVA, significant at p<0.05) were performed with IBM SPSS 27. RESULTS Overall STAI-S scores were 29±5.4, a subjective feeling of anxiety increase was reported in 40.3% of respondents (43.9% significantly > in females), worsening to clinical anxiety in 2.1% (2.4% > in females). 54.2% of respondents reported decreased physical activity, 33.1% gained weight, 72% used internet more often, 52.6% experienced worries related to the information about COVID-19 (56.8% > in females). 88% experienced worsened sleep quality, 69.2% stayed up until late, 23.2% took sleeping pills, and 31% had nightmares in which they felt trapped. To ANOVA, such life habits as reduced physical activity during the lockdown, increased time spent online, internet browsing about COVID-19, tendency to stay up late, use of sleeping pills and disturbing dreams with scenario of being trapped were significantly related to worsening of clinical anxiety. However, eating behaviour, weight changes, and social media use did not contribute to the clinical anxiety increase. CONCLUSIONS Factors of decreased physical activity and sleep disturbances related to the lockdown, as well as excessive internet browsing for information about COVID-19, emerged as risk factors for increased anxiety, more notably in women than in men. Preventive measures should be targeted against relevant factors imparting anxiety in the vulnerable population.","Smirnova, Daria; Syunyakov, Timur; Pavlichenko, Alexey; Bragin, Dmitry; Fedotov, Ilya; Filatova, Viktoriia; Ignatenko, Yulia; Kuvshinova, Natalia; Prokopenko, Egor; Romanov, Dmitry; Spikina, Anna; Yashikhina, Anna; Morozov, Petr; Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559790/,154

200387,Sjögren's syndrome concurrent with organizing pneumonia with secondary systemic capillary leak syndrome: a case report,2020,"The ability of many viruses to replicate in host cells depends on cleavage of certain viral glycoproteins, including hemagglutinin (HA). By generating site-specific mutant HAs of two highly virulent influenza viruses, we established that the relationship between carbohydrate in the stalk and the length of the connecting peptide is a critical determinant of cleavability. HAs that lacked an oligosaccharide side chain in the stalk were cleaved regardless of the number of basic amino acids at the cleavage site, whereas those with the oligosaccharide side chain resisted cleavage unless additional basic amino acids were inserted. This finding suggests that the oligosaccharide side chain interferes with HA cleavage if the number of basic amino acids at the cleavage site is not adequate to nullify this effect. Similar interplay could influence cleavage of other viral glycoproteins, such as those of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses and paramyxoviruses.","Kawaoka, Y; Webster, R G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2746732/,154

With the advantages of having various tracers for whole-body imaging, PET provides opportunities to study the mechanism of COVID-19 from different aspects and obtain patterns of extrapulmonary lesions in COVID-19, which helps explore more effective treatments for the patients. This case series opened the door to many future studies.

201791,The angiocrine Rspondin3 instructs interstitial macrophage transition via metabolic-epigenetic reprogramming and resolves inflammatory injury,2020,"Members of the Paramyxoviridae family utilize a variety of different strategies to increase coding capacity within their P cistrons. Translation initiation at alternative 5'-proximal AUG codons is used by measles virus (MV) to express the virus-specific P and C proteins from overlapping reading frames on their mRNAs. Additional species of mRNAs are transcribed from the MV P cistron by the insertion of extra nontemplated G residues at a specific site within the P transcript. Addition of only a single nontemplated G residue results in the expression of the V protein, which contains a unique carboxyl terminus. We have used an Escherichia coli system to express MV P cistron-related mRNAs and proteins. We have found that ribosomal frameshifting on the MV P protein mRNA is capable of generating a previously unrecognized P cistron-encoded protein that we have designated R. Some ribosomes which have initiated translation of the P protein mRNA use the sequence TCC CCG AG (24 nucleotides upstream of the V protein stop codon) to slip into the -1 reading frame, thus translating the sequence as TC CCC GAG. The resulting R protein terminates five codons downstream of the frameshift site at the V protein stop codon. We have gone on to use a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter system to demonstrate that this MV-specific sequence is capable of directing frameshifting during in vivo translation in eukaryotic cells. Analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins from MV-infected cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis allowed detection of a protein species consistent with R protein in MV-infected cells. Quantitation of this protein species allowed a rough estimation of frameshift frequency of approximately 1.8%. Significant stimulation of ribosomal frameshift frequency at this locus of the MV P mRNA was mediated by a downstream stimulator element which, although not yet fully defined, appeared to be neither a conventional stem-loop nor an RNA pseudoknot structure.","Liston, P; Briedis, D J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7474085/,154
202105,Novel coronavirus pneumonia and acute pulmonary thromboembolism: casualty or causality?,2020,"Immunocytochemistry on serial paraffin sections was used to monitor the production dynamics of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and viral antigens in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and the central side of the dorsal root entry zone (DRE) of mice, following infection of the cornea with herpes simplex virus type 1. In normal TG, scattered satellite cells were TNF-alpha+ and in the DRE, TNF-alpha+ and/or low numbers of IL-6+ cells were detected. On day 3 after infection, foci of TG neurons with viral antigens were surrounded by large numbers of TNF-alpha+ and/or IL-6+ cells and low numbers of IFN-gamma+ cells. IL-2+ and/or IL-4+ cells appeared later, when viral antigens had almost cleared. In the TG, the most striking changes occurred with TNF-alpha, with respect to its source (satellite cells, Schwann cells and infiltrating cells) and the extent and long duration of its production. TNF-alpha was the predominant cytokine throughout acute and latent infection and even by day 30, numbers of satellite cells expressing this cytokine were three times higher than those in normal ganglia. Moreover, in the DRE, TNF-alpha was the only cytokine detected during virus clearance and again, its production continued, along with that of IL-6, on days 20 to 30, in both infiltrating cells and astrocytes. Thus, cytokines, particularly TNF-alpha and perhaps IL-6, from infiltrating cells and resident glial cells may have a role both in virus clearance and in normal homeostatic mechanisms in the nervous system such as repair and protection of neurons from damage.","Shimeld, C; Whiteland, J L; Williams, N A; Easty, D L; Hill, T J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9400983/,154
202481,Systemic lupus erythematosus presenting as non-resolving pneumonia: a case report,2021,"In the context of smart cities, there is a general benefit from monitoring close encounters among pedestrians. For instance, for the access control to office buildings, subway, commercial malls, etc., where a high amount of users may be present simultaneously, and keeping a strict record on each individual may be challenging. GPS tracking may not be available in many indoor cases; video surveillance may require expensive deployment (mainly due to the high-quality cameras and face recognition algorithms) and can be restrictive in case of low budget applications; RFID systems can be cumbersome and limited in the detection range. This information can later be used in many different scenarios. For instance, in case of earthquakes, fires, and accidents in general, the administration of the buildings can have a clear record of the people inside for victim searching activities. However, in the pandemic derived from the COVID-19 outbreak, a tracking that allows detecting of pedestrians in close range (a few meters) can be particularly useful to control the virus propagation. Hence, we propose a mobile clustering scheme where only a selected number of pedestrians (Cluster Heads) collect the information of the people around them (Cluster Members) in their trajectory inside the area of interest. Hence, a small number of transmissions are made to a control post, effectively limiting the collision probability and increasing the successful registration of people in close contact. Our proposal shows an increased success packet transmission probability and a reduced collision and idle slot probability, effectively improving the performance of the system compared to the case of direct transmissions from each node.","Rivero-Angeles, Mario E; Barrera-Figueroa, Víctor; Malfavón-Talavera, José E; García-Tejeda, Yunia V; Orea-Flores, Izlian Y; Jiménez-Ramírez, Omar; Bermúdez-Sosa, José A",,,154
202856,"Corona, COVID and kidney transplantation",2020,"The Indian media's reportage of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the State's long-standing apathy towards low-income migrants and the structural neglect and violence faced by them in society. But how consistent were the country's print media in reporting on this population group before the crisis? This paper reports the findings of a study that examines the representation of migrants and refugees and their health in the Indian print media prior to the pandemic. A secondary objective was to examine any variations in their representation based on their social positions (for example, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religion). Using frame and content analyses, three English language newspapers were examined for the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. A total of 1,111 articles were retrieved. Analysis revealed that migrants were most frequently framed as ""villains"", posing a threat to the security, culture, health and economy in their destination states/cities, and less often as victims. On health coverage, the study found that the media frequently pathologised migrants and projected them as carriers of infection. Migrants' religion, ethnicity and class, and their proximity to the majoritarian population appeared most prominent in determining the frame imposed. The articles mostly relied on accounts of state officials and political leaders, whereas migrants' voices comprised less than a quarter of the sources of information. The media thus play a vital role in crystallising these disparities and, through acts of both omission and commission, end up vilifying migrants.","John, Ekatha Ann; Kapilashrami, Anuj",Indian J Med Ethics,,154

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with covid-19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included. All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis (PAT) were included. Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with log rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: During the pandemic period from March-1 to April-30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed covid-19 in our center. Of them, 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis: 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE. Another 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis. Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis. A 67.92% were men.

In the present investigation, we sought to investigate the association between air pollution, meteorological data, and the Lombardy region COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. We considered the number of detected infected people at the regional and provincial scale from February to March 2020. Air pollution data were collected over the Lombardy region, nominally, sulphur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 µm (PM10) and less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5). Meteorological data have been collected over the same region for temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In this work, we evaluated the combined impact of environmental pollutants and climate conditions on the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis evidenced a positive correlation between spatial distribution of COVID-19 infection cases with high concentrations of suspended particulate matter and a negative relationship with ozone. Moreover, suspended particulate matter concentration peaks in February correlated positively with infection peaks according to the virus incubation period. The obtained results suggested that seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seemed to influence COVID-19 epidemics in Lombardy region.","Dragone, Roberto; Licciardi, Giorgio; Grasso, Gerardo; Del Gaudio, Costantino; Chanussot, Jocelyn",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,154
214273,In this issue-2020 draws to a close,2020,"ABSTRACT: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented new challenges to food manufacturers. During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss, with approximately 15% of personnel diagnosed as asymptomatic for COVID-19. Spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals has been implicated in large outbreaks of COVID-19. In March 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in zones 3 and 4 of 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from 17 March to 3 September 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals were actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles, table surfaces, and sanitizer dispensers. Most processing plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of positive test results for plant personnel and environmental surfaces in one plant revealed a close correlation. Our work illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for identifying the presence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic personnel in workplaces and may aid in controlling infection spread.","Ming, Ziwen; Han, Sukkyun; Deng, Kai; Reyes, Enrique; Ha, Youngsil; Kim, Sungsoo; Zhao, Y U; Dobritsa, Anatoly; Wu, Meiting; Zhang, Dandan; Cox, David P; Joyner, Emma; Kulasekara, Hemantha; Kim, Seong Hong; Jang, Yong Seog; Fowler, Curtis; Fei, Xing; Akasaki, Hikari; Themeli, Eni; Agapov, Alexander; Bruneau, Dylan; Tran, Thao; Szczesny, Cameron; Kienzle, Casey; Tenney, Kristina; Geng, Hao; Myoda, Samuel; Samadpour, Mansour",J Food Prot,,154

214604,Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study,2021,"BackgroundMortality rates provide an opportunity to identify and act on the health system intervention for preventing deaths. Hence, it is essential to appreciate the influence of age structure while reporting mortality for a better summary of the magnitude of the epidemic. ObjectivesWe described and compared the pattern of COVID-19 mortality standardized by age between selected states and India from January to November 2020. MethodsWe initially estimated the Indian population for 2020 using the decadal growth rate from the previous census (2011). This was followed by estimations of crude and age-adjusted mortality rate per million for India and the selected states. We used this information to perform indirect standardization and derive the age-standardized mortality rates for the states for comparison. In addition, we derived a ratio for age-standardized mortality to compare across age groups within the state. We extracted information regarding COVID-19 deaths from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme special surveillance portal up to November 16, 2020. ResultsThe crude mortality rate of India stands at 88.9 per million population(118,883/1,337,328,910). Age-adjusted mortality rate (per million) was highest for Delhi (300.5) and lowest for Kerala (35.9).The age-standardized mortality rate (per million) for India is (<15 years=1.6, 15-29 years=6.3, 30-44 years=35.9, 45- 59 years=198.8, 60-74 years=571.2, [≥]75 years=931.6). The ratios for age-standardized mortality increase proportionately from 45-59 years age group across all the states. ConclusionThere is high COVID-19 mortality not only among the elderly ages, but we also identified heavy impact of COVID-19 on the working population. Therefore, we recommend further evaluation of age-adjusted mortality for all States and inclusion of variables like gender, socio-economic status for standardization while identifying at-risk populations and implementing priority public health actions.","Azarudeen, Mohamed Jainul; Dikid, Tanzin; Kurup, Karishma; Aroskar, Khyati; Chauhan, Himanshu; Jain, Sudhir Kumar; Singh, Sujeet",,,154
215453,Operative Management of Rib Synostosis and Malunion: A Case Report,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the first published cases of the Coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan Hubei Province in China, up until to the time of preparation of this report in mid-September 2020, more than 30 million people have been infected all over the world. In March 2020, more than 300,000 cases have been reported all over Iraq. This study aims to represent data analysis, modelling and forecasting approaches to the presented data in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODOLOGY: The project involves mathematical models for forecasting and artificial simulations using particles. In the study, time series models including Simple Exponential Model, Holt's Method and Brown's Models have been used for the forecasting of the future potential rates in the area. A series of simulations have been conducted to observe the possibilities of virus spread rates in a virtual world which represents a quarter of Erbil. RESULTS: The outcome of the study shows how the disease have spread in Kurdistan, and what are the current rates to compare with neighbour regions. The modelling clearly shows that with cases still sporadically appearing, the risk of second and third waves of infections is high. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the regional government must reduce unnecessary gatherings to the lowest possible level. A scientific registry system of disease statistics must be put in place and rigorously updated all the times. We recommend the officials use a nationwide database provided to the public to monitor movement of every infected individual, to prevent further spread.","Abdullah, Milad; Kolo, Kamal; Aspoukeh, Peyman; Hamad, Rahel; Bailey, James R",J Infect Dev Ctries,,154

The consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia on survivors' pulmonary function and quality of life are unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived dyspnoea. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study regarding patients discharged from our hospital after PCR-proven, non-critical COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. Cases were classified as moderate or severe pneumonia according to WHO definitions. Six weeks post-discharge subjects underwent interviews and pulmonary function tests, and completed questionnaires to assess their HRQoL, perceived dyspnoea (Borgscale and mMRC), and symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS). RESULTS: 101 patients were included. Twenty-eight (27.7%) pneumonias were classified as moderate cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and 73 (72.3%) were classified as severe cases. Diffusion limitation (DLCOc < 80% of predicted value) was found in 66 (71.7%) of 92 cases, obstruction in 26 (25.7%) of 101, and restriction in 21 (21.2%) of 99. Diffusion capacity was significantly lower in cases after severe pneumonia. In the entire group, HADS scores &#8805;8 for depression were found in 16.6% and in 12.5% for anxiety. Across all SF-36 domains, except for bodily pain, significant impairment was found. FEV1 and DLCOc showed significant positive correlations with mMRC scores and multiple SF-36 domains, especially physical functioning. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 non-critical pneumonia survivors have significant impairment in diffusion capacity and HRQOL six weeks after being discharged from hospital.","van der Sar-van der Brugge, S; Talman, S; Boonman-de Winter, Ljm; de Mol, M; Hoefman, E; van Etten, R W; De Backer, I C",Respir Med,,154
218690,Asymptomatic novel coronavirus pneumonia patient outside Wuhan: The value of CT images in the course of the disease,2020,"O carcinoma de células escamosas (CCE) é uma neoplasia epitelial originada dos queratinócitos da pele de cães. Sua etiologia está relacionada à exposição a raios solares ultravioletas, o que o coloca como uma das neoplasias mais frequentes em países tropicais de clima quente. O CCE cutâneo tem comportamento invasivo local, baixa capacidade de metástase e frequentemente encontra-se associado à ceratose actinica. Neste estudo, objetivou-se avaliar o efeito do tratamento pré-operatório com piroxicam (Px) na expressão de COX-2 e Ki67, indicadores de inflamação e proliferação celular, respectivamente, em cães acometidos por CCE cutâneo. Além disso, o intervalo livre de doença (ILD) por um período de pelo menos 180 dias após excisão cirúrgica associada a regime de baixa dose diária com Px (0.3mg/kg) e ciclofosfamida (CYC; 15mg/m2 ) foi determinado nesta população. Não houve diferença estatística significativa na expressão de COX-2 após o tratamento pré-cirúrgico com Px; no entanto, houve diminuição no índice proliferativo marcado com Ki67 (P<0.05). Não foi encontrada alteração significativa no ILD no grupo tratado com Px e CYC (160 dias), quando comparado com o grupo controle retrospectivo (145 dias), tratado somente com ressecção cirúrgica. Não houve diferença estatística no ILD quando analisados o grau histológico, índice mitótico, tempo de evolução, metástase de linfonodos e o comprometimento das margens cirúrgicas. Adicionalmente, cães com estadiamento T4, independente do tratamento, estavam 3.2x e 4.8x mais propensos a recidiva precoce quando comparados aos estádios T3 e T2, respectivamente. Os resultados deste estudo demonstram o efeito anti- proliferativo do Px, independente da inibição de COX-2. O tratamento com baixa dose de Px e CYC associado a cirurgia não foi acompanhado por um aumento do ILD, em comparação com animais submetidos apenas ao tratamento cirúrgico.","ALBERNAZ, VINICIUS GONZALEZ PERES",,,154
219520,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 as the Molecular Bridge Between Epidemiologic and Clinical Features of COVID-19,2020,"The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them, E. amurensis is extant in East Asia’s areas only, whereas E. europaeus, E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe, including Italy. Western European hedgehogs’ ecological and feeding habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus, pestiviruses and Aujeszky’s disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.","Delogu, Mauro; Cotti, Claudia; Lelli, Davide; Sozzi, Enrica; Trogu, Tiziana; Lavazza, Antonio; Garuti, Giacomo; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Vaccari, Gabriele; De Marco, Maria Alessandra; Moreno, Ana",Animals,,154

In this article, we highlight the key considerations necessary for engineering LNPs as a vaccine delivery system and explore areas for further optimisation. There remain opportunities to improve protection of mRNA, optimise cytosolic delivery, target specific cells, minimise adverse side effects and control release of RNA from the particle. The modular nature of LNP formulations and the flexibility of mRNA as a payload provide many pathways to implement these strategies. Innovation in LNP vaccines is likely to accelerate with increased enthusiasm following recent successes, however any advances will have implications for a broad range of therapeutic applications beyond vaccination such as gene therapy.","Huang, Jessica; Yuen, Daniel; Mintern, Justine D; Johnston, Angus P R",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,,154

A few reports showing a positive correlation between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 mortality have ushered in some hope. BCG has been suggested to confer a broad level of nonspecific protection against several pathogens, mainly via eliciting ""trained immunity"" in innate immune cells. Secondly, BCG has also been proven to provide benefits in autoimmune diseases by inducing tolerogenicity. Being an acute inflammatory disease, COVID-19 requires a therapy that induces early priming of anti-viral immune responses and regulates aberrant hyperactivity of innate-immune cells. Here, we hypothesize that BCG can offer reliable spatiotemporal protection from COVID-19 by triggering trained immunity and tolerogenesis, through multiple cellular pathways. We propose further research on BCG-mediated immunoprotection, especially in vulnerable individuals, as a strategy to halt the progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country ""at war"" against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020.

A new questionnaire was developed to evaluate participants' hesitancy. The study was conducted online in November, 2020, using convenience sampling. A total of 538 individuals from the general Greek population participated in the study and completed the Hesitancy Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), the Short Health Anxiety Inventory and a COVID-19-related worry question. The Hesitancy Questionnaire proved to have adequate psychometric properties. Correlation with anxiety as assessed by GAD-2 proved to be significant but low, indicating that the two scales are measuring two different concepts. The greatest hesitancy was observed in older adults for both genders (males, M = 40.86, SD = 15.24; females, M = 49.34, SD = 14.74). Women in general appeared more hesitant than men scoring higher (males, M = 36.13, SD = 15.25; females, M = 42.63, SD = 17.31) with a statistically significant difference [t(536) = - 3.706, p = .001).

Major tasks are defined in the federal laws for the public health service emphasizing different types of activities in daycare units, schools, and community living environments. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the activities of the KJGD have clearly changed. This article will provide a review of these tasks during the pandemic on the basis of interviews with KJGD administrations in 11 communities of the federal state North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2020.Typically, the KJGD is deeply involved in infection prevention in daycare facilities and schools by providing contact tracing, swab collection, guidance, crisis committee participation, quarantine survey, and data capture. The classic tasks had to be entirely discontinued in some areas, or at least strongly limited. The affected areas include occupational medicine, medical reports, school entry examinations for children, assessment of special education needs, health reporting, cooperation with child protection and early intervention, outbreak management for other infectious diseases, and the closing of immunization gaps.The consequences of discontinuing the original tasks, e.g., missing school entry examinations, cannot be predicted; resumption of these activities is essential. On behalf of municipal services of general interest in the sense of public health (in all policies), the KJGD makes a remarkable contribution to ensuring that children and youths not only stay physically healthy and far from infections but are also promoted in their individual development and participation.","Horacek, Ulrike; Auer, Isabel; Thaiss, Heidrun",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,154

DESIGN: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which clinical and laboratory data from 237 women of child-bearing age diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Menstrual data from 177 patients were analysed. Blood samples from the early follicular phase were tested for sex hormones and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). RESULTS: Among 237 patients with confirmed COVID-19, severely ill patients had more comorbidities than mildly ill patients (34% versus 8%), particularly for patients with diabetes, hepatic disease and malignant tumours. Of 177 patients with menstrual records, 45 (25%) patients presented with menstrual volume changes, and 50 (28%) patients had menstrual cycle changes, mainly a decreased volume (20%) and a prolonged cycle (19%). The average sex hormone and AMH concentrations of women of child-bearing age with COVID-19 were not different from those of age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Average sex hormone concentrations and ovarian reserve did not change significantly in COVID-19 women of child-bearing age. Nearly one-fifth of patients exhibited a menstrual volume decrease or cycle prolongation. The menstruation changes of these patients might be the consequence of transient sex hormone changes caused by suppression of ovarian function that quickly resume after recovery.","Li, Kezhen; Chen, Ge; Hou, Hongyan; Liao, Qiuyue; Chen, Jing; Bai, Hualin; Lee, Shiyeow; Wang, Cheng; Li, Huijun; Cheng, Liming; Ai, Jihui",Reprod. biomed. online,,154

Consequently, broader testing than the current methods of nasal or throat swabs will significantly increase the number of people screening, leading to more effective control of the spread of COVID-19. Nonetheless, a comparison of saliva-based assay with current swab test is needed to understand what and how we can benefit from this newly developed assay.

Many regions have experienced its effects. The state of South Carolina in the USA has seen cases since early March 2020 and a primary peak in early April 2020. A lockdown was imposed on April 6th but lifting of restrictions started on April 24th. The daily case and death data as reported by NCHS (deaths) via the New York Times GitHUB repository have been analyzed and approaches to modeling of the data are presented. Prediction is also considered and the role of asymptomatic transmission is assessed as a latent unobserved effect. Two different time periods are examined and one step prediction is provided. The results suggest that both socio-economic disadvantage, asymptomatic transmission and spatial confounding are important ingredients in any model pertaining to county level case dynamics.","Lawson, Andrew B; Kim, Joanne",PLoS One,,154

These microbes interact with the immune system and affect human physiology. Advances in metagenomics have associated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with alterations in fungal and viral species in the gut. Studies of animal models have found that commensal fungi and viruses can activate host-protective immune pathways related to epithelial barrier integrity, but can also induce reactions that contribute to events associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Changes in our environment associated with modernization and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed humans to new fungi and viruses, with unknown consequences. We review the lessons learned from studies of animal viruses and fungi commonly detected in the human gut and how these might affect health and intestinal disease.","Iliev, Iliyan D; Cadwell, Ken",Gastroenterology,,154

Using data from a representative sample of the Portuguese population (N = 1,411) collected early in the pandemic, we find that while media sources were more frequently used, scientific sources played a more important role on perceived personal and societal-level risks; higher trust in scientific sources associated with increased risk perceptions (i.e., amplified perceived risk), trust in social media associated with dismissing personal threat (i.e., attenuated perceived risk). These findings suggest that people's relations with science were determinant factors in risk perceptions, and dimensions that measure these deserve further investigation.","Entradas, Marta",Health Commun,,154

249686,Inner City Asthma Tele-medicine during Covid Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) and cognitive decline (CD) are costly, challenging to treat, highly prevalent among older adults, and worsen each other over time. We are iteratively developing Active-Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older adults with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count aided by a Fitbit. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and signals of improvement in emotional, physical, and cognitive function when delivered in-person to this population. OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AB-F versus a time- and dose-matched educational control (Health Enhancement Program; HEP) in older adults with CP and CD. Due to COVID-19 and qualitative feedback from former participants, both programs are delivered in an entirely virtual format via live video (Zoom). Here, we describe our virtual study protocol, manualized treatments, evaluation plan, and study design. We will evaluate feasibility benchmarks and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and cognitive function. METHODS: This is a single-blind pilot RCT. Participants are randomized to one of two programs: AB-F or HEP. Patients are recruited through pain clinic referrals, institutional registries, and IRB-approved flyers. Interested participants are screened for eligibility via telephone and provide electronic informed consent. After randomization, participants are mailed all study documents, including their treatment manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate sealed envelope for AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via secure live video. Participants complete self-report and performance-based (6-minute walk test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) outcome measures via live video at baseline and post-intervention. Primary outcomes are a-priori set feasibility (recruitment, quantitative measures, adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional function, as well as intervention targets (social function, pain intensity, pain-specific coping, mindfulness). RESULTS: The trial is ongoing. We have recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F, 11 HEP) across two rounds. Only two participants have withdrawn (1 before baseline, 1 before first session). All 19 remaining participants have completed the baseline. In the first round, attendance is high (11/12 completed all 4 sessions so far) and AB-F participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step goals (5/6). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our completely virtual AB-F intervention but need to be confirmed at the trial conclusion. This study will answer important questions about the feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body and activity program to older adults with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Details on integrating multiple digital platforms for the virtual assessments and intervention delivery will inform treatment development for older adults generally and those with CP-CD specifically, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

249687,A060 Inner City Asthma Tele-medicine during Covid Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with ""flu-like"" upper respiratory tract symptoms and pneumonia. Body cavity effusions develop in a subset of patients with advanced disease. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be present in certain body fluids (eg, blood) of COVID patients, it remains unclear if body cavity fluids are sites of infection. Our aim was to characterize the cytologic and clinical findings in COVID-19 patients with effusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A record search for all cases of body cavity effusion cytology in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from March 1, 2020, to September 1, 2020, was performed. Clinical history, fluid chemical analysis, cytologic findings, and patient outcomes were recorded. All cytology slides were reviewed. In situ hybridization (ISH) targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein transcript (V-nCoV2019-S) was performed on cell block material in all cases. RESULTS: A total of 17 effusion cytology cases were identified among 15 COVID patients, including 13 pleural, 2 pericardial, and 2 peritoneal. Most (13 of 15) patients were hospitalized for COVID complications. Eight patients died during hospitalization, 7 from COVID complications. All fluids were transudative by protein criteria. Lymphocytic or histiocytic inflammation predominated in 12 of 17 cases. Five exhibited hemophagocytosis. No viral cytopathic changes or extra-medullary megakaryocytes were seen. Viral RNA was not detected in any case by ISH. CONCLUSIONS: Body cavity effusion is an ominous finding in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease. Such effusions tend to be transudative with lymphohistiocytic inflammation, and commonly exhibit hemophagocytosis, an otherwise rare finding in effusion cytologies. No direct infection of cellular elements by SARS-CoV-2 was identified by ISH.","Cantley, Richard L; Hrycaj, Steven; Konopka, Kristine; Chan, May P; Huang, Tao; Pantanowitz, Liron",,,154

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed 2-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than 2-fold higher rate for death as compared with White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared with White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors, health comorbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are underrepresented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on postdiagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for health care access will be critical to stem these disparities.","Newman, Lisa A; Winn, Robert A; Carethers, John M",Clin. cancer res,,154

In this review, we discuss endogenous regulatory mechanisms that prevent thrombosis in the microcirculation, experimental approaches to induce microvascular thrombi, and clinical conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis. A greater understanding of the links between inflammation and thrombosis in the microcirculation is anticipated to provide optimal therapeutic targets for patients with diseases accompanied by microvascular thrombosis.","Bray, Monica A; Sartain, Sarah E; Gollamudi, Jahnavi; Rumbaut, Rolando E",Transl Res,,154
253370,Viral Meningitis Associated With COVID-19 in a 9-year-old Child: A Case Report,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in several patients who traveled to Wuhan or went to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 was 96.2% identical to bat β-coronaviruses from lineage B. Also, several studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, for entry to target cells. Lung alveolar and small intestine are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 due to the high expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. In this review, we focused on the zoonotic β-coronaviruses and given there is no specific drug or vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019, we reviewed the literature on the therapy options for SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, in order to discover their possible use in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Fani, Mona; Teimoori, Ali; Ghafari, Shokouh",Future Virol.,,154

The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on perceived stress levels in the Jordanian population is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the perceived stress level and factors associated with it in the Jordanian population during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Required data, such as those from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and possible predictors of perceived stress, were collected through a Web-based survey. Statistical analysis was conducted through SPSS. RESULTS: The mean (SD) of perceived stress score was 19.8 (6.7). Regression analysis revealed that stress was increased in females, young adults, usually being stressed more than others by a health problem, increased perceived severity of the disease, increased overall worry score, and student's worry regarding their studies/graduation. Perceived stress was decreased if participants' self-rated health status score increased. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of increasing public health preparedness, the results of this study can be used in designing interventions to alleviate stress in susceptible segments of the Jordanian community.","Abdel Jalil, Mariam H; Alsous, Mervat M; Hammad, Eman A; Mousa, Rimal; Saleh, Mais M; Abu Hammour, Khawla",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,154
253986,COVID-19 in the Developing World: Is the Immune Response to α-Gal an Overlooked Factor Mitigating the Severity of Infection?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since home confinement for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, pediatric visits to the emergency department (ED) have decreased, including consultation for abdominal pain. Our aim is to investigate the incidence of complicated acute appendicitis (AA; peritonitis or appendicular mass) during confinement for COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with the previous 5 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in children with AA who underwent surgery between March 9 and April 13 from 2015 to 2020; patients were divided into six groups according to the year of surgery. We analyzed demographic variables, time from onset of symptoms, mean hospital stay, cumulative incidence, and incidence rate of complicated appendicitis. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were included with no differences in the number of patients, gender, and age between groups. Patients in 2020 (COVID-19 group) presented longer symptom progression time (46.8 hours; p = 0.046), higher rate of complicated appendicitis (48.4%; p = 0.004), longer mean hospital stay (4.9 days; p < 0.001), increased cumulative incidence (8.27 cases per 100,000 children per 0.1 years; p < 0.001), and increased incidence rate of complicated appendicitis (83 cases per 100,000 children; p < 0.001) when compared with other groups. CONCLUSION: Delayed ED visit of children with AA during home confinement lead to an increased rate of complicated appendicitis. It is crucial to make parents aware of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of abdominal pain.","Delgado-Miguel, Carlos; Muñoz-Serrano, Antonio J; Miguel-Ferrero, Miriam; De Ceano-Vivas, María; Calvo, Cristina; Martínez, Leopoldo",Eur. j. pediatr. surg,,154

This work presents a continuation of our previous research, in which we analyzed and developed a methodology to inhibit COVID-19 spread on a university campus. We simulate the virus spread on campus, comparing SIR and SEIR models, and examine how different course policies can affect the number of infected students. We demonstrate that we can achieve a safer environment on campus by moving a certain number of courses with the highest centrality values. Additionally, we analyze how the student flow rate can help reduce the R0 value representing the metric of how many other people an infected individual could infect. This work also presents the simulation analysis of the opened public places on campus and the application of the sensitivity analysis to develop the most efficient approach determining the exact courses that need to be moved online.

255647,Case Report: Endoscopic Removal of an Eroded Gastric Band Causing Small Bowel Obstruction upon Migration into the Proximal Jejunum,2020,"In order to analyze the effectiveness of three successive nationwide lockdown enforced in India, we present a data-driven analysis of four key parameters, reducing the transmission rate, restraining the growth rate, flattening the epidemic curve and improving the health care system. These were quantified by the consideration of four different metrics, namely, reproduction rate, growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio. The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a $45\%$ reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from $393\%$ during the pre-lockdown to $33\%$ after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form $4$-$6$ days to $12$-$14$ days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from $0.28$ (pre-lockdown) to $0.08$ after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3. Analysis of the data in the post-lockdown period with these metrics will provide greater clarity with regards to the extent of the success of the lockdown.","Mondal, Dipankar; Chakrabarty, Siddhartha P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12006v1.pdf,154

257037,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus infection in children: Thoughts on the diagnostic criteria of suspected cases outside Hubei Province/ 中国小儿急救医学,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family (Coronaviridae) of viruses that cause respiratory disorders in birds and mammals. They were originally discovered as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens in the early 20thcentury. A group of related viruses subsequently discovered from mice and humans led to the collective naming as coronaviruses, as they were all characterized by a solar corona-like ring on their surface, called the spikes. The first known human CoVs were among viruses that cause common cold and considered as modest threats to human health. But the emergence of zoonotic CoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during every recent past decade resulted in pandemics with loss of human lives. With no vaccine to prevent, and no drug to treat the infections, the miniscule viruses evolve into behemoths of plagues. SARS-CoV-2 with its infection, COVID-19, is particularly rampant and malicious and is bound to cause colossal impacts not only on human health but also on global economy. Understanding of their evolutionary strategies and pathogenic adaptions had given us fair warnings. Yet, the world was ill-prepared. This article highlights the scientific messages that could have mit-igated the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolutionary mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs that bely drug and vaccine development, and above all, the possible epidemics in the future.","Lalchhandama, Kholhring",Int.

257701,Gastrointestinal Manifestations in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Novel Coronavirus Infection,2020,"Coronaviruses are deadly and contagious pathogens that affects people in different ways. Researchers have increased their efforts in the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus targeting Mpro protein (main protease) as an effective drug target. The present study explores the inhibitory potential of characteristic and non-characteristic Withania somnifera (Indian ginseng) phytochemicals (n &#8776; 100) against SARS-Cov-2 Mpro protein. Molecular docking studies revealed that certain W. somnifera compounds exhibit superior binding potential (-6.16 to -12.27 kcal/mol) compared to the standard inhibitors (-2.55 to -6.16 kcal/mol) including nelfinavir and lopinavir. The non-characteristic compounds (quercetin-3-rutinoside-7-glucoside, rutin and isochlorogenic acid B) exhibited higher inhibitory potential in comparison to characteristic W. somnifera compounds withanolide and withanone. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the complex for 100 ns confirm favorable and stable binding of the lead molecule. The MMPBSA calculation of the last 10 ns of the protein-ligand complex trajectory exhibited stable binding of quercetin-3-rutinoside-7-glucoside at the active site of SARS-Cov-2 Mpro. Taken together, the study demonstrates that the non-characteristic compounds present in W. somnifera possess enhanced potential to bind SARS-Cov-2 Mpro active site. We further recommend in vitro and in vivo experimentation to validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of these lead molecules.","Kushwaha, Prem Prakash; Singh, Atul Kumar; Prajapati, Kumari Sunita; Shuaib, Mohd; Gupta, Sanjay; Kumar, Shashank",Microb Pathog,,154

Methods: In this retrospective study, we studied patients with COVID-19 referred to Sina Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from February 20 to May 14, 2020. Patients with either a positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction test of swab specimens or high clinical suspicion according to the World Health Organization interim guidance were included. We accurately divided all patients into two groups based on diabetes affection and followed-up patients with DM based on incurring death, severe COVID-19, and in-hospital complications. Results: We enrolled 574 patients with COVID-19 in the final analysis, of whom 176 (30.7%) patients had DM. In this study, 104 (18.1%) patients deceased, and 380 (66.2%) patients incurred severe COVID-19. We found that COVID-19 patients with DM had a significantly higher mortality rate (P value<0.001), severe disease (P value<0.001), and in-hospital complications (all P values<0.05). Besides that, in patients with DM, admission temperature (odds ratio (OR): 1.69, P value: 0.024), oxygen saturation (OR: 0.92, P value: 0.004), and urea (OR: 1.01, P value: 0.048) were independent risk indicators of in-hospital mortality. In addition, subgroup analysis of diabetic patients based on admission glucose level showed significant differences between these groups regarding acute cardiac injury (P value: 0.044) and acute liver injury (P value: 0.002). Conclusions: Patients with DM admitted with lower oxygen saturation, elevated temperature, and higher urea are more susceptible to progress to more severe COVID-19 and poor prognosis. This indicates a necessity for more precise care during hospitalization for these patients.

Yet, the practical model production and further research of deep face recognition are in great need of corresponding public support. For example, the production of face representation network desires a modular training scheme to consider the proper choice from various candidates of state-of-the-art backbone and training supervision subject to the real-world face recognition demand; for performance analysis and comparison, the standard and automatic evaluation with a bunch of models on multiple benchmarks will be a desired tool as well; besides, a public groundwork is welcomed for deploying the face recognition in the shape of holistic pipeline. Furthermore, there are some newly-emerged challenges, such as the masked face recognition caused by the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, which draws increasing attention in practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an easy-to-use unified framework to meet the above demands. To this end, we introduce a novel open-source framework, named FaceX-Zoo, which is oriented to the research-development community of face recognition. Resorting to the highly modular and scalable design, FaceX-Zoo provides a training module with various supervisory heads and backbones towards state-of-the-art face recognition, as well as a standardized evaluation module which enables to evaluate the models in most of the popular benchmarks just by editing a simple configuration. Also, a simple yet fully functional face SDK is provided for the validation and primary application of the trained models. Rather than including as many as possible of the prior techniques, we enable FaceX-Zoo to easily upgrade and extend along with the development of face related domains.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students in different geographical areas in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted in 16 provinces or municipalities among Chinese college students from Feb 4 to Feb 12, 2020. An online survey was adopted to collect information, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward epidemic and control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptom was assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7); depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). A total of 11 787 participants were involved in the current study. The Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of the perceived risk of infection and attitude toward the COVID-19 between different geographic locations. The binary logistic models were used to identify associations between associations of geographic location and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 11 787 participants were analyzed in the current study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms were 17.8% (95%CI: 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95%CI: 25.1%-26.7%) for college students. After controlling for covariates, geographically speaking, current living in Wuhan was positively associated with anxiety symptoms (current living OR=1.69, 95%CI: 1.23-2.31, and depressive symptoms (current living OR=1.45, 95%CI: 1.21-1.89) compared with other areas. However, there is no difference in college location. Living or travel history in Wuhan last month was also positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR=1.79, 95%CI: 1.51-2.31) and depressive symptoms (OR=1.62, 95%CI: 1.41-1.85). Both anxiety and depression were more prevalent among college students who reported with high perceived the infection risk of him/herself (&#967;2= 220.46 for anxiety, &#967;2=131.79 for depression; both P < .001) and family members (&#967;2=197.52 for anxiety, &#967;2=136.06 for depression; both P < .001). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were highest in college students who reported with very worry about the infection of her/himself (&#967;2=285.77 for anxiety, &#967;2=186.10 for depression; both P < .001), and community members(&#967;2=178.46 for anxiety, &#967;2=119.60 for depression; both P < .001). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were highest in college students who had a pessimistic attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic (&#967;2=444.61 for anxiety, &#967;2=355.95 for depression; both P<.001) and control (&#967;2=154.02 for anxiety, &#967;2=124.84 for depression; both P< .001). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems among Chinese college students were widespread and geographically diverse. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.","Wu, Xiaoyan; Tao, Shuman; Zhang, Yi; Li, Shiyue; Ma, Le; Yu, Yizhen; Sun, Guilong; Li, Tingting; Tao, Fangbiao",J. med. internet res,,154
264398,Chylovenous bypass for mesenteric lymphangiomatosis: A case report,2020,"Diseases of the lung result in oxygen deficiency, hypoxemia, with the indications for oxygen supplementation, whereas hypercapnia and dyspnea are consequences of disorders and failure of the ventilatory pump, which need to be treated by mechanical ventilation. Early diagnostics enable a timely noninvasive ventilation treatment and can prevent overt ventilatory failure and avoid acute invasive ventilation. Diagnostic measures are available, so that the risk of developing overt respiratory failure can be ascertained in time. Treatment of respiratory pump insufficiency, i.e. ventilatory insufficiency, is also established. Many patients with ventilatory insufficiency use intermittent or continuous ventilation every day in order to relieve the respiratory musculature. Many studies have confirmed an extension of life expectancy and a better quality of life, when this relief together with a lowering of the pCO2 is achieved under ventilation and more importantly while breathing spontaneously. If the target of lowering the pCO2 is not achieved, an effect of intermittent ventilation cannot be detected. The more severe the disease, the more difficult it is to achieve relief, because the substantial effort needed for breathing by the patient can hardly be relieved by assisted ventilation alone. The relief is always guaranteed by a total passive mechanical ventilation below the apnea threshold so that the patient does not need to independently breathe. A high tidal volume, an adequately high respiratory rate and a prolonged inspiration time are necessary in order to reduce the pCO2 to below the normal range and to induce passive ventilation. No lung damage has been observed with this treatment strategy in a large number of patients.","Laier-Groeneveld, G; Criée, C-P",Pneumologe (Berl),,154

266493,Tocilizumab versus the COVID-19 tempest: all's well that ends well or much ado about nothing?,2020,"Single-atom alloys can be effective catalysts and have been compared to supported single-atom catalysts. To rationally design single-atom alloys and other surfaces with localized ensembles, it is crucial to understand variations in reactivity when varying the dopant and the ensemble size. Here, we examined hydrogen adsorption on surfaces embedded with localized clusters and discovered general trends. Counterintuitively, increasing the amount of a more reactive metal sometimes makes a surface site less reactive. This behavior is due to the hybridization and splitting of narrow peaks in the electronic density of states of many of these surfaces, making them analogous to free-standing nanoclusters. When a single-atom alloy has a peak just below the Fermi energy, the corresponding two-dopant cluster often has weaker adsorption than the single-atom alloy due to splitting of this peak across the Fermi energy. Furthermore, single-atom alloys have qualitatively different behaviors than larger ensembles. Specifically, the adsorption energy is a U-shaped function of the dopant's group for single-atom alloys. Additionally, adsorption energies on single-atom alloys correlate more strongly with the dopant's p-band center than with the d-band center.","Monasterial, Abigale P; Hinderks, Calla A; Viriyavaree, Songkun; Montemore, Matthew M",J Chem Phys,,154

267216,Post-transplant donor-specific antibody and outcomes with T cell-mediated rejection and nonadherence,2020,"Community mitigation activities (also referred to as nonpharmaceutical interventions) are actions that persons and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases. Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (e.g., handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (e.g., maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces. Actions such as social distancing are especially critical when medical countermeasures such as vaccines or therapeutics are not available. Although voluntary adoption of social distancing by the public and community organizations is possible, public policy can enhance implementation. The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity. This report presents initial data from the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; New Orleans, Louisiana; and New York City, New York* to describe the relationship between timing of public policy measures, community mobility (a proxy measure for social distancing), and temporal trends in reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Community mobility in all four locations declined from February 26, 2020 to April 1, 2020, decreasing with each policy issued and as case counts increased. This report suggests that public policy measures are an important tool to support social distancing and provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVID-19.","Lasry, Arielle; Kidder, Daniel; Hast, Marisa; Poovey, Jason; Sunshine, Gregory; Winglee, Kathryn; Zviedrite, Nicole; Ahmed, Faruque; Ethier, Kathleen A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,154

As a result, Twitter and other social media became an important place of interaction, and conversation became online. The aim of this study is to examine Twitter discussions around COVID-19 in Greece. Twitter was chosen because of the critical role it played during the global health crisis. Tweets were recorded over four time periods. NodeXL Pro was used to identify word pairs, create semantic networks, and analyze them. A lexicon-based sentiment analysis was also performed. The main topics of conversation were extracted. “New cases” are heavily discussed throughout, showing fear of transmission of the virus in the community. Mood analysis showed fluctuations in mood over time. Positive emotions weakened and negative emotions increased. Fear is the dominant sentiment. Timely knowledge of people’s sentiment can be valuable for government agencies to develop efficient strategies to better manage the situation and use efficient communication guidelines in Twitter to disseminate accurate, reliable information and control panic.","Kydros, Dimitrios Argyropoulou Maria Vrana Vasiliki",Sustainability,,154

This requires an urgent identification of drugs and other interventions to overcome this pandemic. Computational drug repurposing represents an alternative approach to provide a more effective approach in search for COVID-19 drugs. Selected natural product known to have antiviral activities were screened, and based on their hits; a similarity search with FDA approved drugs was performed using computational methods. Obtained drugs from similarity search were assessed for their stability and inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 targets. Diosmin (DB08995) was found to be a promising drug that works with two distinct mechanisms, preventing viral replication and viral fusion into the host cell. Isoquercetin (DB12665) and rutin (DB01698) work by inhibiting viral replication and preventing cell entry, respectively. Our analysis based on molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculation suggests that diosmin, isoquercetin, rutin and other similar flavone glycosides could serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor, hence an alternative solution to treat COVID-19 upon further clinical validation.","Shadrack, Daniel M; Deogratias, Geradius; Kiruri, Lucy W; Swai, Hulda S; Vianney, John-Mary; Nyandoro, Stephen S",J Mol Graph Model,,154

Therefore, the present study investigated the differences in phobic anxiety between work and leisure activities according to optimistic bias among 533 South Korean citizens. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, t-tests, and a one-way analysis of variance were conducted to examine the data. The results showed that for leisure activities, women showed a higher perception of phobic anxiety. In addition, the group showing high optimistic bias had a higher perception of phobic anxiety in both work and leisure activity situations. Therefore, support measures to lower phobic anxiety among women are needed at the government level, while support and interest from family members are needed at home. Moreover, local governments must ensure active involvement to mitigate phobic anxiety among individuals, and measures are needed to more actively implement infectious disease prevention behaviors.","Kim, Young-Jae; Kim, E-Sack",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,154

However, the effect of plasma therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of plasma infusions in people with PD. METHODS: A total of 15 people with clinically established PD, at least 1 cognitive complaint, and on stable therapy received 1 unit of young fresh frozen plasma twice a week for 4 weeks. Assessments and adverse effects were performed/reported on and off therapy at baseline, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the infusions ended. Adverse effects were also assessed during infusions. The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and feasibility. Exploratory outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III off medication, neuropsychological battery, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-6), uric acid, and quantitative kinematics. RESULTS: Adherence rate was 100% with no serious adverse effects. There was evidence of improvement in phonemic fluency (P = 0.002) and in the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 stigma subscore (P = 0.013) that were maintained at the delayed evaluation. Elevated baseline tumor necrosis factor-&#945; levels decreased 4 weeks after the infusions ended. CONCLUSIONS: Young fresh frozen plasma was safe, feasible, and well tolerated in people with PD, without serious adverse effects and with preliminary evidence for improvements in phonemic fluency and stigma.

276277,COVID-19 Associated Hepatitis Complicating Recent Living Donor Liver Transplantation,2020,"PURPOSE: To compare refractive outcomes, higher order aberrations (HOAs), and the changes in contrast sensitivity after wavefront-guided femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (WFG LASIK) and optimized small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) for moderate-to-high astigmatism correction. METHODS: This prospective, randomized study included 87 eyes: 40 eyes in the WFG LASIK group and 47 eyes in the SMILE group. Manual cyclotorsion compensation by marking the horizontal axis before SMILE surgery was used for optimized SMILE. Refractive diopter, aberrations, and contrast sensitivity were assessed 3 months postoperatively. The Alpins vector analysis method was used to analyze the astigmatic changes after surgery. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the corrected distance visual acuity and refraction between the two groups after surgery. The fitted curve of surgically induced astigmatism versus target induced astigmatism was described as y = 0.9905 x + 0.0009 in the WFG LASIK group and y = 0.9672 x + 0.0026 in the SMILE group. The percentage of corneal astigmatism axis change within 5 degrees was statistically significant (chi-square test: 10.632, P = .001). HOAs increased in both the WFG LASIK and SMILE groups after surgery (t = -3.655, P = .001, t = -3.784, P = .001, respectively). However, comparison of the changes of HOAs between both groups was not significant (t = -0.565, P = .575). The improvement in contrast sensitivity in the WFG LASIK group was significantly higher than that in the SMILE group. CONCLUSIONS: WFG LASIK and optimized SMILE can achieve similar outcomes for astigmatism correction. Optimized SMILE with marking could achieve good astigmatism correction, even without an eye tracking system.

ConclusionsWhile there is evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the surgical and obstetrical operative environment (6% of samples taken), the finding of no detectable virus inside the masks worn by the medical teams would suggest a low risk of infection for our health care workers using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).","Lee, Patricia; Kozak, Robert; Alavi, Nasrin; Mbareche, Hamza; Kung, Rose; Murphy, Kellie; Perruzza, Darian; Jarvi, Stephanie; Salvant, Elsa; Ladhani, Noor Niyar; Yee, Albert; Gagnon, Louise-Helene; Jenkinson, Richard; Liu, Grace Y.",,,154

283183,The Evolution of Biologics Administration From Intravenous to Subcutaneous: Treatments for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Go Home,2021,"Cenicriviroc (CVC) is a small-molecule chemokine receptor antagonist with highly potent and selective anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity through antagonizing C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) as a coreceptor of HIV-1. CVC also strongly antagonizes C-C chemokine receptor type 2b (CCR2b), thereby it has potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. CVC is currently under clinical trials in the patients for treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which immune cell activation and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in its pathogenesis. In this study, CVC was examined for its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in cell cultures and found to be a selective inhibitor of the virus. The 50% effective concentrations of CVC were 19.0 and 2.9 µM in the assays based on the inhibition of virus-induced cell destruction and viral RNA levels in culture supernatants of the infected cells, respectively. Interestingly, the CCR5-specific antagonist maraviroc did not show any anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Although the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by CVC remains to be elucidated, CCR2b does not seem to be its target molecule. Considering the fact that the regulation of excessive immune activation is required to treat COVID-19 patients at the late stage of the disease, CVC should be further pursued for its potential in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Okamoto, Mika; Toyama, Masaaki; Baba, Masanori",Antiviral Res,,154
286511,Impact of liver enzymes on SARSCoV-2 infection and on the severity of clinical disease,2020,"A chromatographic approach for separating exfoliated graphene from natural flake graphite is presented. Graphene is an extremely strong, electrically and thermally conductive two-dimensional hexagonal array of carbon atoms with the potential to transform applications such as supercapacitors, composites, biosensors, ultra-thin touchscreens, and solar cells. However, many of these applications require the use of exfoliated graphene, and the current cost of this material can be prohibitive. The most cost-effective source of graphene is exfoliated graphite, and numerous approaches have been proposed for exfoliating graphite to graphene. Solution approaches are the most common, with graphite often exfoliated by extended sonication treatment followed by separation of graphene from graphite using centrifugation. This time-consuming approach results in low concentrations of small lateral dimension graphene, often in high-boiling-point organic solvents or containing stabilizers. In this study, a chromatographic approach is used in combination with a solvent interface trapping method of graphite exfoliation to isolate graphene. The interface trapping exfoliation approach uses a hydrophobic/hydrophilic solvent interface to spontaneously exfoliate graphite and form a graphene-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion. This emulsion contains both graphene and graphite, and when added to water-wet glass beads, graphene adsorbs onto the glass surface, leaving graphite in the hydrophobic mobile phase, where it is removed by washing with an additional oil phase. The efficiency of this scalable approach to separation is demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Tyndall effect scattering.","Abeykoon, Prabodha G; Ward, Shawn P; Chen, Feiyang; Adamson, Douglas H",Langmuir,,154

An online questionnaire was therefore offered to the visitors of the Croatian Association for Epilepsy's website. The 22-items questionnaire was designed to acquire information from adults with epilepsy living in Croatia on demographic data, cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic, and communication problems between patients and their neurologists during the lockdown. Perceived anxiety and fears were expressed with the Likert scale (1-5) and the results of specific fears added to make the Total Fear Score. Results: Out of 186 respondents in total, only 2.8% did not comply with the lockdown measures, and all of those respondents stated that they did not feel any anxiety related to COVID-19. A canceled neurologist examination during the lockdown was significantly associated with pandemic-related anxiety (2.9â¯±â¯1.28 vs. 2.3â¯±â¯1.19, Uâ¯=â¯3039, pâ¯=â¯0.001) and fears (Total Fear Score 31.4â¯±â¯9.70 vs. 28.4â¯±â¯9.79, Uâ¯=â¯3341, pâ¯=â¯0.036), and 87.4% of respondents expressed the wish to communicate with their neurologist, either by phone/video call (53.0%) or email (34.4%). Conclusion: We think the results of our survey show that the responses from PwE point to a social responsibility appropriate for the existing situation. During future pandemics, telemedicine could have an important role in tackling the fears and anxieties caused by the cancelation of examinations, which corresponds to the wishes expressed by the great majority of our respondents.","Friedrich, Latica; Sruk, Ana; Bielen, Ivan",Epilepsy Behav,,154

The purpose of the current study was to assess caregiver preferences for on-campus versus virtual learning at home during the fall and factors associated with these preferences. METHODS: Participants were caregivers of 4436 children and adolescents who were enrolled in pre-kindergarten through high school at a large, public school district in Texas. Caregivers were asked to complete an anonymous, online survey about their initial preferences for their student's back to the school learning environment. RESULTS: Caregivers of high- and middle-school students were more likely to endorse a preference for an on-campus/virtual hybrid instructional format and less likely to endorse a preference for a traditional, face-to-face instructional format compared to caregivers of elementary school students. Regardless of the school level, concerns about child health and safety were the factor most strongly associated with caregiver preferences for on-campus versus virtual learning at home during the fall. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the importance of school re-opening plans offering virtual options and addressing caregiver concerns about children's health and safety amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Limbers, Christine A",J Sch Health,,154

Hence, applicants have had to adapt quickly to this process, since the interviewers and the applicants were mostly inexperienced regarding this process. To date, program directors have had a successful experience on this new modality, and since the pandemic continues to limit in-person meetings and given the benefits that virtual interviews provide in terms of transportation, booking, and cost, there is a high chance that interviews for The Match 2022 will also be conducted in the same, virtual way. In light of this, we performed a review of the literature by using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and other online resources to analyze certain critical aspects and offer recommendations for residency and fellowship applicants to improve their performance in virtual interviews. Despite the current surge of virtual interviewing in today's technology-driven era, virtual interviewing programs for residency and fellowship candidates selection are still in their infancy. We have learned that applicants can control certain aspects such as technology, settings, dress code, and behavior so that they can tailor their experience to make it more favorable and fulfilling.

The declaration of a national emergency in the United States (13 March 2020) necessitated the addition and modification of terminology related to COVID-19 and development of the disease's case definition. During this period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and standard development organizations released guidance on data standards for reporting COVID-19 clinical encounters, laboratory results, cause-of-death certifications, and other surveillance processes for COVID-19 PH emergency operations. The CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository was created to address the need for PH and health-care stakeholders at local and national levels to easily obtain access to comprehensive and up-to-date information management resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce the clinical and health-care informatics community to the CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository: a new, national COVID-19 information management tool.

293979,Obesity and COVID-19: 2 The ominous duet affecting the renin-angiotensin system,2021,"Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a unique post-translational modification that regulates many biological processes, such as DNA damage repair. During DNA repair, ADP-ribosylation needs to be reversed by ADP-ribosylhydrolases. A group of ADP-ribosylhydrolases have a catalytic domain, namely the macrodomain, which is conserved in evolution from prokaryotes to humans. Not all macrodomains remove ADP-ribosylation. One set of macrodomains loses enzymatic activity and only binds to ADP-ribose (ADPR). Here, we summarize the biological functions of these macrodomains in DNA damage repair and compare the structure of enzymatically active and inactive macrodomains. Moreover, small molecular inhibitors have been developed that target macrodomains to suppress DNA damage repair and tumor growth. Macrodomain proteins are also expressed in pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, these domains may not be directly involved in DNA damage repair in the hosts or pathogens. Instead, they play key roles in pathogen replication. Thus, by targeting macrodomains it may be possible to treat pathogen-induced diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Yu, Lily; Liu, Xiuhua; Yu, Xiaochun",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,154

Strikingly, a subset of these patients had SARS-CoV-2 and virus-specific IgG coexist for an unexpectedly long time, with two cases for up to 50 days. One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity alone may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2.

In the early phases of the pandemic, participants reported varying levels of risks for dying. However, most participants adapted to practice changes and became innovative in their roles over time. Hierarchies were less relevant during care delivery, whereas team collaboration became crucial in managing workforce capacity. DISCUSSION: As the pandemic progressed, staff preparedness evolved through a trial-and-error approach.

This study assessed changes in mental health and help-seeking since COVID-19 restrictions in young Australians, including gender differences. METHODS: Data were drawn from a recent subsample (n = 443; 60% female; Mage = 22.0) of a prospective cohort originally recruited in secondary school to complete annual surveys. The subsample completed an additional COVID-19 survey during COVID-19 restrictions (May-June 2020), which was compared to responses from their latest annual survey (August 2019-March 2020). Mixed effect models with time and gender as the primary predictors were conducted for: (i) scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) modules assessed before and during COVID-19 restrictions, and (ii) self-reported help-seeking from a health professional in February 2020, and the month preceding May-June 2020. RESULTS: Mean symptom scores increased from before to during COVID-19 restrictions on the PHQ-9 (coefficient: 1.29; 95% CI 0.72-1.86) and GAD-7 (0.78; 95% CI 0.26-1.31), but there was no increase in help-seeking over time (odds ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.19-1.32). There was no evidence of differential changes by gender.

However, its determinants remain partially unknown. We aimed to assess the relationship between severity of inflammatory response/coagulation abnormalities and hsTnT in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We then explored the relevance of these pathways in defining mortality and complications risk and the potential effects of the treatments to attenuate such risk. In this single-center, prospective, observational study we enrolled 266 consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Primary endpoint was in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. hsTnT, even after adjustment for confounders, was associated with mortality. D-dimer and CRP presented stronger associations with hsTnT than PaO2. Changes of hsTnT, D-dimer and CRP were related; but only D-dimer was associated with mortality. Moreover, low molecular weight heparin showed attenuation of the mortality in the whole population, particularly in subjects with higher hsTnT. D-dimer possessed a strong relationship with hsTnT and mortality. Anticoagulation treatment showed greater benefits with regard to mortality. These findings suggest a major role of SARS-CoV-2 coagulopathy in hsTnT elevation and its related mortality in COVID-19. A better understanding of the mechanisms related to COVID-19 might pave the way to therapy tailoring in these high-risk individuals.","Mengozzi, Alessandro; Georgiopoulos, Georgios; Falcone, Marco; Tiseo, Giusy; Pugliese, Nicola Riccardo; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo; Barbieri, Greta; Forfori, Francesco; Carrozzi, Laura; Santini, Massimo; Monzani, Fabio; De Marco, Salvatore; Menichetti, Francesco; Virdis, Agostino; Masi, Stefano",Sci Rep,,154

299567,"Risk of COVID-19 transmission in esophageal, anorectal manometry, and 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Improvement in epilepsy care requires standardized methods to assess disease severity. We report the results of implementing common data elements (CDEs) to document epilepsy history data in the electronic medical record (EMR) after 12 months of clinical use in outpatient encounters. METHODS: Data regarding seizure frequency were collected during routine clinical encounters using a CDE-based form within our EMR. We extracted CDE data from the EMR and developed measurements for seizure severity and seizure improvement scores. Seizure burden and improvement was evaluated by patient demographic and encounter variables for in-person and telemedicine encounters. RESULTS: We assessed a total of 1696 encounters in 1038 individuals with childhood epilepsies between September 6, 2019 and September 11, 2020 contributed by 32 distinct providers. Childhood absence epilepsy (n = 121), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 86), and Dravet syndrome (n = 42) were the most common epilepsy syndromes. Overall, 43% (737/1696) of individuals had at least monthly seizures, 17% (296/1696) had a least daily seizures, and 18% (311/1696) were seizure-free for >12 months. Quantification of absolute seizure burden and changes in seizure burden over time differed between epilepsy syndromes, including high and persistent seizure burden in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Individuals seen via telemedicine or in-person encounters had comparable seizure frequencies. Individuals identifying as Hispanic/Latino, particularly from postal codes with lower median household incomes, were more likely to have ongoing seizures that worsened over time. SIGNIFICANCE: Standardized documentation of clinical data in childhood epilepsies through CDE can be implemented in routine clinical care at scale and enables assessment of disease burden, including characterization of seizure burden over time. Our data provide insights into heterogeneous patterns of seizure control in common pediatric epilepsy syndromes and will inform future initiatives focusing on patient-centered outcomes in childhood epilepsies, including the impact of telemedicine and health care disparities.","Fitzgerald, Mark P; Kaufman, Michael C; Massey, Shavonne L; Fridinger, Sara; Prelack, Marisa; Ellis, Colin; Ortiz-Gonzalez, Xilma; Fried, Lawrence E; DiGiovine, Marissa P; Melamed, Susan; Malcolm, Marissa; Banwell, Brenda; Stephenson, Donna; Witzman, Stephanie M; Gonzalez, Alexander; Dlugos, Dennis; Kessler, Sudha Kilaru; Goldberg, Ethan M; Abend, Nicholas S; Helbig, Ingo",Epilepsia,,154

302423,Selective CD8 cell reduction by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a worse prognosis and systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients,2020,"OBJECTIVES: A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. METHODS: We collected 626 surface swabs within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major PPE. The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were the most contaminated PPE. CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Ye, Guangming; Lin, Hualiang; Chen, Song; Wang, Shichan; Zeng, Zhikun; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Shiyu; Rebmann, Terri; Li, Yirong; Pan, Zhenyu; Yang, Zhonghua; Wang, Ying; Wang, Fubing; Qian, Zhengmin; Wang, Xinghuan",J Infect,,154

From the early stages of the virus spread, the elderly population was identified as the most vulnerable, and health authorities have rightly focused on this frailer population. Conversely, less attention was given to the emotional and psychological dimensions of children and adolescents. Moreover, even though they were the subjects whose lives and health were at low risk, they, nevertheless, had to face a reality full of anxiety, fears, and uncertainties. The current study investigated the state of anxiety and emotional awareness in a sample of healthy older adolescents, 84 females and 64 males, aged 17 to 19, during the pandemic lockdown, using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and the Italian Emotion Awareness Questionnaire. An unexpected anxious phenomenology was found, affecting anxiety and the ideo-affective domain, while somatic symptomatology appeared to be less severe. The highest anxiety symptoms were breathing difficulties. These findings supported the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic may be a risk condition for an increased state of anxiety in older adolescents and suggested the need to provide (1) an effective, empathic communication system with direct participation of older adolescents, (2) a psychological counseling service for the stress management of adolescents.","Smirni, Pietro; Lavanco, Gioacchino; Smirni, Daniela",,,154

Across the cases, several themes emerge that offer important indicators for future digital inclusion initiatives. First, public policy can effectively reduce access gaps when it addresses the trifecta of network, device, and skill provision. Second, this triple-crown of public policy is highly effective for longitudinal effect when implemented early via educational institutions. Third, ruralurban digital inequality is resistant to change such that rural populations benefit less from policy initiatives than their urban counterparts. Fourth, digital inclusion in rural areas and among marginalized populations is most effective when cocreated with communities to ensure community investment, participation, and control. Fifth, stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly increasing our dependence on digital technologies, making digital inclusion more important than ever for education and rural communities.

312976,COVID-19 Mortality in Transplant Recipients,2020,"The recent surge of interest in ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded invariant mechanics poses the challenge of understanding the physical consequences of a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded symmetry. In this paper it is shown that non-trivial physics can be detected in the multiparticle sector of a theory, being induced by the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded parastatistics obeyed by the particles. The toy model of the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric/ ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded oscillator is used. In this set-up the one-particle energy levels and their degenerations are the same for both supersymmetric and ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded versions. Nevertheless, in the multiparticle sector, a measurement of an observable operator on suitable states can discriminate whether the system under consideration is composed by ordinary bosons/fermions or by ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded particles. Therefore, ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded mechanics has experimentally testable consequences. Furthermore, the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-grading constrains the observables to obey a superselection rule. As a technical tool, the multiparticle sector is encoded in the coproduct of a Hopf algebra defined on a Universal Enveloping Algebra of a graded Lie superalgebra with a braided tensor product.","Toppan, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11554v1.pdf,154

Since it is a new virus, it takes some time to develop a vaccine against it. Until then, the best way to prevent the fast spread of the virus is to enable the proper social distancing and isolation or containment to identify potential patients. Since the virus has up to 14 days of the incubation period, it is important to identify all the social interactions during this period and enforce social isolation for such potential patients. However, proper social interaction tracking methods and patient prediction methods based on such data are missing for the moment. This paper focuses on tracking the social interaction of users and predict the infection possibility based on social interactions. We first developed a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and GPS based social interaction tracking system. Then, we developed an algorithm to predict the possibility of being infected with COVID-19 based on the collected data. Finally, a prototype of the system is implemented with a mobile app and a web monitoring tool. In addition, we performed a simulation of the system with a graph-based model to analyze the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and it verifies that self-isolation is important in slowing down the disease progression.","Sandeepa, C.; Moremada, C.; Dissanayaka, N.; Gamage, T.; Liyanage, M.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee 3rd 5g World Forum,,154

We developed an ordinary differential equation-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with Bayesian underpinning to estimate the main parameter of R0 determined by transmission coefficients, incubation period, and the recovery rate. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method was used to tackle the parameters of uncertainty resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 given a small cohort of the cruise ship. The extended stratified SEIR model was also proposed to elucidate the heterogeneity of transmission route by the level of deck with passengers and crews. With the application of the overall model, R0 was estimated as high as 5.70 (95% credible interval: 4.23-7.79). The entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 63% (95% credible interval: 60-66%) infected passengers. With the deck-specific SEIR model, the heterogeneity of R0 estimates by each deck was noted. The estimated R0 figures were 5.18 for passengers (5-14 deck), mainly from the within-deck transmission, and 2.46 for crews (2-4 deck), mainly from the between-deck transmission. Modelling the dynamic of COVID-19 on the cruise ship not only provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine but also elucidates the relative contributions of different transmission modes on the cruise ship though the deck-stratified SEIR model.

319917,COVID-19 and Common Variable Immunodeficiency,2021,"PURPOSE: An appropriate healthy control dataset is mandatory to achieve good performance in voxel-wise analyses. We aimed at evaluating [18F]FDG PET brain datasets of healthy controls (HC), based on publicly available data, for the extraction of voxel-based brain metabolism maps at the single-subject level. METHODS: Selection of HC images was based on visual rating, after Cook's distance and jack-knife analyses, to exclude artefacts and/or outliers. The performance of these HC datasets (ADNI-HC and AIMN-HC) to extract hypometabolism patterns in single patients was tested in comparison with the standard reference HC dataset (HSR-HC) by means of Dice score analysis. We evaluated the performance and comparability of the different HC datasets in the assessment of single-subject SPM-based hypometabolism in three independent cohorts of patients, namely, ADD, bvFTD and DLB. RESULTS: Two-step Cook's distance analysis and the subsequent jack-knife analysis resulted in the selection of n = 125 subjects from the AIMN-HC dataset and n = 75 subjects from the ADNI-HC dataset. The average concordance between SPM hypometabolism t-maps in the three patient cohorts, as obtained with the new datasets and compared to the HSR-HC standard reference dataset, was 0.87 for the AIMN-HC dataset and 0.83 for the ADNI-HC dataset. Pattern expression analysis revealed high overall accuracy (> 80%) of the SPM t-map classification according to different statistical thresholds and sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The applied procedures ensure validity of these HC datasets for the single-subject estimation of brain metabolism using voxel-wise comparisons. These well-selected HC datasets are ready-to-use in research and clinical settings.","Caminiti, Silvia Paola; Sala, Arianna; Presotto, Luca; Chincarini, Andrea; Sestini, Stelvio; Perani, Daniela; Schillaci, Orazio; Berti, Valentina; Calcagni, Maria Lucia; Cistaro, Angelina; Morbelli, Silvia; Nobili, Flavio; Pappatà, Sabina; Volterrani, Duccio; Gobbo, Clara Luigia",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,154

To characterize which occupations in the United States could likely work from home during a pandemic such as COVID-19.Methods. I merged 2018 US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) national employment and wage data with measures ranking the importance of computer use at work and the importance of working with or performing for the public from the BLS O*NET survey.Results. Approximately 25% (35.6 million) of US workers are employed in occupations (such as technology, administrative, financial, and engineering) that could be done from home; the remaining 75% work in occupations (including health care, manufacturing, retail, and food services) that are challenging to do from home.Conclusions. Most US workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 million workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a pandemic. These workers tend to be lower paid. The stress experienced by lower-income groups, coupled with job insecurity, could result in a large burden of mental health disorders in the United States in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 from workplace transmission.","Baker, Marissa G",Am J Public Health,,154

Particular attention has been paid to delays in accessing timely pediatric care leading to unintended morbidity. In this study, we aim to describe the broader spectrum of unintended negative consequences for pediatric patients and families due to recent health care and societal changes. METHODS: All full-time doctors, dentists, and nurse practitioners working at a tertiary care children's hospital in Canada were surveyed every 2 weeks throughout the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify clinical cases in which they perceived a negative outcome associated with hospital or societal changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis followed a qualitative case series methodology using a narrative synthesis approach to determine similarities and associated themes. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one clinicians, representing 26 hospital divisions, reported 57 unique cases in the first 6 weeks of the study. Thematic analysis of the first 50 reported cases was used to identify 6 primary themes focusing on health care quality domains as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary case analysis, we describe the broad social and clinical impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized pediatric patients and their families. These themes highlight the unintended consequence on families, siblings, disease diagnosis, and hospital-based care provision. Recognition and understanding of the broad implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are necessary as we strive to deliver safe, high-quality, family-centered pediatric care in this new era.","Diskin, Catherine; Orkin, Julia; Agarwal, Tanvi; Parmar, Arpita; Friedman, Jeremy N",Hosp Pediatr,,154

Importantly, no studies addressed the relationship between sleep disturbance or sleep quality and ovarian cancer incidence. Moreover, few studies have examined the relationships between sleep measures and subtypes of ovarian cancer. This study included 109,024 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) during 1993-1998 and followed through 2018. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for the associations between sleep habits and the incidence of ovarian cancer and its subtypes. No association was observed between sleep duration, sleep quality, sleep disturbance, or insomnia and risk of overall ovarian cancer, serous/non-serous or Type I/Type II ovarian cancer subtype. However, compared with women with average sleep quality, women with restful or very restful sleep quality had a significantly lower risk of invasive serous subtype (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.90) while insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous subtype (HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.12-1.66). Associations with insomnia differed significantly by serous and non-serous subtypes, and Type I and Type II subtypes (Pheterogeneity=0.001 and Pheterogeneity<0.001, respectively). This study provides no evidence on association between sleep habits and overall ovarian cancer risk among postmenopausal women. However, restful or very restful sleep quality was associated with a lower risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer, and insomnia was associated with a higher risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer. Associations with insomnia differed by subtypes.","Liang, Xiaoyun; Harris, Holly R; Hendryx, Michael; Shadyab, Aladdin H; Hale, Lauren; Li, Yueyao; Crane, Tracy E; Cespedes Feliciano, Elizabeth M; Stefanick, Marcia L; Luo, Juhua",Cancer prev. res.

325536,COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: What is known about the unknown,2021,"We discuss the implications of possible contagion of COVID-19 through e-cigarette aerosol (ECA) for prevention and mitigation strategies during the current pandemic. This is a relevant issue when millions of vapers (and smokers) must remain under indoor confinement and/or share public outdoor spaces with non-users. The fact that the respiratory flow associated with vaping is visible (as opposed to other respiratory activities) clearly delineates a safety distance of 1-2 m along the exhaled jet to prevent direct exposure. Vaping is a relatively infrequent and intermittent respiratory activity for which we infer a mean emission rate of 79.82 droplets per puff (6-200, standard deviation 74.66) comparable to mouth breathing, it adds into shared indoor spaces (home and restaurant scenarios) a 1% extra risk of indirect COVID-19 contagion with respect to a ""control case"" of existing unavoidable risk from continuous breathing. As a comparative reference, this added relative risk increases to 44-176% for speaking 6-24 min per hour and 260% for coughing every 2 min. Mechanical ventilation decreases absolute emission levels but keeps the same relative risks. As long as direct exposure to the visible exhaled jet is avoided, wearing of face masks effectively protects bystanders and keeps risk estimates very low. As a consequence, protection from possible COVID-19 contagion through vaping emissions does not require extra interventions besides the standard recommendations to the general population: keeping a social separation distance of 2 m and wearing of face masks.","Sussman, Roberto A; Golberstein, Eliana; Polosa, Riccardo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,154

The present study aims to report the regional variations of North American adult cardiac surgical case volume and case mix through the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was sent to recruit participating adult cardiac surgery centers in North America. Data in regard to changes in institutional and regional cardiac surgical case volume and mix were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study comprises 67 adult cardiac surgery institutions with diverse geographic distribution across North America, representing annualized case volumes of 60,452 in 2019. Nonurgent surgery was stopped during the month of March 2020 in the majority of centers (96%), resulting in a decline to 45% of baseline with significant regional variation. Hospitals with a high burden of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated similar trends of decline in total volume as centers in low burden areas. As a proportion of total surgical volume, there was a relative increase of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (high +7.2% vs low +4.2%, P = .550), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (high +2.5% vs low 0.4%, P = .328), and heart transplantation (high +2.7% vs low 0.4%, P = .090), and decline in valvular cases (high -7.6% vs low -2.6%, P = .195). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the impact of COVID-19 on North American cardiac surgery institutions as well as helps associate region and COVID-19 burden with the impact on cardiac surgery volumes and case mix.","Ad, Niv; Luc, Jessica G Y; Nguyen, Tom C",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,,154

This case report presents the clinical course of two male patients with COVID-19 who developed sexual dysfunction, as anorgasmia, following recovery from the infection. Although no evidence of viral replication or inflammatory involvement could be identified in these cases' urogenital organs, a lack of other known risk factors for anorgasmia points to the role of COVID-19 as the contributing factor.","Shoar, Saeed; Khavandi, Siamak; Tabibzadeh, Elsa; Vaez, Aydin; Oskouei, Ali Khabbazi; Hosseini, Fatemeh; Naderan, Mohammad; Shoar, Nasrin",Prehosp Disaster Med,,154

It then spread with enormous rapidity and by mid-March 2020 was declared a world pandemic. Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1% of the population. The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics. Germane to this communication is that 85% of patients with GTS have associated psychiatric co-morbidities, many of which are being exacerbated in the current global health crisis. In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and ""non-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms"" can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law. We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not. It is fair to say that having read the current medical and lay press we conclude that it is not easy to reassure our patients with absolute certainty.

Since it began, Covid-19 has brought forth anti-vaxxers, Covid-deniers, and questionable remedies in ways that parallel responses to earlier disease crises. Allopathic medicine has historically proven ineffective against chronic pain, degenerative illnesses, migraines, insomnia, and psychological complaints, leading unsatisfied patients to seek care from chiropractors, osteopaths, mesmerists, and Christian Science healers.3 Such unorthodox therapies have disproportionately appealed to women, who have a harder time getting doctors to take their pain seriously and who were, until the 1990s, seldom included in clinical trials of new medications and treatments.4 Today, “Americans now consult their homeopaths, naturopaths, herbalists, acupuncturists, chiropractors, and Reiki workers more often than they see their primary care physicians,” as Steve Silberman wrote in 2015.5 A similar situation prevails in Britain, where “dozens of . . . creative, sensory, mind-body and manual therapies” vie for prominence with traditional medicine.6 How did we get here? [...]though, both the idea of scientific medicine and the distinction between orthodox and alternative medicine are relatively new. Some alternative treatment systems, such as Thomsonianism with its reliance on harsh emetics, were scarcely less punishing than their allopathic counterparts.14 Nevertheless, the heterodox emphases on individual choice and on gentle, natural healing understandably attracted many customers. [...]midcentury, allopaths promoted so-called “heroic” remedies such as bleeding, emetics, laxatives, blistering, and the application of leeches to the skin.","Stiles, Anne Swenson Kristine",Literature and Medicine,,154

332351,Expert recommendations on the management of childhood bronchial asthma during the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic,2020,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a severe disorder that is characterized by intracellular transport abnormalities leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids. The compound 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HPßCD) has high cholesterol complexation capacity and is currently under clinical investigation for the NPC treatment. However, due to its short blood half-life, high doses are required to produce a therapeutic effect. In this work, stable polymerized HPßCD is generated to investigate their in vitro mechanisms of action and in vivo effects. Crosslinked CDs (8-312 kDa) display a ninefold greater cholesterol complexation capacity than monomeric HPßCD but are taken up to a lower extent, resulting in an overall comparable in vitro effect. In vivo, the 19.3 kDa HPßCD exhibits a longer half-life than the monomeric HPßCD but it does not increase the life span of Npc1 mice, possibly due to reduced brain penetration. This is circumvented by the application of magnetic resonance imaging-guided low intensity-pulsed focused ultrasound (MRIg-FUS), which increases the brain penetration of the CD. In conclusion, stable polymerized HPßCDs can elucidate CDs' mechanism of action while the use of MRIg-FUS warrants further investigation, as it may be key to harnessing CDs full therapeutic potential in the NPC treatment.","Carradori, Dario; Chen, Hsintsung; Werner, Beat; Shah, Aagam S; Leonardi, Chiara; Usuelli, Mattia; Mezzenga, Raffaele; Platt, Frances; Leroux, Jean-Christophe",Small,,154

It is associated with age, comorbidities and a weakened immune system. Typically, lymphopenias have been evidenced in severe cases and an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), which would explain the role of the hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Secondary inflammatory responses from virus reinfections may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a viremic phenomenon that may be an alternative mechanism of cellular infection and should be considered when designing vaccines or immunotherapies involving the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, no vaccines or treatments demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19. However, the results from phase III clinical trials which involve the application of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) nucleic acid vaccine and an antiviral drug (remdisivir), are yet to be concluded. For the time being, the best measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is by implementing social isolation, this measure has been adopted by several countries as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).","Lozada-Requena, Iván; Núñez Ponce, César",Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,,154
333609,Pop goes the tumour! Spontaneous haemorrhage of a hepatocellular carcinoma tumour,2021,"The aim of sequential change-point detection is to issue an alarm when it is thought that certain probabilistic properties of the monitored observations have changed. This work is concerned with nonparametric, closed-end testing procedures based on differences of empirical distribution functions that are designed to be particularly sensitive to changes in the comtemporary distribution of multivariate time series. The proposed detectors are adaptations of statistics used in a posteriori (offline) change-point testing and involve a weighting allowing to give more importance to recent observations. The resulting sequential change-point detection procedures are carried out by comparing the detectors to threshold functions estimated through resampling such that the probability of false alarm remains approximately constant over the monitoring period. A generic result on the asymptotic validity of such a way of estimating a threshold function is stated. As a corollary, the asymptotic validity of the studied sequential tests based on empirical distribution functions is proven when these are carried out using a dependent multiplier bootstrap for multivariate time series. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the good finite-sample properties of the resulting procedures. The application of the derived sequential tests is illustrated on financial data.","Kojadinovic, Ivan; Verdier, Ghislain",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12322v2.pdf,154

The biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc., and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste. The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the ""Zero Waste"" concept. The study also explains the circular economy policies practiced for solid waste management that stimulates the economy of the country and identify the pathways to maximize the local resources. In addition the review addresses the advanced information and communication technologies to unfold the issues and challenges faced in the solid waste management. The smart governance of managing waste using the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) is one of the great precursors of technological development that could lead innovations in waste management.","Velvizhi, G; Shanthakumar, S; Das, Bhaskar; Pugazhendhi, A; Priya, T Shanmuga; Ashok, B; Nanthagopal, K; Vignesh, R; Karthick, C",Sci Total Environ,,154

However, these issues around blood availability during the pandemic are related primarily to the decline in supply caused by reduced donations during the pandemic rather than increased demand for transfusion of patients with COVID-19.The challenges to ensure a safe blood supply during the pandemic will continue until a vaccine is developed, effective treatments are available, or the virus goes away. If this virus or a similar virus were capable of transmission through blood, it would have a catastrophic impact on the health care system, causing a future public health emergency that would jeopardize the national blood supply.In this article, we identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply adequacy, discuss the public health implications, propose recovery strategies, and present recommendations for preparing for the next disruption in blood supply driven by a public health emergency.","Riley, William; Love, Kailey; McCullough, Jeffrey",Am J Public Health,,154
334931,COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients: A multicenter study,2020,"COVID-19 has caused unprecedented challenges to our lives. Many governments have forced people to stay at home, leading to a radical shift from on-site to virtual collaboration for many knowledge workers. Existing remote working literature does not provide a thorough explanation of government-enforced working from home situations. Using an affordance lens, this study explores the sudden and enforced issues that COVID-19 has presented, and the technological means knowledge workers use to achieve their team collaboration goals. We interviewed 29 knowledge workers about their experiences of being required to work from home and introduced the term “enforced work from home”. This paper contributes to the affordance theory by providing an understanding of the substitution of affordances for team collaboration during COVID-19. The shifting of affordances results in positive and negative effects on team collaboration as various affordances of technology were perceived and actualised to sustain “business as usual”.","Waizenegger, Lena; McKenna, Brad; Cai, Wenjie; Bendz, Taino",Eur.

335752,How to interpret and use COVID-19 serology and immunology tests,2021,"BACKGROUND: Information disclosure is a top priority for official responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The timely and standardized information published by authorities as a response to the crisis can better inform the public and enable better preparations for the pandemic; however, there is limited evidence of any systematic analyses of the disclosed epidemic information. This in turn has important implications for risk communication. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe and compare the officially released content regarding local epidemic situations as well as analyze the characteristics of information disclosure through local communication in major cities in China. METHODS: The 31 capital cities in mainland China were included in this city-level observational study. Data were retrieved from local municipalities and health commission websites as of March 18, 2020. A checklist was employed as a rapid qualitative assessment tool to analyze the information disclosure performance of each city. Descriptive analyses and data visualizations were produced to present and compare the comparative performances of the cities. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 cities (93.5%) established specific COVID-19 webpages to disclose information. Among them, 12 of the city webpages were added to their corresponding municipal websites. A majority of the cities (21/31, 67.7%) published their first cases of infection in a timely manner on the actual day of confirmation. Regarding the information disclosures highlighted on the websites, news updates from local media or press briefings were the most prevalent (28/29, 96.6%), followed by epidemic surveillance (25/29, 86.2%), and advice for the public (25/29, 86.2%). Clarifications of misinformation and frequently asked questions were largely overlooked as only 2 cities provided this valuable information. The median daily update frequency of epidemic surveillance summaries was 1.2 times per day (IQR 1.0-1.3 times), and the majority of these summaries (18/25, 72.0%) also provided detailed information regarding confirmed cases. The reporting of key indicators in the epidemic surveillance summaries, as well as critical facts included in the confirmed case reports, varied substantially between cities. In general, the best performance in terms of timely reporting and the transparency of information disclosures were observed in the municipalities directly administered by the central government compared to the other cities. CONCLUSIONS: Timely and effective efforts to disclose information related to the COVID-19 epidemic have been made in major cities in China. Continued improvements to local authority reporting will contribute to more effective public communication and efficient public health research responses. The development of protocols and the standardization of epidemic message templates-as well as the use of uniform operating procedures to provide regular information updates-should be prioritized to ensure a coordinated national response.","Hu, Guangyu; Li, Peiyi; Yuan, Changzheng; Tao, Chenglin; Wen, Hai; Liu, Qiannan; Qiu, Wuqi",J Med Internet Res,,154

The aim of this study is to analyse the commitment to and feeling of insecurity related to practising sport, sports habits and the profile of the Spanish population during lockdown according to the level of addiction to exercise. The sample consisted of 1019 subjects with a mean age of 35 years old. The variables analysed were exercise addiction, commitment to and feeling of insecurity related to sport, and sport habits. Three groups were identified according to their addiction level to exercise: asymptomatic (n = 202), symptomatic (n = 756), and at risk of addiction (n = 61). The main results indicated that a higher addiction level was associated with a higher number of days and time spent on exercise per week. Six percent of the subjects were at addiction risk, and they had a lower feeling of insecurity towards sport. These findings provide information to governments on the need to promote physical activity programmes at home to promote adequate fitness and mental wellbeing in the population.","Berengüí, Rosendo; López-Gullón, José María; Angosto, Salvador",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,154

In a Post-COVID World, Supporting and Incentivizing Antimicrobial Drug Development Must Become a Governmental Priority",2021,"The new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a new type of virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Environmental conditions necessary for survival and spread of 2019-nCoV are somewhat transparent but unlike animal coronaviruses. We are poorly aware of their survival in environment and precise factors of their transmission. Countries located in east and west of globe did not have a significant impact on prevalence of disease among communities, and on the other hand, north and south have provided a model for relative prediction of disease outbreaks. The 2019-nCoV can survive for up to 9 days at 25 °C, and if this temperature rises to 30 °C, its lifespan will be shorter. The 2019-nCoV is sensitive to humidity, and lifespan of viruses in 50% humidity is longer than that of 30%. Also, temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the COVID-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-nCoV transmission. Thus, considering the available and recent evidence, it seems that low temperatures, as well as dry and unventilated air, may affect stability and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.","Harmooshi, Narges Nazari; Shirbandi, Kiarash; Rahim, Fakher",,,154

CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of 2 adolescent males, ages 16 and 17, who presented with delirium secondary to an acute COVID-19 infection in the fall of 2020 at Children's Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The foundation of our treatment strategy was the triad of alpha-2 agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine, guanfacine), antipsychotic agents (quetiapine, haloperidol, olanzapine), and melatonin. Discharge planning required involvement from inpatient psychiatry, case management, social work, and the family. Both patients showed improvement after several weeks. DISCUSSION: We believe these are the first reported cases of COVID-19-associated delirium in children outside of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 delirium is a new manifestation of the COVID-19 disease. Treatment guidelines are emerging and lessons regarding therapies and discharge considerations are described in these 2 unique cases.","Bauer, S.

340923,Novel mutations in ZP1: expanding the mutational spectrum associated with empty follicle syndrome in infertile women,2021,"BACKGROUND: Teleradiology has become one of the most important approaches to virtual clinical diagnosis; its importance has only grown during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. In developing countries, asking patients to take photographs of their images using a smartphone can facilitate the process and help keep its costs down. However, the images taken by patients with smartphones often are of poor quality, and there is no regulation or standard instruction about how to use smartphones to take photographs of medical examination images effectively. These problems limit the use of smartphones in remote diagnosis and treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To formulate a set of guidelines for the most appropriate and effective use of smartphones to capture images (radiographs, CT images, and MR images), and to determine whether these guidelines are more effectively adopted by patients of differing ages and genders. METHODS: In this prospective study, a set of step-by-step instructions was created with the goal of helping patients take better smartphone photographs of orthopaedic diagnostic images for transfer to telemedicine services. Following the advice of surgeons, experts in smartphone technology, imaging experts, and suggestions from patients, the instructions were modified based on clinical experience and finalized with the goals of simplicity, clarity, and convenience. Potentially eligible patients were older than 18 years, had no cognitive impairment, and used smart phones. Based on that, 256 participants (patients or their relatives and friends) who visited the orthopaedic department of our hospital from June to October 2020 potentially qualified for this study. A total of 11% (29) declined to participate, leaving 89% (227) for analysis here. Their mean age was 36 ± 11 years, 50% were women (113 of 227), and the patient himself/herself represented in 34% (78 of 227) of participants while relatives or friends of patients made up 66% (149 of 227) of the group. In this study, the diagnoses included spinal stenosis (47% [107 of 227]), disc herniation without spinal stenosis (31% [71 of 227]), vertebral fractures (14% [32 of 227]), and other (7% [17 of 227]). Each study participant first took photographs of their original medical images based on their own knowledge of how to use the smartphone camera function; each participant then took pictures of their original images again after receiving our instructional guidance. Three senior spine surgeons (YZ, TQL, TCM) in our hospital analyzed, in a blinded manner, the instructed and uninstructed imaging files based on image clarity (the content of the image is complete, the text information in the image is clearly visible, there is neither reflection nor shadow in the image) and image position (it is not tilted, curled, inverted, or reversed). If either of these conditions was not satisfied, the picture quality was deemed unacceptable; two of three judges' votes determined the outcome. Interobserver reliability with kappa values for the three judges were 0.89 (YZ versus TQL), 0.92 (YZ versus TCM), and 0.90 (TQL versus TCM). RESULTS: In this study, the overall proportion of smartphone medical images deemed satisfactory increased from 40% (91 of 227) for uninstructed participants to 86% (196 of 227) for instructed participants (risk ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.82 to 2.55]; pï¼0.001). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in different age groups improved after instruction, except for in patients aged 51 years or older (3 of 17 uninstructed participants versus 8 of 17 instructed participants; RR 2.67 [95% CI 0.85 to 8.37]; p = 0.07). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in both genders improved after instruction, but there was no difference between the genders. CONCLUSION: We believe our guidelines for patients who wish to take smartphone photographs of their medical images will decrease image transmission cost and facilitate orthopaedic telemedicine consultations. However, it appears that patients older than 50 years are more likely to have difficulty with this approach, and if so, they may benefit from more hands-on assistance from clinic staff or younger relatives or friends. The degree to which our findings are culture-specific should be verified by other studies in other settings, but on the face of it, there is little reason to believe our findings would not generalize to a reasonable degree. Other studies in more heterogeneous populations should also evaluate factors related to levels of educational attainment and wealth differences, but in the meantime, our findings can give clinical teams an idea of which patients may need a little extra assistance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.","Yang, Xiao-Jiang; Wei, Wei; Zhang, Yang; Wang, Ya-Nan; Zhang, Nan; Li, Tian-Qing; Ma, Tian-Cheng; Zhang, Ke-Ying; Jiang, Ming-Chun; Ma, Zhen-Sheng",,,154

An early recommendation to utilize general anesthesia and intubate all patients undergoing intervention to avoid an emergent aerosolizing procedure was found to have worse outcomes. The decline in new stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnoses may be related to patient and/or family fear of seeking acute medical care. A true shift in stroke epidemiology is also possible. As several vaccines become more readily available and the world rebounds from this pandemic, we hope to transform the neurointerventional experiences discussed in this paper into strategies that may improve care delivery of neurologically ill patients during a global crisis.","Rana, Ameena; Nguyen, Thanh N; Siegler, James E",Expert Rev Med Devices,,154

Research on early psychological programmes that aim to prevent or reduce mental health symptoms and that have been tested in frontline responders may assist service providers with choosing a suitable intervention for rapid dissemination in healthcare settings. DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched through a systematic literature review of early psychological interventions administered to frontline responders in the last 15 years. Interventions were included if they were designed to prevent or reduce psychological impact and had outcome measures of psychological distress (eg, general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress) and/or positive mental health domains (eg, resilience, self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Second, the suitability of these programmes for the healthcare workforce was evaluated according to the criteria of effectiveness, content applicability and feasibility. RESULTS: Of 320 articles retrieved, 12 relevant studies were included that described six early psychological interventions. Although the evidence base is limited, psychological first aid, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, and trauma risk management showed effectiveness across at least two studies each with frontline workers. Resilience and coping for the healthcare community; anticipate, plan, and deter; and resilience at work programmes found promising results in single studies. Concerning other suitability criteria, all programmes appear applicable to healthcare settings and have acceptable feasibility for rapid implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited evidence, several interventions were identified as potentially suitable and useful for improving psychological functioning of healthcare workers across a variety of disaster situations. Service providers should continue to implement and evaluate early psychological interventions in frontline workers in order to refine best practices for managing the psychological impact of future disasters.","Hooper, Jasmine Jean; Saulsman, Lisa; Hall, Tammy; Waters, Flavie",BMJ Open,,154

The cecal appendix may influence the homeostasis of the colonic microbiota. In this large population-based study, we investigated whether early removal of the appendix is associated with an increased risk of mental disorders later in life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Swedish individuals born between 1973 and 1992 (N = 1,937,488) were included and followed prospectively until December 31, 2016 for any psychiatric International Classification of Disease diagnosis from age 14 or later in life. The main exposure was defined as having a history of appendectomy before age 14 (N = 44,259); the second exposure, appendicitis before age 14 but without appendectomy (N = 1,542), and the third exposure studied was a history of hernia surgery before age 14 (N = 35,523). Control groups for each respective exposure were all unexposed individuals in the study population. RESULTS: Individuals exposed to appendectomy before age 14 had a 19% increased risk of depressive disorder (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.19; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.15-1.23), 27% increased risk of bipolar affective disorder (aHR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.17-1.37), and a 20% increased risk of an anxiety disorder (aHR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.16-1.23) compared to individuals unexposed to childhood appendectomy. We found no association between appendectomy and increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia and there was no association between appendicitis without appendectomy and mental disorders. The association between childhood hernia surgery and mental disorders later in life was small but significant. CONCLUSION: Childhood appendectomy, but not appendicitis without appendectomy, was associated with a significantly increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood.","Ekström, Lucas D; Ekström, Hampus; Dal, Henrik; Kosidou, Kyriaki; Gustafsson, Ulf O",Depress. anxiety,,154

344819,Phenotypic switch from non-active primary Sjögren's syndrome to severe systemic Lupus erythematosus after COVID-19 infection in an elderly man,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected care workers all over the globe, as older and more vulnerable people face a high risk of developing severe symptoms and dying from the virus infection. The aim of this study was to compare staff experiences of stress and anxiety as well as internal and external organizational support in Sweden, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom (UK) in order to determine how care staff were affected by the pandemic. A 29-item online questionnaire was used to collect data from care staff respondents: management (n = 136), nurses (n = 132), nursing assistants (n = 195), and other healthcare staff working in these organizations (n = 132). Stress and anxiety levels were highest in the UK and Germany, with Swedish staff showing the least stress. Internal and external support only partially explain the outcomes. Striking discrepancies between different staff groups’ assessment of organizational support as well as a lack of staff voice in the UK and Germany could be key factors in understanding staff’s stress levels during the pandemic. Structural, political, cultural, and economic factors play a significant role, not only factors within the care organization or in the immediate context.","Lethin, Connie Kenkmann Andrea Chiatti Carlos Christensen Jonas Backhouse Tamara Killett Anne Fisher Oliver Fänge Agneta Malmgren",Healthcare,,154

However, the specific regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role and molecular mechanism of histone methyltransferases G9a in lipids-induced M1 macrophage polarization in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We used saturated fatty acid palmitate to induce macrophage polarization, and performed real-time PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and CHIP assay to study the function and molecular mechanism of G9a. Additionally, we isolated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 187 patients with type 2 diabetes and 68 healthy individuals, and analyzed the expression level of G9a. RESULTS: The palmitate treatment induced the macrophage M1 polarization, and decreased the expression of G9a. The deficiency of G9a could promote the palmitate-induced M1 macrophage polarization, whereas, over-expressing G9a notably suppressed this process. Meanwhile, we observed the regulatory role of G9a on the ER stress which could contribute to M1 macrophage. Furthermore, we identified the fatty acid transport protein CD36 as the potential target of G9a. Dependent on the methyltransferase activity, G9a could negatively regulate the expression of CD36 induced by palmitate. The CD36 inhibitor SSO could significantly attenuate the regulatory effect of G9a on M1 macrophage polarization and ER stress. Importantly, G9a was decreased, and suppressed CD36 and M1 macrophage genes in the PBMCs from individuals with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that G9a plays critical roles in lipid-induced M1 macrophage polarization via negatively regulating CD36.","Wang, Xiuling; Chen, Shanshan; He, Jinrong; Chen, Weiqun; Ding, Yu; Huang, Juan; Huang, Jin",Metabolism,,154
348782,Children Hospitalized With Severe COVID-19 in Wuhan,2020,"Introduction La pandémie à COVID-19 est responsable de près de 3 millions de décès. En l’absence de traitement curatif à ce jour, la prévention est la seule stratégie efficace pour la contrôler. La vaccination est un des piliers de cette prévention. Elle a commencé par les sujets les plus fragiles, les résidents d’établissement d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes (EHPAD). Ils ont bénéficié des premiers vaccins disponibles à ARN messager depuis le 28 décembre 2020. Ils présentent une immunosénescence physiologique à l’origine habituellement d’une immunité innée moins efficiente et ou d’une immunité adaptative moins durable. Les données concernant cette population âgée particulière sont absentes que ce soit sur la réponse immunitaire naturelle versus l’immunité vaccinale et les facteurs (âge, comorbidités, statut nutritionnel) pouvant modifier les réponses du système immunitaire. L’objectif de ce travail est de comparer la qualité de la réponse vaccinale anti-SARS-CoV-2 versus l’immunité naturelle. Matériels et méthodes Étude observationnelle prospective monocentrique d’une cohorte de résidents d’EHPAD et d’unités de soins de longue durée de plus de 65 ans d’un centre hospitalo-universitaire français. Les résidents bénéficient de la vaccination par COMINARTY (BNT162b2), 2 doses à 21 jours d’intervalle. Les objectifs sont de comparer la réponse immunitaire spécifique 3 mois après COVID-19 et 3 mois après la vaccination. Elle évalue le nombre de lymphocytes T totaux spécifiques anti-S et d’anticorps neutralisants (Virus neutralization test) 3 mois après une infection COVID-19 prouvée avant toute vaccination et 3 mois après la vaccination chez les sujets « naïfs ». La qualité de réponse immunitaire postvaccinale est évaluée en comparant l’amplitude, le nombre de lymphocytes T, d’anticorps totaux anti-S en fonction de la présence d’anticorps prévaccinaux (infection antérieure). La qualité de la réponse immunitaire est comparée en fonction de l’état nutritionnel des sujets âgés et des indicateurs d’immunosénescence sur l’immunité adaptative (nombre de lymphocytes T, taux d’anticorps totaux anti-S et d’anticorps neutralisants en fonction des taux basals de cytokines proinflammatoires, du pourcentage et du nombre absolu de lymphocytes CD4+ naïfs, lymphocytes CD8+ de différenciation terminale). Résultats Seules les données pour les réponses à 3 mois seront disponibles pour cette communication. Description de la population : EHPAD de 104 lits et USDL de 96 lits avec 162 résidents présents avec une moyenne d’âge de 83 ans et des comorbidités lourdes avec un GIR moyen pondéré de 761 en EHPAD et de 865 en USLD. Quatre-vingt-sept résidents ont présenté une infection à COVID-19 documentée entre mars et décembre 2020. Quatre-vingt-quinze pour cent des résidents ont bénéficié d’une vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 et 90 % ont accepté la participation à l’étude.

Remdesivir has shown in vitro activity against coronaviruses and is a possible antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This prospective (compassionate), open-label study of remdesivir, which was conducted at Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, between February 23 and March 20, 2020, involved patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia aged &#8805;18 years undergoing mechanical ventilation or with an oxygen saturation level of &#8804;94 % in air or a National Early Warning Score 2 of &#8805;4. The primary outcome was the change in clinical status based on a 7-category ordinal scale (1 = not hospitalised, resuming normal daily activities; 7 = deceased). The 35 patients enrolled from February 23 to March 20, 2020, included 18 in intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 in our infectious diseases ward (IDW). The 10-day course of remdesivir was completed by 22 patients (63 %) and discontinued by 13, of whom eight (22.8 %) discontinued because of adverse events. The median follow-up was 39 days (IQR 25-44). At day 28, 14 (82.3 %) patients from IDW were discharged, two were still hospitalized and one died (5.9 %), whereas in ICU 6 (33.3 %) were discharged, 8 (44.4 %) patients died, three (16.7 %) were still mechanically ventilated and one (5.6 %) was improved but still hospitalized. Hypertransaminasemia and acute kidney injury were the most frequent severe adverse events observed (42.8 % and 22.8 % of the cases, respectively). Our data suggest that remdesivir can benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalised outside ICU where clinical outcome was better and adverse events are less frequently observed.

This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice. METHODS: An online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group. RESULTS: Healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Almost all States included the 65-74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States. CONCLUSIONS: The prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable despite clear Federal guidance. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs, values, and constraints, to minimize any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations.","Jain, Vageesh; Schwarz, Lara; Lorgelly, Paula",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,154

We sought to identify all potentially deleterious drug groups in COVID-19 and critically assess the underpinning strength of evidence pertaining to the harmful effects of these drugs. Methods and findingsWe performed a rapid systematic review, searching Medline, Embase and two COVID-19 portfolios (WHO COVID-19 database and NIH iSearch COVID-19 portfolio) for papers and preprints related to primary studies investigating drugs identified as potentially deleterious. Primary outcomes were direct measures of susceptibility to infection, disease severity and mortality. Study quality was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for data synthesis with further subgroup analyses where possible for specific outcome, study design, statistical adjustment and drug groups when two were combined. Sensitivity analyses were performed by removing any studies at high risk of bias and by publication status. 49 observational studies (15 peer-reviewed papers and 34 preprints) reported primary outcomes for eight drug groups hypothesised to be deleterious. Meta-analysis showed that acute inpatient corticosteroid use was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.90), however this result appeared to have been biased by confounding via indication. One subgroup analysis indicated an association between immunosuppressant use and susceptibility to COVID-19 among case control and cross-sectional studies (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.40) but this was not found with cohort studies (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86-1.43). Studies which adjusted for multiple confounders showed that people taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-II-receptor blockers (ARBs) required a lower level of care (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98). Furthermore, studies which combined these two drug groups in their analysis demonstrated an association with a lower mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.85). ConclusionsWe found minimal high quality or consistent evidence that any drug groups increase susceptibility, severity or mortality in COVID-19. Converse to initial hypotheses, we found some evidence that regular use of ACEIs and ARBs prior to infection may be effective in reducing the level of care required, such as requiring intensive care, in patients with COVID-19.","Holder, Michael W; Heeney, Catherine; Malden, Stephen; Perera, Uditha; Sheikh, Aziz",,,154
362022,Distinct cytokine profiles associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality,2021,"The exact mechanisms leading to myocardial injury in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unknown. In this retrospective observational study, we include all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our center. They were divided into two groups according to the presence of myocardial injury. Clinical variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), C-reactive protein (CRP), CAC (COVID-19-associated coagulopathy), defined according to the ISTH score, treatment and in-hospital events were collected. Between March and April 2020, 331 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, 72 of them (21.8%) with myocardial injury. Patients with myocardial injury showed a higher CCI score (median (interquartile range), 5 (4–7) vs. 2 (1–4), p = 0.001), higher CRP values (18.3 (9.6–25.9) mg/dL vs. 12.0 (5.4–19.4) mg/dL, p ˂ 0.001) and CAC score (1 (0–2) vs. 0 (0–1), p = 0.001), and had lower use of any anticoagulant (57 patients (82.6%) vs. 229 patients (90.9%), p = 0.078), than those without. In the adjusted logistic regression, CRP, myocardial injury, CCI and CAC score were positive independent predictors of mortality, whereas anticoagulants resulted as a protective factor. Myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients is associated with inflammation and coagulopathy, resulting in a worse in-hospital prognosis. Treatment with anticoagulant agents may help to improve in-hospital outcomes.","Arévalos, Victor Ortega-Paz Luis Rodríguez-Arias Juan José Calvo Margarita Castrillo Leticia Salazar Anthony Roque Merce Dantas Ana Paula Sabaté Manel Brugaletta Salvatore",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,154

It is important for any vital information to be written unambiguously, and at a level that can be understood by all people regardless of education levels. The purpose of this study was to assess the readability of 50 sources of COVID19 testing information online. Only 6 websites out of 50 received an appropriate readability score on more than one assessment. One-sample, one-tailed t-tests (&#945; = 0.05, df = 49) were used to see if the websites with information on COVID-19 testing are being written at appropriate reading levels. The resulting p-values indicate that each p-value recorded is substantially below 0.05, it is very unlikely that websites on this topic are being written at the recommended levels. Even the optimal messages on COVID-19 reflect a confusing and rapidly changing public health crisis, however if messages are kept simple and clear, individuals will have the best possible chance of optimizing behavioral mitigation strategies. These are compelling reasons for informational hosts to take necessary steps to ensure that messages are written in as simple terms as possible. To this end, it is suggested that internet sites dispersing COVID-19 testing information build in text analysis methods for all published messages, particularly those meant to inform best health practices in the time of a pandemic.","Garcia, Philip; Fera, Joseph; Mohlman, Jan; Basch, Corey H",J. community health,,154

With the lack of data, it is uncertain how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect antimicrobial resistance. Severe disruption of research, innovation, global health programs, and compromised antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention and control programs, especially in low-and middle-income countries, could affect antimicrobial resistance. However, factors such as strict lockdown, social distancing, vaccination, and the extensive implementation of hand hygiene and face masks, with limited international travel and migration, may also contribute to decreasing AMR. Although the impact of COVID-19 on AMR is global, the adverse effect is likely to be worse in LMICs.

364629,COVID-19 in Lung Transplant Recipients,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of society worldwide. To combat the pandemic, measures such as face mask-wearing, hand-washing and -sanitizing, movement restrictions, and social distancing have been introduced. These measures have significantly disrupted education, particularly health professions education, which depends on student-patient contact for the development of clinical competence. The wide-ranging consequences of the pandemic are immense, and health professions education institutions in sub-Saharan Africa have not been spared. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a protocol for assessing the preparedness of selected health professions education institutions in sub-Saharan Africa for remote teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A mixed-methods design with a case study approach will be used. The awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement model of change was selected as the conceptual framework to guide the study. Eight higher education institutions in 6 sub-Saharan countries have participated in this study. Data will be collected through electronic surveys from among whole populations of academic staff, students, and administrators in undergraduate medicine and nursing programs. Qualitative and quantitative data from each institution will be analyzed as a case study, which will yield an inventory of similar cases grouped for comparison. Quantitative data will be analyzed for each institution and then compared to determine associations among variables and differences among programs, institutions, or countries. RESULTS: Our findings will provide information to higher education institutions, particularly those offering health professions education programs, in Africa regarding the preparedness for remote teaching and learning to influence efforts related to web-based teaching and learning, which is envisaged to become the new normal in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This study has not received any funding, and any costs involved were borne by individual consortium members at the various institutions. Ethics approval from the institutional review board was obtained at various times across the participating sites, which were free to commence data collection as soon as approval was obtained. Data collection was scheduled to begin on October 1, 2020, and end on February 28, 2021.

This concept can pose a degree of anxiety for patients as well as neurologists. We aimed to evaluate patient perspectives regarding the use of Natalizumab and anti-CD20 therapies (Rituximab and Ocrelizumab) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: cross-sectional study conducted via voluntary survey filled in by patients with MS and related disorders receiving their infusional treatment in one MS centre in Australia, exploring their concerns regarding their therapy, their therapy and COVID-19, precautions undertaken in response to the pandemic, and factors impacting their decision-making. RESULTS: 170 patients completed the survey. Of patients on Natalizumab, the majority had either no or mild concern regarding their DMT and COVID-19, and of patients on B-cell depleting therapies, again, the majority had no or mild concern, though a slightly higher proportion had a moderate level of concern. Asked to delineate their concerns, an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 was more commonly conveyed than MS-specific factors or poor outcomes pertaining to COVID-19 if contracted, by patients in both groups. Conversely, being invited to specifically consider the possibility of contracting COVID-19 or experience a relapse of MS, almost half of the cohort rated both of equal of concern. More than half of the cohort were self-isolating more stringently than general government advice and government-related resources followed by information provided by patient's neurologist where the commonest means of information to guide decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst a large proportion of patients had some concern regarding the impact of their DMT on COVID-19, whether on their risk of contracting COVID-19 or a theoretical risk for more severe disease, the overall level of concern in most cases was at most mild. Patients on B-cell depleting therapies were more inclined to express a higher level of concern. A similar concern was ascribed to a risk of a relapse or worsening MS symptoms compared to the risk of contracting COVID-19. Such attitudes may underscore a willingness of patients to continue their DMT where benefits outweigh risks during future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Seery, Nabil; Li, Vivien; Nguyen, Ai-Lan; Roos, Izanne; Buzzard, Katherine A; Atvars, Roberts; Taylor, Nicola; Tunnell, Kelsey; Carey, John; Dwyer, Chris; Taylor, Hasini Fernandoa Lisa; Baker, Josephine; Marriott, Mark P; Kilpatrick, Trevor J; Kalincik, Tomas; Monif, Mastura",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,154

373014,The specificity of the novel coronavirus infection in transplantation recipients,2020,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) can lead to immobility and bulbar weakness. This, in addition to the older age of onset and the higher rate of hospitalization compared to multiple sclerosis, makes this patient group a potential target for complicated COVID-19 infection. Moreover, many of the commonly used preventive therapies for NMOSD are cell-depleting immunouppsressants with increased risk of viral and bacterial infections. The emergence of several new NMOSD therapeutics, including immune-modulating agents, concurrently with the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 global pandemic call for careful therapeutic planning and add to the complexity of NMOSD management. Altering the common therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the pandemic may be necessary to balance both efficacy and safety of treatment. Selection of preventive therapy should take in consideration the viral exposure risk related to the route and frequency of administration and, most importantly, the immunological properties of each therapeutic agent and its potential impact on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity of infection. The impact of the therapeutic agent on the immune response against the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should also be considered in the clinical decision-making. In this review, we will discuss the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the potential impact of the current and emerging NMOSD therapeutics on infection risk, infection severity, and future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We propose a therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the COVID-19 pandemic based on analysis of the mechanism of action, route of administration, and side effect profile of each therapeutic agent.","Abboud, Hesham; Zheng, Crystal; Kar, Indrani; Chen, Claire Kaori; Sau, Crystal; Serra, Alessandro",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,154

Our objective is to report our practice implementation and experience of COVID-19 recovery during the resumption of routine imaging at a tertiary academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines for this practice implementation. Recover Wisely focused on a data driven, strategic rescheduling and redesigning patient flow process. We used scheduling simulations and meticulous monitoring and control of outpatient medical imaging volumes to achieve a linear restoration to our pre-COVID imaging studies. We had a tiered plan to address the backlog of rescheduled patients with gradual opening of our imaging facilities, while maintaining broad communication with our patients and referring clinicians. RESULTS: Recover Wisely followed our anticipated linear modeling. Considering the last 10 weeks in the recovery, outpatient growth was linear with an increase of approximately 172 cases per week, (R2 =0.97). We achieved an overall recovery of 102% in week 10, as compared to average weekly pre-COVID outpatient volumes. The modalities recovered as follows in outpatient volumes: CT (113%), MRI (101%), nuclear medicine including PET (138%), mammograms (97%), ultrasound (99%) and interventional radiology (106%). When compared to identical 2019 calendar weeks (May 4, 2020-July 10, 2020), the total 2020 radiology volume was 11% reduced from the 2019 volume. The reduction in total weighted relative value units was 8% in this time period, as compared to 2019. CONCLUSION: Our department utilized a data-driven, team approach based on our guiding principles to ""Recover Wisely."" We created and implemented a methodology that achieved a linear increase in outpatient studies over a 10-week recovery period.","Vagal, Achala; Mahoney, Mary; Anderson, Jeffrey L; Allen, Becky; Hudepohl, Joseph; Chadalavada, Seetharam; Choe, Kyuran A; Kapur, Sangita; Gaskill-Shipley, Mary; Makramalla, Abouelmagd; Brown, Ann; Braley, Susan; England, Eric; Scheler, Jennifer; Udstuen, Gavin; Rybicki, Frank J",Acad Radiol,,154

After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following the first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology: We developed a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of the Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results: The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the city closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all the cities. The more a city showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty.","Ribeiro, Sérvio Pontes; Castro e Silva, Alcides; Dáttilo, Wesley; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Alcantara, Luiz Carlos; Giovanetti, Marta; Coura-Vital, Wendel; Fernandes, Geraldo Wilson; Azevedo, Vasco Ariston C.",PeerJ,,154
379135,Hereditary angioedema again revisited,2021,"Neutralizing antibody targeting to the SARS-CoV-2 could provide powerful therapies. A neutralizing antibody CC12.1 which was found in SARS-CoV-2 patient samples provides potential protection from disease. The aim of molecular dynamics simulations is to identify key epitopes that are crucial to the antibody binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) to promote the development of superior antibodies. Binding modes of the antibody were investigated and compared with RBD bound receptor ACE2. Key epitopes were revealed and a distal motif of RBD (residue numbers 473-488) was demonstrated by analyzing dynamic trajectories. Compared to the receptor ACE2, conformation of RBD could be better stabilized through additional interaction of antibody with the distal motif of RBD, which was further found driven by electrostatic complementarity. By further analysis of the extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, residues D405, K417, Y421, Y453, L455, R457, Y473, A475, N487, G502, Y505 of RBD, which mainly interacted with CDR H3/L3 and two conserved motifs SNY, SGGS, were identified as key epitopes. Higher binding free energy calculated after point mutations on key residues confirms the crucial role for the specific binding. Subsequently, mutations of VH V98E and VL G68D in CC12.1, which could significantly enhance the binding affinity of the antibody, were also proposed. The results indicate the key epitopes for antibody binding and give explanations for failure of neutralization antibody caused by specific residues mutations on structural basis. Simulations of two point mutations on antibody provide feasible information for advanced antibody design.","Wang, Daojiong; Ge, Yushu; Zhong, Bin; Liu, Dan",,,154
379182,Determinants of inflammatorybowel disease patient satisfactionafter transition to virtual visits,2021,"During the first two decades of the 21st century, there have been three coronavirus infection outbreaks raising global health concerns by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the SARS-CoV-2. Although the reported imaging findings of coronavirus infection are variable and nonspecific, the most common initial chest radiograph (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) findings are ground-glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral predominance and eventually spread to involve both lungs as the disease progresses. These findings can be explained by the immune pathogenesis of coronavirus infection causing diffuse alveolar damage. Although it is insensitive in mild or early coronavirus infection, the CXR remains as the first-line and the most commonly used imaging modality. That is because it is rapid and easily accessible and helpful for monitoring patient progress during treatment. CT is more sensitive to detect early parenchymal lung abnormalities and disease progression, and can provide an alternative diagnosis. In this pictorial review, various coronavirus infection cases are presented to provide imaging spectrums of coronavirus infection and present differences in imaging among them or from other viral infections, and to discuss the role of imaging in viral infection outbreaks.","Franquet, Tomas; Jeong, Yeon Joo; Lam, Hiu Yin Sonia; Wong, Ho Yuen Frank; Chang, Yeun-Chung; Chung, Myung Jin; Lee, Kyung Soo",Br J Radiol,,154

Favipiravir, indicated for the treatment of new and re-emerging influenza infections, has been suggested to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, although this is not yet fully validated. We administered favipiravir to a 64-year-old female patient with COVID-19. Her symptoms resolved quickly after the start of treatment, with reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but she developed a fever again on day 12. Since the fever was relieved by discontinuation of favipiravir, and based on positive results with a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, we diagnosed her with favipiravir-induced drug fever. A decrease in the serum concentration of favipiravir was observed along with resolution of the fever. The present case suggests that drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of relapsing fever episodes in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir.","Murai, Yushi; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Takegoshi, Yusuke; Kaneda, Makito; Kimoto, Kou; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Kawago, Koyomi; Fukui, Yasutaka; Ogami, Chika; Sakamaki, Ippei; Tsuji, Yasuhiro; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",Int J Infect Dis,,154

Puede transmitirse por contacto, gotas y aerosoles, y ha sido aislado en secreciones gastrointestinales y heces. Durante la endoscopía digestiva podría ocurrir la transmisión por cualquiera de estos mecanismos. Se recomienda limitar la endoscopía digestiva a casos de hemorragia digestiva, disfagia severa, cuerpo extraño en tracto digestivo, obstrucción biliar con dolor intratable o colangitis, pseudoquiste o necrosis pancreática encapsulada complicada, obstrucción gastrointestinal, y casos con riesgo de deterioro en el tiempo. Se recomienda tamizar a los pacientes en base a la temperatura, síntomas, y factores epidemiológicos para clasificarlos según su riesgo de infección. Para procedimientos en pacientes de riesgo bajo el personal debe usar bata descartable, guantes, protector ocular o facial, mascarilla quirúrgica estándar, gorro descartable, cubiertas descartables para zapatos. En casos de riesgo intermedio o alto, o COVID-19 confirmado, se debe incrementar la protección usando bata descartable impermeable, respirador N95 o similar, y doble guante. En caso de escasez puede ser necesario reutilizar los respiradores N95 hasta un máximo de 5 usos, siguiendo las recomendaciones de CDC sobre la colocación, retiro y almacenamiento para prevenir la contaminación secundaria por contacto. Asimismo todo el equipo de protección debe colocarse y retirarse siguiendo las recomendaciones del CDC. La presencia de personal en la endoscopía debe limitarse al mínimo indispensable. Dicho personal debe tener control diario de temperatura y si ésta es mayor a 37,3 ºC se debe proceder a la evaluación correspondiente. Después de cada procedimiento se debe desinfectar apropiadamente la camilla y superficies de la sala.

382735,"Zoonotic coronavirus epidemics: SARS, MERS, and COVID-19",2020,"COVID-19 is a pandemic with over 5 million cases worldwide. The disease has imposed a huge burden on health resources. Evaluation of clinical and epidemiological profiles of such patients can help in understanding and managing the outbreak more efficiently. This study was a prospective observational analysis of 200 diagnosed COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 20th march to 8th May 2020. All these patients were positive for COVID-19 by an oro-nasopharyngeal swab-rtPCR based testing. Analyses of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and the outcomes were performed. The mean age of the population was 40 years with a slight male predominance (116 patients out of 200, 58%). A majority of the patients (147, 73.5 %) were symptomatic, with fever being the most common symptom (109, 54.5%), followed by cough (91, 45.5%). An older age, presence of symptoms and their duration, leukocytosis, a high quick SOFA score, a high modified SOFA score, need for ventilator support, an AST level more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater were at a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Presence of diabetes mellitus, AST > three times ULN, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or higher, and a qSOFA score of 1 or higher were all associated with significantly greater odds of critical care requirement. Triage and severity assessment helps in deciding the requirement for a hospital stay and ICU admission for COVID-19 which can easily be done using clinical and laboratory parameters. A mild, moderate and severe category approach with defined criteria and treatment guidelines will help in judicious utilization of health-care resources, especially for developing countries like India. *Other members of the Safdarjung Hospital COVID-19 working group: Balvinder Singh (Microbiology), MK Sen (Pulmonary Medicine), Shibdas Chakrabarti (Pulmonary Medicine), NK Gupta (Pulmonary medicine), AJ Mahendran (Pulmonary Medicine), Ramesh Meena (Medicine), G Usha (Anaesthesiology), Santvana Kohli (Anaesthesiology), Sahil Diwan (Anaesthesiology), Rushika Saksena (Microbiology), Vikramjeet Dutta (Microbiology), Anupam Kr Anveshi (Microbiology).","Gupta, Nitesh; Ish, Pranav; Kumar, Rohit; Dev, Nishanth; Yadav, Siddharth Raj; Malhotra, Nipun; Agrawal, Sumita; Gaind, Rajni; Sachdeva, Harish; Covid Working Group, Other Members Of The Safdarjung Hospital",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,154
385796,Effect of Jinhua Qinggan granules on novel coronavirus pneumonia in patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Ageing-related processes such as cellular senescence are believed to underlie the accumulation of diseases in time, causing (co)morbidity, including cancer, thromboembolism and stroke. Interfering with these processes may delay, stop or reverse morbidity. The aim of this study is to investigate the link between (co)morbidity and ageing by exploring biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of disease-triggered deterioration in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and (thromboembolic) ischaemic stroke (IS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 50 patients with PDAC, 50 patients with (thromboembolic) IS and 50 controls at Rostock University Medical Center, Germany. We will gather routine blood data, clinical performance measurements and patient-reported outcomes at up to seven points in time, alongside in-depth transcriptomics and proteomics at two of the early time points. Aiming for clinically relevant biomarkers, the primary outcome is a composite of probable sarcopenia, clinical performance (described by ECOG Performance Status for patients with PDAC and the Modified Rankin Scale for patients with stroke) and quality of life. Further outcomes cover other aspects of morbidity such as cognitive decline and of comorbidity such as vascular or cancerous events. The data analysis is comprehensive in that it includes biostatistics and machine learning, both following standard role models and additional explorative approaches. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers for interventions addressing senescence may become available if the biomarkers that we find are specifically related to ageing/cellular senescence. Similarly, diagnostic biomarkers will be explored. Our findings will require validation in independent studies, and our dataset shall be useful to validate the findings of other studies. In some of the explorative analyses, we shall include insights from systems biology modelling as well as insights from preclinical animal models. We anticipate that our detailed study protocol and data analysis plan may also guide other biomarker exploration trials. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Ethikkommission an der Medizinischen Fakultät der Universität Rostock, A2019-0174), registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021184), and results will be published following standard guidelines.","Henze, Larissa; Walter, Uwe; Murua Escobar, Hugo; Junghanss, Christian; Jaster, Robert; Köhling, Rüdiger; Lange, Falko; Salehzadeh-Yazdi, Ali; Wolkenhauer, Olaf; Hamed, Mohamed; Barrantes, Israel; Palmer, Daniel; Möller, Steffen; Kowald, Axel; Heussen, Nicole; Fuellen, Georg",BMJ Open,,154
385797,Effect of Jinhua Qinggan granules on novel coronavirus pneumonia in patients,2020,"INTRODUCCIÓN: En diciembre de 2019 emergió en China y se propagó rápidamente a otros países un nuevo síndrome respiratorio agudo grave, causado por un nuevo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), que fue llamado &quot;enfermedad por coronavirus 2019&quot;o COVID-19 El 30 de enero de 2020 la OMS declaró oficialmente que se estaba en presencia de una emergencia de salud de importancia internacional y el 11 de marzo de 2020 declaró la situación como una pandemia Esta infección representa la tercera oportunidad en la que se introduce en la población humana un coronavirus altamente patogénico y de amplia propagación (SARS-CoV en 2002 y Síndrome respiratorio de Medio Oriente - MERS-CoV- en 2012) Desde su origen en Wuhan, China, el SARS-CoV-2 se ha propagado rápidamente, alcanzando a nivel mundial 638 146 casos y 30 105 (4,72%) muertes al 29 de marzo del 2020 En Argentina se registraban hasta ese momento 820 casos, con un 2 44 % de mortalidad (n=20) A la fecha de la actualización de este informe (16 de abril) se registran a nivel mundial 2 078 605 casos y 139 515 (6,71%) muertes En Argentina se registran actualmente 2 669 casos, con un 4 57% de mortalidad (n=122) METODOLOGÍA: Se realizó una búsqueda sistemática de información en Medline (a través de Pubmed), Cochrane, Tripdatabase, Epistemonikos, en buscadores generales de internet (Google), en la Base Regional de Informes de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud de las Américas (BRISA), y en informes de evaluación de tecnologías sanitarias de la Red Argentina de Evaluación de Tecnologías Sanitarias (RedARETS) Se analizaron también las revisiones y o guías generadas por Ministerios de salud, la OMS, agencias reguladoras, Sociedad Científica de Argentina, el Centro para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE UU (CDC) Se priorizó la inclusión de revisiones sistemáticas y metaanálisis, ensayos clínicos controlados aleatorizados (ECCA), guías de práctica clínica basadas en evidencia, evaluaciones de tecnologías sanitarias y estudios observacionales para los aspectos de seguridad o efectos adversos Debido a la reciente pandemia de COVID-19, se consideró además cualquier publicación directa o indirecta que mencionara el tema en cuestión Se recabaron datos de eficacia en desenlaces clínicamente relevantes (cura, disminución de la mortalidad, disminución de las complicaciones, negativización de la serología viral) RESULTADOS: Al 29 de marzo, fecha original de la primera versión de este informe, a partir de la búsqueda en las bases de datos de información biomédica utilizadas, fueron incluidos para el análisis dos estudios de investigación in vitro, una revisión sistemática y un ensayo clínico multicéntrico para cloroquina En el caso de hidroxicloroquina se incluyó un estudio in vitro y un estudio observacional Por su parte respecto al lopinavir/ritonavir , se recuperaron tres estudios in vitro, dos estudios observacionales, y un ECCA Considerando la búsqueda en buscadores generales de internet, en BRISA, en informes de ETS de RedARETS y las publicaciones que directa o indirectamente mencionaran el tema, se encontraron y priorizaron 8 documentos (consensos, guías o informes rápidos) referidos al tema y medicamentos evaluados Al momento de la actualización de este informe, 16 de abril, se incluyeron adicionalmente un estudio in vitro sobre cloroquina/hidroxicloroquina, un estudio observacional y un ensayo clínico aleatorizado sobre hidroxicloroquina, un ensayo clínico aleatorizado fase 2 b sobre cloroquina y un ECCA sobre lopinavir/ritonavir CONCLUSIONES: Existe plausibilidad biológica para el uso de hidroxicloroquina, cloroquina, lopinavir/ ritonavir en pacientes con COVID-19 Estos medicamentos han demostrado efectos antivirales en experimentos &quot;in vitro&quot;sobre el SARS-CoV (hidroxicloroquina, cloroquina y lopinavir/ritonavir) el SARS-CoV-2 (hidroxicloroquina y cloroquina) y el MERS-CoV (lopinavir/ritonavir)48 La plausibilidad biológica y experimentos &quot;In vitro&quot;solo sirven d base para evidenciar la necesidad de estudios clínicos de buena calidad para validar o descartar esos resultados preliminares En un estudio observacional, en pacientes con SARS-CoV, se encontró que el tratamiento con lopinavir/ritonavir se asociaba con resultados clínicos significativamente menores (síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo - SDRA- o muerte) Este tipo de estudios, sirven de base para la realización de ECCA, pero no para sacar conclusiones definitivas El estudio de casos y controles que analizó hidroxicloroquina con o sin azitromicina en pacientes hospitalizados con infección confirmada por COVID-19 comparándose con pacientes no tratados, encontró al medicamento eficaz para las variables estudiadas, aunque el estudio presenta limitaciones importantes En una comunicación preliminar (sin publicación de resultados a la fecha) del ensayo clínico multicéntrico de tratamiento de la neumonía asociada a COVID-19, realizado en China en más de 100 pacientes, se menciona la eficacia de la cloroquina con una seguridad aceptable La serie de casos 20 de 80 pacientes con COVID-19 tratados con hidroxicloroquina y azitromicina, mostró una rápida disminución de la carga viral nasofaríngea y negativización de los cultivos virales de muestras, permitiendo una rápida alta hospitalaria (duración media de internación hospitalaria de cinco días) Sin embargo, es un estudio con sesgos importantes, que no brinda evidencia de alta calidad ya que carece de grupo control, incluye pacientes jóvenes en promedio, y la mayoría con enfermedad leve, dejando lugar a la incertidumbre de si la mejoría clínica podría haberse dado sola, sin la intervención Un ensayo clínico aleatorizado (ECA) realizado también en China en 62 pacientes con COVID-19 mostró que el tiempo de recuperación de la temperatura corporal y el tiempo de remisión de la tos se acortaron significativamente en el grupo de tratamiento con hidroxicloroquina También se observó una mayor proporción de pacientes con mejoría de la neumonía en el grupo de tratamiento en relación con el grupo control Estos resultados no son concluyentes, teniendo en cuenta el pequeño número de pacientes analizados y la ausencia de información sobre la prescripción de otros medicamentos previos o durante el estudio Considerando que los pacientes en este estudio tenían enfermedad leve y la mayoría eran jóvenes (45 años), no es posible extrapolar estos resultados a pacientes graves y de mayor edad Un estudio observacional, en 134 pacientes no encontró ningún efecto de lopinavir / ritonavir y umifenovir para aliviar los síntomas o aumentar la depuración del virus en pacientes con neumonía por COVID-19 El ECCA que compara lopinavir/ritonavir con tratamiento habitual en pacientes adultos hospitalizados con COVID-19, no encontró ningún beneficio con el tratamiento No se han encontrado otros estudios clínicos de importancia con el uso de lopinavir/ritonavir en pacientes con COVID-19 Consideramos que las conclusiones del ensayo ELACOI pueden no ser definitivas dada la baja calidad de evidencia de este estúdio Se tomaron en consideración además los perfiles de seguridad de estos medicamentos, con especial atención en la posibilidad de prolongación del intervalo QT y tener presente las posibles interacciones con otros medicamentos que puedan aumentar este y otros riesgos La OMS y la Guía de SSC14 consideran que no existe evidencia actual para recomendar un tratamiento antiviral específico para pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado, y solo se puede utilizar en el marco de un ensayo clínico controlado Por su parte, un documento técnico de España24 no incluye el uso de hidroxicloroquina o cloroquina, en pacientes con COVID 19, pero si recomienda el tratamiento con lopinavir/ritonavir La guía del Instituto de Salud Pública de Bélgica recomienda el uso de los medicamentos evaluados en esta revisión El Ministerio de Salud de Argentina enmarca las recomendaciones del uso de estos medicamentos, en la definición de cobertura condicionada a la generación de evidencias, dentro de un estudio clínico controlado La OMS ha desarrollado el protocolo de un ensayo clínico a nivel internacional, llamado &quot;Solidarity&quot;en el que incluyen 4 ramas de tratamiento: remdesivir;cloroquina/ hidroxicloroquina;lopinavir/ritonavir;y lopinavir/ritonavir /interferón beta Hasta el momento el ensayo incluirá la participación de Argentina, Bahréin, Canadá, España, Francia, Irán, Noruega, Sudáfrica, Suiza y Tailandia El estudio comparará la seguridad y la eficacia de estos medicamentos contra COVID-19 Según OMS este estudio, enmarcado en una acción solidaria cooperativa entre los sistemas de salud de todos los países, podrá reducir drásticamente el tiempo necesario para generar evidencia sólida sobre cuáles son los medicamentos que demuestran beneficios (efectividad/seguridad) para el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19 Analizando la información presentada, se puede concluir que no existe hasta el momento, información proveniente de estudios de calidad de evidencia alta, que permitan recomendar hidroxicloroquina, cloroquina, lopinavir/ritonavir para el tratamiento específico de pacientes con COVID-19 Considerando que a nivel global se enfrenta ahora una emergencia sanitaria grave, con el advenimiento de una infección viral respiratoria para la cual no existen vacunas ni tratamientos, el uso de los medicamentos, que han probado evidencias a nivel experimental y que se han comenzado a utilizar con eficacia por algunos países (aunque estas experiencias clínicas carezcan aún de evidencias de alta calidad), pueden ser recomendados solamente en el marco de ensayos clínicos autorizados en cada país, que permitan generar la mejor evidencia disponible para unatoma de decisiones terapéuticas

Here, we summarize the current evidence on the transmission, clinical presentation, complications and risk factors in regard to SARS-CoV-2 in children, and highlight crucial gaps in knowledge going forward. Based on current evidence, children are rarely the primary source of secondary transmission in the household or in child care and school settings and are more likely to contract the virus from an adult household member. Higher transmission rates are observed in older children (10-19 years old) compared with younger children ( <10 years old). While increasing incidence of COVID-19 in neonates raises the suspicion of vertical transmission, it is unlikely that breast milk is a vehicle for transmission from mother to infant. The vast majority of clinical cases of COVID-19 in children are mild, but there are rare cases that have developed complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which often presents with severe cardiac symptoms requiring intensive care. Childhood obesity is associated with a higher risk of infection and a more severe clinical presentation. Although immediate mortality rates among children are low, long-term respiratory, and developmental implications of the disease remain unknown in this young and vulnerable population.","Siebach, Melissa K; Piedimonte, Giovanni; Ley, Sylvia H",Pediatr Pulmonol,,154
388384,Effect of manual and digital contact tracing on COVID-19 outbreaks: a study on empirical contact data,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), exhibit a wide spectrum of disease behaviour. Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients &#8804; 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients. FINDINGS: The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease. INTERPRETATION: We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic factors, could be useful in the clinical stratification and management of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.

388936,A case report of COVID-19 infection and management during pregnancy,2021,"Recent clinical trials have now firmly established that inflammation participates causally in human atherosclerosis. These observations point the way toward novel treatments that add to established therapies to help stem the growing global epidemic of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, we now have a number of actionable targets whose clinical exploration will help achieve the goal of optimizing beneficial effects while avoiding undue interference with host defenses or other unwanted actions. This review aims to furnish the foundation for this quest by critical evaluation of the current state of anti-inflammatory interventions within close reach of clinical application, with a primary focus on innate immunity. In particular, this paper highlights the pathway from the inflammasome, through interleukin (IL)-1 to IL-6 supported by a promising body of pre-clinical, clinical, and human genetic data. This paper also considers the use of biomarkers to guide allocation of anti-inflammatory therapies as a step toward realizing the promise of precision medicine. The validation of decades of experimental work and association studies in humans by recent clinical investigations provides a strong impetus for further efforts to target inflammation in atherosclerosis to address the considerable risk that remains despite current therapies.","Libby, Peter",,,154

To do this, it calls for the fortification of the traditional course of study that introduces students to the analysis of literary texts. However, a traditional approach to school-based literary analysis that attends exclusively to a text's formal properties in order to determine its meaning is insufficient to get ahead of the world risk curve. Instead, the article turns to the concept of allegory as theorized in curriculum theory and to a theory of preventative foresight to interpret a famous dream (of a world-shattering contagion) in a famous work of literature (Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment) that provides a novel opportunity to understand the significance of sense in the time of plagues.","Spector, Hannah",Prospects (Paris),,154

392721,Psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China,2020,"CONTEXT.­: Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare, indolent Hodgkin lymphoma subtype with distinct clinicopathologic features and treatment paradigms. The neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant cells typically express bright CD20 and other B-cell antigens, which distinguishes them from Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells of lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma. OBJECTIVE.­: To characterize the clinicopathologic features of CD20-negative NLPHL at a single institution. DESIGN.­: A retrospective search for CD20-negative NLPHL in our pathology archives and medical records was conducted. RESULTS.­: Of 486 NLPHL patients identified with CD20 available for review, 14 (2.8%) had LP cells with absent CD20 expression. Patients with prior rituximab administration (n = 7) and insufficient clinical history (n = 1) were excluded, leaving 6 patients with rituximab-naïve, CD20-negative NLPHL. A broad immunohistochemical panel showed the LP cells in all cases expressed B-cell antigens, particularly Oct-2, although PAX5 and CD79a were frequently also dim. CD30, CD15, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs were negative in all evaluated cases. Two patients had high-risk variant immunoarchitectural pattern D. One patient had extranodal disease, involving the spleen and bone, and was suspected to have large cell transformation. Standard NLPHL therapy was given, including local radiation and/or chemotherapy. Of 5 patients with available follow-up, 4 are alive in complete remission after therapy, and 1 is alive with relapsed disease. CONCLUSIONS.­: NLPHL can lack CD20 de novo without prior rituximab therapy. In such cases, extensive immunophenotyping helps distinguish NLPHL from lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma, which differ in clinical behavior and therapy. In our series, CD20-negative NLPHL showed both classic and variant histologic patterns and the expected range of clinical behavior seen in NLPHL, including 1 case with suspected large cell transformation.","Menke, Joshua R; Spinner, Michael A; Natkunam, Yasodha; Warnke, Roger A; Advani, Ranjana H; Gratzinger, Dita A",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

In a screen for new models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identify human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. Remarkably, H522 infection requires the E484D S variant; viruses expressing wild-type S are not infectious. Anti-S monoclonal antibodies differentially neutralize SARS-CoV-2 E484D S in H522 cells as compared to ACE2-expressing cells. Sera from vaccinated individuals block this alternative entry mechanism, whereas convalescent sera are less effective. Although the H522 receptor remains unknown, depletion of surface heparan sulfates block H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reveal alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type I interferon signaling. These findings establish an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor for the E484D SARS-CoV-2 variant, which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.","Puray-Chavez, Maritza; LaPak, Kyle M; Schrank, Travis P; Elliott, Jennifer L; Bhatt, Dhaval P; Agajanian, Megan J; Jasuja, Ria; Lawson, Dana Q; Davis, Keanu; Rothlauf, Paul W; Liu, Zhuoming; Jo, Heejoon; Lee, Nakyung; Tenneti, Kasyap; Eschbach, Jenna E; Shema Mugisha, Christian; Cousins, Emily M; Cloer, Erica W; Vuong, Hung R; VanBlargan, Laura A; Bailey, Adam L; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Crowe, James E; Diamond, Michael S; Hayes, D Neil; Whelan, Sean P J; Horani, Amjad; Brody, Steven L; Goldfarb, Dennis; Major, M Ben; Kutluay, Sebla B",Cell Rep,,154

Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease were found in 45%, 41.5%, 15%, and 20.1% cases, respectively. Mean HbA1c was 5.8%± 1.1 in patients with no history of diabetes, 3% presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, mortality rate was 30.6%. Non-survivors were significantly older (median age 68 vs 56, p &amp;lt;0.03) and had higher rate of microvascular and macrovascular diseases. In patients with diabetes, mortality rate was 40.1%. HbA1c was similar between survivors and non-survivors. Older age and hyperglycemia on admission were the risk factors for mortality. Only 30% of the cohort had normal weight (BMI&amp;lt;25), 30% was overweight and 40% was obese. In univariate analysis, the characteristics at admission significantly associated with mortality were age, BMI, hyperglycemia, diabetes and DKA in patients with or without diabetes. In age- and sex-adjusted multivariable analysis only BMI 30–39 kg/m2 (OR = 1.63;95% CI, 1.10, 2.43;p = 0.015), BMI &amp;gt;40 kg/m2 (OR = 2.05;95% CI, 1.22, 3.44;p = 0.007) and DKA (OR = 1.77;95% CI, 1.18, 2.64;p = 0.005) remained positively associated with higher mortality.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Henry Ford Health System Multidisciplinary ICU, a total of 156 beds spread throughout the hospital in Detroit, MI. PATIENTS: We obtained data from the electronic medical record of all adult severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive patients managed in the ICU of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, between March 13, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Included patients were divided into two groups: people of color (including Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Arab) and White. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 365 patients were evaluated: 219 were Black (60.0%), 129 were White (35.3%), two were Asian (0.6%), eight were Hispanic/Latino (2.2%), and seven were Arab (1.9%). People of color were younger (62.8 vs 67.1; p = 0.007), with equal distribution of sex. People of color had less coronary artery disease (34 [14.4%] vs 35 [27.1%]; p =0.003) and less self-reported use of regular alcohol consumption (50 [21.2%] vs 12 [9.3%]; p = 0.004) than Whites, with no differences in diabetes (125 [53.0%] vs 66 [51.2%]; p = 0.742), hypertension (188 [79.7%] vs 99 [76.8%]; p = 0.516), congestive heart failure (41 [17.4%] vs 32 [24.8%]; p = 0.090), or chronic kidney disease (123 [54.1%] vs 55 [42.6%]; p = 0.083).There was no difference in ICU length of stay between people of color (18 d [CI, 7-47 d]) and Whites (18 d [CI, 6-48 d]; p = 0. 0.979). Neither frequency (72.5% vs 71.3%; p = ns) nor median time to mechanical ventilation between people of color (9 d [CI, 6-15 d]) and Whites (10 d [CI, 5-16 d]; p = 0.733) was different. Overall, 188 patients (51.5 %) died in the hospital. The 28-day mortality was lower in people of color (107/236; 45.3%) versus Whites (73/129; 56.6%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.60; p = 0.034), and there was an increased median survival time in people of color (20 d) versus Whites (13.5 d; hazard ratio 0.62; p = 0.002). The inhospital mortality was lower in people of color versus White, but the difference was not statistically significant (113 [47.9%] vs 75 [58.1%], respectively; p = 0.061). Finally, there was no significant difference in days of symptoms prior to admission, frequency of presenting symptoms, or frequency or severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019, people of color had a lower 28-day mortality than Whites with no difference in hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, or rates of intubation. These findings are contrary to previously held beliefs surrounding the pandemic.","Lazar, Michael H; Fadel, Raef; Gardner-Gray, Jayna; Tatem, Geneva; Caldwell, Martina T; Swiderek, Jennifer; Jennings, Jeffrey H",Crit Care Med,,154
395528,COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients: A single center case series from New York City,2020,"PURPOSE: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral issues among those who have completed bariatric surgery (BS) is not well described in ethnically diverse populations. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders and after lockdown orders were lifted on substance use, mental health, and weight-related behaviors among a sample of post-BS adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified BS patients from one university-based obesity medicine clinic and two BS practices. An online non-anonymous survey was implemented in two phases: during lockdown (April 1-May 31, 2020) and after lockdown orders were lifted (June 1, 2020-September 30, 2020) to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on BS patients. RESULTS: A total of 189 (during lockdown=39, post-lockdown=150) participants (90.4% female, mean age 52.4 years, SD 11.1, 49.8% non-Hispanic White, 30.6% non-Hispanic Black, 16.1% Hispanic) participated. Lockdown participants were more likely to have sleep problems (74.3% vs. 56.1%, P=.039) and feel anxious (82.0% vs. 63.0%, P=.024) versus post-lockdown participants. A majority (83.4%) reported depression in both lockdown/post-lockdown. Post-lockdown participants were more than 20 times more likely to report substance use compared those in lockdown (aOR 20.56, 95% CI 2.66-158.4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a substantial negative impact on substance use, mental health, and weight-related health behaviors in diverse BS patients. These findings have important implications for post-BS patient care teams and may suggest the integration of screening tools to identify those at high risk for behavioral health issues.","Messiah, Sarah E; Uppuluri, Maduri; Xie, Luyu; Schellinger, Jeffrey N; Mathew, M Sunil; Ofori, Ashley; Kukreja, Sachin; Schneider, Benjamin; Dunn, Samuel H; Tavakkoli, Anna; Almandoz, Jaime P",Obes Surg,,154

Healthcare resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic.","Aziz, Asma B; Raqib, Rubhana; Khan, Wasif A; Rahman, Mahbubur; Haque, Rashidul; Alam, Munir; Zaman, K; Ross, Allen G",Int J Infect Dis,,154
397925,Current global status and future development of traditional Chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are currently many unanswered questions surrounding the management of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and several 'rapid' guidelines have been released, although are subject to be updated and changed in the near future. The purpose of this review is to discuss the approach to management of patients with immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: At present, there is little evidence to suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with immune-mediated diseases or associated with conventional or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; however, glucocorticoid use does appear to have negative associations. SUMMARY: Currently, conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs can be continued in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In the case of exposure, with the exception of hydroxyhcloroquine and sulfasalazine, immunosuppression should be held for 2 weeks. Our recommendations and the guidelines we discuss here are based on C-level recommendations but help provide a framework for how to counsel our patients during this pandemic.","Calabrese, Cassandra; Lehman, Bethany",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,154

METHODS: To analyze the impact of cocaine and cannabis use on levels of markers of monocyte activation (sCD163 and sCD14) and systemic inflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6]) in AUD patients admitted for hospital treatment between 2013 and 2018. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained upon admission. IL-6, sCD163, and sCD14 were measured in frozen plasma samples. We performed logistic regression to detect associations between cocaine and cannabis use and markers of monocyte activation and inflammation in the highest quartile. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients (77.5 % male) were included (median age = 50 years). The median alcohol intake upon admission was 142 g/day. The median duration of AUD was 20 years. Of the 289 patients with AUD, 76 % were active smokers, 23.1 % and 22.1 % concomitantly used cocaine and cannabis, respectively The median levels of IL-6, sCD163, and sCD14 were 4.37 pg/mL, 759 ng/mL, and 1.68 × 106 pg/mL, respectively. We did not detect associations between cocaine use and inflammation or monocyte activation. Cannabis use was associated with a higher odds of having sCD163 levels in the highest quartile (adjusted odds ratio = 2.34, 95 % confidence interval = 1.07-5.15, p = 0.03). Cannabis use was not associated with inflammation. CONCLUSION: In this series of AUD patients the concomitant use of cannabis use was associated with sCD163 levels that were in the highest quartile, consistent with monocyte activation.","Fuster, Daniel; García-Calvo, Xavier; Bolao, Ferran; Zuluaga, Paola; Rocamora, Gemma; Hernández-Rubio, Anna; Sanvisens, Arantza; Tor, Jordi; Muga, Robert",Drug Alcohol Depend,,154

The patient presented with subacute cerebellar syndrome and myoclonus several days after general infectious symptoms began. Methods: Clinical examination, CT, PET, MRI, and autoantibody testing were performed. Results: The oropharyngeal swab test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The brain MRI results were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed normal cell counts, a negative result on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, and no oligoclonal banding. Brain 18F-FDG PET showed diffuse cortical hypometabolism associated with putaminal and cerebellum hypermetabolism, compatible with encephalitis and especially cerebellitis. The immunologic study revealed high titers of IgG autoantibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid directed against the nuclei of Purkinje cells, striatal neurons, and hippocampal neurons. Whole-body 18F-FDG PET and CT scans did not show neoplasia. Treatment with steroids allowed a rapid improvement in symptoms. Conclusion: This clinical case argues for a possible relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and autoimmune encephalitis and for the use of 18F-FDG PET in such a context.","Grimaldi, Stephan; Lagarde, Stanislas; Harlé, Jean-Robert; Boucraut, José; Guedj, Eric",J Nucl Med,,154
402133,Strategies for qualified triage stations and fever clinics during the outbreak of COVID-2019 in the county hospitals of Western Chongqing,2020,"The cotton bollworm P450s of the clustered CYP6AE subfamily share high sequence identities but differ dramatically in their capacity to metabolize xenobiotics, especially esfenvalerate. Among them, CYP6AE17 has the highest sequence identity with CYP6AE18 but shows â¼7-fold higher metabolic efficiency. CYP6AE11 is most active towards esfenvalerate but CYP6AE20 is inactive even though the enzymes share 54.8% sequence identity. Sequence analysis revealed the SRS1 (Substrate Recognition Site) and SRS6 between CYP6AE17 and CYP6AE18, and SRS1 between CYP6AE11 and CYP6AE20 are the most variable among all six SRSs. In order to identify the key factors that underlie the observed catalytic difference, we exchanged these SRS sequences between two pairs of P450s and studied the activity of the resulting hybrid mutants or chimeras. In vitro metabolism showed that the CYP6AE17/18 chimeras had 2- and 10-fold decreased activities and the CYP6AE18/17 chimeras had 6- and 10-fold increased activities to esfenvalerate. Meanwhile, after exchanging SRS1 with each other, the CYP6AE11/20 chimera folded incorrectly but the CYP6AE20/11 chimera gained moderate activity to esfenvalerate. Molecular modelling showed that amino acids variants within SRS1 or SRS6 change the shape and chemical environment of the active sites, which may affect the ligand-binding interactions. These results indicate that the protein structure variation resulting from the sequence diversity of SRSs promotes the evolution of insect chemical defense and contributes to the development of insect resistance to pesticides.","Shi, Yu; O Reilly, Andrias O; Sun, Shuo; Qu, Qiong; Yang, Yihua; Wu, Yidong",Insect Biochem Mol Biol,,154
402824,Full Issue PDF,2020,"1The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated wastewater-based surveillance, allowing public health to track the epidemic by monitoring the concentration of the genetic fingerprints of SARS-CoV-2 shed in wastewater by infected individuals. Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we perform exploratory simulations to quantify the effect of surveillance effectiveness, public-health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the effective reproduction number and incidence forecasts. We find that wastewater-based surveillance, paired with this model, can complement clinical surveillance by supporting the estimation of key epidemiological metrics and hence better triangulate the state of an epidemic using this alternative data source.","Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Fazil, Aamir; Li, Michael; Mangat, Chand S.; Peterson, Shelley W; Daigle, Jade; Langner, Stacie; Shurgold, Jayson; D039, Patrick M; Aoust,; Delatolla, Robert; Mercier, Elisabeth; Pang, Xiao-Li; Lee, Bonita E.; Stuart, Rebecca; Wijayasri, Shinthuja; CHAMPREDON, David",,,154

The mechanochemical cycle of kinesins is well described, but how they establish cargo specificity is not fully understood. Transport of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte is mediated by Drosophila kinesin-1, also called kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and a putative cargo adaptor, the atypical tropomyosin, aTm1. How the proteins cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1 from classical motor adaptors.","Dimitrova-Paternoga, Lyudmila; Jagtap, Pravin Kumar Ankush; Cyrklaff, Anna; Lapouge, Karine; Sehr, Peter; Perez, Kathryn; Heber, Simone; Löw, Christian; Hennig, Janosch; Ephrussi, Anne",Genes dev,,154

GVT collaboration has become ubiquitous and has additionally accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main issues of global virtual teams are technology difficulties, language and time zone differences, and lower levels of psychological safety. Advances in collaboration technology aim at improving collaboration for GVT. But we know little about the acceptance of these technologies. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore how Millennial and Gen Z members of GVT accept speech-to-text technology;namely, automated captions in virtual conferences and automated meetings transcripts. Particularly, we are comparing antecedents of acceptance across levels of language proficiency and psychological safety. We surveyed 530 users of speech-to-text technology in GVT both before and after they used the technology. The pre-survey was administered before the COVID-19 pandemic hit;when participants completed the post-survey all were under some degree of lockdown. Results suggest that use of the technology reduces anxiety and effort, but decreases performance expectation and hedonic motivation. Non-native speakers rate the technology more positively.

We aimed to identify the attitudes and perceptions of Gastroenterology Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the virtual interview experience and the role of virtual interviews (VI) in the future. METHODS: We designed separate surveys targeting PDs and applicants using the Qualtrics software. At the end of the interview season, we e-mailed both survey links to all PDs and requested that they forward the applicant survey to their interviewed candidates. Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with results presented as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 29.7% of PDs completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 46.5% of PDs to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. Yet, 69.1% envisioned a role for VI in the future. A total of 14.2% of applicants completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 42.3% of applicants to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. However, 61.8% saw a future role for VI. While both applicants and PDs reported that establishing an interpersonal connection was a disadvantage with VI, applicants placed more emphasis on this need for connection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, PDs and applicants report mixed views with regard to VI but anticipate that it may continue to have a future role. VI may augment future recruitment cycles with care taken to not disadvantage applicants, who rely heavily on the interview process to create personal connections with programs.","Hamade, Nour; Bhavsar-Burke, Indira; Jansson-Knodell, Claire; Wani, Sachin; Patel, Swati G; Ehrlich, Adam C; Paine, Elizabeth; Hosseini-Carroll, Pegah; Menard-Katcher, Paul; Fayad, Nabil",Dig. dis. sci,,154
407081,Impact of dexamethasone on SARS-CoV-2 concentration kinetics and antibody response in hospitalised COVID-19 patients - results from a prospective observational study,2021,"PURPOSE: Although much research has been done on accountable care organizations (ACOs), little is known about their impact on rural hospitals. We examine the association between rural hospitals' participation in an ACO and their performance on utilization and financial measures. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study estimates the relationship between voluntary ACO participation and hospital metrics using propensity score-matched, longitudinal regression models with year and hospital fixed effects. Regression models controlled for secular trends and time-varying hospital and county characteristics. Hospital measures were from the American Hospital Association, RAND Hospital Data, and Leavitt Partners. The initial population comprises 643 rural hospitals that participated in an ACO for at least one year during the 2011 to 2018 study period and 1,541 rural hospitals that did not participate in an ACO. From this population we created a sample of propensity score-matched hospitals consisting of 525 ACO-participating and 525 comparable non-ACO hospitals. RESULTS: Rural hospitals' participation in an ACO is not associated with changes in hospital utilization or financial measures, nor is there an association between these performance metrics and whether another within-county hospital participated in an ACO. A secondary analysis limited to Critical Access Hospitals provides some evidence that inpatient utilization increases in the second year of ACO participation, though the increases are not significant in year 3 and beyond. CONCLUSION: We find no evidence that rural hospitals experience substantive changes in outpatient visits, inpatient utilization, or operating margin in the years immediately after joining an ACO.","Comfort, Leeann N; Fulton, Brent D; Shortell, Stephen M",J. rural health,,154

Iron liberated from necrotic cells may catalyze free radical production and amplify lipid peroxidation causing membrane dysfunction and multiorgan failure. Consequently, iron chelators have been successfully utilized in various experimental and clinical models of cytokine storm and multiorgan damage, such as in ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis, and infections. Since viral replication may be influenced by iron accumulation, iron chelation has been proven beneficial in a variety of viral infections, such as HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, Mengovirus, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, Enterovirus 71, and West Nile virus. In this commentary, we elaborate on the idea of considering iron chelation as a therapeutic modality in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. For critically ill patients in the ICU, intravenous deferoxamine would provide sufficient and rapid iron chelation to ameliorate cytokine storm, whereas in less severe cases an oral chelator could prevent the development of excessive inflammatory response.","Vlahakos, Vassilios D; Marathias, Katerina P; Arkadopoulos, Nikolaos; Vlahakos, Demetrios V",Artif. organs,,154

407614,Successful Management of COVID-19 Infection in 2 Early Post-Liver Transplant Recipients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to protective behaviors is central to limiting the spread of COVID-19 and associated risk of serious illness and mortality in older populations. Whether cognition predicts adherence to protective behaviors has not been examined in older adults. AIMS: To examine whether specific cognitive abilities predict adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in older adults, independent of other relevant factors. METHODS: Data from 431 older adults (i.e., &#8805; 65 years) who took part in the COVID-19 module of the Health and Retirement Study were included in the present study. Separate binary logistic regression models were used to examine whether performance on measures of immediate and delayed recall and working memory predicted adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, controlling for demographics, level of COVID-19 concern, depressive symptoms, and medical conditions. RESULTS: For every unit increase in immediate and delayed recall, the probability of adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviors increased by 47% and 69%, respectively. There was no association between the measure of working memory and adherence. DISCUSSION: It is of public interest to understand the factors that reduce adherence to protective behaviors so that we can better protect those most vulnerable and limit community spread. Our findings demonstrate that reduced memory predicts non-adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, independent of virus concern, and other relevant demographic and health factors. CONCLUSIONS: Public health strategies aimed at increasing adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in community dwelling older adults, should account for the role of reduced cognitive function in limiting adherence.","O039,; Shea, Deirdre M; Davis, Jennifer D; Tremont, Geoffrey",Aging Clin Exp Res,,154
408074,Management and infection control practices in a Taiwanese radiology department during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"This article develops an agent-level stochastic simulation model, termed RAW-ALPS, for simulating the spread of an epidemic in a community. The mechanism of transmission is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported for the COVID-19 pandemic. When unconstrained, the agents follow independent random walks and catch infections due to physical proximity with infected agents. Under lockdown, an infected agent can only infect a coinhabitant, leading to a reduction in the spread. The main goal of the RAW-ALPS simulation is to help quantify the effects of preventive measures—timing and durations of lockdowns—on infections, fatalities, and recoveries. The model helps measure changes in infection rates and casualties due to the imposition and maintenance of restrictive measures. It considers three types of lockdowns: 1) whole population (except the essential workers), 2) only the infected agents, and 3) only the symptomatic agents. The results show that the most effective use of lockdown measures is when all infected agents, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are quarantined, while the uninfected agents are allowed to move freely. This result calls for regular and extensive testing of a population to isolate and restrict all infected agents. © Copyright © 2021 Srivastava.","Srivastava, A.",Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,,154

This study aimed to compare the success rates of vaginismus therapy with exposure therapy treatment using a finger or a dilator. The finger training group (FTG) (n = 30) and the dilator training group (DTG) (n = 30) were established. Groups were trained about dilatation and desensitization. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was applied. From the baseline measurement to the post-treatment measurement, the average change in FSFI scores for both groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference between two groups in terms of patient drop-out numbers (p = 0.016); the DTG was more successful in continuing treatment than the FTG. This research revealed that DTG is more successful in treatment continuity and show more improvement in sexual functions.","Aslan, Melike; Yavuzkir, Seyda; Baykara, Sema",J Sex Marital Ther,,154

415957,Inaugural 'global women in cardiology early careers' case competition in collaboration with EHJ - Case Reports,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has created unanticipated changes in health care delivery for people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkeyTM electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists' perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included ß-IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey, MS specialist physicians and other clinicians serving on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US reported profound changes in how they are delivering MS care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Morrison, Elizabeth H; Michtich, Katelyn; Hersh, Carrie M",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,154

Our research aims were to characterize the changepoint in the flow of the COVID-19 epidemic in each European country and to evaluate the association of the level of social distancing with the observed decline in the national epidemics. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in 28 European countries. Social distance index was calculated based on Google Community Mobility Reports. Changepoints were estimated by threshold regression, national findings were analyzed by Poisson regression, and the effect of social distancing in mixed effects Poisson regression model. Our findings identified the most probable changepoints in 28 European countries. Before changepoint, incidence of new COVID-19 cases grew by 24% per day on average. From the changepoint, this growth rate was reduced to 0.9%, 0.3% increase, and to 0.7% and 1.7% decrease by increasing social distancing quartiles. The beneficial effect of higher social distance quartiles (i.e., turning the increase into decline) was statistically significant for the fourth quartile. Notably, many countries in lower quartiles also achieved a flat epidemic curve. In these countries, other plausible COVID-19 containment measures could contribute to controlling the first wave of the disease. The association of social distance quartiles with viral spread could also be hindered by local bottlenecks in infection control. Our results allow for moderate optimism related to the gradual lifting of social distance measures in the general population, and call for specific attention to the protection of focal micro-societies enriching high-risk elderly subjects, including nursing homes and chronic care facilities.","Vokó, Zoltán; Pitter, János György",Geroscience,,154

Telehealth can increase the diversity of people who take part in research. This matters because most autism spectrum disorder studies have included people who have resources, are White, and live in North America and Europe. When study participants are similar, it is hard to understand which interventions can help different types of people who live in different parts of the world. While telehealth may allow more people to take part in research, it needs to ""fit"" the local context and consider the ""digital divide"" because many people around the world have no access to computers and the Internet. This short report describes changes to two research studies that include caregiver coaching based on the Early Start Denver Model in the United States and South Africa. We describe how the local context, including technology and Internet access, guided the telehealth approach. By doing so, we highlight ways to make telehealth available to more people around the world. The pandemic can help us understand how telehealth can ""fit"" diverse places and support high-quality research. It is important that study changes are tracked and we assess how well the changes work. COVID-19 telehealth changes to caregiver coaching can result in new ways to reach more people around the world.","Franz, Lauren; Howard, Jill; Viljoen, Marisa; Sikich, Linmarie; Chandrasekhar, Tara; Kollins, Scott H; Lee, Lawrence; Ndlovu, Minkateko; Sabatos-DeVito, Maura; Seris, Noleen; Shabalala, Nokuthula; Spanos, Marina; de Vries, Petrus J; Dawson, Geraldine",Autism,,154

Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. RESULTS: Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. CONCLUSIONS: Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources.","Kim, Andrew Wooyoung; Nyengerai, Tawanda; Mendenhall, Emily",Psychol Med,,154

Patients can develop a spectrum of cardiac diseases, from mild myocarditis to acute coronary syndrome with an impaired systolic fraction. We describe an interesting case of transient ST segment elevation in a COVID-19 patient admitted to ICU for severe respiratory distress syndrome. During his stay in ICU, the patient developed transient ST segment elevation in inferior-lateral leads which promptly resolved without requiring any additional invasive and/or pharmacological treatment. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a preserved ejection fraction without any regional abnormalities and the rise in enzyme biomarkers was insignificant. The case highlights the importance of avoiding invasive procedures in this subset of patients to reduce both patient complications and medical staff exposure. Careful evaluation including echocardiogram and second-line examinations should be performed before invasive and aggressive treatment is undertaken. LEARNING POINTS: Transient ST elevation may occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Early recognition is important to avoid unnecessary intervention or thrombolytic therapy.","Tuaima, Tareq; Kinsara, Abdulhalim J; Alrajawi, Amtalkhaliq; Allam, Hassan H; Alfakih, Shadwan",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,,154

A major portion of the population has become susceptible to this strain. Scientists are pushing their limits to formulate a vaccine against Covid-19 with the least side effects. Although the recent discoveries of vaccines have shown some relief from the covid infection rate, however, physical fatigue, mental abnormalities, inflammation and other multiple organ damages are arising as post-Covid symptoms. The long-term effects of these symptoms are massive. Patients with such symptoms are known as long-haulers and treatment strategy against this condition is still unknown. In this study, we tried to explore a strategy to deal with the post-Covid symptoms. We targeted three human proteins namely ACE2, Interleukin-6, Transmembrane serine protease and NRP1 which are already reported to be damaged via Covid-19 proteins and upregulated in the post-Covid stage. Our target plant in this study is Cannabis (popularly known as 'Ganja' in India). The molecular docking and simulation studies revealed that Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabivarin (CVN) obtained from Cannabis can bind to post-Covid symptoms related central nervous system (CNS) proteins and downregulate them which can be beneficial in post-covid symptoms treatment strategy. Thus we propose Cannabis as an important therapeutic plant against post-Covid symptoms.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

447404,Assessing 2019-nCoV Risk to Healthcare Workers: Forty healthcare workers infected in Chinese hospital,2020,"Over the past several decades, studies have demonstrated the existence of bi-directional relationships between periodontal disease and systemic conditions. Periodontitis is a polymicrobial and multifactorial disease involving both host and environmental factors. Tissue destruction is primarily associated with hyperresponsiveness of the host resulting in release of inflammatory mediators. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role in bacterial stimulation and tissue destruction. In addition, these cytokines are thought to underlie the associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions. Current research suggests that increased release of cytokines from host cells, referred to as the cytokine storm, is associated with disease progression in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An intersection between periodontitis and pulmonary disease is biologically plausible. Hence, we reviewed the evidence linking COVID-19, cytokines, and periodontal disease. Plaque control is essential to prevent exchange of bacteria between the mouth and the lungs, reducing the risk of lung disease. Understanding these associations may help identify individuals at high risk and deliver appropriate care at early stages.","Sukumar, Kanchana; Tadepalli, Anupama",J Int Med Res,,154

Viral infections are known to be associated with coagulation impairment; thus, thrombosis, hemorrhage, or both may occur. Understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development of coagulation disorders during viral infection is essential for the development of therapeutic strategies. Coagulopathy in COVID-19 infection is emerging as a precipitant factor for severe respiratory complications and death. An increase in coagulation markers, such as fibrinogen and D-dimer, has been found in severe COVID-19 cases. Heparin, clinically used as an anticoagulant, also has anti-inflammatory properties, including binding of inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, and protection of endothelial cells, and a potential antiviral effect. We hypothesized that low-molecular-weight heparin may attenuate cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients; therefore, low-molecular-weight heparin could be a valid adjunctive therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy. In this paper, we review potential mechanisms involved in coagulation impairment after viral infection and the possible role of heparin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Costanzo, Luca; Palumbo, Francesco Paolo; Ardita, Giorgio; Antignani, Pier Luigi; Arosio, Enrico; Failla, Giacomo",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,,154

This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw",Public Health Nutr,,154

467036,A clinical analysis of extrapulmonary complications in novel coronavirus pneumonia patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patient age is one of the most salient clinical indicators of risk from COVID-19. Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for many regions. Less attention has been given to the age distributions of serious medical interventions administered to COVID-19 patients, which could reveal sources of potential pressure on the healthcare system should SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increase, and could inform mass vaccination strategies. The aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 patient age and serious outcomes of the disease, beyond fatalities alone. METHODS: We analysed 277,555 known SARS-CoV-2 infection records for Ontario, Canada, from 23 January 2020 to 16 February 2021 and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: The distribution of hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 60-90, whereas deaths are concentrated in ages 80+. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known infection reaches a maximum of 27.8% at age 80 (95% CI 26.0%-29.7%). The probability of survival given hospitalization is nearly 100% for adults younger than 40, but declines substantially after this age; for example, a hospitalized 54-year-old patient has a 91.7% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 88.3%-94.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant need for hospitalization in middle-aged individuals and young seniors. This need is not captured by the distribution of deaths, which is heavily concentrated in very old ages. The probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 is lower than is generally perceived for patients over 40. If acute care capacity is exceeded due to an increase in COVID-19 prevalence, the distribution of deaths could expand toward younger ages. These results suggest that vaccine programs should aim to prevent infection not only in old seniors, but also in young seniors and middle-aged individuals, to protect them from serious illness and to limit stress on the healthcare system.","Papst, Irena; Li, Michael; Champredon, David; Bolker, Benjamin M; Dushoff, Jonathan; D Earn, David J",BMC Public Health,,154

Healthcare monitoring has already been transformed by such devices, with notable recent applications including heart rate monitoring in smartwatches and COVID-19 lateral flow diagnostic test kits. The commercial success and impact of existing optical sensors has galvanized research in expanding its application in numerous disciplines. Drug detection and monitoring seeks to benefit from the fast-approaching wave of optical biosensors, with diverse applications ranging from illicit drug testing, clinical trials, monitoring in advanced drug delivery systems and personalized drug dosing. The latter has the potential to significantly improve patients' lives by minimizing toxicity and maximizing efficacy. To achieve this, the patient's serum drug levels must be frequently measured. Yet, the current method of obtaining such information, namely therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is not routinely practiced as it is invasive, expensive, time-consuming and skilled labor-intensive. Certainly, optical sensors possess the capabilities to challenge this convention. This review explores the current state of optical biosensors in personalized dosing with special emphasis on TDM, and provides an appraisal on recent strategies. The strengths and challenges of optical biosensors are critically evaluated, before concluding with perspectives on the future direction of these sensors.","Ong, Jun Jie; Pollard, Thomas D; Goyanes, Alvaro; Gaisford, Simon; Elbadawi, Mohammed; Basit, Abdul W",Biosens Bioelectron,,154

When regular operating returns, there will be a large volume of patients and an emphasis on a short hospital stay. Patients will be keen to return home, and capacity will need to maximised. Strategies to reduce the associated risks of surgery and to accelerate recovery will be needed, and so Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) should be promoted as the model of care. ERAS protocols are proven to reduce hospital stay safely; however, ERAS pathways may require adaption to ensure both patient and staff safety. The risk of exposure to possible sources of COVID-19 should be limited, and so hospital visits should be minimised. The use of technology such as smartphone apps to provide pre-operative education, wearable activity trackers to assist with rehabilitation, and the use of telemedicine to complete outpatient appointments may be utilised. Also, units should be reminded that ERAS protocols are multi-modal, and every component is vital to minimise the surgical stress response. The focus should be on providing better and not just faster care. Units should learn from the past in order to expedite the implementation of or adaption of existing ERAS protocols.

SETTING: Wuhan, China. METHODS: 35 co-infected patients were identified by matching the reported cases in National Notifiable Infectious Disease Report system for COVID-19 and HIV in Wuhan by time of April 19, 2020. Questionnaire-based survey and follow-up with blood sample collection were used to obtain characteristics before COVID-19 and after recovery. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, Mcnemar test and Wilcoxon test were conducted. RESULTS: Twenty of the 35 co-infected patients were identified as asymptomatic/mild/moderate COVID-19 (non-severe group) and 15 were identified as severe/critical (severe group). The severe and non-severe group had no differences in demographics, HIV baseline status, the intervals between last tests and follow-up tests for CD4+ cell count and HIV-1 viral load (all P>0.05). Overall, there was a significantly increased number of co-infected patients with HIV-1 viral load &#8805;20 copies/mL after recovery (P=0.008). The median viral load increased significantly after recovery in severe group (P=0.034) while no significant change of HIV-1 viral load was observed in non-severe group. Limited change of CD4+ cell count was found (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 might put PLHIV at greater risk for HIV-1 viral rebound especially for severe/critical COVID-19 while had limited impacts on CD4+ cell count. Whether continuous ART against HIV infection would have significant impacts on CD4+ cell count among PLHIV co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 need further research.","Hu, Rong; Yan, Han; Liu, Manqing; Tang, Li; Kong, Wenhua; Zhu, Zerong; Liu, Pan; Bai, Wenjuan; Hu, Xuejiao; Ding, Jie; Wang, Xia; Xie, Nianhua",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,154

A cross-sectional community sample (N = 2,329) was gathered to assess community cohesion buffering against heath anxiety and perceived stress during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, using structural equation modeling analyses. Community cohesion acted as a protective mechanism against both health anxiety and stress during the first national lockdown. A strong positive association was also found between health anxiety and stress. Stress and health anxiety scores peaked in the first weeks of the imposed quarantine; as the lockdown was extended, participants reported lower stress, health anxiety and community cohesion scores. The reduction of community cohesion scores was greater for those younger than 45 while the positive association between stress and health anxiety was stronger among males during the lockdown. While community cohesion effects against health anxiety were enhanced for females, community's buffering against stress were greater for males. Strengthening citizens' psychological sense of community through the publicization and support of local initiatives and mutual-aid groups and utilizing methodically green (and blue) spaces to boost neighborhood attraction might be viable strategies within which stress and health anxiety can be suppressed. Conversely, allowing community, regional and national cracks to deepen can exacerbate the impact of stressful events experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Svensson, Sarah Jane; Elntib, Stamatis",,,154

This case-series study was conducted at Phoebe Putney Health System. Participants were confirmed Covid-19 patients admitted to our health system between March 2, 2020 and June 7, 2020. Data were collected from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with and without elevated cTnI. The cTnI were further divided in 4 tertiles. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for demographics, baseline comorbidities, and laboratory parameters including D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Out of 309 patients, 116 (37.5%) had elevated cTnI. Those with elevated cTnI were older (59.9 vs. 68.2 years, p <0.001), and more likely to be males (53.5% vs. 36.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.003). Elevated cTnI group had higher baseline comorbidities. After multivariable adjustment, overall mortality was significantly higher in elevated cTnI group (37.9% vs. 11.4%, odds ratio:4.45; confidence interval:1.78 to 11.14, p <0.001). Need for intubation, dialysis, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer was higher in elevated cTnI group. Among those with elevated cTnI, mortality was 23.2% for 50th percentile, 48.4% for 75th percentile, and 55.2% for 100th percentile. Similarly, further increase in cTnI was associated with a higher need for intubation, dialysis, and ICU transfer. In conclusion, myocardial injury occurs in significant proportion of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes, with higher values associated with worse outcomes.","Shah, Priyank; Doshi, Rajkumar; Chenna, Avantika; Owens, Robin; Cobb, Abigail; Ivey, Holley; Newton, Sarah; Mccarley, Kelly",Am J Cardiol,,154
474790,COVID-19 and kidney transplantation: Results from the TANGO International Transplant Consortium,2020,"CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 18 million people worldwide and the pandemic is still spreading. After the first case we reported, we observed 4 additional cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to describe additional cases of SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to alert physicians that SAT may be a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We describe clinical, biochemical, and imaging features of 4 patients with SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: All patients were female (age, 29-46 years). SAT developed 16 to 36 days after the resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neck pain radiated to the jaw and palpitations were the main presenting symptoms and were associated with fever and asthenia. One patient was hospitalized because of atrial fibrillation. Thyroid function tests (available for 3 individuals) were suggestive of destructive thyroiditis, and inflammatory markers were high. At neck ultrasound the thyroid was enlarged, with diffuse and bilateral hypoechoic areas and (in 3 patients) absent vascularization at color Doppler. Symptoms disappeared a few days after commencement of treatment (prednisone in 3 patients and ibuprofen in 1). Six weeks after the onset of SAT, all patients were asymptomatic and inflammatory markers had returned to normal range. Two patients were euthyroid, whereas 2 were diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: SAT may be an underestimated manifestation of COVID-19. Clinicians should keep in mind the possible occurrence of SAT during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Brancatella, Alessandro; Ricci, Debora; Cappellani, Daniele; Viola, Nicola; Sgrò, Daniele; Santini, Ferruccio; Latrofa, Francesco",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,154

METHODS: We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 relapsing-remitting MS patients, who underwent blinded clinical and 3T-MRI evaluations for 4 years. Groups with (EDA) or without (NEDA) evidence of disease activity (occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, EDSS change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated. RESULTS: Fortyone patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFNÎ³, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT and APRIL (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (HR=1.35, p=0.0002), LIGHT (HR=1.22, p=0.005) and APRIL (HR=1.78, p=0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model including CSF variables predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C-index at 4 years= 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (ß=4.7*10-4 ,p<0.001), TNF (ß=3.1*10-3 ,p=0.004), LIGHT (ß=2.6*10-4 ,p=0.003), sCD163 (ß=4.3*10-3 ,p=0.009) and TWEAK (ß=3.4*10-3 ,p=0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning. INTERPRETATION: A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B-cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage. The CSF analysis may allow stratifications of patients at diagnosis for optimizing therapeutic approaches. This article is protected by copyright.

A total of 139 patients with COVID-19 were investigated at Siirt State Hospital. According to the disease severity, the patients were categorized as three groups (moderate: 85, severe: 54, and critical: 20). Then, patients were divided into two groups: nonsevere (moderate) and severe (severe and critical). Demographic, clinical data, and routine blood parameters were analyzed. In multivariate model adjusted for potential confounders BUN/Cr ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.40; P = .002) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.20-4.30; P < .001) were independent predictive factors for disease severity. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model BUN/Cr ratio (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05; P = .030), and NLR (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06-1.30; P = .020) were independent predictors for survival of COVID-19 disease. The optimal thresholds of the BUN/Cr ratio at 33.5 and 51.7 had the superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, area under the curve (AUC) were 0.98 and 0.95, respectively. The optimal thresholds of NLR at 3.27 and 5.72 had a superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, AUC were 0.87 and 0.85, respectively.

476560,Traditional Chinese Medicine guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), excessive amounts of quinolinic acid (QUIN) accumulate within the brain parenchyma and dystrophic neurons. QUIN also regulates glutamate uptake into neurons, which may be due to modulation of Na+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). To determine the biological relationships between QUIN and glutamate dysfunction, we first quantified the functionality and kinetics of [3H]QUIN uptake in primary human neurons using liquid scintillation. We then measured changes in the protein expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT3 and EAAT1b in primary neurons treated with QUIN and the EAAT inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDC) using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was further used to elucidate intracellular transport of exogenous QUIN and the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Structural insights into the binding between QUIN and EAAT3 were further investigated using molecular docking techniques. We report significant temperature-dependent high-affinity transport leading to neuronal uptake of [3H]QUIN with a Km of 42.2 µM, and a Vmax of 9.492 pmol/2 min/mg protein, comparable with the uptake of glutamate. We also found that QUIN increases expression of the EAAT3 monomer while decreasing the functional trimer. QUIN uptake into primary neurons was shown to involve EAAT3 as uptake was significantly attenuated following EAAT inhibition. We also demonstrated that QUIN increases the expression of aberrant EAAT1b protein in neurons further implicating QUIN-induced glutamate dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that QUIN is metabolised exclusively in lysosomes. The involvement of EAAT3 as a modulator for QUIN uptake was further confirmed using molecular docking. This study is the first to characterise a mechanism for QUIN uptake into primary human neurons involving EAAT3, opening potential targets to attenuate QUIN-induced excitotoxicity in neuroinflammatory diseases.","Braidy, Nady; Alicajic, Hayden; Pow, David; Smith, Jason; Jugder, Bat-Erdene; Brew, Bruce J; Nicolazzo, Joseph A; Guillemin, Gilles J",Mol.

477361,Covid-19 (Sars-Cov-2 Infection) Information for Patients with Predialytic Chronic Kidney Disease,2020,"Belt conveyors are used for transporting bulk materials over distances. The core of the belt, by transferring the longitudinal stresses and ensuring proper frictional coupling of the belt, enables belt movement and transportation of materials on its surface. As the belt cover and edges are used, the belt becomes abraded, and the core is subject to fatigue. The result is the development of cracks in rubber covers across the belt, which leads to the development of damage not only along the cables (the natural direction of water migration and corrosion) but also in the direction transverse to the belt axis. Conducting a series of scans of the St-type belt operating in one of the underground copper ore mines in Poland allowed identifying the number of failures as well as their size and changes over time. These data were in turn used to determine the measures defining the condition of the belt such as the density of defects (the number of defects per 1 m of the belt), the density of the area of damage (the area of damage per 1 m of the belt) and the change in the average area of a single defect over time. By determining the regression of these measures in time and the rate of damage development in both directions (along the axis of the belt and across the belt), it was possible to forecast future states of the belt, as well as to evaluate the costs of different belt replacement strategies and the economic rationalization of the decision to replace them. This research has become possible owing to the development of the DiagBelt system for two-dimensional imaging of the damage to the core of steel-cord belts with resolution sufficiently high to allow tracking the development of single core defects.","Blazej, Ryszard; Jurdziak, Leszek; Kirjanow-Blazej, Agata; Kozlowski, Tomasz",Sci Rep,,154

DESIGN: A follow-up online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Among the 1,600 baseline online survey participants, 388 adults were already frail, and 275 older adults did not respond to the follow-up survey. Thus, the final number of participants in this study was 937 (follow-up rate: 77.3%). METHODS: We assessed the total PA time at four time points according to the COVID-19 waves in Japan: January 2020 (before the pandemic), April 2020 (during the first wave), August 2020 (during the second wave), and January 2021 (during the third wave). We then investigated the incidence of frailty during a one-year follow-up period (during the pandemic). RESULTS: The total PA time during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic decreased from the pre-pandemic PA time by 33.3%, 28.3%, and 40.0%, respectively. In particular, the total PA time of older adults who were living alone and socially inactive decreased significantly: 42.9% (first wave), 50.0% (second wave), and 61.9% (third wave) less than before the pandemic, respectively. Additionally, they were at a significantly higher risk of incident frailty than those who were not living alone and were socially active (adjusted odds ratio: 2.04 [95% confidence interval: 1.01-4.10]). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that older adults who live alone and are socially inactive are more likely to experience incident frailty/disability due to decreased PA during the pandemic. Understanding this mechanism may be crucial for maintaining the health status of older adults.","Yamada, M; Kimura, Y; Ishiyama, D; Otobe, Y; Suzuki, M; Koyama, S; Kikuchi, T; Kusumi, H; Arai, H",J Nutr Health Aging,,154

Recommendations for COVID-19 clinical management",2020,"At the time of writing of this article, there have been over 110 million cases and 2.4 million deaths worldwide since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, postponing millions of non-urgent surgeries. Existing literature explores the complexities of rationing medical care. However, implications of non-urgent surgery postponement during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been analyzed within the context of the four pillars of medical ethics. The objective of this review is to discuss the ethics of elective surgery cancellation during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy. This review hypothesizes that a more equitable decision-making algorithm can be formulated by analyzing the ethical dilemmas of elective surgical care during the pandemic through the lens of these four pillars. This paper's analysis shows that non-urgent surgeries treat conditions that can become urgent if left untreated. Postponement of these surgeries can cause cumulative harm downstream. An improved algorithm can address these issues of beneficence by weighing local pandemic stressors within predictive algorithms to appropriately increase surgeries. Additionally, the potential harms of performing non-urgent surgeries extend beyond the patient. Non-maleficence is maintained through using enhanced screening protocols and modifying surgical techniques to reduce risks to patients and clinicians. This model proposes a system to transfer patients from areas of high to low burden, addressing the challenge of justice by considering facility burden rather than value judgments concerning the nature of a particular surgery, such as cosmetic surgeries. Autonomy can be respected by giving patients the option to cancel or postpone non-urgent surgeries. However, in the context of limited resources in a global pandemic, autonomy is not absolute. Non-urgent surgeries can ethically be postponed in opposition to the patient's preference. The proposed algorithm attempts to uphold the four principles of medical ethics in rationing non-urgent surgical care by building upon existing decision models, using additional measures of resource burden and surgical safety to increase health care access and decrease long-term harm as much as possible. The next global health crisis will undoubtedly present its own unique challenges. This model may serve as a comprehensive starting point in determining future guidelines for non-urgent surgical care.","Brown, N.

This problem can be formulated as a penalized maximum likelihood estimation of the precision matrix under Laplacian structural constraints. Like in the classical graphical lasso problem, recent works made use of the $\ell_1$-norm regularization with the goal of promoting sparsity in Laplacian structural precision matrix estimation. However, we find that the widely used $\ell_1$-norm is not effective in imposing a sparse solution in this problem. Through empirical evidence, we observe that the number of nonzero graph weights grows with the increase of the regularization parameter. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a large regularization parameter will surprisingly lead to a fully connected graph. To address this issue, we propose a nonconvex estimation method by solving a sequence of weighted $\ell_1$-norm penalized sub-problems and prove that the statistical error of the proposed estimator matches the minimax lower bound. To solve each sub-problem, we develop a projected gradient descent algorithm that enjoys a linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments involving synthetic and real-world data sets from the recent COVID-19 pandemic and financial stock markets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

After the primary influenza infection, the innate immune system is attenuated, and the susceptibility to bacteria is increased. Subsequent bacterial pneumonia exacerbates morbidity and increases the mortality rate. Similarly, COVID-19 infection attenuates innate immunity and results in pneumonia. In addition, the current pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may have limited defense against secondary pneumococcal infection after influenza infection. Therefore, until a fully protective vaccine is available, a method of increasing immunity may be helpful. Ginseng has been shown to increase the defense against influenza in clinical trials and animal experiments, as well as the defense against pneumococcal pneumonia in animal experiments.

Despite their importance, the study of membrane proteins has been significantly limited by the difficulties inherent to their successful expression, purification, and stabilization once they have been extracted from the cell membrane. In addition, expression of human membrane proteins commonly requires the use of expensive and/or time-consuming eukaryotic systems, hence their successful expression in bacteria will be obviously beneficial for experimental research. Furthermore, since lipids can have critical effects on the activity of membrane proteins and given the composition similarities between the inner mitochondrial membrane and the bacterial plasma membrane, production of mitochondrial membrane proteins in E. coli represents a logical choice. Here, we present a novel protocol to produce a human mitochondrial ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter in E. coli. The function of the three known human mitochondrial ABC transporters is not fully understood, but X-ray crystallography models of ABCB10 produced in insect cells are available. We have successfully expressed and purified ABCB10 from E. coli. The yield is close to that of another bacterial ABC transporter routinely produced in our laboratory under similar conditions. In addition, we can efficiently reconstitute detergent purified ABCB10 into lipid nanodiscs. Measurements of ATPase activity of ABCB10 produced in E. coli show an ATP hydrolysis rate similar to other human ABC transporters. This novel protocol facilitates the production of this human mitochondrial transporter for biochemical, structural, and functional analysis, and can likely be adjusted for production of other mitochondrial transporters.","Saxberg, Alexandra D; Martinez, Melissa; Fendley, Gregory A; Zoghbi, Maria E",Protein Expr Purif,,154

However, the number of deaths in Japan has remained very low. Japan also stands out for the relatively low incidence of viral transmission in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) compared to both European countries and the United States. We argue that Japan's institutional decision to lockdown Long-Term Care facilities as early as mid-February - weeks earlier than most European countries and the US - contributed to lowering the number of deaths in LTCFs. We highlight a few lessons from the Japanese experience: (i) the presence of hierarchically organized government agencies whose sole missions are elderly care; (ii) the presence of effective communication channels between LTCFs and the regulatory authorities; and (iii) the well-established routine protocols of prevention and control in LTCFs.","Estévez-Abe, Margarita; Ide, Hiroo",J Aging Soc Policy,,154

Severe respiratory syndrome SARS-COV-2 leads to Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and has the capability of transmission through human-to-human and surface-to-human transmission leads the world to catastrophic phase. Computational system based biological signal analysis helps medical officers in handling COVID-19 tasks like ECG monitoring at Intensive care, fatal ventricular fibrillation, etc., This paper is on diagnosing heart dysfunctions such as tachycardia, bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrhythmia using fuzzy relations and artificial intelligence algorithm. In this study, the heart pulse base signal and features like spectral entropy, largest lyapunov exponent, Poincare plot and detrended fluctuation analysis are extracted and presented for classification purpose. The RR intervals of Poincare plot summarize RR time series obtained from an ECG in one picture, and a time interval quantities derives information duration of HRV. This analysis eases the prediction of heart rate fluctuation due to Covid or other heart disorders. The better accuracy level in diagnosing heart pulse irregularity using Artificial Neural network(ANN) is an integer value (0 to 4)but for Fuzzy Classifier, it is 0.8 to 0.9.The processing time for analyzing heart dysfunctionalties is 0.05s using ANN which is far better than Fuzzy classifier.","Nivethitha, T; Kumar Palanisamy, Satheesh; Mohanaprakash, K; Jeevitha, K",,,154

Currently, no licensed vaccines, drugs, or biologics have been confirmed to be absolutely effective in prophylaxis or treatment of this novel infection. Therefore, the treatment of this highly contagious disease remains a global concern and emergency. The viral interference is a competition phenomenon by which a primary virus infecting a cell prohibits the infection of the same cell by another (secondary) virus. The phenomenon has recently been indicated to be exploited for antiviral strategies. This strategy, particularly when there is no efficient drug against a viral infection, is of high importance. Some researchers have studied the application of the phenomenon among different viruses. In this paper, I discussed the possibility of the application of interference phenomenon in prophylaxis of the disease.","Ahmadi, M. H.",Bioimpacts,,154

While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 879 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and May 26th, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients' initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: admission to intensive care, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 129 of 879 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 878 (7%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 193 of 619 (31%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) scores of 0.76 to 0.87 (F1 scores of 0.42-0.60). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient's oxygen supply and selected laboratory results, such as blood lactate and creatinine levels, were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient's first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","Heldt, Frank S; Vizcaychipi, Marcela P; Peacock, Sophie; Cinelli, Mattia; McLachlan, Lachlan; Andreotti, Fernando; Jovanovic, Stojan; Dürichen, Robert; Lipunova, Nadezda; Fletcher, Robert A; Hancock, Anne; McCarthy, Alex; Pointon, Richard A; Brown, Alexander; Eaton, James; Liddi, Roberto; Mackillop, Lucy; Tarassenko, Lionel; Khan, Rabia T",Sci Rep,,154

METHODS: Each CT was recorded, and the validity of the repeated CTs was assessed. RESULTS: The 394 patients underwent a total of 1493 CTs. Of the 394 patients, 260 received at least one non-value-added CT. Both the total number of CTs (median, 4; interquartile range (IQR), 3-5) and non-value-added CTs (median, 1; IQR, 0-1) per patient were strongly related to the disease duration (R2 = 0.566 for total CTs, R2 = 0.432 for non-value-added CTs, p < 0.001). The proportion of non-value-added CTs was potentially higher after 3 weeks from symptom onset (>35%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high rate of repeat CTs for the COVID-19 patients, and the proportion of non-value-added CTs increased with disease duration. Follow-up CT should be avoided without clinical decline.

It does this by examining a particular episode, involving spaces of educating, that reveals this support through its undermining: the sudden rushes to home and online teaching that university instructors in the US underwent in the spring of 2020. Part one of the essay outlines a practice theoretical account of the spaces of social life according to which there are three principal spaces of sociality: material spaces, activity spatialities, and places. Part Two uses this account to diagnose spatial challenges that instructors faced that spring when they suddenly found themselves at home teaching. The contrast between what happened then and normal educating at universities makes clear just how crucial diverse spatial features of social life can be to the successful carrying on of education practices. The conclusion points out that this episode also affirms that one form of continuing education for educators is becoming conscious of, better appreciating, and acting on things they already know.

511549,Minimal change disease and acute kidney injury following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,2021,"BACKGROUND: The lack of consensus criteria of acute on chronic kidney injury (ACKI) affects the judgment for its clinical prognosis. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the data from 711,615 hospitalized adults who had at least 2 serum creatinine (SCr) tests within 30 days. We estimated the reference change value (RCV) of SCr given initial SCr level in adults without known risks of acute kidney injury other than chronic kidney disease (CKD). We proposed a criterion for ACKI based on the RCV of SCr (cROCK), which defined ACKI as a &#8805;25% increase in SCr in 7 days. We validated cROCK by its association with the risks of in-hospital mortality, death after discharge, and CKD progression in a large cohort of patients with CKD stage 3. RESULTS: In 21,661 patients with CKD stage 3, a total of 3,145 (14.5%), 1,512 (7.0%), and 221 (1.0%) ACKI events were detected by both cROCK and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), cROCK only, and KDIGO only, respectively. cROCK detected 40% more ACKI events than KDIGO. Compared with patients without ACKI by both definitions, those with cROCK- but not KDIGO-defined ACKI had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 5.53; 95% CI 3.75-8.16), death after discharge (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21-1.83), and CKD progression (OR 5.65; 95% CI 3.05-10.48). CONCLUSIONS: RCV-based criterion (cROCK) for ACKI is clinically valid in that it has a substantially improved sensitivity in identifying patients with high risk of adverse outcomes.","Xu, Xin; Wang, Long; Xiong, Mengqi; Nie, Sheng; Liu, Zhangsuo; Feng, Yunlin; Chen, Chunbo; Zha, Yan; Ou, Jun; Ge, Shuwang; Chen, Jianghua; Wan, Qijun; Teng, Siyuan; Hao, Chuan-Ming; Liu, Bi-Cheng; Xu, Anping; Feng, Jian-Hua; Zhang, Aihua; Mao, Jianhua; Liu, Hai-Peng; Liang, Huiying; Shen, Qian; Feng, Shipin; Zhou, Wei; Liu, Xuemei; Yang, Yonghong; Tao, Yuhong; Wang, Mo; Wang, Li-Jun; Qi, Jin-Lei; Li, Yanqin; Su, Licong; Hou, Fan Fan",Am J Nephrol,,154

513785,Mechanism of Dayuanyin in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 based on network pharmacology and molecular docking,2020,"BACKGROUND: Rintatolimod is a selective TLR3 agonist, which has demonstrated clinical activity for ME/CFS in Phase II and Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A hypothesis-based post-hoc analysis of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population diagnosed with ME/CFS from 12 independent clinical sites of a Phase III trial was performed to evaluate the effect of rintatolimod therapy based on disease duration. The clinical activity of rintatolimod was evaluated by exercise treadmill tolerance (ETT) using a modified Bruce protocol. The ITT population (n = 208) was divided into two subsets of symptom duration. Patients with symptom duration of 2-8 years were identified as the Target Subset (n = 75); the remainder (<2 year plus >8 year) were identified as the Non-Target Subset (n = 133). Placebo-adjusted percentage improvements in exercise duration and the vertical rise for the Target Subset (n = 75) were more than twice that of the ITT population. The Non-Target Subset (n = 133) failed to show any clinically significant ETT response to rintatolimod when compared to placebo. Within the Target Subset, 51.2% of rintatolimod-treated patients improved their exercise duration by &#8805;25% (p = 0.003) despite reduced statistical power from division of the original ITT population into two subsets. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of ETT from a Phase III trial has identified within the ITT population, a subset of ME/CFS patients with &#8805;2 fold increased exercise response to rintatolimod. Substantial improvement in physical performance was seen for the majority (51.2%) of these severely debilitated patients who improved exercise duration by &#8805;25%. This magnitude of exercise improvement was associated with clinically significant enhancements in quality of life. The data indicate that ME/CFS patients have a relatively short disease duration window (<8 years) to expect a significant response to rintatolimod under the dosing conditions utilized in this Phase III clinical trial. These results may have direct relevance to the cognitive impairment and fatigue being experienced by patients clinically recovered from COVID-19 and free of detectable SARS-CoV-2.

514919,Safety of Endoscopy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China has dispersed rapidly worldwide. Although most patients present with mild fever, cough with varying pulmonary shadows, a significant portion still develops severe respiratory dysfunction. And these severe cases are often associated with manifestations outside the respiratory tract. Currently, it is not difficult to find inflammatory cytokines upregulated in the blood of infected patients. However, some complications in addition to respiratory system with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are impossible to explain or cannot be attributed to virus itself. Thus excessive cytokines and their potentially fatal adverse effects are probably the answer to the multiple organ dysfunctions and growing mortality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying cytokine storm, summarizes its pathophysiology and improves understanding of cytokine storm associated with coronavirus infections by comparing SARS-CoV-2 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Zhao, Zhongyi; Wei, Yinhao; Tao, Chuanmin",Clin Immunol,,154

Hence, we aim to evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 related cardiovascular complications and secondary infection and their possibility as potential triggers for the stroke. METHODS: Data from observational studies describing the complications [acute cardiac injury (ACI), cardiac arrhythmias (CA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic shock, secondary infection] and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, were extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Adverse outcomes defined as intensive care units, oxygen saturation less than 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation, severe disease, and in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were obtained, and forest plots were created using random-effects models. A short review of these complications as triggers of stroke was conducted. RESULTS: 16 studies with 3480 confirmed COVID-19 patients, prevalence of ACI [38%vs5.9%], CA [26%vs5.3%], DIC [4%vs0.74%], septic shock [18%vs0.36%], and infection [30%vs12.5%] was higher among patients with poor outcomes. In meta-analysis, ACI [aOR:9.93(95%CI:3.95-25.00], CA [7.52(3.29-17.18)], DIC [7.36(1.24-43.73)], septic shock [30.12(7.56-120.10)], and infection [10.41(4.47-24.27)] had higher odds of adverse outcomes. Patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, had complications like pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism, DIC, etc. and had poor outcomes CONCLUSION: The complications like acute cardiac injury, cardiac arrhythmias, DIC, septic shock, and secondary infection had poor outcomes. Patients with stroke were having history of these complications. Long term monitoring is required in such patients to prevent stroke and mitigate adverse outcomes.","Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti; Mehta, Deep; Rajput, Priyanka; Shrivastava, Mashu; Naveed, Madiha; Urhoghide, Eseosa; Martin, Mehwish; Somi, Shamima; Jaiswal, Richa; Patel, Achint; Israni, Avantika; Singh, Jagmeet; Kichloo, Asim; Shah, Shamik; Lunagariya, Abhishek",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,154

519377,Complications of Coronavirus in a Patient with Cvid,2020,"PURPOSE: The RSNA expert consensus statement and CO-RADS reporting system assist radiologists in describing lung imaging findings in a standardized manner in patients under investigation for COVID-19 pneumonia and provide clarity in communication with other healthcare providers. We aim to compare diagnostic performance and inter-/intra-observer among chest radiologists in the interpretation of RSNA and CO-RADS reporting systems and assess clinician preference. METHODS: Chest CT scans of 279 patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent RT-PCR testing were retrospectively and independently examined by 3 chest radiologists who assigned interpretation according to the RSNA and CO-RADS reporting systems. Inter-/intra-observer analysis was performed. Diagnostic accuracy of both reporting systems was calculated. 60 clinicians participated in a survey to assess end-user preference of the reporting systems. RESULTS: Both systems demonstrated almost perfect inter-observer agreement (Fleiss kappa 0.871, P < 0.0001 for RSNA; 0.876, P < 0.0001 for CO-RADS impressions). Intra-observer agreement between the 2 scoring systems using the equivalent categories was almost perfect (Fleiss kappa 0.90-0.92, P < 0.001). Positive predictive values were high, 0.798-0.818 for RSNA and 0.891-0.903 CO-RADS. Negative predictive value were similar, 0.573-0.585 for RSNA and 0.573-0.58 for CO-RADS. Specificity differed between the 2 systems, 68-73% for CO-RADS and 52-58% for RSNA with superior specificity of CO-RADS. Of 60 survey participants, the majority preferred the RSNA reporting system rather than CO-RADS for all options provided (66.7-76.7%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RSNA and CO-RADS reporting systems are consistent and reproducible with near perfect inter-/intra-observer agreement and excellent positive predictive value. End-users preferred the reporting language in the RSNA system.","O039,; Neill, Siobhan B; Byrne, Danielle; Müller, Nestor L; Jalal, Sabeena; Parker, William; Nicolaou, Savvas; Bilawich, Ana-Maria",Can Assoc Radiol J,,154

This study is aimed at evaluating serum chemerin, lipocalin 2, and apelin concentrations in GDM and healthy pregnant patients, assessing the correlation between these adipokines, and suggesting the potential role of these cytokines in the diagnosis and pathophysiology of GDM. The study comprised 237 pregnant women: 153 with GDM and 84 with physiological pregnancy. Serum concentrations of chemerin, lipocalin 2, and apelin were obtained at 24-29 weeks of gestation. The mean concentrations of chemerin and lipocalin 2 were significantly higher in the GDM group. The concentration of apelin was slightly higher in the GDM group, but not statistically significant. The strong positive correlation between chemerin and lipocalin 2 concentrations was noticed in both groups. Our data suggest that maternal chemerin and lipocalin 2 may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of GDM. We imply that these adipokines could potentially be established as novel biomarkers for the early identification of GDM. However, more studies are needed to analyze the effect of these adipokines on glucose metabolism during early pregnancy.","Mierzynski, Radzislaw; Poniedzialek-Czajkowska, Elzbieta; Dluski, Dominik; Kaminski, Maciej; Mierzynska, Agnieszka; Leszczynska-Gorzelak, Bozena",J Diabetes Res,,154

Using order-level data from Uber Technologies, we study how the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing shutdown of businesses in the United States affected independent, small business restaurant supply and demand on the Uber Eats platform. We find evidence that small restaurants experience significant increases in total activity, orders per day, and orders per hour following the closure of the dine-in channel, and that these increases may be due to both demand-side and supply-side shocks. We document an increase in the intensity of competitive effects following the shock, showing that growth in the number of providers on a platform induces both market expansion and heightened inter-provider competition. Our findings underscore the critical role that digital will play in creating business resilience in the post-COVID economy, and provide new managerial insight into how supply-side and demand-side factors shape business performance on a platform.","Raj, Manav; Sundararajan, Arun; You, Calum",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07204v1.pdf,154

Despite the pandemic-related obstacles the sector faces, SDG12.3, halving food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030, needs to be achieved. This study therefore examines the two questions: How far has the pandemic affected the generation of food waste and the implementation of prevention measures? How does the use of digital technology, which has been increasingly accessed since the beginning of the pandemic, offer opportunities to further reduce food waste in the sector? Two online surveys were conducted. In the first survey, 84% of the 170 respondents indicated not to implement further food waste reduction measures since the start of the pandemic, while 11% do. They engaged in more targeted purchasing activities based on more conscious planning of the production volume, the reduction of menus offered, and the standardisation of menu components. In total, 91 food service companies provided data on the food wasted (in %) before and since the pandemic. Of the 179 entries made for the different waste categories, 47% indicated waste had not changed, while 42% and 11% indicated an increase/decrease, respectively. In the context of the ongoing digitalisation of the sector, possible fields of action for digital applications were identified, which are helpful in combating food waste in general and specifically during the pandemic. In this study, a classification scheme for digital food waste reduction approaches was developed. These approaches are systemised into four categories: forecasting, waste analysis, redistribution, and measures catalogue. Further, the process steps in which the applications are applied are indicated and direct and indirect effects on the generation of food waste are provided.","Strotmann, Christina Baur Vanessa Börnert Nora Gerwin Paula",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,154

In the absence of authorised pharmacological treatments, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine, which are known as anti-malaria drugs, had been widely used off-label until concerns about their efficacy/safety limited their use to hospitalized patients affected by severe COVID-19. Regardless of their clinical use, their manipulation is necessary since the pure drug substance is not always promptly available and most of the drug products available on the market are tablets designed to be ingested; no liquid dosage forms are available. These are needed for children and the enteral nutrition of inpatients of intensive care units. Considering that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are BCS class I, proper procedures for purifying the preparation from the insoluble excipients may be adopted to avoid clogging of a nasogastric tube and to reduce the drug content variability in the administered doses. The data in this article indicate that compounded oral suspensions containing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can be filtered and/or centrifuged without altering the drug assay of the preparation.","Musazzi, U M; Zanon, D; Gennari, C M G; Fortini, M; Maximova, N; Cilurzo, F; Minghetti, P",Data Brief,,154
591116,Severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by Leptospira interrogans: A case report and review of literature,2021-03-16,"Sweden stands out among the other European countries by the degree of restrictive measures taken towards handling the 2019 coronavirus outbreak, associated with the CoViD-19 pandemic. While several governments have imposed a nationwide total or partial lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus, the Swedish government has opted for a recommendation-based approach together with a few imposed restrictions. In a previous contribution by the authors, the impact of the Swedish strategy was observed through the monitored variation of the city noise levels during a period associated with the so-called “first wave” of the pandemic in Stockholm. A very strong impact of these recommendations was shown on the evolution of the noise levels in central Stockholm. This highlighted the potential of acoustic sensor networks both for enforcement of regulation and monitoring of the effectiveness of their implementation. The present contribution presents a follow-up to this urban noise monitoring in central Stockholm, Sweden, for the period leading to the so-called “second wave” of the pandemic in Europe. Both the evolution of adherence to the recommendations and the impact of the recurrence of cases combined with reinforced recommendations are observed through the evolution of the measured noise levels. While the measurements show a gradual lower level of compliance, in particular, past the summer break, these also show again a rapid response to the reinforced recommendations issued by the authorities in mid-fall of 2020. These observations thus confirm the potential associated with detailed urban noise monitoring, for instance here acting as a proxy to evaluating the response to recommendations or restrictions in times of crisis.","Rumpler, Romain; Venkataraman, Siddharth; Göransson, Peter",J Acoust Soc Am,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765773/; https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0003778,154

We aim to study the spread mechanism of rumors on social network platform during the spread of COVID-19 and consider education as a control measure of the spread of rumors. Firstly, a novel epidemic-like model is established to characterize the spread of rumor, which depends on the nonautonomous partial differential equation. Furthermore, the registration time of network users is abstracted as ‘age,’ and the spreading principle of rumors is described from two dimensions of age and time. Specifically, the susceptible users are divided into higher-educators class and lower-educators class, in which the higher-educators class will be immune to rumors with a higher probability and the lower-educators class is more likely to accept and spread the rumors. Secondly, the existence and uniqueness of the solution is discussed and the stability of steady-state solution of the model is obtained. Additionally, an interesting conclusion is that the education level of the crowd is an essential factor affecting the final scale of the spread of rumors. Finally, some control strategies are presented to effectively restrain the rumor propagation, and numerical simulations are carried out to verify the main theoretical results.","Hui, Hongwen; Zhou, Chengcheng; Lü, Xing; Li, Jiarong",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-020-05842-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836821/,154

Objective To examine the probability of mortality benefit for remdesivir and contrast with systemic corticosteroids. Design, setting, and participants A probabilistic reanalysis of available clinical trial data for corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic approach. Studies were identified from existing meta-analyses performed by the World Health Organization. Main outcomes and measures For both drugs, we calculated the posterior probabilities of an absolute decrease in mortality versus control patients by subgroups based on oxygen requirements. To contextualize, we quantified the probability of at least a 1, 2, or 5% absolute mortality decrease. Results Among patients requiring ventilation, remdesivir had only a 4% probability of 1% or greater mortality benefit compared to 93% for corticosteroids. For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, the probability of 1% or greater survival benefit was 81% for remdesivir compared to 93% for dexamethasone. Finally, for patients without oxygen requirements, the probabilities of 1% or greater mortality benefit were 29% for remdesivir and 4% for dexamethasone. Conclusions and relevance Using a Bayesian analytic approach, remdesivir had a low probability of achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, except for patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Corticosteroids were more promising for populations requiring oxygen support, especially ventilation. While awaiting more definitive studies, this probabilistic interpretation of the evidence will help guide treatment decisions for clinicians as well as guideline and policy makers.","Lee, Todd C.; McDonald, Emily G.; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Harrison, Luke B.; Cheng, Matthew P.; Brophy, James M.",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.01.065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33540128/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000771?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000771,154

Most African countries are planning, exsiccating and connecting their renewable energy projects with national grid system with giving high propriety to energy security, sustainable energy consumption and low carbon emission. Many policies have been enacted by countries to promote the scaling up of wind energy and renewable energy in particular, across the globe. However, these policies have mixed effects on the deployment of wind energy. For this purpose, current study used panel data and fixed effects model for 17 African countries with wind installed generation capacity to determine the driver of wind energy development on the African continent between 2008 and 2017. The variables were grouped into three thematic areas: policy, socioeconomic, and country-specific factors. After conducting the analysis, socioeconomic variables (GDP, CO(2), energy use) and energy security variables (energy import, electricity consumption) have significant effects in determining the scaling up of wind energy in Africa. However, the policy variables of FITs, licensing during, and Tax did not have significant effects on wind energy capacity addition for the case of Africa. This study adds to the drivers of nascent wind energy deployment literature in Africa. This study suggests that set of effecitive policies are deem necessary to scale up wind energy in Africa.","Abbas, Qaiser; Khan, Abdul Razzaq; Bashir, Ahmed; Alemzero, David Ajene; Sun, Huaping; Iram, Robina; Iqbal, Nadeem",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32556986/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09596-1,154

Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women.

600598,Thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination: a single UK centre experience,2021-07-13,"The current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a huge impact on emergency surgical services in the UK. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) published guidelines about COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020 to aid decision making for the surgeons. These guidelines recommended that all patients requiring urgent surgery should have reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or computed tomography (CT) thorax pre-operatively. However, it is currently unclear whether the use of CT thorax is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test. The objective of this study was to find out whether CT thorax is a reliable and accurate test in the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to RT-PCR. This is particularly important in surgical patients where there is no time to wait for RT-PCR results. A prospective cohort study of patients presented with acute surgical emergencies at a University Teaching Hospital was conducted. Data was collected from March 23, to May 15, 2020, during the peak of the crisis in the UK. All adult patients presented with operable general surgical emergencies were considered eligible. Another group of patients, admitted with acute medical emergencies but with suspected COVID-19 infection, was used for comparison. Data was manually collected, and sensitivity, specificity and predictive value were calculated using the MedCalc statistical software version 19.2.6. Standard reporting for COVID-19 infection for CT chest based on guidelines from British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) and Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) was used. Patients who had their CT thorax reported as typical or classic of COVID 19 (high probability) were treated as infected cases with extra precautions in the wards and surgical theatres as suggested by health and safety executive (HSE). These patients had serial RT-PCR during their admissions or in the post-operative phase, if the first swab was negative. For the study, 259 patients were considered eligible for inclusion from both groups. Patients admitted for acute surgical emergencies were treated according to RCS guidelines and subjected to RT-PCR test and/or CT scan of the thorax. There were 207 patients with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Of those 207 patients, 77 patients had CT thorax with radiographic features consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, only 40 patients had a positive RT-PCR result. CT thorax was normal in 130 patients, out of which 29 patients were found to have COVID-19 diagnosis after swab test. Sensitivity of CT scan to diagnose COVID-19 infection was found to be 58% (95% CI; 45.48% to 69.76%) whilst specificity was 73% (95% CI; 64.99% to 80.37%) with a negative predictive value of 77.69% (95% CI; 72.17% to 82.39%). CT scan was found to be a reliable tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19. With a negative predictive value of up to 82.4%, CT thorax can play an important role to help surgeons in their decision making for asymptomatic suspected cases of COVID-19. However, over-reliance on CT scan which also has a high false positive rate for diagnosis of COVID-19 infections can lead to overtreatment, overuse of resources and delays in decision-making process. Hence, results should be interpreted with caution and correlated with clinical presentation and swab test results.","Majeed, Talal; Ali, Romassa Siddiq; Solomon, Joshua; Mesri, Mina; Sharma, Shiv; Shamim, Sarah; Aiynattu, Sony; Ishak, Rafik; Wilson, Jeremy; Magee, Conor",Indian J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100739/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-020-02626-9,154
601025,Circulating Exosomes from Human Lung Transplant Recipients Having Respiratory Viral Infections Contain Nucleic Acids and Activate Signaling Pathways CGAS/STING and RIG-1,2020-04-30,"INTRODUCTION: Lipid based nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically successful vectors for hepatic delivery of nucleic acids. These systems are being developed for non-hepatic delivery of mRNA for the treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis or retinal degeneration as well as infectious diseases. Localized delivery to the lungs requires aerosolization. We hypothesized that structural lipids within LNPs would provide features of integrity which can be tuned for attributes required for efficient hepatic and non-hepatic gene delivery. Herein, we explored whether naturally occurring lipids that originate from the cell membrane of plants and microorganisms enhance mRNA-based gene transfection in vitro and in vivo and whether they assist in maintaining mRNA activity after nebulization. METHODS: We substituted DSPC, a structural lipid used in a conventional LNP formulation, to a series of naturally occurring membrane lipids. We measured the effect of these membrane lipids on size, encapsulation efficiency and their impact on transfection efficiency. We further characterized LNPs after nebulization and measured whether they retained their transfection efficiency. RESULTS: One plant-derived structural lipid, DGTS, led to a significant improvement in liver transfection of mRNA. DGTS LNPs had similar transfection ability when administered in the nasal cavity to conventional LNPs. In contrast, we found that DGTS LNPs had reduced transfection efficiency in cells pre-and post-nebulization while maintaining size and encapsulation similar to DSPC LNPs. CONCLUSIONS: We found that structural lipids provide differential mRNA-based activities in vitro and in vivo which also depend on the mode of administration. Understanding influence of structural lipids on nanoparticle morphology and structure can lead to engineering potent materials for mRNA-based gene therapy applications.","Kim, Jeonghwan; Jozic, Antony; Sahay, Gaurav",Cell Mol Bioeng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837581/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12195-020-00619-y,154
601649,Clinical features and outcomes of 2019 novel coronavirus-infected patients with cardiac injury,2020-03-16,"As one of the major approaches in combating the COVID-19 pandemics, the availability of specific and reliable assays for the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and its proteins is essential to identify the infection in suspected populations, make diagnoses in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, and determine clearance of the virus after the infection. For these purposes, use of the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for detection of the viral nucleic acid remains the most valuable in terms of its specificity, fast turn-around, high-throughput capacity, and reliability. It is critical to update the sequences of primers and probes to ensure the detection of newly emerged variants. Various assays for increased levels of IgG or IgM antibodies are available for detecting ongoing or past infection, vaccination responses, and persistence and for identifying high titers of neutralizing antibodies in recovered individuals. Viral genome sequencing is increasingly used for tracing infectious sources, monitoring mutations, and subtype classification and is less valuable in diagnosis because of its capacity and high cost. Nanopore target sequencing with portable options is available for a quick process for sequencing data. Emerging CRISPR-Cas-based assays, such as SHERLOCK and AIOD-CRISPR, for viral genome detection may offer options for prompt and point-of-care detection. Moreover, aptamer-based probes may be multifaceted for developing portable and high-throughput assays with fluorescent or chemiluminescent probes for viral proteins. In conclusion, assays are available for viral genome and protein detection, and the selection of specific assays depends on the purposes of prevention, diagnosis and pandemic control, or monitoring of vaccination efficacy.","Zhou, Yuan; Zhang, Li; Xie, You-Hua; Wu, Jian",Lab Invest,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-021-00663-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497366/,154

We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific guidance using current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines as a reference point. DESIGN: We convened a RAND appropriateness panel comprising 14 gastroenterologists and an IBD nurse consultant supplemented by surgical and COVID-19 experts. Panellists rated the appropriateness of interventions for ASUC in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Median scores and disagreement index (DI) were calculated. Results were discussed at a moderated meeting prior to a second survey. RESULTS: Panellists recommended that patients with ASUC should be isolated throughout their hospital stay and should have a SARS-CoV-2 swab performed on admission. Patients with a positive swab should be discussed with COVID-19 specialists. As per BSG guidance, intravenous hydrocortisone was considered appropriate as initial management; only in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was its use deemed uncertain. In patients requiring rescue therapy, infliximab with continuing steroids was recommended. Delaying colectomy because of COVID-19 was deemed inappropriate. Steroid tapering as per BSG guidance was deemed appropriate for all patients apart from those with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom a 4–6 week taper was preferred. Post-ASUC maintenance therapy was dependent on SARS-CoV-2 status but, in general, biologics were more likely to be deemed appropriate than azathioprine or tofacitinib. Panellists deemed prophylactic anticoagulation postdischarge to be appropriate in patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. CONCLUSION: We have suggested COVID-19-specific adaptations to the BSG ASUC guideline using a RAND panel.","Din, Shahida; Kent, Alexandra; Pollok, Richard C; Meade, Susanna; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Arnott, Ian; Beattie, R Mark; Chua, Felix; Cooney, Rachel; Dart, Robin J; Galloway, James; Gaya, Daniel R; Ghosh, Subrata; Griffiths, Mark; Hancock, Laura; Hansen, Richard; Hart, Ailsa; Lamb, Christopher Andrew; Lees, Charlie W; Limdi, Jimmy K; Lindsay, James O; Patel, Kamal; Powell, Nick; Murray, Charles D; Probert, Chris; Raine, Tim; Selinger, Christian; Sebastian, Shaji; Smith, Philip J; Tozer, Phil; Ustianowski, Andrew; Younge, Lisa; Samaan, Mark A; Irving, Peter M",Gut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513653/; https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321927,154

Methods: In accordance with the systematic approach of a scoping review, a literature search was conducted in national and international medical literature databases using a search string. The search in the databases was limited to the period from 01.01.2000 to 15.11.2020 and has been subsequently completed by hand search until 08.03.2021. A hand search, even beyond 15.11.2020, seemed necessary and reasonable, since due to the dynamics of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of articles and regulations are being published very quickly at short notice. Results: The literature search resulted in the following number of hits in the databases listed below: PubMed: 165 articles. Cochrane: 1 review and 35 studies. Web of Science: 217 articles. Robert Koch Institute: 49 articles . Thus, a total of 467 hits were identified, with a total of 124 hits being duplicates. From these, 138 articles were considered relevant to the COVID-19 infection surveillance situation in Germany based on established criteria. After reading the full texts, 92 articles and websites were ultimately included in the scoping review.

603173,Respiratory Care for the Critical Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus,2021-06-21,"The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is a versatile and powerful platform for protein expression in insect cells. With the ability to approach similar post-translational modifications as in mammalian cells, the BEVS offers a number of advantages including high levels of expression as well as an inherent safety during manufacture and of the final product. Many BEVS products include proteins and protein complexes that require expression from more than one gene. This review examines the expression strategies that have been used to this end and focuses on the distinguishing features between those that make use of single polycistronic baculovirus (co-expression) and those that use multiple monocistronic baculoviruses (co-infection). Three major areas in which researchers have been able to take advantage of co-expression/co-infection are addressed, including compound structure-function studies, insect cell functionality augmentation, and VLP production. The core of the review discusses the parameters of interest for co-infection and co-expression with time of infection (TOI) and multiplicity of infection (MOI) highlighted for the former and the choice of promoter for the latter. In addition, an overview of modeling approaches is presented, with a suggested trajectory for future exploration.

Approved in the U.S. more than 30 years ago, octreotide is widely used to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and has been shown to demonstrate antiproliferative activity. The two formulations available in the U.S. include a subcutaneous immediate‐release (IR) injection introduced in 1989 and a long‐acting repeatable (LAR) intramuscular injection approved in 1999. Lanreotide depot (lanreotide), a more recent somatostatin congener, has been available in the U.S. since 2014. Despite widespread use of octreotide LAR, several key challenges exist with the current depot‐based treatment paradigm. Studies indicate that LAR formulations are associated with continued unmet patient needs, owing in part to a loss of bioactivity over time that may necessitate progressive supplemental treatment with IR octreotide to adequately control symptoms. Clinicians should understand the key differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of the LAR and IR formulations that may contribute to bioactivity loss and somatostatin receptor desensitization. In addition, there is a need to re‐evaluate the role of IR octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms. The purpose of this review is to explore all these issues and to re‐establish a rationale for the IR formulation, particularly with respect to novel use cases and its use during the COVID‐19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: There is a need to re‐evaluate the role of immediate‐release octreotide in combination with depot therapy to provide consistent bioavailability and better control of carcinoid syndrome symptoms.","Anthony, Lowell B.; O'Dorisio, Thomas M.",Oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097784/,154

604039,"Type I, II, and III interferon signatures correspond to COVID-19 disease severity",2021-05-24,"IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, remains viable and therefore potentially infectious on several materials. One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected. MaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay. ResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure. ConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","Lehman, Caitlin W.; Flur, Rafaela; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; McEntire, Bryan J.; Bal, B.

Like previous respiratory virus pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant strains on the standing capacity of laboratories around the world. In this case study, we describe the surge response required by our laboratory to meet the fluctuating demand for SARS-CoV-2 in our regional pathology service in Western Sydney, Australia between March and May 2020. While the overall number of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive cases was relatively low compared to other Australian local health districts, testing numbers were highly unpredictable and changed on a weekly basis as local outbreaks were detected. As with other laboratories, numerous other challenges were also faced during this period, including the requirement to introduce a new and unaccredited diagnostic PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2, local and global shortages of reagents for sampling and sample processing, and a significant institutional SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in our laboratory catchment area. A successful service delivery during this period could only be maintained by a dynamic whole-of-laboratory and organizational response including (1) operational changes to the hours of service and the expansion of diagnostic testing at our laboratory site and other sites within our organization (2) careful management of specialist staff and re-training and recruitment of additional staff (3) changes to laboratory workflows to improve SARS-CoV-2 PCR test turnaround time and to accommodate limits to precious laboratory reagents; (4) clear communication within our laboratory and the NSW Health Pathology organization; and (5) collaborative co-ordination and support by NSW Health Pathology.","Sparks, Rebecca; Balgahom, Rifky; Janto, Catherine; Polkinghorne, Adam; Branley, James; Samarasekara, Harsha",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33486387/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115309; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073288932100002X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073288932100002X,154
605260,5-Aminolevulinic Acid as a Novel Therapeutic for Inflammatory Bowel Disease,2021-05-20,"Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes reflect the unequal burden experienced by vulnerable communities in the United States (US). Proposed explanations include socioeconomic factors that influence how people live, work, and play, and pre-existing comorbidities. It is important to assess the extent to which observed US COVID-19 racial and ethnic disparities can be explained by these factors. We study 9.8 million confirmed cases and 234,000 confirmed deaths from 2,990 US counties (3,142 total) that make up 99.8% of the total US population (327.6 out of 328.2 million people) through 11/8/20. We found national COVID-19 racial health disparities in US are partially explained by various social determinants of health and pre-existing comorbidities that have been previously proposed. However, significant unexplained racial and ethnic health disparities still persist at the US county level after adjusting for these variables. There is a pressing need to develop strategies to address not only the social determinants but also other factors, such as testing access, personal protection equipment access and exposures, as well as tailored intervention and resource allocation for vulnerable groups, in order to combat COVID-19 and reduce racial health disparities.","Li, D.; Gaynor, S.

608712,Education and training in infection prevention and control: Exploring support for national standards,2021-01-16,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across many countries in pandemic proportions since the first case was reported in Hubei, China in December 2019. Understanding transmission, susceptibility and exposure risks is crucial for surveillance, control and response to the disease. Knowing the geographic distribution of health resource scarcity areas is necessary if a country is to adequately anticipate and prepare for the full impact of infections. We explored the potential to undertake a spatial risk assessment of an emerging pandemic under data scarcity in Eswatini. We used a set of socio-economic and demographic variables to identify epidemic risk prone areas in the country. Three risk zone levels for COVID-19 were identified in the country. The analysis showed that about 29% (320 818) of the population were located in the high risk zone and these were people who could potentially be infected with COVID-19 in the absence of mitigation measures. A majority of cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 would likely remain unknown but our estimate could be used to gauge the full burden of the disease. Approximating and quantifying the number of people who may be potentially infected with COVID-19 remains impossible under data scarcity and limited healthcare capacity especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We provided an estimation method that could support the pandemic risk forecasting, preparedness and response measures in the midst of data scarcity. The resultant map products could be used to guide on-the-ground surveillance and response efforts.","Dlamini, Wisdom M.; Dlamini, Sabelo N.; Mabaso, Sizwe D.; Simelane, Sabelo P.",Appl Geogr,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102358; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143622820306524; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622820306524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132463/,154
608966,The effects of injection of bovine vaccine into a human digit: a case report,2005-10-11,"Background. Most camps remained closed during Summer 2020, due to concerns regarding child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and limited information about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) within child congregate settings. Methods. We surveyed US camps about on-site operations, camper and staff demographics, COVID-19 cases amongst campers and staff, and NPI usage as related to pre-camp quarantines, facial coverings, physical distancing, cleaning, and facility modifications. For all NPIs, save quarantines, responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale format. Results. Within 486 on-site camps, a range of NPIs were instituted, most often related to reduced camper interactions, staff face coverings, cleaning, and hand hygiene. Camper facial coverings were less common, with campers always wearing masks at ~34% of the camps. Approximately 15% of camps reported 1+ confirmed COVID-19 case in either campers or staff, with three camps reporting a COVID outbreak. In both single and multi-NPI analyses, the risk of COVID-19 cases was lowest when campers always wore facial coverings. While less effective, constant use of staff facial coverings and targeted physical distancing measures, but not pre-camp quarantine, also reduced COVID-19 risks. Conclusions. We found constant facial coverings, especially for campers, and targeted physical distancing measures to reduce risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within summer camps. Our findings provide valuable guidance for future operations of camp and other child congregate settings with regard to efficient and effective NPI usage to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Suh, H.

Previous data on PD and SARS-CoV-2 are scarce, suggesting a poor prognosis in advanced disease and second-line therapies. METHODS: A retrospective case–control study comparing patients with PD and COVID-19 and patients with PD without COVID-19 was conducted during the pandemic period in Spain (March 1st–July 31st 2020) in a tertiary university hospital. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (COVID-19 +) and 172 (COVID-19-) PD patients were included. Fifty-nine percent were males in both groups, with similar age (75.9 ± 9.0 COVID-19 + , 73.9 ± 10.0 COVID-19-), disease duration (8.9 ± 6.2 COVID-19 + , 8.5 ± 5.6 COVID-19-) and PD treatments. COVID-19 was mild in 10 (26%), required admission in 21 (54%) and caused death in 8 (21%) patients. Dementia was the only comorbidity more frequent in COVID-19 + patients (36% vs. 14%, p = 0.0013). However, in a multivariate analysis, institutionalization was the only variable associated with COVID-19 + (OR 17.0, 95% CI 5.0–60.0, p < 0.001). When considering severe COVID-19 (admission or death) vs. mild or absent COVID-19, institutionalization, neoplasm, dementia and a lower frequency of dopamine agonists were associated with severe COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, only institutionalization [OR 5.17, 95% CI 1.57–17, p = 0.004] and neoplasm [OR 8.0, 95%CI 1.27–49.8, p = 0.027] remained significantly associated. CONCLUSION: In our experience, institutionalization and oncologic comorbidity, rather than PD-related variables, increased the risk of developing COVID-19, and impacted on its severity. These findings suggest that epidemiologic factors and frailty are key factors for COVID-19 morbidity/mortality in PD. Appropriate preventive strategies should be implemented in institutionalized patients to prevent infection and improve prognosis.","Sainz-Amo, R.; Baena-Álvarez, B.; Pareés, I.; Sánchez-Díez, G.; Pérez-Torre, P.; López-Sendón, J.

Thousands of articles have been published to tackle this crisis. Here, a bibliometric study of the publications in environmental studies has been conducted to identify the emerging research trends in this field in the era of COVID-19. Bibliometric analysis serves as a useful tool to evaluate research productivity and scholarly trends in a field. For this, publications were searched in nine environment-related subject categories indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database of the Web of Science Core Collection. A bibliometric evaluation of 495 relevant documents was performed to identify various essential research indicators, including the type of the publication, the most prominent journals, subject categories, authors, institutions, and the countries, that contributed significantly to this theme. Major focus of this bibliometric study is to illustrate the potential research hotspots emerged during this pandemic. It has been found that significant amount of research has been conducted for the assessment of environmental quality and its contribution in environmental transmission of COVID-19. In addition to its positive impacts on environment, COVID-19 has contributed indirectly in worsening many environmental threats such as increased exposure to disinfectants and antimicrobials, poor solid waste management, and food insecurity.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess Saudi domestic air travellers’ understanding regarding COVID-19 and attitude towards mandating the COVID-19 vaccination for travellers. Methods: A survey using a self-administered, structured, and closed-ended questionnaire was conducted among domestic air travellers in Saudi Arabia. Participants’ socio-demographic information, travel history, health status, and attitudes and willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccination were collected and analysed. Results: Of the 2236 respondents who participated in the survey, 542 (24.25%) had a history of COVID-19, 803 (35.9%) were exposed to a COVID-19 case, 1425 (63.7%) were concerned about catching COVID-19 during air travel, 796 (35.6%) thought the COVID-19 vaccination should be obligatory for travellers, 1105 (49.4%) thought it should be optional, and 335 (15.0%) thought the vaccination was unnecessary. Being of the male gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.14–1.69), being concerned about contracting COVID-19 (aOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.12–2.10) and frequent travelling (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10–3.40) were predictors of vaccination uptake.

611513,Sertraline as a rare cause of interstitial lung disease,2021-04-28,"Aims: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The current paper described how carnosine, a naturally occurring supplement, can be an effective drug candidate for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the basis of molecular docking and modeling to host ACE2 cocrystallized with nCoV spike protein. Methods: First, the starting point was ACE2 inhibitors and their structure–activity relationship (SAR). Next, chemical similarity (or diversity) and PubMed searches made it possible to repurpose and assess approved or experimental drugs for COVID-19. Parallel, at all stages, the authors performed bioactivity scoring to assess potential repurposed inhibitors at ACE2. Finally, investigators performed molecular docking and modeling of the identified drug candidate to host ACE2 with nCoV spike protein. Results: Carnosine emerged as the best-known drug candidate to match ACE2 inhibitor structure. Preliminary docking was more optimal to ACE2 than the known typical angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitor (enalapril) and quite comparable to known or presumed ACE2 inhibitors. Viral spike protein elements binding to ACE2 were retained in the best carnosine pose in SwissDock at 1.75 Angstroms. Out of the three main areas of attachment expected to the protein–protein structure, carnosine bound with higher affinity to two compared to the known ACE2 active site. LibDock score was 92.40 for site 3, 90.88 for site 1, and inside the active site 85.49. Conclusion: Carnosine has promising inhibitory interactions with host ACE2 and nCoV spike protein and hence could offer a potential mitigating effect against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Saadah, Loai M.; Deiab, Ghina’a I.

Ten patients from 2 families and 1 hospital were involved in the transmission. MATERIAL/METHODS: We conducted an epidemiological investigation to identify the cluster transmission of COVID-19. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and cluster characteristics were described and analyzed. RESULTS: From January 27 to February 13, 2020, a total of 10 individuals were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 families and 1 hospital. Among the confirmed cases, 7 had atypical clinical symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic. The median times from onset to diagnosis and to discharge were 3.5 days (range, 1–5 days) and 19.5 days (range, 16–38 days), respectively. There were 4 patients whose exposure dates were 1, 3, 3, and 2 days earlier than the onset dates of their previous-generation cases, respectively. Four prevention and control measures were effectively used to interrupt the disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmitted within families and in hospitals, and asymptomatic patients could act as a source of disease transmission. The results of this outbreak at the early epidemic stage support the recommendation that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and all their close contacts should be subjected to medical quarantined observation and nucleic acid screening as early as possible, even if they do not have any symptoms. Meanwhile, people in high-risk areas should improve their protective measures.","Zhang, Hui; Song, Shuxuan; Chen, Zhijun; Bai, Miao; He, Zhen; Fu, Ting; Liu, Kun; Shao, Zhongjun",Med Sci Monit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121087/; https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.929701,154

In an attempt to address this, avian and human influenza HA pseudotyped retroviruses have been successfully employed in antibody neutralization assays. In this study we generated an equine influenza pseudotyped lentivirus for serological screening. This was achieved by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of an H3N8 subtype equine influenza virus strain, HIV gag-pol and firefly luciferase reporter genes and harvesting virus from supernatant. In order to produce infective pseudotype particles it was necessary to additionally co-transfect a plasmid encoding the TMPRSS2 endoprotease to cleave the HA. High titre pseudotype virus (PV) was then used in PV antibody neutralization assays (PVNAs) to successfully distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated equines. The sera were also screened by single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay. There was a 65% correlation between the results of the two assays, with the PVNA assay appearing slightly more sensitive. Future work will extend the testing of the PVNA with a larger number of serum samples to assess sensitivity/specificity, inter/intra-laboratory variability and to define a protective titre.","Scott, Simon; Molesti, Eleonora; Temperton, Nigel; Ferrara, Francesca; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva; Daly, Janet",J Mol Genet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515229/,154

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate for the treatment of DED. METHODS: Experimental models of DED were generated in Sprague Dawley rats using a combination of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) with atropine sulfate and in New Zealand White rabbits using BAC. The animals were treated twice daily with eye drops of vehicle, imatinib (0.01%–0.3%), or a positive control (Restasis). The improvement in DED due to imatinib was assessed by staining with fluorescein, lissamine green, impression cytology, and histological analysis. In addition, immunofluorescence staining was performed at the end of the study to evaluate the inflammatory response in the ocular surface. RESULTS: Topical application of imatinib significantly reduced ocular surface damage compared with vehicle-treated animals. Imatinib restored the morphology and structure of the conjunctival epithelium and reduced the recruitment of immune cells in the corneal epithelium. Furthermore, imatinib significantly reduced the impression cytology score, thus demonstrating that imatinib prevents the loss of goblet cells in DED animal models. The therapeutic efficacy of imatinib was similar to or better than that of cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide an animal in vivo proof of concept of the therapeutic potential of imatinib for the treatment of DED. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: With this study we show the possibility of developing imatinib as a new ophthalmic drop to treat DED.","Baek, Yi-Yong; Sung, Bokyung; Choi, Jun-Sub; Go, Hyeon-Kyu; Kim, Do-Hyung; Hyon, Joon Young; You, Ji Chang",Transl Vis Sci Technol,https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.10.11.14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520512/,154

The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J‐SSCG) 2020 Special Committee created the Japanese Rapid/Living recommendations on drug management for COVID‐19 using the experience of creating the J‐SSCGs. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to determine the certainty of the evidence and strength of the recommendations. The first edition of this guideline was released on September 9, 2020, and this document is the revised edition (ver. 3.1) (released on March 30, 2021). Clinical questions (CQs) were set for the following seven drugs: favipiravir (CQ1), remdesivir (CQ‐2), hydroxychloroquine (CQ‐3), corticosteroids (CQ‐4), tocilizumab (CQ‐5), ciclesonide (CQ‐6), and anticoagulants (CQ‐7). Favipiravir is recommended for patients with mild COVID‐19 not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 2C); remdesivir for moderate COVID‐19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B); hydroxychloroquine is not recommended for all COVID‐19 patients (GRADE 1B); corticosteroids are recommended for moderate COVID‐19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 1B) and severe COVID‐19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 1A); however, their administration is not recommended for mild COVID‐19 patients not requiring supplemental oxygen (GRADE 1B); tocilizumab is recommended for moderate COVID‐19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization (GRADE 2B); and anticoagulant therapy for moderate COVID‐19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen/hospitalization and severe COVID‐19 patients requiring ventilator management/intensive care (GRADE 2C).

Identifying antigens presented on MHCs by infected cells and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) during infection may therefore provide a route toward developing new vaccines. Peptides bound to MHCs can be identified at whole-proteome scale using mass spectrometry—a technique referred to as “immunopeptidomics.” This technique has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying potential vaccine targets in the context of many infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss the contributions immunopeptidomic studies have made to understanding antigen presentation and T cell priming in the context of infection and the potential for immunopeptidomics to inform the development of vaccines to address pressing global health problems in infectious disease.","Leddy, Owen K.; White, Forest M.; Bryson, Bryan D.",mSystems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342538/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00310-21,154

Despite this, the research lacks spatiotemporal statistical and mathematical analysis based on large datasets. We describe a novel methodology to extract useful spatiotemporal information from COVID-19 pandemic data. (2) Methods: We perform specific analyses based on mathematical and statistical tools, like mathematical morphology, hierarchical clustering, parametric data modeling and non-parametric statistics. These analyses are here applied to the large dataset consisting of about 19,000 COVID-19 patients in the Veneto region (Italy) during the entire Italian national lockdown. (3) Results: We estimate the COVID-19 cumulative incidence spatial distribution, significantly reducing image noise. We identify four clusters of connected provinces based on the temporal evolution of the incidence. Surprisingly, while one cluster consists of three neighboring provinces, another one contains two provinces more than 210 km apart by highway. The survival function of the local spatial incidence values is modeled here by a tapered Pareto model, also used in other applied fields like seismology and economy in connection to networks. Model’s parameters could be relevant to describe quantitatively the epidemic.

The disease occurred in a breeding farm of raccoon dogs in Guan County of Shandong Province in China in August of 2019. 47% (425/896) of the raccoon dogs showed some abnormal symptoms; 17.6% (75/425) of which had sever skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), dyspnea and sever pathological lesions in lungs, livers, etc; and 4.2% (18/425) of which died within 4 weeks. The pathogen of the disease was identified as S. pseudintermedius by mass spectrometer detection, animal pathogenicity tests, microscopic examination and biochemical reaction tests. Its nucleotide homology of 16S rRNA gene was 100% with that of other published strains and its genotype was between the American and Brazilian strains from other animals. The isolated S. pseudintermedius strain from the diseased raccoon dogs could cause ulceration and suppuration in the skins and sever pathological lesions not only in raccoon dogs, but also in mice; and it is confirmed as a methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) strain by the amplification of mecA gene; and 12 sensitive drugs were screened by drug sensitivity tests. Full attention should be paid to the great economic loss and the potential zoonotic risk caused by the S. pseudintermedius in raccoon dogs, and this study can provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of this new disease.","Zhu, Yisong; Liu, Junhong; Guo, Kaiyan; Qiu, Jianhua; Cheng, Ziqiang; Liu, Faxiao; Zhao, Yuqing; Zhang, Dingxiu; Guo, Huijun; Li, Hongmei",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32966709/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13847,154
617208,Correlation between viral RNA shedding and serum antibodies in COVID-19 patients,2020-05-23,"Novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global health challenge particularly for developing countries like Pakistan where overcrowded cities, inadequate sanitation, little health awareness and poor socioeconomic conditions exist. The SARS-CoV-2 has been known to spread primarily through direct contact and respiratory droplets. However, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and sewage, have raised the possibility of fecal-oral mode of transmission. Currently, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the only method being used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which requires expensive instrumentation, dedicated laboratory setup, highly skilled staff, and several hours to report results. Considering the high transmissibility and rapid spread, a robust, sensitive, specific and cheaper assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection is highly needed. Herein, we report a novel colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for naked-eye detection of SARS-COV-2 in clinical as well as sewage samples. Our SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-based LAMP assay could successfully detect the virus RNA in 26/28 (93%) of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 clinical samples with 100% specificity (n = 7) within 20 min. We also tested the effect of various additives on the performance of LAMP assay and found that addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) could increase the sensitivity of assay up to 10(1) copies of target sequence. Moreover, we also successfully applied this assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in sewage waters collected from those areas of Lahore, a city of Punjab province of Pakistan, declared as virus hotspots by local government. Our optimized LAMP assay could provide a sensitive first tier strategy for SARS-CoV-2 screening and can potentially help diagnostic laboratories in better handling of high sample turnout during pandemic situation. By providing rapid naked-eye SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage samples, this assay may support pandemic readiness and emergency response to any possible virus outbreaks in future.","Haque, Muhammad Farhan Ul; Bukhari, Syeda Sadia; Ejaz, Rabia; Zaman, Faheem Uz; Sreejith, Kamalalayam Rajan; Rashid, Naeem; Umer, Muhammad; Shahzad, Naveed",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146608/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198484; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817022100191X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817022100191X,154

This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = 0.017) with individuals' perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted 'knowledge about social distancing'. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the 'perception of COVID-19 origin' and the 'perception and knowledge about social distancing'.","Reyes, L.

618144,"Assessing the Real-Time Impact of COVID-19 on TB and HIV Services: The Experience and Response from Selected Health Facilities in Nairobi, Kenya",2021-05-10,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes sporadic zoonotic disease and healthcare-associated outbreaks in human. MERS is often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure(1,2). The high incidence of renal failure in MERS is a unique clinical feature not often found in other human coronavirus infections(3,4). Whether MERS-CoV infects the kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood(5,6). Here, we demonstrated renal infection and apoptotic induction by MERS-CoV in human ex vivo organ culture and a nonhuman primate model. High-throughput analysis revealed that the cellular genes most significantly perturbed by MERS-CoV have previously been implicated in renal diseases. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects. We further demonstrated that hyperexpression of Smad7 or FGF2 induced a strong apoptotic response in kidney cells. Common marmosets infected by MERS-CoV developed ARDS and disseminated infection in kidneys and other organs. Smad7 and FGF2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidneys of the infected animals. Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and host targets for treatment.

Commercially, both live and killed PRRSV vaccines are available to control PRRS, but they are not always successful. Based on the results of mucosal immunization studies in other viral models, a good mucosal vaccine may be an effective way to elicit protective immunity to control PRRS outbreaks. In the present study, mucosal adjuvanticity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) was evaluated in pigs administered a modified live PRRS virus vaccine (PRRS-MLV) intranasally. A Mtb WCL mediated increase in the frequency of NK cells, CD8(+)and CD4(+) T cells, and γδ T cells in pig lungs were detected. Importantly, an increased and early generation of PRRSV specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL compared to pigs inoculated with vaccine alone. In addition, there was an increased secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFNγ and IL-12) that correlated with a reciprocal reduction in the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGFβ) as well as T-regulatory cells in pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL. Further, a complete rescue in arginase levels in the lungs mediated through Mtb WCL was observed in pigs inoculated with PRRS-MLV. In conclusion, Mtb WCL may be a potent mucosal adjuvant for PRRS-MLV in order to potentiate the anti-PRRSV specific immune responses to control PRRS effectively.","Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Patterson, Ruthi; Dodson, Katie; Weeman, Matthew; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11003574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21419164/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11003574,154

The subgenomic-RNA component was assessed in 36 subjects using digital PCR. Infection duration, viral load decay speed, effects of age and sex were assessed and compared by extensive statistical analyses. Overall, infection duration and viral load differed between the groups (p < 0.05). Male sex was more present among both original and variant carriers affected with high viral load and showing fast decay speed, whereas original strain carriers with slow decay speed resulted in older (p < 0.05). Subgenomic-RNA was detected in the positive samples, including those with low viral load.

Using linked patient-level data, we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and/or related mortality. Methods A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition. Findings A total of 5,664,652 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.","Burn, E.; Tebe, C.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Aragon, M.; Recalde, M.; Roel, E.; Prats-Uribe, A.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Duarte-Salles, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.13.20152454v1?rss=1,154

Antibacterial consumption was measured in items/1000 population for primary care and in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1000 admissions for secondary care in England from 2015 to October 2020. Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on antibacterial consumption. In the community, the rate of antibacterial items prescribed decreased further in 2020 (by an extra 1.4% per month, 95% CI: −2.3 to −0.5) compared to before COVID-19. In hospitals, the volume of antibacterial use decreased during COVID-19 overall (−12.1% compared to pre-COVID, 95% CI: −19.1 to −4.4), although the rate of usage in hospitals increased steeply in April 2020. Use of antibacterials prescribed for respiratory infections and broad-spectrum antibacterials (predominately ‘Watch’ antibacterials in hospitals) increased in both settings. Overall volumes of antibacterial use at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic decreased in both primary and secondary settings, although there were increases in the rate of usage in hospitals in April 2020 and in specific antibacterials. This highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship during pandemics to ensure appropriate prescribing and avoid negative consequences on patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance.","Andrews, Amelia; Budd, Emma L.; Hendrick, Aoife; Ashiru-Oredope, Diane; Beech, Elizabeth; Hopkins, Susan; Gerver, Sarah; Muller-Pebody, Berit",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10070841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356762/,154

All children presented with velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and compensatory articulation (CA) after palatal repair. TP was provided in small groups (5-6 children) following the principles of the Whole Language Model (WLM). Severity of CA was evaluated by a standardized scale at the onset and at the end of the TP period. Results At the onset of the TP intervention period, 84% of the patients demonstrated severe CA. At the end of the TP period there was a significant improvement in severity of CA (p<0.001). Conclusion The results of this study suggests that TP can be a safe and reliable tool for improving CA.

Preparations were made to face the spread of COVID-19, as predicting the most probable risk areas by using spatial models. Prediction spatial models of COVID-19 risk areas can help the governmental authorities to generate sustainable strategies and set up suitable protocols to control the pandemic. This research presents an attempt of a potential spatial prediction modeling of COVID-19 risk areas in Cairo governorate-Egypt. Four indicator models (demographic, residential, environmental and topographic) were developed using geomatics technology based on the guidelines of the UN-habitat sustainable development goals (SDGs) target (11 & 3). Five predicted scenarios were generated for the most pandemic probability areas by the integration of the four indicator models. The results showed that there are common areas in all scenarios for highly COVID-19 pandemic risk areas. These common risk areas were found in (El Marag, El Salam, Ain Shams, El Mataria, El Gammaleya, Manshiat Nasser, El Mosky , Bolak , Hadaak El Koba, and El Sharbeya) districts. The hotspots zones are characterized by overcrowding, high population density and economic activities, large family size, poor infrastructure service and low rate of education. Moreover, it was noticed that crowding points resulted in traffic density and air pollution, which may affect the pandemic spread. The accuracy assessment results displayed that, the environmental predicted scenario was more consistent with the official data of the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population) MOHP), while the residential one was less convenient. The result of this study supports the health sector by predicting the hot spots areas.

It has appeared to intensify during the COVID-19 pandemic and the nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as closures, taken to slow its spread. No-shows interfere with patients' continuous care, lead to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and increase healthcare costs. We present a comprehensive analysis of no-shows for breast imaging appointments made during 2020 in a large medical network in Israel. We applied advanced machine learning methods to provide insights into novel and known predictors. Additionally, we employed causal inference methodology to infer the effect of closures on no-shows, after accounting for confounding biases, and demonstrate the superiority of adversarial balancing over inverse probability weighting in correcting these biases. Our results imply that a patient's perceived risk of cancer and the COVID-19 time-based factors are major predictors. Further, we reveal that closures impact patients over 60, but not patients undergoing advanced diagnostic examinations.","Ozery-Flato, M.; Pinchasov, O.; Dabush-Kasa, M.; Hexter, E.; Chodick, G.; Guindy, M.; Rosen-Zvi, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253358v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253358,154
626185,A rare case of the superior vena cava obstruction in a 16-year-old boy with Burkitt's lymphoma: A case report,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: A first-dose of various vaccines provides acceptable protection against infections by SARS-CoV-2 and evolution to the most severe forms of COVID-19. The recombinant adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccine, Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V), was proven efficacious but information about effectiveness in the real-world setting is lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the rollout of the first component (rAd26) of Gam-COVID-Vac and PCR-positive tests, hospitalisations and deaths. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study which analyzed individuals aged 60-79 who self-registered in the online vaccination system of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, from December 29, 2020 to March 21, 2021. Exclusion criteria were having a previous positive RT-PCR or antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2, having received other vaccines, or two doses of any vaccine. Proportions of new laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations and deaths until 83 days of vaccination were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Vaccine effectiveness for the three outcomes was calculated as (1–OR) × 100. Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curves were constructed. FINDINGS: During the study period 415995 registered subjects received the first component of Gam-COVID-Vac; 40387 belonged to the 60-79 age group, and were compared to 38978 unvaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness for preventing laboratory-confirmed infections was 78•6% [CI(95%) 74·8 - 81·7]; and for reducing hospitalizations and deaths was, respectively, 87·6% [CI(95%) 80·3 - 92·2] and 84·8% [CI(95%) 75·0 - 90·7]. Effectiveness was high across all subgroups. INTERPRETATION: Similarly to other vaccines, the administration of one dose of Gam-COVID-Vac was effective for a wide range of COVID-19–related outcomes.

Worldwide rigorous containment measures for limiting the spread of the virus have several beneficial environmental implications due to decreased anthropogenic emissions and air pollutants, which provide a unique opportunity to understand and quantify the human impact on atmospheric environment. In the present study, the associated changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST), aerosol, and atmospheric water vapor content were investigated over highly COVID-19 impacted areas, namely, Europe and North America. The key findings revealed a large-scale negative standardized LST anomaly during nighttime across Europe (–0.11 °C to –2.6 °C), USA (–0.70 °C) and Canada (–0.27 °C) in March–May of the pandemic year 2020 compared to the mean of 2015–2019, which can be partly ascribed to the lockdown effect. The reduced LST was corroborated with the negative anomaly of air temperature measured at meteorological stations (i.e. –0.46 °C to –0.96 °C). A larger decrease in nighttime LST was also seen in urban areas (by ∼1–2 °C) compared to rural landscapes, which suggests a weakness of the urban heat island effect during the lockdown period due to large decrease in absorbing aerosols and air pollutants. On the contrary, daytime LST increased over most parts of Europe due to less attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols. Synoptic meteorological variability and several surface-related factors may mask these changes and significantly affect the variations in LST, aerosols and water vapor content. The changes in LST may be a temporary phenomenon during the lockdown but provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the effects of various forcing controlling factors in urban microclimate and a strong evidence base for potential environmental benefits through urban planning and policy implementation.","Parida, Bikash Ranjan; Bar, Somnath; Kaskaoutis, Dimitris; Pandey, Arvind Chandra; Polade, Suraj D.; Goswami, Santonu",Sustain Cities Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513574/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103336; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670721006120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721006120?v=s5,154

We evaluate life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for automated suburban ground delivery systems consisting of a vehicle (last-mile) and a robot (final-50-feet). Small and large cargo vans (125 and 350 cubic feet; V125 and V350) with an internal combustion engine (ICEV) and battery electric (BEV) powertrains were assessed for three delivery scenarios: (i) conventional, human-driven vehicle with human delivery; (ii) partially automated, human-driven vehicle with robot delivery; and (iii) fully automated, connected automated vehicle (CAV) with robot delivery. The robot's contribution to life cycle GHG emissions is small (2-6%). Compared to the conventional scenario, full automation results in similar GHG emissions for the V350-ICEV but 10% higher for the V125-BEV. Conventional delivery with a V125-BEV provides the lowest GHG emissions, 167 g CO2e/package, while partially automated delivery with a V350-ICEV generates the most at 486 g CO2e/package. Fuel economy and delivery density are key parameters, and electrification of the vehicle and carbon intensity of the electricity have a large impact. CAV power requirements and efficiency benefits largely offset each other, and automation has a moderate impact on life cycle GHG emissions.","Li, Luyao; He, Xiaoyi; Keoleian, Gregory A; Kim, Hyung Chul; De Kleine, Robert; Wallington, Timothy J; Kemp, Nicholas J",Environ. sci. technol,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c08213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328327/,154

Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social cost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression approach; and ii) second, to build a “taxonomy” of provinces with similar mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution, climatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density, air pollutants concentrations (NO(2), O(3), PM(10), and PM(2.5)), relative average humidity, COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular, the risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a three-fold greater risk than the 80–to–89 years old and four-fold greater risk than 70–to–79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest risk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and health system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining the CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by the massive stress of the Italian health system.","Perone, Gaetano",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33022464/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720360526; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720360526; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142523,154
627682,"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study",2020-01-30,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - the cause of COVID-19 disease. It has been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. Collectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, X.; Eales, J.

Patients were recruited from emergency and infectious disease departments and were divided into a training and a validation cohort. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and results of blood tests (complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP) were collected. The pre-test probability score was derived from univariate analyses between patients and controls, followed by multivariate binary logistic analysis to determine the independent variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Points were assigned to each variable to create the PARIS score. ROC curve analysis determined the area under the curve (AUC) Findings: One hundred subjects with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the training cohort, and 300 other consecutive individuals were included in the validation cohort. Low lymphocyte (<1.3 G/L), eosinophil (<0.06G/L), basophil (<0.04G/L) and neutrophil counts (<5G/L) were associated with a high probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical variable was statistically significant. The score had a good performance in the validation cohort (AUC=0.889 (CI: [0.846-0.932]; STD=0.022) with a sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value of high-probability score of 80.3% and 92.3% respectively. Furthermore, a low-probability score excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection with a Negative Predictive Value of 99.5% Interpretation: The PARIS score based on complete white blood cell count has a good performance to categorize the pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It could help clinicians avoid diagnostic tests in patients with a low-probability score and conversely keep on testing individuals with high-probability score but negative RT-PCR or CT.

628660,Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors as a new potential therapeutic option in management of COVID-19,2020-11-08,"The Spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses (CoV) mediates viral entry into host cells. It contains two hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR) regions, denoted HRN and HRC, which oligomerize the S glycoprotein into a trimer in the native state and when activated collapse into a six-helix bundle structure driving fusion of the host and viral membranes. Previous studies have shown that peptides of the HR regions can inhibit viral infectivity. These studies imply that the HR regions are accessible and that agents which can interact with them may prevent viral entry. In the present study, we have investigated an approach to generate antibodies that specifically recognize the HRN and HRC regions of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein in order to evaluate whether these antibodies can inhibit viral infectivity and thus neutralize the SARS-CoV. In this regard, we incorporated HRN and HRC coiled-coil surface residues into a de novo designed two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil template for generating conformation-specific antibodies that recognize α-helices in proteins (Lu, S.M., Hodges, R.S., 2002. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 23515–23524). Eighteen surface residues from two regions of HRN and HRC were incorporated into the template and used to generate four anti-sera, HRN1, HRN2, HRC1, and HRC2. Our results show that all of the elicited anti-sera can specifically recognize HRN or HRC peptides and the native SARS-CoV S protein in an ELISA format. Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis, however, showed only HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could bind to native S protein expressed on the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells, i.e., the cell surface structure of the S glycoprotein precluded the ability of the HRN1 or HRN2 anti-sera to see their respective epitope sites. In in vitro viral infectivity assays, no inhibition was observed for either HRN1 or HRN2 anti-serum, whereas both HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could inhibit SARS-CoV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HRC1 anti-serum, which was a more effective inhibitor of viral infectivity compared to HRC2 anti-serum, could only bind the pre-fusogenic state of HRC, i.e., the HRC1 anti-serum did not recognize the six-helix bundle conformation (fusion state) whereas HRC2 anti-serum did. These results suggest that antibodies that are more specific for the pre-fusogenic state of HRC may be better neutralizing antibodies. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that the two-stranded coiled-coil template acts as an excellent presentation system for eliciting helix-specific antibodies against highly conserved viral antigens and HRC1 and HRC2 peptides may represent potential candidates for use in a peptide vaccine against the SARS-CoV.","Tripet, Brian; Kao, Daniel J.; Jeffers, Scott A.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Hodges, Robert S.",J Struct Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847706001122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16697221/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847706001122,154

629678,Diagnostic Testing of COVID-19 in Solid Organ Transplantation: Current Clinical Application and Future Strategies,2020-10-25,"Several biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) pathogens are high-consequence, single-stranded RNA viruses, and their genomes, when introduced into permissive cells, are infectious. Moreover, many of these viruses are select agents (SAs), and their genomes are also considered SAs. For this reason, cDNAs and/or their derivatives must be tested to ensure the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA before transfer out of the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This tremendously limits the capacity to conduct viral genomic research, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we present a sequence-independent method to rapidly amplify viral genomic RNA while simultaneously abolishing both viral and genomic RNA infectivity across multiple single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA+) virus families. The process generates barcoded DNA amplicons that range in length from 300 to 1,000 bp, which cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable to transport at room temperature. Our barcoding approach allows for up to 288 barcoded samples to be pooled into a single library and run across various NGS platforms without potential reconstitution of the viral genome. Our data demonstrate that this approach provides full-length genomic sequence information not only from high-titer virion preparations but it can also recover specific viral sequence from samples with limited starting material in the background of cellular RNA, and it can be used to identify pathogens from unknown samples. In summary, we describe a rapid, universal standard operating procedure that generates high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA. IMPORTANCE This report establishes and validates a standard operating procedure (SOP) for select agents (SAs) and other biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) RNA viruses to rapidly generate noninfectious, barcoded cDNA amenable for next-generation sequencing (NGS). This eliminates the burden of testing all processed samples derived from high-consequence pathogens prior to transfer from high-containment laboratories to lower-containment facilities for sequencing. Our established protocol can be scaled up for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost and effort required for NGS library construction. NGS data from this SOP can provide complete genome coverage from viral stocks and can also detect virus-specific reads from limited starting material. Our data suggest that the procedure can be implemented and easily validated by institutional biosafety committees across research laboratories.","Moser, Lindsey A.; Ramirez-Carvajal, Lisbeth; Puri, Vinita; Pauszek, Steven J.; Matthews, Krystal; Dilley, Kari A.; Mullan, Clancy; McGraw, Jennifer; Khayat, Michael; Beeri, Karen; Yee, Anthony; Dugan, Vivien; Heise, Mark T.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Rodriguez, Luis L.; Bernard, Kristen A.; Wentworth, David E.; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Shabman, Reed S.",mSystems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27822536/,154

The resulting copolymers exhibited number average molecular weights (M(n)) of 3.73–5.23 × 10(4) g/mol with a variable polydispersity (PDI = 2.3–3.8). The amide group of the PMA/PSA polymer was used for grafting poly (-styrene-maleic acid substituted aromatic 2-aminopyridine) by the Hantzsch reaction using a substituted aromatic aldehyde, malononitrile, and ammonium acetate.

Moreover, the polymer showed the fluorescence spectra of the copolymer had a strong, broad emission band between 300 to 550 nm (maximum wavelength 538 nm) under excitation at 293 nm. The Hantzsch reaction yields an interesting class of nitrogen-based heterocycles that combine with a synthetic strategy for synthesis of grafted co-polymer pyridine-styrene derivatives. The as-prepared pyridine-based polymer compounds were screened against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, where a maximum inhibition zone toward all four types of bacteria was observed, including specific antifungal activity.

In building these models, we collected > 500,000 data points, encompassing experimentally measured molecular association data of > 160,000 unique ligands against > 250 GPCRs. These data points were retrieved from the GPCR-Ligand Association (GLASS) database. We have used diverse molecular featurization methods to describe the input molecules. Multiple supervised ML algorithms were developed, tested and compared for their accuracy, F scores, as well as for their Matthews’ correlation coefficient scores (MCC). Our data suggest that combined with molecular fingerprinting, ensemble decision trees and gradient boosted trees ML algorithms are on the accuracy border of the rather sophisticated deep neural nets (DNNs)-based algorithms. On a test dataset, these models displayed an excellent performance, reaching a ~ 90% classification accuracy. Additionally, we showcase a few examples where our models were able to identify interesting connections between known drugs from the Drug-Bank database and members of the GPCR family of receptors. Our findings are in excellent agreement with previously reported experimental observations in the literature. We hope the models presented in this paper synergize with the currently ongoing interest of applying machine learning modeling in the field of drug repurposing and computational drug discovery in general.","Ahmed, Marawan; Hasani, Horia Jalily; Kalyaanamoorthy, Subha; Barakat, Khaled",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88939-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947911/,154

This study was conducted on a farrow-to-finish farm that experienced a PED outbreak beginning on January 6, 2014. Blood samples were collected at weaning from 19 to 20 sows every month from July 2013 until July 2014 to investigate the ovarian condition. The mean progesterone concentration was numerically higher during January 2014 than the other months, but this difference was not significant. The mean estradiol-17β concentration was higher during January 2014 than during July and October 2013 (P < 0.05). In addition, reproductive performance was compared during January, February, and March before (2013) and after (2014) the PED outbreak. Sows that farrowed in January had higher preweaning mortality in 2014 than in 2013 (P < 0.05), but sows that farrowed in February and March had similar preweaning mortality in 2013 and 2014 (P > 0.10). Sows that farrowed between January and March 2014 had 15% lower farrowing rate than those that farrowed during the same months in 2013 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results demonstrate poorer reproductive performance of Berkshire sows after a PED outbreak compared with before the outbreak.","Sasaki, Yosuke; Kawabata, Tadahiro; Noguchi, Michiko",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-017-1257-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281162/,154

The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID‐19 patients admitted to both intensive care unit and medical ward. Consecutive patients admitted for COVID‐19 to medical ward and intensive care unit at Padua University Hospital, all receiving thromboprophylaxis, underwent systematic ultrasonography of internal jugular, upper and lower limbs veins every 7(±1) days after the admission; and if negative, once‐weekly until discharge or death. In case of suspected pulmonary embolism, a multi‐detector computed tomographic angiography was performed. The primary outcome was the proportion of any deep‐vein thrombosis and symptomatic pulmonary embolism in both groups. An extended blood coagulative test was performed as well. From March 4 to April 30, 2020 a total of 85 patients were investigated, 44 (52%) in medical ward and 41 (48%) in intensive care unit. Despite thromboprophylaxis, venous thromboembolism occurred in 12 medical ward (27.3%) and 31 intensive care unit patients (75.6%) with an Odds Ratio of 9.3 (95%CI, 3.5 to 24.5;p<0.001). Multiple‐site deep‐vein thrombosis occurred in 55.6% of patients (95%CI, 39.6 to 70.5). Increased D‐Dimer levels significantly correlated with venous thromboembolism (p=0.001) and death (p=0.015). Summarizing, COVID‐19 patients admitted to medical ward or intensive care unit showed a high frequency of venous thromboembolism, despite standard‐ or high‐dose thromboprophylaxis.

METHODS: Ventilation rates were measured in 105 outpatient clinic rooms categorized by services rendered. Building characteristics were evaluated as determinants of ventilation rates, and risk of disease transmission was estimated using the Gammaitoni-Nucci model. RESULTS: When compared to Standard 170, 10% of clinic rooms assessed did not meet the minimum requirement for general exam rooms, 39% did not meet the requirement for treatment rooms, 83% did not meet the requirement for aerosol-generating procedures, and 88% did not meet the requirement for procedure rooms or minor surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Lower than standard air changes per hour were observed and could lead to an increased risk of spread of diseases when conducting advanced procedures and evaluating persons of interest for emerging infectious diseases.

As we all know, dyslipidemia is a leading pathogenic risk factor for ASCVD, which leads to cardiac ischemic injury and myocardial infarction. Dyslipidemias include hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and decreased high density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-c). Mutations of dyslipidemia related genes have been proved to be the crucial contributor to the development of AS and ASCVD. In this study, a Han-Chinese family with ASCVD was enrolled and the lipid testing discovered an obvious reduced levels of HDL-c in the affected members. We then performed whole exome sequencing to detect the candidate genes of the family. After data filtering, a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation (NM_007168: c.3460C>T; p.R1154X) of ABCA8 was detected and validated to be co-separated in the family members by Sanger sequencing. Previous studies have proved that deleterious heterozygous ABCA8 variants may disrupt cholesterol efflux and reduce HDL-c levels in humans and mice. This study may be the second report related to ABCA8 mutations in patients with reduced levels of HDL-c. Our study not only contributed to the genetic counseling and prenatal genetic diagnosis of patients with ASCVD caused by reduced HDL-c levels, but also provided a new sight among ABCA8, cholesterol efflux and HDL-c levels.","Wang, Chen-Yu; Chen, Ya-Qin; Jin, Jie-Yuan; Du, Ran; Fan, Liang-Liang; Xiang, Rong",Front Genet,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760429/,154

The aim of this study was to assess four commercial serological tests from EUROIMMUN, DiaSorin, Abbott, and Roche as well as an in-house immunofluorescence and neutralization test for their capability to identify SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals in a high-prevalence setting. Therefore, 42 social and working contacts of a German super-spreader were tested. Consistent with a high-prevalence setting, 26 of 42 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive by neutralization test (NT), and immunofluorescence test (IFT) confirmed 23 of these 26 positive test results (NT 61.9% and IFT 54.8% seroprevalence). Four commercial assays detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 33.3-40.5% individuals. Besides an overall discrepancy between the NT and the commercial assays regarding their sensitivity, this study revealed that commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike-based assays are better to predict the neutralization titer than nucleoprotein-based assays are.

Although the close relation between CVD and COVID-19 outcomes is well established, contrasting data exists about the occurrence of HF complications during COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a specific algorithm focused on diagnostic differentiation in acute patients distinguishing between acute HF and acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 is needed. Further, several concerns exist for the management of patients with an uncertain diagnosis and acute dyspnea, the exact relationship existing between COVID-19 and HF. Therefore, the treatment for subjects with both COVID-19 and HF and which criteria may be defined for domiciliary or hospital management, remain poorly defined.

The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. The knowledge, attitudes and practices people hold toward the disease play an integral role in determining a society's readiness to accept behavioural change measures from health authorities. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking recautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia.

Delhi was worst affected by COVID-19. However, when it was fast returning back to normal after about 6 months with minimum fatalities, it suddenly encountered a reversal with a 10 fold increase in infection counts, coinciding with the onset of the stubble burning period in neighbouring states. We hereby report that the crop residue burning induced lethal aged Black carbon-rich particles which engulfs Delhi during the post-monsoon months of October–November are strongly associated with COVID-19 and largely responsible for the sudden surge. It is found that the virus efficacy is not necessarily related to any particulates but it is more of source-based toxicity of its component where the virus is piggybacking. We conclude that the aged biomass BC particles tend to aggregate and react with other compounds to grow in size, providing temporary habitat to viruses leading to the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases which declined after the crop burning stopped.","Rathod, Aditi; Beig, Gufran",Urban Clim,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095521001437?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258181/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100913; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212095521001437,154

As an essential service, community pharmacists have been enacting a key role in patient counseling and supply of essential medicines and protective equipment. OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists’ perspectives of the role of educational institutes and professional pharmacy organizations in supporting them to take on roles during COVID-19 pandemic and to identify barriers to be able to support themselves and their patients. METHODS: This descriptive mixed-method study was conducted via a cross-sectional online survey distributed to pharmacists/pharmacy students in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (15–30 March 2020) using an online questionnaire, followed by an online focus group. Questionnaire items related to participants’ perspectives in being prepared for and supported in their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic, and items were tested for face validity. Data were descriptively analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and triangulated with focus group findings. RESULTS: Considering that fear and anxiety are a consequence of mass social distancing/quarantine, study participants (n = 726, age = 26.9 (SD = 8.0) years, 71.9% females), reported needing training on mental healthcare to be able to support themselves and people during pandemics (90.2%). Most respondents agreed/strongly agreed (59.7%) with the statement around pharmacy educators/educational institutes having a key role in preparing pharmacists for practice during epidemics/pandemics and agreed that their faculties should add a course regarding pandemic preparedness in their curriculum (89.9%). Results were similar regarding roles for the pharmaceutical associations. Focus group findings (n = 7) mirrored the survey findings to a large extent.

METHODS: We analysed blood cultures of patients presenting and admitted to a London hospital group between January 2020 and February 2021. We reported BSI incidence, as well as changes in sampling, case mix, healthcare capacity, and COVID-19 variants. RESULTS: 34,044 blood cultures were taken. We identified 1,047 BSIs; 653 (62.4%) community-acquired and 394 (37.6%) hospital-acquired. Important changes in patterns were seen. Among community-acquired BSIs, Escherichia coli BSIs remained lower than pre-pandemic level during COVID-19 waves, however peaked following lockdown easing in May 2020, deviating from the historical trend of peaking in August. The hospital-acquired BSI rate was 100.4 per 100,000 patient-days across the pandemic, increasing to 132.3 during the first wave and 190.9 during the second, with significant increase seen in elective inpatients. Patients who developed a hospital-acquired BSI, including those without COVID-19, experienced 20.2 excess days of hospital stay and 26.7% higher mortality, higher than reported in pre-pandemic literature. In intensive care, the BSI rate was 421.0 per 100,000 patient-ICU days during the second wave, compared to 101.3 pre-COVID. The BSI incidence in those infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant was similar to that seen with earlier variants. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic and national responses have impacted the patterns of community- and hospital-acquired BSIs, in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science direct, were searched to detect relevant publications up to April 16, 2020. Depending on the heterogeneity between studies, a fixed‐ or random‐effects model was applied to pool data. Publication bias Egger's test was also performed. RESULTS: Meta‐analysis of 20 retrospective studies (3428 patients), identified that patients with a severe manifestation of COVID‐19 exhibited significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin values with prolonged prothrombin time. Furthermore, lower albumin level was associated with a severe presentation of COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Liver dysfunction was associated with a severe outcome of COVID‐19 disease. Close monitoring of the occurrence of liver dysfunction is beneficial in early warning of unfavorable outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

638962,Focusing On A Unique Innate Memory Cell Population Of Natural Killer Cells In The Fight Against COVID-19: Harnessing The Ubiquity Of Cytomegalovirus Exposure,2020-07-01,"Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This paper presents an approach that combines a well-established approach from transportation modelling that uses person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of different room sizes, air exchange rates, disease import, changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), masks, indoors vs. outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. The model is validated against the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. The model predicts the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, masks, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors in fall, and is thus able to quantitatively predict the consequences of interventions. It is shown that these effects are best given as additive changes of the reinfection rate R. The model also explains why contact reductions have decreasing marginal returns, i.e. the first 50% of contact reductions have considerably more effect than the second 50%. Our work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different lockdown measures, or consequences of wearing masks in certain situations. The results can be used to inform political decisions.","MuÌller, S.

639273,Analysis of viral infection and biomarkers in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2017-06-15,"OBJECTIVES: Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is the most common cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including Haiti. Our objective was to detect pathogens found in children with ARI in rural Haiti to help develop evidence-based guidelines for treatment and prevention. METHODS: Retrospective study of students with ARI at four schools in rural Haiti. Viral and/or bacterial pathogens were identified by qPCR in 177 nasal swabs collected from April 2013 through November 2015. RESULTS: Most common viruses detected were Rhinovirus (36%), Influenza A (16%) and Adenovirus (7%), and bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%). Compared to older children, children aged 3–5 years had more Influenza A (28% vs. 9%, p = 0.002) and Adenovirus detected (14% vs. 3%, p = 0.01). Similarly, S. pneumoniae was greatest in children 3–5 years old (71% 3–5yrs; 58% 6–15 years; 25% 16–20 years; p = 0.008). Children 3–10 years old presented with fever more than children 11–20 years old (22% vs 7%; p = 0.02) and were more often diagnosed with pneumonia (28% vs 4%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Younger children had increased fever, pneumonia, and detection of Influenza A and S. pneumoniae. These data support the need for influenza and pneumococcus vaccination in early childhood in Haiti.","Kim, Yong Yean; Lew, Judy F.; Keith, Bahareh; Telisma, Taina; Nelson, Eric J.; Brantly, Alexis C.; Chavannes, Sonese; Anilis, Gina; Yang, Yang; Liu, Mingjin; Alam, Meer Taifur; Rashid, Mohammed H.; Morris, John Glenn; Madsen Beau De Rochars, Valery E.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971219300670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772468/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.02.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219300670,154

We studied the impact of recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and new coronaviruses (HCoV‐NL63 and HKU1) on the global epidemiology of ARTI. From October 2006 to April 2007, 237 pediatric patients affected by ARTI were enrolled in our study. Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. One hundred twenty‐four out of 237 samples (52.3%) were positive for one or more viruses. Picornaviruses were the most prevalent viruses (n = 61, 43.6%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (n = 34, 24.3%) and Adenovirus (n = 25, 17.9%); hMPV (n = 9, 6.4%) was the fourth most common virus detected. HBoV and HCoV showed a low prevalence (respectively 2.9% and 2.1%). RSV was the prevalent agent of LRTI (38%). Viruses were identified in more than 50% of the studied ARTI, providing useful information on clinical features and epidemiology of specific agents affecting children in cold months. Although routine surveillance of respiratory viruses does not seem cost‐effective, continuous monitoring of ARTI etiology could be a useful tool for planning resources for the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents.

Here, we assessed the effects of 679 COVID-19-risk variants on gene expression in a wide-range of immune cell types. Severe COVID-19-risk variants were significantly associated with the expression of 11 protein-coding genes, and overlapped with either target gene promoter or cis-regulatory regions that interact with target promoters in the cell types where their effects are most prominent. For example, we identified that the association between variants in the 3p21.31 risk locus and the expression of CCR2 in classical monocytes is likely mediated through an active cis-regulatory region that interacted with CCR2 promoter specifically in monocytes. The expression of several other genes showed prominent genotype-dependent effects in non-classical monocytes, NK cells, B cells, or specific T cell subtypes, highlighting the potential of COVID-19 genetic risk variants to impact the function of diverse immune cell types and influence severe disease manifestations.","Schmiedel, Benjamin J.; Chandra, Vivek; Rocha, Job; Gonzalez-Colin, Cristian; Bhattacharyya, Sourya; Madrigal, Ariel; Ottensmeier, Christian H.; Ay, Ferhat; Vijayanand, Pandurangan",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299987/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407429,154

Being an ADHD child’s parent is a daunting and sometimes stressful job that becomes more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative consequences. This cross-sectional study was applied to 54 mothers of ADHD children and adolescents; the data of the ADHD children and adolescents have been registered before the lockdown on their regular follow-up visits on the child and adolescent’s clinic of the psychiatry department. Data of the study were collected through an electronic Google form included a COVID-19 questionnaire, The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale—21 Items (DASS-21) (Arabic version), and Conners’ Parent Rating Scale Revised-short version (CPRS-48). We aimed to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among the mothers of ADHD children and adolescents during COVID-19 outbreaks and determine the relationship between these symptoms and the changed circumstances that occurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, also with the behavioral problem of their children that may deteriorate by their mothers’ psychological state. RESULTS: Most of our participants were from the low socioeconomic class and were married. In total, 29.6% of the mother of ADHD children had confirmed COVID-19 cases among their family members, while 11.1% of our subjects lost a family member due to this epidemic, 22% of our sample lost their work because of COVID-19. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a big financial drawback on the family of our participants by a percentage of 31.5%. We noticed that 48.1% of our sample documented domestic violence toward them compared to before COVID-19. A total of 92.6% of the mothers who participated in our study assessed the period of change and restrictions as being very demanding. We found that 74.1% of ADHD patients were not compliant with their medications than before the epidemic. Also, we found that the mothers of ADHD children have bigger challenges in managing the child’s meals, structured activities, and sleep compared to before COVID-19. We showed that 53.7% of the mothers had depressive symptoms, 61% had anxiety symptoms, and 53.7% had stress symptoms. These symptoms were statistically associated with the lost family member due to COVID-19, the financial drawbacks of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the domestic violence toward mothers, compared to before COVID-19, the non-compliance of their children on the medications compared to before COVID-19, the presence of confirmed COVID-19 cases among family members, mother’s assessment of the period of change and restrictions as being very demanding compared to before COVID-19, and the non-compliance of their children on the medications compared to before COVID-19 as well as the increased behavioral symptoms of their children. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has psychological influences on mothers of children with ADHD. A significant number of them may have depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms that could affect their children’s compliance with the medication and, consequently, their symptomatology.","Yousef, Amira Mohamed; Sehlo, Mohammad Gamal; Mohamed, Amany Elshabrawy",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43045-021-00139-z,154

DNA fragmentation in tiny microdroplets, which was produced by electrosonically spraying (+3 kV) a room temperature aqueous solution containing 10 μM DNA and 10 μg ml(−1) DNase I from a homemade setup, takes less than 1 ms. High differentiation/identification fidelity could be obtained by applying a cosine correlation measure for similarity assessment between two fragment mass patterns, which compares both mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) with an error tolerance of 5 ppm and the peaks’ relative intensities. A single-nucleotide mutation in the sequence of bases, as exemplified by the sickle cell anemia mutation, is differentiated by setting a cutoff value of similarity at 90%. The order change of two adjacent bases in the sequence could still be well discriminated with a similarity of only 62% between the fragment mass patterns of the two similar sequences, which have the same molecular weights and thus cannot be differentiated by gel electrophoresis or direct mass detection by mass spectrometry. Compared to traditional genotyping methods, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the identification process with our approach could be completed within several minutes without any other expensive and complicated reagents or experimental steps. The potential of our approach for convenient and fast microbe genetic discrimination or identification is further demonstrated by differentiating the Orf1ab gene fragments of two similar coronaviruses with a very high sequence homologous rate of 96%, SARS-CoV-2 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, with a similarity of 0% between their fragment mass patterns.","Zhong, Xiaoqin; Chen, Hao; Zare, Richard N.",QRB Discov,https://doi.org/10.1017/qrd.2021.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192264/,154

The objective of this report is to describe the characteristics and outcome observed among 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest academic hospital in KSA, and assess co-infection with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods: This single-center case series data included select epidemiological, clinical, radiological features and laboratory findings of all confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC), Riyadh, KSA, from March 22 until May 31, 2020, followed through June 6, 2020. We conducted retrospective analysis of listed data from 99 hospitalized patients and present characteristics and factors associated with severity in percentages and univariate odds ratios. Cases were confirmed using nasopharyngeal or throat swab by real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. Results: The 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in this analysis constitute 16% of 632 positive SARS-CoV-2 among 6633 persons who were tested at the KSUMC (positivity rate, 9.4%). MERS-CoV PCR was negative in all 99 patients tested. The majority of these 99 hospitalized patients were males (66%), had a mean age of 44 years (range, 19–87), and a quarter (25.3%) were health care workers. Patients with comorbid conditions accounted for 52.5% of patients including the 8.1% who were asymptomatic; diabetes mellitus being the most frequent (31.3%), followed by hypertension (22.2%). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (67.7%), cough (60.6%), dyspnea (43.4%), upper respiratory symptoms (27.3%), fatigue (26.3%), diarrhea (19.2%) and loss of smell (9.1%). The clinical conditions among these 99 patients included upper respiratory tract infection (47.5%), abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers a fifth (21%) of patients had moderate pneumonia, while 7% had severe pneumonia with 22.2% requiring admission to the intensive care unit and 12.1% died. Late presentation with severe disease, an abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin), and end organ damage (high creatinine or high aspartate aminotransferase) were predictors for admission to critical care unit or died. Conclusion: We observed no MERS-CoV co-infection in this early cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were relatively young, more than half had comorbid conditions, presented with fever and/or cough, an abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, and high inflammatory markers.

Until a decade and half ago, IDs were the major cause of both morbidity and mortality accounting 70% for both. However, as a result of various preventive measures implemented by both the state and non-state actors, the overall IDs have shown a changing (declining) trend. The most impressive decline has been seen in the intestinal helminth infection. Though the overall burden of IDs is decreasing, several newer infectious diseases (emerging infections) namely, dengue fever, scrub typhus, influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), and others are posing a great public health problem. On the other hand, though sporadic, outbreaks of endemic diseases together with HIV-TB coinfection and infection with drug resistance microbes during recent years have constituted a serious public health as well as medical problem. On the contrary, with the decline of IDs, noninfectious diseases (noncommunicable disease, NCD) namely, diabetes, cancer (and cancer therapy), and others are on the rise particularly in urban areas. Hence, currently Nepal is trapped in “double burden” of diseases. Risk of opportunistic infection has increased in immunocompromised person with NCD.

DESIGN: Stepwise demonstration of the technique with narrated video footage. SETTING: A urogenital fistula in developed countries mostly occurs after gynecologic surgeries but rarely from obstetric complications. The main treatment of a urogenital fistula is either transvaginal or transabdominal surgical repair. We present a case of a 36-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 3-0-0-3, who developed a complicated large vesico-[utero]/cervicovaginal fistula after an emergent repeat cesarean section. Robotic repair was performed 2 months after the injury using the modified O'Connor method. Blood loss was minimal, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 1 day postoperatively. Follow-up showed complete healing of the fistula with no urine leakage, frequency of urination, or dyspareunia. The patient resumed normal bladder function and menstrual period up to 4 months after the repair procedure. INTERVENTIONS: The basic surgical principle of urogenital fistula repair is demonstrated: (1) development of vesicovaginal spaces by dissection of the bladder from the uterus and the vagina, (2) meticulous hemostasis, (3) adequate freshened of the fistula edges, (4) tension-free and watertight closure of the bladder. We also demonstrate some other techniques that have developed though our own practice: (1) facilitating bladder distention by temporarily blocking the fistula, (2) placement of a ureteral catheter to protect the ureters, (3) interposition with omental flap, (4) single layer through and through closure of a cystotomy with 2-0 V-Loc suture (Covidien, Irvington, NJ).

648335,Coinfection of Parvovirus B19 with Influenza A/H1N1 Causes Fulminant Myocarditis and Pneumonia. An Autopsy Case Report,2021-07-29,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after cardiac surgery is reported with a widely variable incidence (from 0.4%-8.1%). Cardiac surgery patients usually are affected by several comorbidities, and the development of ARDS significantly affects their prognosis. Herein, evidence regarding the current knowledge in the field of ARDS in cardiac surgery is summarized and is followed by a discussion on therapeutic strategies, with consideration of the peculiar aspects of ARDS after cardiac surgery. Prevention of lung injury during and after cardiac surgery remains pivotal. Blood product transfusions should be limited to minimize the risk, among others, of lung injury. Open lung ventilation strategy (ventilation during cardiopulmonary bypass, recruitment maneuvers, and the use of moderate positive end-expiratory pressure) has not shown clear benefits on clinical outcomes. Clinicians in the intraoperative and postoperative ventilatory settings carefully should consider the effect of mechanical ventilation on cardiac function (in particular the right ventricle). Driving pressure should be kept as low as possible, with low tidal volumes (on predicted body weight) and optimal positive end-expiratory pressure. Regarding the therapeutic options, management of ARDS after cardiac surgery challenges the common approach. For instance, prone positioning may not be easily applicable after cardiac surgery. In patients who develop ARDS after cardiac surgery, extracorporeal techniques may be a valid choice in experienced hands. The use of neuromuscular blockade and inhaled nitric oxide can be considered on a case-by-case basis, whereas the use of aggressive lung recruitment and oscillatory ventilation should be discouraged.","Sanfilippo, Filippo; Palumbo, Gaetano J.; Bignami, Elena; Pavesi, Marco; Ranucci, Marco; Scolletta, Sabino; Pelosi, Paolo; Astuto, Marinella",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2021.04.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030957/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053077021003505; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053077021003505,154

The development of an effective vaccine will take several months to become available, and its affordability is unpredictable. Transfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) may provide passive immunity. Based on initial data from China, a group of hematologists, infectious disease specialists, and intensivists drafted this protocol in March 2020. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of CP in treating patients with COVID-19 across Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Eligible patients with COVID-19 will be recruited for CP infusion according to the inclusion criteria. As COVID-19 has proven to be a moving target as far as its management is concerned, we will use current definitions according to the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. All CP recipients will receive supportive management including all available recommended therapies according to the available MOH guidelines. Eligible CP donors will be patients with COVID-19 who have fully recovered from their disease according to MOH recovery criteria as detailed in the inclusion criteria. CP donors have to qualify as blood donors according to MOH regulations except for the history of COVID-19 in the recent past. We will also test the CP donors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by a rapid test, and aliquots will be archived for future antibody titration. Due to the perceived benefit of CP, randomization was not considered. However, we will compare the outcome of the cohort treated with CP with those who did not receive CP due to a lack of consent or lack of availability. In this national collaborative study, there is a likelihood of not finding exactly matched control group patients. Hence, we plan to perform a propensity score matching of the CP recipients with the comparator group patients for the major characteristics. We plan to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of both groups and compare the outcomes. A total sample size of 575 patients, 115 CP recipients and 460 matched controls (1:4 ratio), will be sufficient to detect a clinically important hospital stay and 30-day mortality difference between the two groups with 80% power and a 5% level of significance. RESULTS: At present, patient recruitment is still ongoing, and the interim analysis of the first 40 patients will be shared soon. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we present a protocol for a national collaborative multicenter phase II study in Saudi Arabia for assessing the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of CP in treating patients with severe COVID-19. We plan to publish an interim report of the first 40 CP recipients and their matched comparators soon.

METHODS: One hundred subjects were included. Nineteen index COVID-19 cases and eighty-one traced close contacts were screened for coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by rapid test. RESULTS: Thirty-four (42%) contacts in the study were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-three (67.6%) manifested less than two respiratory symptoms, and five (14.7%) remained asymptomatic. The average of positive contacts by index COVID-19 case (R(0)) was 4.3 and the mean of time of positive COVID-19 test at sampling time was 18.9 days. Positive antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 16% of the participants. CONCLUSION: The proportion of close contacts of COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (42%) and with less than two or with no respiratory symptoms (82.4%) was high in the study population. A low proportion of COVID-19 patients had a positive test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The screening for SARS-CoV-2 in close contacts of COVID-19 positive patients should be encouraged to avoid spreading the infection and the expansion of the disease.","Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L.; Ríos-Jasso, Jorge; Garza-Veloz, Idalia; Reyes-Veyna, Lucia; Cerda-Luna, Rosa Maria; Duque-Jara, Iliana; Galvan-Jimenez, Maribel; Ramirez-Hernandez, Leticia A; Morales-Esquivel, Andres; Ortiz-Castro, Yolanda; Gutierrez-Camacho, Jose R; Valdes-Aguayo, José J; Vargas-Rodriguez, Jose R",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320308981; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320308981?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035601/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.10.002,154

We evaluated the adoption of evidence-based treatment in the post-MAGIC era and its impact on survival. METHODS: A total of 7058 patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma undergoing definitive surgical resection between 2004 and 2015 were analyzed using the National Cancer Database. RESULTS: Over the study period, the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant CRT decreased from 19.1% to 9.1%, while perioperative chemotherapy increased from 1.9% to 28.6%. Utilization of perioperative chemotherapy surpassed adjuvant CRT in 2011. Evidence-based treatment (either perioperative chemotherapy or adjuvant CRT) had better overall survival (OS) than other treatments for clinical stage II–III patients (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis of the whole study period, evidence-based treatments were associated with better OS (HR 0.67 [0.60–0.74], p < 0.05). Only 360/1262 (28.5%) patients in the perioperative chemotherapy group completed postoperative therapy, which was associated with improved OS (p < 0.05). For clinical stage III patients (n = 2402), only 806 (33.6%) received evidence-based treatment, while 487 (22.2%) underwent surgery alone. On multivariate analysis of these patients between 2010 and 2015, both perioperative chemotherapy (HR 0.49 [0.35–0.68]) and adjuvant CRT (HR 0.31 [0.21–0.44]) were associated with better OS than surgery alone (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Since the INT-0116 and MAGIC trials, utilization of evidence-based treatments for resectable gastric adenocarcinoma has increased, with perioperative chemotherapy surpassing adjuvant CRT as the preferred practice. However, overall utilization of these regimens remains quite low nationally despite association with improved OS.","Lee, Tiffany C.; Wima, Koffi; Morris, Mackenzie C.; Johnston, Michael E.; Shah, Shimul A.; Ahmad, Syed A.; Patel, Sameer H.; Wilson, Gregory C.",J Gastrointest Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-020-04868-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201456/,154

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case series, we retrospectively analysed clinical, laboratory and cardiopulmonary parameters of six patients with life-threatening COVID-19 receiving convalescent plasma (CP) as rescue therapy between April 11, 2020 to October 10, 2020. Clinical and laboratory parameters before and after transfusion were compared in two B-cell-depleted patients and four B-cell sufficient patients (control group). RESULTS: Both B-cell-depleted patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 virus and survived, while all other patients died within 14 days from intervention despite maximal therapeutic efforts. D-dimer levels increased in both cohorts subsequent to CPT. In control patients, mean Interleukin-6 increased and platelet levels decreased as opposed to decreasing and stable levels in B-cell-depleted patients, respectively. Control patients required increased doses of vasopressor compared to decreasing doses in B-cell depleted patients subsequent to CPT. PO(2)/FiO(2) decrease was more pronounced and respiratory deterioration required postinterventional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in two control patients. Transpulmonary thermodilution revealed a further increase of the Extravascular Lung Water Index upon CPT in control patients. CONCLUSION: Use of CP in late stages of life-threatening COVID-19 should be used with caution but may be beneficial in B-cell-depleted patients. Further studies are necessary to assess factors predicting potential therapeutic benefits as well as possible hazards.","Erber, Johanna; Wiessner, Johannes R.; Huberle, Christina; Schneider, Jochen; Mijočević, Hrvoje; von Bomhard, Doris; Luppa, Peter; Schmid, Roland M.; Rasch, Sebastian; Lahmer, Tobias",Transfus Apher Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050221002780?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050221002780; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2021.103278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548246/,154

Engineering simulation, which employs computational fluid dynamics, provides a convenient means of investigating airflow behaviour in isolation rooms for various ventilation arrangements. A cough model was constructed to permit the numerical simulation of virus diffusion inside an isolation room for different ventilation system configurations. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of virus diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was also performed for each ventilation arrangement. The numerical results presented in this paper indicate that the parallel-directional airflow pattern is the most effective means of controlling flows containing virus droplets. Additionally, staggering the positions of the supply vents at the door end of the room relative to the exhaust vents on the wall behind the bed head provides effective infection control and containment. These results suggest that this particular ventilation arrangement enhances the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.","Kao, P.H.; Yang, R.J.",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670105003634; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670105003634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16359753/,154

Artemisinin and its antimalarial properties were discovered by the Chinese scientist Tu Youyu, who became one of the laureates of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this breakthrough in tropical medicine. It is a commonly used anti-malaria drug. Artemisinin has recently been repurposed as a potential COVID-19 drug. Its documented anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity has been attributed to its ability to inhibit spike-protein mediated and TGF-β-dependent early steps in the infection process as well as its ability to disrupt the post-entry intracellular events of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle required for viral replication. In addition, Artemisinin has anti-inflammatory activity and reduces the systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to cytokine storm and inflammatory organ injury in high-risk COVID-19 patients. We postulate that Artemisinin may prevent the worsening of the health condition of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 when administered early in the course of their disease.","Uckun, Fatih M.; Saund, Saran; Windlass, Hitesh; Trieu, Vuong",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815126/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.649532,154

The pandemic has exposed inequities in existing institutional structure and policies concerning clinical workload, research productivity, and/or teaching excellence inadvertently privileging those who do not have significant caregiving responsibilities or those who have the resources to pay for their management. METHODS: We sought to identify the challenges facing multidisciplinary faculty and trainees with dependents, and highlight a number of possible strategies to address challenges in work-life (im)balance. RESULTS: To date, there are no Canadian-based data to quantify the physical and mental effect of COVID-19 on health care workers, multidisciplinary faculty, and trainees. As the pandemic evolves, formal strategies should be discussed with an intersectional lens to promote equity in the workforce, including (but not limited to): (1) the inclusion of broad representation (including equal representation of women and other marginalized persons) in institutional-based pandemic response and recovery planning and decision-making; (2) an evaluation (eg, institutional-led survey) of the effect of the pandemic on work-life balance; (3) the establishment of formal dialogue (eg, workshops, training, and media campaigns) to normalize coexistence of work and caregiving responsibilities and to remove stigma of gender roles; (4) a reevaluation of workload and promotion reviews; and (5) the development of formal mentorship programs to support faculty and trainees. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a multistrategy approach needs to be considered by stakeholders (including policy-makers, institutions, and individuals) to create sustainable working conditions during and beyond this pandemic.","Banks, Laura; Randhawa, Varinder K.; Colella, Tracey J.F.; Dhanvantari, Savita; Connelly, Kim A.; Robinson, Lisa; Mak, Susanna; Ouzounian, Maral; Mulvagh, Sharon L.; Straus, Sharon; Allan, Katherine; Yin Yip, Cindy Ying; Graham, Michelle M.",CJC Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027367/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2020.12.027,154

Since there are several ways of visually communicating information, we investigate whether different types of visualizations affect how viewers judge the credibility of information as well as the complexity and potential harm of pathogens. A first experiment was conducted to assess whether a round, fluent shape elicits a different response than pathogens featuring disfluent components such as thread‐like appendages. Visualizations of disfluent bacteria were rated as more credible than those of fluent bacteria. In Experiment 2, bacteria were either presented as realistic renderings or as cartoon‐like line drawings (varied between‐subjects). Furthermore, half of the six bacteria had fluent shapes, while the other half featured disfluent shapes, resulting in the within‐subjects factor of fluency. Participants were asked to rate the credibility, complexity, and risk of serious illness associated with these bacteria. We found that disfluent bacteria were perceived as having a more complex metabolism and as holding a higher risk for serious illness. Furthermore, realism and disfluent shapes increase the credibility of visualizations, but not the credibility of additional information.

The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.","Kotfis, Katarzyna; Williams Roberson, Shawniqua; Wilson, Jo Ellen; Dabrowski, Wojciech; Pun, Brenda T.; Ely, E.

658368,Idiopathic Nonhistaminergic Acquired Angioedema in a Patient with COVID-19,2020-07-01,"Older adults are healthier and living independently within our communities for longer. This demonstrates the need to build capacity in geriatric preventative services, with the potential to utilize health promotion to encourage successful aging. This scoping review examines the availability and potential of health promotion initiatives for community-dwelling older adults in Canada. Two research databases were searched for empirical articles published in Canada, in English, since 2000. A total of 17 articles met our inclusion criteria. The empirical literature demonstrates successful implementation of different primary prevention programs, with various facilitation methods used to address several health issues in late life. Most programs targeted falls prevention, often using education or exercise programming. Participants reported positive results in various biopsychosocial aspects of aging. Reported positive health outcomes and high engagement rates across examined programs may represent the ability for health promotion to successfully address the needs of older adults in the community, as well as meet the existing desire for participation in such initiatives. Further implementation and investment into health promotion for older adults can increase the accessibility of these programs across Canada, address new needs amongst this population, and alleviate the future healthcare burden posed by the growing aging demographic. The need for preventative services in gerontology is universal, thus the success seen in health promotion programs and policy, and the need for expansion, in Canada may also be relevant in countries with similar demographics.","Visconti, Christina; Neiterman, Elena",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34532164/,154

The emergence of highly transmissible novel viral strains that escape neutralizing responses emphasizes the urgent need to deepen our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and to develop additional therapeutic strategies. Using a comprehensive identification of RNA binding proteins (RBP) by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-M/S) approach, we identified 142 high-confidence cellular factors that bind the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome during infection. By systematically knocking down their expression in a human lung epithelial cell line, we found that the majority of the RBPs identified in our study are proviral factors that regulate SARS-CoV-2 genome replication. We showed that some of these proteins represented drug targets of interest for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive view of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome during infection and highlights candidates for host-centered antiviral therapies.","Labeau, Athéna; Lefevre-Utile, Alain; Bonnet-Madin, Lucie; Fery-Simonian, Luc; Soumelis, Vassili; Lotteau, Vincent; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Amara, Ali; Meertens, Laurent",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436611,154

Here, we report a monoclonal antibody (mAb), MW05, showing high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity by disrupting the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Crosslinking of Fc with Fc{gamma}RIIB mediates antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity by MW05. This activity was eliminated by introducing the LALA mutation to the Fc region (MW05/LALA). Most importantly, potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in rhesus monkeys. A single dose of MW05/LALA completely blocked the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a study of its prophylactic effect and totally cleared SARS-CoV-2 in three days in a treatment setting. These results pave the way for the development of MW05/LALA as an effective strategy for combating COVID-19.","Gui, Xun",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.222257,154

The range of natural hosts that supporting L. monocytogenes persistence in the environment has not been fully established yet. In this study, we were interested in the potential of L. monocytogenes to infect cells of bats, which are being increasingly recognized as a reservoir for microorganisms that are pathogenic to humans and domestic animals. A stable epithelial cell line was developed from the kidneys of Pipistrellus nathusii, a small bat widely distributed across Europe. The wild-type L. monocytogenes strain EGDe infected this cell line with an invasion efficiency of 0.0078 ± 0.0009%. Once it entered bat cells, L. monocytogenes doubled within about 70 min. When L. monocytogenes lacked either of the major invasion factors, InlA and InlB, invasion efficiency decreased by a factor of 10 and 25 respectively (p < 0.000001). The obtained results suggest that bat epithelial cells are susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and that L. monocytogenes invasion of bat cells depends on the major invasion factors InlA and InlB. These results constitute the first report on in vitro studies of L. monocytogenes infection in bats.","Povolyaeva, Olga; Chalenko, Yaroslava; Kalinin, Egor; Kolbasova, Olga; Pivova, Elena; Kolbasov, Denis; Yurkov, Sergey; Ermolaeva, Svetlana",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33105852/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9110867,154

Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to reveal new HIV-1 inhibitors. This approach led us to identify the RNA helicase DDX42 as an intrinsic antiviral inhibitor. DDX42 was previously described as a non-processive helicase, able to bind RNA secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes, with no clearly defined function ascribed. Our data show that depletion of endogenous DDX42 significantly increased HIV-1 DNA accumulation and infection in cell lines and primary cells. DDX42 overexpression inhibited HIV-1, whereas a dominant-negative mutant increased infection. Importantly, DDX42 also restricted retrotransposition of LINE-1, infection with other retroviruses and positive-strand RNA viruses, including CHIKV and SARS-CoV-2. However, DDX42 did not inhibit infection with three negative-strand RNA viruses, arguing against a general, unspecific effect on target cells, which was confirmed by RNA-seq analysis. DDX42 was found in the vicinity of viral elements by proximity ligation assays, and cross-linking RNA immunoprecipitation confirmed a specific interaction of DDX42 with RNAs from sensitive viruses. This strongly suggested a direct mode of action of DDX42 on viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Taken together, our results show for the first time a new and important role of DDX42 in intrinsic antiviral immunity.","Bonaventure, Boris; Rebendenne, Antoine; de Gracia, Francisco Garcia; McKellar, Joe; Gracias, Ségolène; Labaronne, Emmanuel; Tauziet, Marine; Valadão, Ana Luiza Chaves; Bernard, Eric; Briant, Laurence; Gros, Nathalie; Djilli, Wassila; Arnaud-Arnould, Mary; Courgnaud, Valérie; Parrinello, Hugues; Rialle, Stéphanie; Ricci, Emiliano; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Schulz, Reiner; Moncorgé, Olivier; Goujon, Caroline",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.359356,154

662682,Successful management of COVID-19 infection in two early post-liver transplant recipients,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Proliferation of misinformation in digital news environments can harm society in a number of ways, but its dangers are most acute when citizens believe that false news is factually accurate. A recent wave of empirical research focuses on factors that explain why people fall for the so-called fake news. In this scoping review, we summarize the results of experimental studies that test different predictors of individuals’ belief in misinformation. METHODS: The review is based on a synthetic analysis of 26 scholarly articles. The authors developed and applied a search protocol to two academic databases, Scopus and Web of Science. The sample included experimental studies that test factors influencing users’ ability to recognize fake news, their likelihood to trust it or intention to engage with such content. Relying on scoping review methodology, the authors then collated and summarized the available evidence. RESULTS: The study identifies three broad groups of factors contributing to individuals’ belief in fake news. Firstly, message characteristics—such as belief consistency and presentation cues—can drive people’s belief in misinformation. Secondly, susceptibility to fake news can be determined by individual factors including people’s cognitive styles, predispositions, and differences in news and information literacy. Finally, accuracy-promoting interventions such as warnings or nudges priming individuals to think about information veracity can impact judgements about fake news credibility. Evidence suggests that inoculation-type interventions can be both scalable and effective. We note that study results could be partly driven by design choices such as selection of stimuli and outcome measurement. CONCLUSIONS: We call for expanding the scope and diversifying designs of empirical investigations of people’s susceptibility to false information online. We recommend examining digital platforms beyond Facebook, using more diverse formats of stimulus material and adding a comparative angle to fake news research.","Bryanov, Kirill; Vziatysheva, Victoria",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166478/,154
663007,Sudden unexpected death caused by infantile acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,2021-08-13,"In this contribution, the classification of protein binding sites using the physicochemical properties exposed to their pockets is presented. We recently introduced Cavbase, a method for describing and comparing protein binding pockets on the basis of the geometrical and physicochemical properties of their active sites. Here, we present algorithmic and methodological enhancements in the Cavbase property description and in the cavity comparison step. We give examples of the Cavbase similarity analysis detecting pronounced similarities in the binding sites of proteins unrelated in sequence. A similarity search using SARS M(pro) protease subpockets as queries retrieved ligands and ligand fragments accommodated in a physicochemical environment similar to that of the query. This allowed the characterization of the protease recognition pockets and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be incorporated into novel antiviral compounds. A cluster analysis procedure for the functional classification of binding pockets was implemented and calibrated using a diverse set of enzyme binding sites. Two relevant protein families, the α-carbonic anhydrases and the protein kinases, are used to demonstrate the scope of our cluster approach. We propose a relevant classification of both protein families, on the basis of the binding motifs in their active sites. The classification provides a new perspective on functional properties across a protein family and is able to highlight features important for potency and selectivity. Furthermore, this information can be used to identify possible cross-reactivities among proteins due to similarities in their binding sites.","Kuhn, Daniel; Weskamp, Nils; Schmitt, Stefan; Hüllermeier, Eyke; Klebe, Gerhard",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16697007/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606004724; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606004724,154

METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, and 20C (first phase, February–May 2020), Pangolin lineages B.1.177 (we named Marseille-2) and B.1.160 (Marseille-4) variants (second phase, June–December 2020), and B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and A.27 (Marseille-501) variants (third phase, January 2021-today). Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death. RESULTS: During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others.

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms.

We examined COVID-19 related hospitalisations by city district and migration background in the municipality of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. METHODS: We used surveillance data on all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisations in Amsterdam until 31 May 2020, matched to municipal registration data on migration background. We calculated directly standardised (age, sex) rates (DSR) of hospitalisations, as a proxy of COVID-19 burden, per 100,000 population by city district and migration background. We calculated standardised rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) to compare hospitalisations between city districts of varying socio-economic and health status and between migration backgrounds. We evaluated the effects of city district and migration background on hospitalisation after adjusting for age and sex using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Between 29 February and 31 May 2020, 2326 cases (median age 57 years [IQR = 37–74]) were notified in Amsterdam, of which 596 (25.6%) hospitalisations and 287 (12.3%) deaths. 526/596 (88.2%) hospitalisations could be matched to the registration database. DSR were higher in individuals living in peripheral (South-East/New-West/North) city districts with lower economic and health status, compared to central districts (Centre/West/South/East) (RD = 36.87,95%CI = 25.79–47.96;RR = 1.82,95%CI = 1.65–1.99), and among individuals with a non-Western migration background compared to ethnic-Dutch individuals (RD = 57.05,95%CI = 43.34–70.75; RR = 2.36,95%CI = 2.17–2.54).

669368,A precision medicine approach to managing 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH)/Caffey disease is an inflammatory collagenopathy of infancy, manifested by subperiosteal bone hyperplasia. Genetically, ICH was linked with heterozygosity for an R836C mutation in the COL1A1 gene. Although an autosomal-recessive trait is also suspected, it has not been proven thus far. METHODS: A case of an infant male born to consanguineous parents is reported, presenting with classical findings, course, and clinical outcome of ICH. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in order to identify a possible underlying genetic defect. RESULTS: WES analysis revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in lysine 2 of fetuin-A, encoded by the ALPHA-2-HS-GLYCOPROTEIN (AHSG) gene (c.A4T; p.K2X). Fetuin-A is an important regulator of bone remodeling and an inhibitor of ectopic mineralization. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we show a complete deficiency of this protein in the patient’s serum, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: A novel homozygous nonsense mutation in AHSG gene has been found in ICH patient with a typical phenotype, resulting in fetuin-A deficiency. This finding postulates an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance in ICH, which, unlike the autosomal-dominant inheritance associated with COL1A1, is associated with AHSG and fetuin-A deficiency.","Merdler-Rabinowicz, Rona; Grinberg, Anna; Jacobson, Jeffrey M.; Somekh, Ido; Klein, Christoph; Lev, Atar; Ihsan, Salama; Habib, Adib; Somech, Raz; Simon, Amos J.",Pediatr Res,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0499-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288248/,154

This includes women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We evaluated the impacts of the first COVID-19 wave on parameters such as the GDM treatment, glycemic control, and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective study from a reference diabetes center (Krakow, Poland), we compared patient data from two different time periods: the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–June 2020) and the preceding five months (October 2019–February 2020). Data was collected from the medical records and telephone surveys. RESULTS: We included 155 consecutive women (group N1 = 73 and group N2 = 82 from the COVID-19 pandemic period and non-COVID-19 period, respectively). During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost half of all GDM women (N1 = 36, 49.3%) used telemedicine as a method of contacting their diabetic specialists while this tool was not utilized in the earlier period. Moreover, these patients reported difficulties in performing blood glucose self-control more often (N1 = 20, 27.4%, vs N2 = 7, 8.5%; p ≤ 0.01) and spent less time on diabetes education than the control group on average (N1 = 39, 53.4%, vs N2 = 9, 9.8% below 2 hours of training; p ≤ 0.01). Most analyzed glycemic parameters and pregnancy outcomes were similar. Differences were found with respect to the incidence of prolonged labor (N1 = 12, 16.4%, vs N2 = 3, 3.7%; p ≤ 0.01) and preeclampsia (N1 = 0 vs N2 = 7, 8.5%; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this single-center observational study, the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to have a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes in GDM women, despite the difficulties in diabetes management delivery.","Wilk, Magdalena; Surowiec, Paulina; Matejko, Bartłomiej; Wróbel, Albert; Zięba-Parkitny, Joanna; Cyganek, Katarzyna; Huras, Hubert; Małecki, Maciej T.",J Diabetes Res,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5515902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307689/,154

This study aims to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards infectious diseases related to travel among community pharmacists in Italy. The data was collected from September 2018 to September 2019 using semi-structured telephone interviews. Only 1.8% answered correctly to all seven questions regarding the infectious diseases related to travel. Community pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine and those who had received information were more likely to have good knowledge. More than two-thirds of the respondents believed that it is important to provide information to the public about travel medicine. Pharmacists who worked a higher number of hours per week, were more knowledgeable about the more frequent infectious diseases related to travel, believed that travel medicine was a pharmacist competency, believed that they could give advice to the public, and had received information from scientific journals and educational activities were more likely to have this positive attitude. More than two-thirds often/always informed the public about the importance of having travel health center counseling. Pharmacists who had heard about travel medicine and those who believed that they could give advice to the public were more likely to inform.

Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. METHODS: Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. RESULTS: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible). CONCLUSION: The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.","Xie, Mingxuan; Chen, Qiong",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302046?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247050/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.071,154

Elderly people, being more fragile, are the most affected by the severity and lethality of this disease. The NH and LTCU of the Amiens University Hospital registered their first Covid-19 cases in February 2020, which lead to the opening of a Covid-19 dedicated unit and of specific protocol for confinement. This descriptive study was analyzing the prevalence of Covid-19 seroconversion within the NH and the LTCU of the Amiens University Hospital. Both this screening test and the nasopharyngeal swab PCRs were in order to assess the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic in NH and LTCU. On June 15th and 16th, the serological tests for Covid-19 were positive for 146 (66.1%) of the residents tested. The seroconversion rate was significantly different (p < 0.001) between the NH (88.7%) and the LTCU (45.6%). During the epidemic, there was no excess mortality index within the NH and LTCU services of the Amiens University Hospital. Among frail patients, the role of immunosenescence can be discussed to account for the absence of this inflammatory reaction. This study showed that isolating the infected patient in a dedicated unit significantly reduces the risk of seroconversion and contamination compared to isolating them within their own unit.","Moyet, Julien; Joseph, Cédric; Brochot, Etienne; Defouilloy, Isabelle; Brasseur, Thierry; Smarandache, Camélia; Boutalha, Samir; Castelain, Sandrine; Schmit, Jean-Luc; Bloch, Frédéric",Geriatrie et psychologie neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387193/; https://doi.org/10.1684/pnv.2021.0952,154

The study participants were hospitalized in Tongji Hospital, Guanggu Branch, Wuhan, China, between February 1 and April 1, 2020. BPV was assessed as standard derivation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and variability independent of mean (VIM). The 79 participants included 60 (75.9%) severe patients discharged from the hospital after up to 47 days of hospitalization, and 19 (24.1%) critically ill patients transferred to other hospitals for further treatment (n = 13), admitted to ICU (n = 3) or died (n=3). Despite similar use of antihypertensive medication (47.4% vs. 41.7%) and mean levels of systolic/diastolic blood pressure (131.3/75.2 vs. 125.4/77.3 mmHg), critically ill patients, compared with severe and discharged patients, had a significantly (p ≤ .04) greater variability of systolic (SD 14.92 vs. 10.84 mmHg, CV 11.39% vs. 8.56%, and VIM 15.15 vs. 10.75 units) and diastolic blood pressure (SD 9.38 vs. 7.50 mmHg, CV 12.66% vs. 9.80%, and VIM 9.33 vs. 7.50 units). After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios for critical versus severe and discharged patients for systolic BPV were 3.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20‐9.66, p = .02), 4.09 (95% CI 1.14‐14.67, p = .03), and 2.81 (95% CI 1.12‐7.05, p = .03) for each 5‐mmHg increment in SD, 5% increment in CV, and 5‐unit increment in VIM, respectively. Similar trends were observed for diastolic BPV indices (p ≤ .08).

After the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, recently diagnosed novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread across 203 countries and territories in all 5 major continents. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e. COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO. As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT+2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO. (Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83). It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China. A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals. Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan. They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2. This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people. Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults. This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts. The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries. Without any effective antiviral agents available at present, the need of the hour is early case detection, isolation of cases, use of good preventive care measures by the household contacts and in the hospital set up. The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections. A need for effective vaccine is being seen an as good preventive strategy in this pandemic. However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.","Kaul, Dinesh",Curr Med Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmrp.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352081720300398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363221/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352081720300398,154

To support nursing homes in evidence‐based infection control practices, the Massachusetts Senior Care Association and Hebrew SeniorLife partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ ECHO National Nursing Home COVID‐19 Action Network (the network). This educational program provided 16 weeks of free weekly virtual sessions to 295 eligible nursing homes, grouped into nine cohorts of 30–33 nursing homes. Eighty‐three percent of eligible nursing homes in Massachusetts participated in the Network, and Hebrew SeniorLife's Training Center served the vast majority. Each cohort was led by geriatrics clinicians and nursing home leaders, and coaches trained in quality improvement. The interactive sessions provided timely updates on COVID‐19 infection control best practices to improve care and also created a peer‐to‐peer learning community to share ongoing challenges and potential solutions. The weekly Network meetings were a source of connection, emotional support, and validation and may be a valuable mechanism to support resilience and well‐being for nursing home staff.","Baughman, Amy W.; Renton, Marina; Wehbi, Nizar K.; Sheehan, Eric J.; Gregorio, Tara M.; Yurkofsky, Mark; Levine, Sharon; Jackson, Vicki; Pu, Chuck T.; Lipsitz, Lewis A.",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310686/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17389,154

Although it has been traditionally used for biofuels production, the oleochemical potential of UCOs is vast. UCOs can be used as feedstock for a large variety of value added green chemicals including plasticizers, binders, epoxides, surfactants, lubricants, polymers, biomaterials, and different building blocks. Thus, UCOs transformation into functional chemicals can bring long-term stability to the supply chain, avoiding the current dependence on commodity products. In this regard, this work describes some of the potential benefits of using UCOs as feedstock in oleochemical biorefineries. Also, some of the most recent investigations on the valorization of UCOs other than biofuel are presented.

675976,Autopsy insights from the EVALI epidemic,2020-08-04,"Over a year after the initial emergence of the disease, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain healthcare systems worldwide. The value of feedback and connection between clinical care, public health, and death investigation systems has never been more clear. To this end, knowledge of the radiologic and histopathologic features of fatal COVID-19 is critical for those working with the living and the dead. Most of the medical descriptions of COVID-19 are either focused on clinical in vivo medical imaging or autopsies performed following an intensive course of treatment over days to weeks prior to death, rather than deaths in the community prior to hospitalization. Here we report the postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) and lung histopathology in five fatal cases of COVID-19 that were subject to medicolegal death investigation. All individuals died in the community without medical treatment, or after a brief terminal admission to hospital. In these cases, the main PMCT findings included: diffuse lung changes including ground glass-type opacifications, a “crazy paving” appearance, variable areas of more dense consolidation, and relatively few areas of spared/less involved lung parenchyma. The unifying histopathology was diffuse alveolar damage in various stages of cellular evolution. In all cases, the pattern of PMCT and the lung histopathology corroborated the diagnosis of COVID-19. We propose the routine use of PMCT as a potential screening tool for the identification of COVID-19 related fatalities in the medicolegal setting where a paucity of historical information may not otherwise permit the identification of this disease prior to autopsy.","Williams, Andrew S.; Dmetrichuk, Jennifer M.; Kim, Patrick; Pollanen, Michael S.",Forensic Sci Int,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037907382100075X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774384/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037907382100075X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.110755,154

However, after nine months cases resurged with re-establishment of endemic rabies transmission to pre-intervention levels. Previous analyses investigated district level spatial heterogeneity of vaccination coverage, and dog density; and importation, identifying the latter as the primary factor for rabies resurgence. Here we assess the impact of individual level heterogeneity on outbreak probability, effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and likely time to resurgence after a campaign. Geo-located contact sensors recorded the location and contacts of 237 domestic dogs in N’Djaména over a period of 3.5 days. The contact network data showed that urban dogs are socially related to larger communities and constrained by the urban architecture. We developed a network generation algorithm that extrapolates this empirical contact network to networks of large dog populations and applied it to simulate rabies transmission in N’Djaména. The model predictions aligned well with the rabies incidence data. Using the model we demonstrated, that major outbreaks are prevented when at least 70% of dogs are vaccinated. The probability of a minor outbreak also decreased with increasing vaccination coverage, but reached zero only when coverage was near total. Our results suggest that endemic rabies in N’Djaména may be explained by a series of importations with subsequent minor outbreaks. We show that highly connected dogs hold a critical role in transmission and that targeted vaccination of such dogs would lead to more efficient vaccination campaigns.","Laager, Mirjam; Mbilo, Céline; Madaye, Enos Abdelaziz; Naminou, Abakar; Léchenne, Monique; Tschopp, Aurélie; Naïssengar, Service Kemdongarti; Smieszek, Timo; Zinsstag, Jakob; Chitnis, Nakul",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067733/,154

Routine testing of asymptomatic students and staff, as part of a comprehensive program, can help schools open safely. ""Pooling-in-a-pod"" is a public health surveillance strategy whereby testing cohorts are composed based on social relationships and physical proximity. Pooling-in-a-pod allowed for weekly on-site point-of-care testing of all staff and students at an independent preschool to grade 12 school in Washington, D.C. Staff and older students self-collected anterior nares samples, and trained staff collected samples from younger students. Overall, 6,746 samples were tested for 815 students and 276 staff between November 30, 2020, and March 3, 2021. The average pool size was 7.3 people. Sample collection to pool result time averaged 40 minutes. The direct testing cost per person per week was $24.77, including swabs. One surveillance test pool was positive. During the study period, daily new cases in Washington, D.C., ranged from 24 - 46 per 100,000 population. A post-launch survey found most parents (90.3%), students (93.4%), and staff (98.8%) were willing to participate in pooled testing with confirmatory tests for positive pool members.

However, the underlying mechanisms that explain this variation are poorly understood. Here, we reanalyzed and integrated public RNAseq datasets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, comparing transcription patterns according to sex, age, and viral load. We found that female and young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a similar transcriptomic pattern with a larger number of total (up- and downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to males and elderly patients. The transcriptional analysis showed a sex-specific profile with a higher transcriptional modulation of immune response-associated genes in female and young subjects against SARS-CoV-2. The functional clustering was characterized by a highly correlated interferome network of cytokine/chemokine- and neutrophil-associated genes that were enriched both in nasopharyngeal cells and peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients. Females exhibited reduced transcriptional levels of key pro-inflammatory/neutrophil-related genes such as CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1/CXCR2), IL-1{beta}, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL compared to males, which correlate with a protective gene expression profile against inflammatory damage.

The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. METHOD: An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. RESULTS: 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers (P<0.05). LIMITATION: This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. CONCLUSION: There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected.

DESIGN: A methods review. LITERATURE SEARCH: Articles indexed in MEDLINE and published between January 2016 and July 2020 were included. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Two independent, blinded reviewers identified the RCTs using Covidence. We included RCTs related to musculoskeletal interventions that were published in International Society of Physiotherapy Journal Editors (ISPJE) member journals. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted for the variables of interest from the identified RCTs by two blinded reviewers independently. The data were presented descriptively or in frequency tables. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight RCTs were identified. One-third of RCTs were consistent with their prospectively-registered intent (49/138); Consistency with prospectively intent could not be determined for two-thirds (89/138) of the RCTs. Four RCTs (3%) reported inconsistent results with the primary aims and outcomes from the prospective clinical trial registry despite high methodological quality (PEDro score).

This has changed the way people live and are included socially. This paper focuses on the unexpected ways schools have altered and deepened social inclusion for children with learning disabilities during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We interviewed six people: two people who work for a Local Authority, one Headteacher of a special school, one Special Educational Needs and Disability Consultant, one young person with a learning disability and her mother. The findings and conclusions show the “new normal” caused by COVID‐19 can help to deepen social inclusion for children with learning disabilities. For example, it can help children communicate in alternative ways with their teachers and friends. It can help families to understand more about their son/daughter's educational abilities; this means they can advocate better for them. It can help professionals to meet the needs of children with learning disabilities more quickly. We do not enjoy living at a social distance from everyone else, but we do want to make sure that lessons can be learnt from this moment in time. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: To slow the spread of COVID‐19, on 20 March 2020, nurseries, schools and colleges across England were closed to all learners, apart from those who were children of key workers or were considered “vulnerable.” As young people with learning disabilities, families, professionals and schools become acquainted with the Erfahrung of the new horizon brought about by COVID‐19, the negativity of altered social inclusion is becoming the “new normal.” Capturing this transitory moment in time, this paper reflexively analyses the curiously productive variables of altered ecological pathways to social inclusion for people with learning disabilities. METHODS: Taking a hermeneutic stance, this paper draws on Gadamer's construction of the nature of new experiences. Focussed on the experience of social inclusion during the COVID‐19 pandemic, semi‐structured interviews were conducted with six key stakeholders. As the phenomenon in question was new, an inductive approach to thematic analysis was applied. FINDINGS: The critical tenet of this paper is that the Erfahrung of COVID‐19 has created the conditions for a “new normal” which have afforded children with learning disabilities altered opportunities for social inclusion, whether that be through increased power/agency for them and their families and/or new modes of connectedness leading to enhanced relationships. CONCLUSION: Whilst the impact of COVID‐19 has been a negative one for many aspects of society, application of Simplican and Gadamer's theories on social inclusion and the nature of new experiences has permitted the surfacing of new possibilities for the social inclusion of children with learning disabilities.","Beaton, Mhairi C.; Codina, Geraldene N.; Wharton, Julie C.",Br J Learn Disabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220278/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bld.12399,154

Consequently, novel and efficacious treatment approaches are highly warranted. Based on our experiences with concentrated treatment formats for other health challenges, we developed a highly concentrated interdisciplinary group rehabilitation approach for chronic illnesses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the acceptability of the intervention and describe potential changes in functional impairment at follow-up. METHODS: The cornerstones of the intervention are as follows: (1) prepare the patient for change prior to treatment, (2) focus on health promoting microchoices instead of symptoms, and (3) expect the patient to integrate the changes in everyday living with limited hands-on follow-up. The intervention will be delivered to patients with highly diverse primary symptoms, namely patients with low back pain, post-COVID-19 symptoms, anxiety and depression, and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Recruitment started between August 2020 and January 2021 (according to the illness category). For initial 3-month results, recruitment is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: If successful, this study may have a substantial impact on the treatment of low back pain, post-COVID-19 symptoms, anxiety and depression, and type 2 diabetes, which together constitute a major socioeconomic cost. Further, the study may widen the evidence base for the use of the concentrated treatment format in a diverse group of medical conditions.

680755,Telehealth in inflammatory bowel disease,2020-09-25,"Community-based learning is a pedagogical technique designed to bring students out of the classroom and into their communities. Students typically pair with local nonprofit organizations to complete work which ties into their scholarship. Faculty, students, and community members can all benefit from these partnerships, and university-community relations are strengthened by them. These connections deepen the educational experience and improve student success and retention, and build civic engagement skills that benefit the university community and the student’s home community (Strait, Turk, and Nordyke in: JR Strait, K Nordyke (eds), Pedagogy Of Civic Engagement, High-Impact Practices, and e-Service- L Earning, Stylus Publishing, Virginian, 2015; Bednarz in Journal of Geography in Higher Education 32:87–100, 2008; Mohan in Journal of Geography in Higher Education 19:129–142, 1995). Spatial citizenship, while vital to such engagement and to effective community participation, is seldom taught in traditional pedagogy (Kanwischer, Schulze, and Gryl in: Thomas Jekel, Adrijana Car, Josef Strobl, and Gerald Griesebner (eds), Spatial citizenship—dimensions of a curriculum, Wichmann Verlag, Berlin, 2012). Connecting place to pedagogy with spatially-enabled learning helps students investigate complex global concepts at a manageable local scale. Geography is an intrinsic part of scholarship, to varying degrees, and spatial thinking can bring added dimension and value to the educational process (Vogler in: Thomas Jekel, Adrijana Car, Josef Strobl, and Gerald Griesebner (eds), Wichmann Verlag, Berlin, 2012). The intersectionalities which exist within the community, when examined with a spatial lens, are the core of community geography, a praxis-focused method of engaged scholarship (Shannon in Progress in Human Geography, 10.1177/0309132520961468, 2020). Community-based learning is not clearly defined, yet some established models exist. Place-based learning communities move cohorts of students through a curriculum that is centered on local community issues, with the community as both laboratory and lens, and building place attachment (Schweizer, Davis, and Thompson in Environmental Communication 7:42–62, 2013). Service learning, while less clearly defined, typically involves direct work with community organizations, identifying, investigating, and contributing to solutions for local issues (Strait, Turk, and Nordyke in: JR Strait, K Nordyke (eds), Pedagogy Of Civic Engagement, High-Impact Practices, and e-Service- L Earning, Stylus Publishing, Virginian, 2015; Cal Corps Public Service in Designing Community-Based Courses, 1–45, 2015). Built around the concept of place, the added dimension of improved spatial citizenship benefits both community and students. This paper will review community-based learning as practiced through upper-division service learning courses in geography at two universities, and the development of a new course, as methods of engagement with local communities through a spatial lens.","Rock, Amy E.",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814680/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10408-3,154

Current evidence seems to suggest a possible link with ecosystem disequilibrium and even air pollution. The primary manifestations affect respiratory and circulatory systems, but neurological features are also being reported through case reports and case series. We summarize neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19. We have searched for original articles published in PubMed/Medline, PubMed Central and Google Scholar using the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “Coronavirus”, “pandemic”, “SARS-COV-2”, “neurology”, “neurological”, “complications” and “manifestations”. We found around 1000 publications addressing the issue of neurological conditions associated with COVID-19 infection. Amongst those, headache and dizziness are the most common reported symptoms followed by encephalopathy and delirium, while the most frequent complications are cerebrovascular accidents, Guillain–Barré syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, and acute encephalitis. Specific symptoms affecting the peripheral nervous system such as hyposmia and dysgeusia are the most common manifestations recorded in the selected studies. Interestingly, it was noted that these kinds of neurological symptoms might precede the typical features, such as fever and cough, in COVID patients. Neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19 should be considered as a part of the clinical features of this novel global pandemic.","Bellocchio, Luigi; Bordea, Ioana Roxana; Ballini, Andrea; Lorusso, Felice; Hazballa, Denisa; Isacco, Ciro Gargiulo; Malcangi, Giuseppina; Inchingolo, Alessio Danilo; Dipalma, Gianna; Inchingolo, Francesco; Piscitelli, Prisco; Logroscino, Giancarlo; Miani, Alessandro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139595/,154

The pathological changes in several human organs of patients with SARS have been extensively described. However, to date, little has been reported about the effects of this infection on the thyroid gland. Femoral head necrosis and low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels, commonly found in patients with SARS, raise the possibility of thyroid dysfunction. We have undertaken this study to evaluate for any potential injury to the thyroid gland caused by SARS on tissue samples obtained from 5 SARS autopsies. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end–labeling assay was performed to identify apoptotic cells. The follicular epithelium was found to be damaged with large numbers of cells exfoliated into the follicle. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end–labeling assay demonstrated many cells undergoing apoptosis. Follicular architecture was altered and showed distortion, dilatation, and collapse. No distinct calcitonin-positive cells were detectable in the SARS thyroids. In conclusion, both parafollicular and follicular cells were injured. This may provide an explanation both for low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels and the osteonecrosis of the femoral head associated with patients with SARS. Apoptosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS associated coronavirus infection in the thyroid gland.","Wei, Lan; Sun, Shen; Xu, Cai-hong; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Yun; Zhu, Hong; Peh, Suat-cheng; Korteweg, Christine; McNutt, Michael A.; Gu, Jiang",Hum Pathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0046817706003807; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0046817706003807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16996569/,154

This resulted in a sharp economic contraction unparalleled in recent Chinese history. Satellite retrievals show that nitrogen dioxide pollution declined by an unprecedented amount (~50% regionally) from its expected unperturbed value, but regional‐scale column aerosol loadings and cloud microphysical properties were not detectably affected. The disparate impact is tied to differential economic impacts of the shutdown, in which transportation, a disproportionate source of nitrogen oxide emissions, underwent drastic declines (~90% reductions in passenger traffic), whereas industry and power generation, responsible for >90% of particulate emissions, were relatively less affected (~20% reductions in electricity and thermal power generation). A combination of anomalously warm and humid meteorological conditions and complex chemical interactions further decreased nitrogen dioxide concentrations but likely enhanced secondary aerosol formation.","Diamond, Michael S.; Wood, Robert",Geophys Res Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904938/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl088913,154

Despite heavy regulation, there is substantial scope for new technologies and care models to not only boost patient outcomes but to do so at reduced cost to healthcare systems and consumers. Promoting innovation within national health systems such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) has been set as a key target for health care professionals and policy makers. However, while the UK has a world-class biomedical research industry, several reports in the last twenty years have highlighted the difficulties faced by the NHS in encouraging and adopting innovations, with the journey from idea to implementation of health technology often taking years and being very expensive, with a high failure rate. This has led to the establishment of several innovation pathways within and around the NHS, to encourage the invention, development and implementation of cost-effective technologies that improve health care delivery. These pathways span local, regional and national health infrastructure. They operate at different stages of the innovation pipeline, with their scope and work defined by location, technology area or industry sector, based on the specific problem identified when they were set up. In this introductory review, we outline each of the major innovation pathways operating at local, regional and national levels across the NHS, including their history, governance, operating procedures and areas of expertise. The extent to which innovation pathways address current challenges faced by innovators is discussed, as well as areas for improvement and future study.","Arora, Anmol; Wright, Andrew; Cheng, Mark; Khwaja, Zahra; Seah, Matthew",Ther Innov Regul Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-021-00304-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009551/,154

ALL and its treatment cause altered bone-mineral homeostasis, which can contribute to musculoskeletal late adverse effects (LAEs). With the increasing number of childhood cancer survivors, LAEs are reported often, and are aggravated by inactive lifestyles. A telerehabilitation program is proposed to strengthen the muscle–bone complex and prevent future impairment. Objective: This study aimed to explore and better understand patient and parent experience of a telerehabilitation program after completion of ALL treatment. Methods: ALL survivors (n = 12), 75% girls, 7.9 to 14.7 years old, within six months to five years of treatment, were recruited to participate in the proposed study, along with a parent. The 16-week group program included 40 potential home-based physical activities, with monthly progression, supervised by a kinesiologist, through an online telerehabilitation platform. Patients could be included in the study if they joined during the first month of intervention of their group (minimum 12 weeks of intervention). A semi-structured post-intervention interview was conducted with the patients and their parent during the final assessment, along with a review of the kinesiologist’s clinical notes, to obtain a portrait of the participants’ experience with the telerehabilitation program. Overarching themes were identified by one author and confirmed by two senior authors before extracting the various aspects of each theme. Results: Of the 12 patients recruited, three were excluded from the analysis because they did not complete the minimum 12 weeks of intervention (one = relapse, one = failure to meet technical requirements, and one = abandoned due to parent’s disinterest). The nine patients who completed the program (six girls; 10.93 ± 2.83 years) had a mean adherence of 89%. The overarching themes identified were the program modalities (group approach with patient–parent paired training, supervised by a kinesiologist), the telerehabilitation system, the participants’ perception of the benefits, and recommendations and suggestions from the families. Both patients and parents expressed very high satisfaction with the program and perceived benefits. Conclusion: Participants appreciated the program and reported they would all recommend it to other families in similar situations. The telerehabilitation method of service delivery was perceived by some as decisive in choosing to participate, while the supervision and intra- and inter-family interactions were the motivating factors that were key to program adherence.","Lambert, Genevieve; Alos, Nathalie; Bernier, Pascal; Laverdière, Caroline; Drummond, Kenneth; Dahan-Oliel, Noémi; Lemay, Martin; Veilleux, Louis-Nicolas; Kairy, Dahlia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807179/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073610,154

Soon after Asia, Europe was seriously affected. Many countries, including Romania, adopted lockdown measures to limit the outbreak. AIM: We performed a molecular epidemiology analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral strains circulating in Romania during the first two months of the epidemic in order to detect mutation profiles and phylogenetic relatedness. METHODS: Respiratory samples were directly used for shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: All Romanian sequences belonged to lineage B, with a different subtype distribution between northern and southern regions (subtype B.1.5 and B.1.1). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Romanian epidemic started with multiple introduction events from other European countries followed by local transmission. Phylogenetic links between northern Romania and Spain, Austria, Scotland and Russia were observed, as well as between southern Romania and Switzerland, Italy, France and Turkey. One viral strain presented a previously unreported mutation in the Nsp2 gene, namely K489E. Epidemiologically-defined clusters displayed specific mutations, suggesting molecular signatures for strains coming from areas that were isolated during the lockdown.

In Study 1, we conducted a field experiment in Wuhan, China during the lockdown between February 20, 2020, and March 2, 2020, in which we induced state mindfulness by randomly assigning participants to either a daily mindfulness practice or a daily mind-wandering practice. Results showed that the sleep duration of participants in the mindfulness condition, compared with the control condition, was less impacted by COVID-19 stressors (i.e., the increase of infections in the community). In Study 2, in a 10-day daily diary study in the United Kingdom between June 8, 2020, and June 19, 2020, we replicate our results from Study 1 using a subjective measure of COVID-19 stressors and a daily measure of state mindfulness. In addition, we find that mindfulness buffers the negative effect of COVID-19 stressors on work engagement mediated by sleep duration. As the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and the number of reported cases continues to rise globally, our findings suggest that mindfulness is an evidence-based practice that can effectively neutralize the negative effect of COVID-19 stressors on sleep and work outcomes.

689405,Implementing Telemedicine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: is COVID-19 the definitive trigger?,2020-05-15,"Mutations in desmosomal Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) are the most prevalent drivers of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. However, partner proteins that elucidate PKP2 cellular mechanism to understand cardiac dysfunction in ACM are mostly unknown. Here we identify the actin-based motor proteins Myh9 and Myh10 as key PKP2 interactors, and demonstrate that the expression of the ACM-related PKP2 mutant R735X alters actin fiber organization and cell mechanical stiffness. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein acts similarly to this known pathogenic R735X mutant, altering the actomyosin component distribution on cardiac cells. Our data reveal that the viral Nsp1 hijacks PKP2 into the cytoplasm and mimics the effect of delocalized R735X mutant. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP2, wildtype or mutant, induces the collapse of the actomyosin network, since shRNA-PKP2 knockdown maintains the cell structure, validating a critical role of PKP2 localization in the regulation of actomyosin architecture. The fact that Nsp1 and PKP2 mutant R735X share similar phenotypes also suggests that direct SARS-CoV-2 heart infection could induce a transient ACM-like disease in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to right ventricle dysfunction, observed in patients with poor survival prognosis. Highlights The specific cardiac isoform Plakophilin-2a (PKP2) interacts with Myh9 and Myh10. PKP2 delocalization alters actomyosin cytoskeleton component organization. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein hijacks PKP2 from the desmosome into the soluble fraction where it is downregulated. Viral Nsp1 collapses the actomyosin cytoskeleton and phenocopies the arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy-related mutant R735X.","Márquez-López, Cristina; Roche-Molina, Marta; García-Quintáns, Nieves; Sacristán, Silvia; Siniscalco, David; González-Guerra, Andrés; Camafeita, Emilio; Lytvyn, Mariya; Guillen, María I.; Sanz-Rosa, David; Martín-Pérez, Daniel; Sánchez-Ramos, Cristina; García, Ricardo; Bernal, Juan A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.14.296178,154
689425,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the daily management of biotechnological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease patients: Reorganisational response in a high-volume Italian inflammatory bowel disease centre,2020-05-21,"This case report describes immune thrombocytopenic purpura in a 41-year-old man hospitalized in the intensive-care unit for COVID-19, 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms with respiratory failure at admission. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was treated with, among other drugs, low-molecular-weight heparin. On day 8, his platelet count began descending rapidly. On day 10, heparin treatment was replaced by danaparoid sodium, but by day 13, the continued low platelet count made a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia unlikely. Normocytic nonregenerative anemia gradually developed. On day 13, a bone marrow aspiration showed numerous megakaryocytes and a few signs of hemophagocytosis. Corticosteroids were introduced on day 14, and platelets began rising after 3 days and then fell again on day 19. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) was then administered. Two days later, the platelet count returned to normal. The immune cause was confirmed by ruling out the differential diagnoses and the excellent and rapid response to intravenous immunoglobulins. Finally, the patient's respiratory state improved. He was discharged to a respiratory rehabilitation unit on day 38. Our case suggests that an immunological cause should be considered in patients with thrombocytopenia during COVID-19.","Deruelle, Emilie; Ben Hadj Salem, Omar; Sep Hieng, Sonnthida; Pichereau, Claire; Outin, Hervé; Jamme, Matthieu",Int J Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12185-020-02943-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677007/,154

A case report and literature review",2021-01-03,"HLA‐A, ‐C, ‐B, and ‐DRB1 genotypes were analyzed in 178 Japanese COVID‐19 patients to investigate the association of HLA with severe COVID‐19. Analysis of 32 common HLA alleles at four loci revealed a significant association between HLA‐DRB1*09:01 and severe COVID‐19 (odds ratio [OR], 3.62; 95% CI, 1.57–8.35; p = 0.00251 [permutation p value = 0.0418]) when age, sex, and other common HLA alleles at the DRB1 locus were adjusted. The DRB1*09:01 allele was more significantly associated with risk for severe COVID‐19 compared to preexisting medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. These results indicate a potential role for HLA in predisposition to severe COVID‐19.","Anzurez, Alitzel; Naka, Izumi; Miki, Shoji; Nakayama‐Hosoya, Kaori; Isshiki, Mariko; Watanabe, Yusuke; Nakamura‐Hoshi, Midori; Seki, Sayuri; Matsumura, Takayuki; Takano, Tomohiro; Onodera, Taishi; Adachi, Yu; Moriyama, Saya; Terahara, Kazutaka; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Yoshimura, Yoshihiro; Sasaki, Hiroaki; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Miyazaki, Kazuhito; Koga, Michiko; Ikeuchi, Kazuhiko; Nagai, Hiroyuki; Saito, Makoto; Adachi, Eisuke; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Kawashima, Akira; Miyazato, Yusuke; Kinoshita, Noriko; Kouno, Chiyoko; Tanaka, Kensuke; Takahashi, Yoshimasa; Suzuki, Tadaki; Matano, Tetsuro; Ohashi, Jun; Kawana‐Tachikawa, Ai",HLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734601/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tan.14256,154
690711,Scope of a weekly infection control team rounding in an acute-care teaching hospital: a pilot study,2020-08-15,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a large, initially uncontrollable, public health crisis both in the United States (US) and across the world, with experts looking to vaccines as the ultimate mechanism of defense. The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines by investigating the spatiotemporal trends of their sentiment and emotion towards vaccines, as well as how such trends relate to popular topics on Twitter in the US. Methods: We collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the US from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified three phases along the pandemic timeline with the significant changes of public sentiment and emotion. We further linked the changes to eleven key events and major topics as the potential drivers to induce such changes via cloud mapping of keywords and topic modeling. Results: An increasing trend of positive sentiment in parallel with the decrease of negative sentiment are generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards COVID-19 vaccines. The overall tendency of the eight types of emotion implies the trustiness and anticipation of the public to vaccination, accompanied by the mixture of fear, sadness and anger. Critical social/international events and/or the announcements of political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on the public opinion on vaccines. These factors, along with important topics and manual reading of popular posts on eleven key events, help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis. Conclusions: The analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics and promote the confidence of individuals within a certain region or community, towards vaccines.","Hu, T.; Wang, S.; Luo, W.; Yan, Y.; Zhang, M.; Huang, X.; Liu, R.; Ly, K.; Kacker, V.; Li, Z.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.02.21258233; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.02.21258233v1?rss=1,154
