61723,[Noninvasive Respiratory Support for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia: Enough is Enough].,2020-03-04,"OBJECTIVE Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common gastrointestinal diseases. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and psychosocial distress worsens symptoms severity. Since the end of 2019 the world has been facing COVID-19 pandemic. The associated control measures have affected the psychological health of people. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders among Italian children and adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study sample is composed of 407 patients (187 males, 220 females), aged from 10 to 17 years. The mean age is 14.27 ± 2.24 years. The study was conducted through the Italian version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III Version. The prevalence of each disorder has been calculated as the ratio of affected subjects for each disease and the total number of effective cases for that specific disease. RESULTS The study demonstrates that the prevalence of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder in Italian children, during the COVD-19 pandemic, is higher, compared with the one reported in the previous studies. The most frequent disorders are Abdominal Migraine and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Our study is the first one which provides data of the prevalence of Functional gastrointestinal disorders in sample of Italian adolescents, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study underlines the need to focus on stress management, in order to reduce the effects of the lockdown on the psychological wellness of the youngest.","Farello, G; Di Lucia, A; Fioravanti, B; Tambucci, R; Stagi, S; Gaudino, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202109_26802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604975/,851
62580,[Coronavirus and the risk of ocular transmission].,2021-04-11,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Advances in pharmacology offer freedom from topical medical therapy without compromise of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial coverage in the perioperative period. In this review, we describe the basis for dropless cataract surgery with the goal of improving outcomes and the patient experience. RECENT FINDINGS Phacoemulsification outcomes depend largely on surgeon skill but also on adherence to a complex multidrug regimen of perioperative anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapy to prevent sight-threatening complications such as cystoid macular edema or endophthalmitis. Successful administration of this regimen can be limited by noncompliance, difficulty administering eye drops, bioavailability, and side effects, among others. The recent development of sustained-release formulations of dexamethasone - one an intracanalicular insert and the other an intraocular suspension - can provide sustained tapering doses of dexamethasone while reducing or eliminating the need for anti-inflammatory eye drop therapy. Similarly, mounting evidence compellingly demonstrates that intracameral antibiotic use intraoperatively is at least as effective as topical antibiotics in preventing endophthalmitis. SUMMARY Sustained-release dexamethasone coupled with intracameral antibiotics at the time of phacoemulsification can provide antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis without the need for topical eye drop medications. This approach has the potential to improve compliance with therapy, visual acuity outcomes, and the overall patient experience.","Assil, Kerry K; Greenwood, Michael D; Gibson, Andrea; Vantipalli, Srilatha; Metzinger, Jamie L; Goldstein, Michael H",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027213/,851

The North American Solitaire Stent Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) registry aimed to assess the real world performance of the Solitaire FR device in contrast with the results from the SWIFT (Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy) and TREVO 2 (Trevo versus Merci retrievers for thrombectomy revascularization of large vessel occlusions in acute ischemic stroke) trials. METHODS The investigator initiated NASA registry recruited North American sites to submit retrospective angiographic and clinical outcome data on consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with the Solitaire FR between March 2012 and February 2013. The primary outcome was a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) score of ≥2 or a Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of ≥2a. Secondary outcomes were 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS 354 patients underwent treatment for AIS using the Solitaire FR device in 24 centers. Mean time from onset to groin puncture was 363.4±239 min, mean fluoroscopy time was 32.9±25.7 min, and mean procedure time was 100.9±57.8 min. Recanalization outcome: TIMI ≥2 rate of 83.3% (315/354) and TICI ≥2a rate of 87.5% (310/354) compared with the operator reported TIMI ≥2 rate of 83% in SWIFT and TICI ≥2a rate of 85% in TREVO 2. CLINICAL OUTCOME 42% (132/315) of NASA patients demonstrated a 90 day mRS ≤2 compared with 37% (SWIFT) and 40% (TREVO 2). 90 day mortality was 30.2% (95/315) versus 17.2% (SWIFT) and 29% (TREVO 2). CONCLUSIONS The NASA registry demonstrated that the Solitaire FR device performance in clinical practice is comparable with the SWIFT and TREVO 2 trial results.","Zaidat, Osama O; Castonguay, Alicia C; Gupta, Rishi; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Martin, Coleman; Holloway, William E; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; English, Joey D; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Malisch, Tim W; Marden, Franklin A; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar T; Froehler, Michael T; Badruddin, Aamir; Nguyen, Thanh N; Taqi, M Asif; Abraham, Michael G; Janardhan, Vallabh; Shaltoni, Hashem; Novakovic, Roberta; Yoo, Albert J; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng R; Britz, Gavin W; Kaushal, Ritesh; Nanda, Ashish; Issa, Mohammad A; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24062252/,851

Material and method:Eight hundred and twelve participants (43.7% males) with a mean age of 49.±14.8 years (range 19-83 years), from the area of Thrace, Greece, were enrolled in this cross-sectional populational study. A two-stage stratified sampling scheme was used and subjects were classified, according to the net mean monthly household income, into three financial levels: low .1000 Euro; medium 1001-2000 Euro; and high >2000 Euro. Self-reported questionnaires for socio-demographic, lifestyle and health related characteristics were collected. Sleep characteristics, utilizing Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Berlin Questionnaire, and mental health, using Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory have been also assessed. Results:The majority of participants belonged to the lower income level (476 subjects, 58.6%). Lower income level was associated with a higher prevalence of high alcohol consumption (p=0.030), low adherence to Mediterranean diet (p=0.016), low physical activity (p<0.001) and either short or long nocturnal sleep duration (p<0.001). After adjusting for all socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, subjects with low income had a higher risk for anxiety (aOR=1.97, p=0.017), depression (aOR=4.88, p<0.001), dyslipidemia (aOR=2.50, p=0.007), diabetes (aOR=3.58, p<0.001), obesity (aOR=1.97, p=0.038), cardiovascular disease (aOR=3.04, p=0.015) and sleep disorders, as well as for primary (aOR=3.56, p=0.017) and secondary (aOR=2.49, p=0.010) healthcare utilization compared to subjects with high income.

71934,[Countermeasures and treatment for aortic acute syndrome with novel coronavirus pneumonia].,2020-02-18,"INTRODUCTION Walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON) is a sequela of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in 15-40% of cases. We sought to compare the outcomes of minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic cyst gastrostomy (CG) and necrosectomy for the management for sterile WON at a tertiary care high-volume pancreas center. METHOD This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent minimally invasive surgical or endoscopic CG and necrosectomy for clinically sterile WON between 2008 and 2013. Peri-procedural outcomes including costs were analyzed and compared. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent minimally invasive surgical (robotic = 14, laparoscopic = 6) CG and necrosectomy, and 20 patients underwent endoscopic treatment. The surgical cohort had a larger median cyst size and higher CCI score. For the surgical cohort, median OR time was 167.5 min, estimated blood loss was 30 ml, and 65% underwent concomitant cholecystectomy. There was no mortality in either group and no difference in complication rates (20%). The failure rate was similar (15 versus 10%, P = 0.66). Although surgery was associated with a lower re-intervention rate (0 versus 1, P = 0.008), the endotherapy group was associated with shorter total LOS (inclusive of re-interventions) (7 versus 3 days, P = 0.032). The cost of the index procedure was significantly higher for the surgery group (P = 0.014); however, when considering all readmissions and re-interventions until resolution of the WON, the total cost was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic CG and necrosectomy are comparable treatments for sterile WON in terms of outcomes and overall cost. The surgical approach may be considered advantageous when a concomitant cholecystectomy is required.","Khreiss, Mohammad; Zenati, Mazen; Clifford, Amber; Lee, Kenneth K; Hogg, Melissa E; Slivka, Adam; Chennat, Jennifer; Gelrud, Andres; Zeh, Herbert J; Papachristou, Georgios I; Zureikat, Amer H",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-2864-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26033038/,851
78662,[Online learning-related visual impairment and preventive measures during the 2019 novel coronvirus outbreak].,2020-02-20,"This research communication addressed the hypothesis that late lactation cows offered an oat-grain-based supplement or a high level of α-TOC supplementation at pasture would have improved milk composition and processability. Over a grazing period of 49 d, 48 Holstein Friesian dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were: control, pasture only (CTRL), pasture + 2.65 kg DM barley-based concentrate + 350 IU α-TOC/kg (BARLO), pasture + 2.65 kg DM oat-based concentrate + 350 IU α-TOC/kg (OATLO) and pasture + 2.65 kg DM oat-based concentrate + 1050 IU α-TOC/kg (OATHI). Within this randomised complete block design experiment cows were blocked on days in milk (DIM) and balanced for parity, milk yield and composition. Rennet coagulation time (RCT) was reduced in milk from cows offered OATHI compared to CTRL cows and OATLO. Concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was increased by OATHI compared to OATLO and in OATLO compared to CTRL. Supplementation with OATHI reduced individual saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in milk compared to OATLO. In conclusion, supplementing grazing dairy cows with an oat-based supplement improved total milk CLA concentration compared to pasture only. Offering a high level of α-TOC (2931 IU/d) to dairy cows reduced RCT, individual SFA and increased total CLA concentration of milk compared to a lower α-TOC level (738 IU α-TOC/d).","McKay, Zoe C; O'Sullivan, Michael; Lynch, Mary B; Mulligan, Finbar J; Ma, Lu; Rajauria, Gaurav; Pierce, Karina M",The Journal of dairy research,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022029921000091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594969/,851

To improve the rRT-PCR assays for detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and performance of 12 rRT-PCR primer-probe sets [SW (a) to SW (l)] using a panel of virus strains and clinical specimens. These primer-probe sets were derived from published work and designed for detecting the hemagglutinin (HA) or the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus. A primer-probe set, SW (CDC), developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) to target the HA gene of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, was used as a referee method. Our results demonstrated that although all primer-probe sets in this study had as high as 98.4 to 100% in silico coverage, some of the primer-probe sets had better specificity, sensitivity, and amplification efficiency than others. Two primer-probe sets, SW (h) and SW (l), which target the NA gene of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, were highly sensitive (10(4) copies/reaction), had high detection rates (56/60, P = 0.134, and 59/60, P = 1.000), and showed ideal specificity compared with SW (CDC). In addition, a cocktail of primer-probe sets targeted to the HA and NA genes displayed higher detection sensitivity than primer-probe sets targeting HA or NA alone, indicating that for practical applications, a combination of primer-probes targeting HA and NA genes is the best option for the detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus.","Yang, Yaowu; Huang, Fang; Gonzalez, Richard; Wang, Wei; Lu, Guilan; Li, Yongjun; Vernet, Guy; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01914-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21289144/,851

The coronavirus 2019 pandemic continues to negatively impact center-based cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. There is justifiable concern that the exercise-related increase in pulmonary ventilation within the rehabilitation classes may lead to the generation of infectious respiratory particles. RESEARCH QUESTION Is cardiopulmonary rehabilitation while wearing a procedural mask a particle generating procedure? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Data were collected prospectively at a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation facility with all patients wearing a procedural mask. Small (0.3-4.9μm) and large (5-10μm) particle generation was quantified using a light scattering particle counter. Data was analyzed by time, exertion level, and number of participants. RESULTS A total of 24 distinct patients attended ≥2 of the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes tested. The majority of the patients were male (n=16; 67%) and were in rehabilitation because of cardiac disease. During the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation class, small and large micron-sized particles increased with increasing class size. In classes with ≥4 patients, there was a significant increase from ambient levels in both small (4 patients; p<0.01 and 5 patients; p<0.01) and large (4 patients; p<0.01 and 5 patients; p<0.01) particle count that peaked at about 35-40 minutes during each class. INTERPRETATION Using an airborne particle counter, we found significant exercise related increases in both small and large micron-sized particle generation during cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes, with larger class sizes (i.e. more patients), despite wearing a procedural mask.","Helgeson, Scott A; Taylor, Bryan J; Lim, Kaiser G; Lee, Augustine S; Niven, Alexander S; Patel, Neal M",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.02.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667490/,851

The present study attempted to investigate the effect of SCH on IR and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, the effects of ellagic acid (EA) on SCH C57BL/6J and db/db mice were also investigated to explore potential therapeutic drug against SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism. T2DM patients were recruited in our study and categorized into two groups according to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value: T2DM without SCH group (TSH ≤4 μIU/ml; n = 30) and T2DM with SCH group (TSH >4μIU/ml; n = 60). Methimazole (MMI; 0.08 mg kg-1 day-1 ) was intragastrically administrated for 12 weeks to establish SCH in C57BL/6J and db/db mice. Compared with T2DM patients without SCH, poor glycemic and cholesterol control were emerged in T2DM patients with SCH and that were prominent in patients with TSH more than 10 μIU/ml. In addition, a significant positive correlation between serum TSH and fasting plasma-glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed in T2DM patients with SCH. Moreover, abnormal glucose metabolism in C57BL/6J and db/db mice with SCH has been attenuated by EA administration. Our findings provided data regarding the positive correlation between high TSH level with poor glycemic control in T2DM patients with SCH. EA might be a supportive strategy for preventing SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a potential risk factor associated with abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A clinical theory of a positive correlation between high TSH level and poor glycemic control was validated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and mouse models. Ellagic acid (EA) might be a supportive strategy for preventing SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism that provided a treatment option in T2DM patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in clinical practice.","Liu, Ye; Li, Xing; Zhu, Yikun; Liu, Jiong; Liu, Sunjun",Journal of food biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.13753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955004/,851

Poor needle tip visualization has been cited for USGPIV failure. Twinkle artifact (TA), visualized with color Doppler, is used in other clinical settings. Our objective was to investigate whether teaching students USGPIV placement utilizing TA would enhance needle tip visualization and improve first pass success. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized study of premedical and preclinical medical students without prior USGPIV experience. Students were given a standardized didactic session on USGPIV placement before being randomized and separated to learn and practice USGPIV with or without TA (control). The students were given 5 min to perform USGPIV on phantom models. The primary outcome was the rate of first pass success. Secondary outcomes included total time to cannulation, rate of posterior venous wall puncture, and total number of attempts. RESULTS Rates of first pass success were similar in both the TA (82%) and control groups (57%), p = 0.095. There was a difference in the mean time to cannulation. The TA group achieved success at 50.76 s (SD 26.93) while the control group achieved success at 85.30 s (SD 65.47), p = 0.048. CONCLUSION In this study of utilizing TA to aid in USGPIV placement, students were able to achieve successful cannulation in a shorter amount of time. There was no significant difference in first pass success. Future studies should utilize a larger sample size and evaluate the utility of TA when placing USGPIV on patients.","Gardecki, Jeffrey; Hughes, Liam P; Zakaria, Saami; Lewiss, Resa E; Goodsell, Kelly; Risler, Zachary; Chang, Anna Marie; Shughart, Hailey; Norton, Kyle; Au, Arthur",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729820959907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962536/,851

However, options for chronic vascular access for haemodialysis - an essential part of kidney replacement therapy - have remained unchanged for decades. The high morbidity and mortality associated with current vascular access complications highlights an unmet clinical need for novel techniques in vascular access and is driving innovation in vascular access care. The development of devices, biological approaches and novel access techniques has led to new approaches to controlling fistula geometry and manipulating the underlying cellular and molecular pathways of the vascular endothelium, and influencing fistula maturation and formation through the use of external mechanical methods. Innovations in arteriovenous graft materials range from small modifications to the graft lumen to the creation of completely novel bioengineered grafts. Steps have even been taken to create new devices for the treatment of patients with central vein stenosis. However, these emerging therapies face difficult hurdles, and truly creative approaches to vascular access need resources that include well-designed clinical trials, frequent interaction with regulators, interventionalist education and sufficient funding. In addition, the heterogeneity of patients with kidney failure suggests it is unlikely that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach for effective vascular access will be feasible in the current environment.","Lawson, Jeffrey H; Niklason, Laura E; Roy-Chaudhury, Prabir",Nature reviews.

OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to study factors associated with COVID-19 and AC in HCWs of a COVID-19 academic medical center. METHODS This is a case-control study. Cases were either symptomatic or asymptomatic HCWs with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result between March 16 and May 21 of 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by means of multivariable logistic regression. In addition, each subject was followed for 14 days to inform outcomes. RESULTS One hundred thirty of 249 (52.2%) symptomatic HCWs had COVID-19; 10 were hospitalized but none died. Of 987 asymptomatic HCWs,37 (3.7%) were AC; 6 of the remaining 950 asymptomatic HCWs with a negative PCR test result were found to be presymptomatic COVID-19 cases the following 14 days. Nurses were more frequently present in the COVID-19 group (51.5% vs. 37.0%), but multivariable analysis rendered non-significant results. After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and working place, factors found to be associated with AC were: working in wards as a nurse (aOR = 9.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-80.22, p = 0.045), kitchen personnel (aOR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.55-10.83, p = 0.005), and being a physician (aOR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.54, p = 0.006).

METHODS Murine activities and appetite, body weight, ratio of liver weight to its body weight (Hepatic mass index, HMI) were observed. Worm load and liver egg burden were evaluated as the infection intensity. Number and size of liver egg granulomas and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were investigated. We analyzed hepatic fibrosis by markers of fibrosis in tissue, detected hepatic Th17 and Treg frequency by flow cytometry, measured hepatic expressions of RORγt, Foxp3, IL-17A, and TGF-β1 via qPCR. Lipid metabolism was determined by serum levels of cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) as well as hepatic Oil red O staining. RESULTS In the infected ApoE-/- mice, the increased infection intensity aggravated the hepatic immunopathology (evidenced by increased HMI, elevated egg granulomas, increased ALT levels) and fibrosis (increased hepatic collagen deposition). ApoE deficiency resulted in significantly elevated ratio of hepatic Th17/Treg and higher serum levels of TC and TG, along with higher level of hepatic Oil red O staining. CONCLUSIONS ApoE deficiency promotes hepatic pathology and fibrosis by exacerbating Th17/Treg imbalance and altering lipid metabolism in murine schistosomiasis japonica.","Guan, Fei; Zhang, Chongyang; Jiang, Chunjie; Lupemba Jacques, Muziazia; Bai, Yang; Lu, Shengjun; Liu, Wenqi; Lei, Jiahui",Parasite immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786078/,851

However, caregivers may be or feel unable to cope with their role and, despite the needs of caregivers are often assessed in the literature, their opinions and feelings about these needs are not widely explored yet. This study aimed at exploring the opinions and feelings about their educational needs and role of familial caregivers of Parkinson's Disease patients. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted from October to December 2017 in a polyclinic of central Italy. Fourteen caregivers voluntarily participated in the study; semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted, and audio recorded until data saturation. Two investigators reviewed the transcribed notes, created Meaning Units, Sub-categories and finally the Categories with emerged themes. RESULTS The analysis of the 14 interviews generated three categories: supportiveness of healthcare educational programs; sense of inability to manage caregiver tasks; need for interaction with other familial caregivers. CONCLUSIONS The caregivers declared their belief that healthcare educational courses can be useful in helping them live and understand the caregiving tasks and expressed their need to share their experiences with other caregivers.

This variability affects both the segments (vowels and consonants) and the suprasegmental properties of their speech (prosody). Previous literature has demonstrated that listeners can adapt to variability in how different talkers pronounce the segments of speech. This study shows that listeners can also adapt to variability in how talkers produce lexical stress. Experiment 1 demonstrates a selective adaptation effect in lexical stress perception: repeatedly hearing Dutch trochaic words biased perception of a subsequent lexical stress continuum towards more iamb responses. Experiment 2 demonstrates a recalibration effect in lexical stress perception: when ambiguous suprasegmental cues to lexical stress were disambiguated by lexical orthographic context as signaling a trochaic word in an exposure phase, Dutch participants categorized a subsequent test continuum as more trochee-like. Moreover, the selective adaptation and recalibration effects generalized to novel words, not encountered during exposure. Together, the experiments demonstrate that listeners also flexibly adapt to variability in the suprasegmental properties of speech, thus expanding our understanding of the utility of listener adaptation in speech perception. Moreover, the combined outcomes speak for an architecture of spoken word recognition involving abstract prosodic representations at a prelexical level of analysis.","Bosker, Hans Rutger",Language and speech,https://doi.org/10.1177/00238309211030307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227417/,851

METHODS A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by using pairs of excellent (acquisition time of 6 min/bed position) and standard (acquisition time of 1.5 min/bed position) or sub-standard (acquisition time of 1 min/bed position) images from 72 patients. A test group of 25 patients was used to validate the CNN qualitatively and quantitatively with 5 different image sets per patient: 4 min/bed position, 1.5 min/bed position with and without CNN, and 1 min/bed position with and without CNN. RESULTS Difference in hotspot maximum or peak standardized uptake value between the standard 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN images fell short of significance. Coefficient of variation, the noise level, was lower in the CNN-enhanced images compared with standard 1 min and 1.5 min images. Physicians ranked the 1.5 min CNN and the 4 min images highest regarding image quality (noise and contrast) and the standard 1 min images lowest. CONCLUSIONS AI can enhance [18F]FDG-PET images to reduce noise and increase contrast compared with standard images whilst keeping SUVmax/peak stability. There were significant differences in scoring between the 1.5 min and 1.5 min CNN image sets in all comparisons, the latter had higher scores in noise and contrast. Furthermore, difference in SUVmax and SUVpeak fell short of significance for that pair. The improved image quality can potentially be used either to provide better images to the nuclear medicine physicians or to reduce acquisition time/administered activity.","Ly, John; Minarik, David; Jögi, Jonas; Wollmer, Per; Trägårdh, Elin",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-021-00788-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974171/,851

Nevertheless, the attention on social disparities in patient safety has been mainly directed towards the hospital care, often overlooking the primary care setting. Therefore, this paper aims to synthesise social disparities in patient safety in the primary care setting. METHODS The Databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies published between January 1st 2006 and January 31st 2017. Papers investigating racial, gender and socioeconomic disparities in regards to administrative errors, diagnostic errors, medication errors and transition of care errors in primary care were included. No distinction in terms of participants' age was made. RESULTS Women and black patients are more likely to experience patient safety events in primary care, although it depends on the type of disease, treatment, and healthcare service. The available literature largely describes gender and ethnic disparities in the different patient safety domains whilst income and educational level are studied to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS The results of this systematic review suggest that vulnerable social groups are likely to experience adverse patient safety events in primary care. Enhancing family doctors' awareness of these inequities is a necessary first step to tackle them and improve patient safety for all patients. Future research should focus on social disparities in patient safety using socioeconomic indicators, such as income and education.","Piccardi, Carlotta; Detollenaere, Jens; Vanden Bussche, Pierre; Willems, Sara",International journal for equity in health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-018-0828-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086754/,851

127357,[Risk assessment of exported risk of novel coronavirus pneumonia from Hubei Province].,2020-02-21,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don't suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.","Shneider, Alex; Kudriavtsev, Aleksandr; Vakhrusheva, Anna",International reviews of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2020.1756284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347747/,851

The necessity for achieving this specificity is exemplified by the RSK family, downstream effectors of ERK1/2, which have divergent physiological effects. The natural product, SL0101, a flavonoid glycoside, binds specifically to RSK1/2 through a binding pocket generated by an extensive conformational rearrangement within the RSK N-terminal kinase domain (NTKD). In modelling experiments a single amino acid that is divergent in RSK3/4 most likely prevents the required conformational rearrangement necessary for SL0101 binding. Kinetic analysis of RSK2 association with SL0101 and its derivatives identified that regions outside of the NTKD contribute to stable inhibitor binding. An analogue with an n-propyl-carbamate at the 4"" position on the rhamnose moiety was identified that forms a highly stable inhibitor complex with RSK2 but not with RSK1. These results identify a SL0101 modification that will aid the identification of RSK2 specific inhibitors.","Wright, Eric B; Fukuda, Shinji; Li, Mingzong; Li, Yu; O'Doherty, George A; Lannigan, Deborah A",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2021.1957862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348556/,851

As an alternative to systemic drug administration, inhaled drug delivery can produce high drug concentrations in the lung tissue to overcome resistant bacteria. The development of inhaled fixed-dose combination powders (I-FDCs) is promising next step in this field, as it would enable simultaneous drug-drug or drug-adjuvant delivery at the site of infection, thereby promoting synergistic activity and improving patient compliance. AREAS COVERED This review covers the clinical and pharmaceutical rationales for the development of I-FDCs for the treatment of respiratory infections, relevant technologies for particle and powder generation, and obstacles which must be addressed to achieve regulatory approval. EXPERT OPINION I-FDCs have been widely successful in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; however, application of I-FDCs towards the treatment of respiratory infections carries additional challenges related to the high dose requirements and physicochemical characteristics of anti-infective drugs. At present, co-spray drying is an especially promising approach for the development of composite fixed-dose anti-infective particles for inhalation. Though the majority of fixed-dose research has thus far focused on the combination of multiple antibiotics, future work may shift to the additional inclusion of immunomodulatory agents or repurposed non-antibiotics.","Brunaugh, Ashlee D; Sharma, Shivam; Smyth, Hugh",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2021.1886074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632051/,851

We leveraged provisional records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided as rolling 12-month sums, which are helpful for smoothing, yet may mask pandemic-related spikes in overdose mortality. We cross-referenced these rolling aggregates with previous monthly data to estimate monthly drug-related overdose mortality for January through July 2020. We quantified historical errors stemming from reporting delays and estimated empirically derived 95% prediction intervals (PIs).Results. We found that 9192 (95% PI = 8988, 9397) people died from drug overdose in May 2020-making it the deadliest month on record-representing a 57.7% (95% PI = 54.2%, 61.2%) increase over May 2019. Most states saw large-magnitude increases, with the highest in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

Prophylactic surgical decompression using microcapsulotomy improves kidney dysfunction after IRI. Supportive cell therapy in combination with microcapsulotomy might act synergistically protecting kidney function against IRI. The effects of therapeutic endothelial cell application alone and in combination with microcapsulotomy were investigated in a xenogenic murine model of 45-min warm renal ischemia. Renal function and perfusion were determined before as well as 2 and 18 days postischemia by (99m)Tc-MAG3 imaging and laser Doppler. Histological analysis included H&E stains and immunohistology for endothelial marker MECA-32, cell proliferation marker Ki-67, and macrophage marker F4/80. Histomorphological changes were quantified using a tubular injury score. Ischemia of 45 min led to severe tissue damage and a significant decrease in renal function and perfusion. Microcapsulotomy and cell therapy alone had no significant effect on renal function, while only surgical decompression significantly increased blood flow in ischemic kidneys. However, the combination of both microcapsulotomy and cell therapy significantly improved kidney function and perfusion. Combination therapy significantly reduced morphological injury of ischemic kidneys as determined by a tubular injury score and MECA-32 staining. Macrophage infiltration evidenced by F4/80 staining was significantly reduced. The Ki-67 proliferation index was increased, suggesting a regenerative environment. While microcapsulotomy and cell therapy alone have limited effect on renal recovery after IRI, combination therapy showed synergistic improvement of renal function, perfusion, and structural damage.

An association between long-term opioid treatment (L-TOT) of CNCP patients and suppression of both the innate and the adaptive immune system has been proposed. This systematic review aims at investigating the effects of L-TOT on the immune system in CNCP patients. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the CINAHL for relevant articles was performed. Studies examining measures of both the innate and the adaptive immune system in adult CNCP patients in L-TOT (≥4 weeks of intake) were included. Outcomes and the level of evidence were analyzed. RESULTS Three-hundred-eighty-two studies were identified; however, 376 were excluded (352 inappropriate methodology, 21 duplicates, 3 full-text could not be obtained) and one RCT and five cross-sectional studies were included and analyzed. L-TOT compared with no treatment was associated with a lower percentage of NK cells, a lower absolute number of CD56bright NK cells, a higher absolute number of IL-2 activated NK cells and a higher concentration of IL-1β as a response to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists stimulation (Pam3CSK4, LPS, Imiquimod). No other significant differences were reported. Generalizability of the results was limited due to inconsistency of outcomes and an overall low quality of the studies. CONCLUSIONS L-TOT may alter the immune system in CNCP patients, but the level of evidence is still weak.

Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7% vs 4.5% in low crowding index homes (P < .001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7% vs 1.3%, respectively (P < .001). The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (high = 31.3% vs low = 30.2%; P = .79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with an increased incidence of infection (relative risk [RR] = 1.73, 95% CI, 1.10-2.72) and mortality (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.99-2.87). A propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.30-3.38) and mortality (RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.09-3.08). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 998 COVID-19 cases (19.1%) and 263 deaths (18.1%). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort of Canadian nursing homes, crowding was common and crowded homes were more likely to experience larger and deadlier COVID-19 outbreaks.","Brown, Kevin A; Jones, Aaron; Daneman, Nick; Chan, Adrienne K; Schwartz, Kevin L; Garber, Gary E; Costa, Andrew P; Stall, Nathan M",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165560/,851

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of a family cluster of 8 individuals, of whom 1 family member (Patient 3) had an epidemiologic history of having visited Guangzhou from Hubei Province on January 20, 2020. Her father (Patient 1) developed a fever and respiratory system symptoms and was confirmed COVID-19-positive on February 4-5, 2020 at Zengcheng People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China. Seven close-contact family members of the patients were then screened for COVID-19 on February 5-6 at the hospital. The CT imaging manifestation and laboratory tests of this family cluster were investigated and reported. Results Five (62.5%) of the 8 family members were confirmed COVID-19-positive. Except for Patient 1, who had fever, cough, fatigue, and dizziness, the remaining four (4/5, 80%) COVID-19-positive family members (Patients 2-5) had no clinical symptoms. Among the 5 patients, 2 had leukopenia (2/5, 40%), 1 had low absolute neutrophil counts (1/5, 20%), and 2 had increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (2/5, 40%).

We use a survey among 730 persons living in Germany at the start of the official vaccination program. We elicit willingness to vaccinate first in a standard form, and then again after clarifications and after providing additional information. We find that a substantial number of persons who state initially that they do not want to get vaccinated does so simply because they want to let people with higher risk be vaccinated first. Appropriately rephrasing the question increases the willingness by around 5 percentage points. Information about herd immunity increases the willingness by additional 7%, confirming previous findings. Standard survey-based estimates of vaccination willingness might underestimate the real number of persons who want to get a vaccination.

This study aimed to establish if and how the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted the practice of routine prostate cancer screening in Verona, Italy. METHODS: We searched the laboratory information system of the Service of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospitals of Verona to identify all test requests for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and vitamin D (Vit D; i.e., the locally most requested immunochemical test) for outpatients during the last five years (December 10, 2016, to December 10, 2020). The weekly requests for these tests placed between February 25 and December 9, 2020, were compared to those placed during the same period of previous four years (i.e., 2016-2019). RESULTS: The volume of test requests for both Vit D and PSA did not differ in 2020 compared to previous four years. However, a dramatic decline was observed during the local lockdown period (between March 10 and May 17, 2020), with median decrease of 76% for Vit D and 62% for total PSA, respectively. This reduction was compensated by 13% increase for Vit D and 43% increase for total PSA in post-lockdown period. CONCLUSION: These results show that the lockdown period established during the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy’s Verona province was associated with a dramatic decrease in routine prostate cancer screenings.","Ferrari, Anna; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Henry, Brandon M.; Lippi, Giuseppe",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941059/,851

The outbreak occurred after the identified index patient visited a flat on a middle floor in Block E of the Amoy Gardens estate on two nights. Approximately 45% of the subsequently infected people resided in Block E, while the other 55% of infected cases mainly resided in six other blocks close to Block E. The distribution of the infected flats in Block E conformed to a non-uniform spatial pattern. Probable environmental causes for airborne transmission associated with the air movements between flats in Block E are identified. The well-established multi-zone airflow modeling method was used to analyze the virus-laden bio-aerosol dispersion between flats through door and window leakage areas in Block E under six different scenarios. The distribution of infection risk in Block E matched with the virus concentrations in flats predicted with the use of multi-zone modeling. Our study shows the importance of ventilation design in high-rise residential apartments. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The present study on the Amoy Gardens outbreak presented a scenario in which crowded living spaces might lead to infection disasters. There is a need to improve the current sanitary drainage design and maintenance standards to avoid any leakage of foul gas into the indoor environments. Our study revealed the need for a review of indoor air quality and ventilation design in buildings including offices, homes and hotels.

187027,Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome with convalescent plasma.,2003,"The RAS (renin-angiotensin system) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of CVD (cardiovascular disease), and RAS blockade is an important therapeutic strategy in the management of CVD. A new counterbalancing arm of the RAS is now known to exist in which ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 degrades Ang (angiotensin) II, the main effector of the classic RAS, and generates Ang-(1-7). Altered ACE2 expression is associated with cardiac and vascular disease in experimental models of CVD, and ACE2 is increased in failing human hearts and atherosclerotic vessels. In man, circulating ACE2 activity increases with coronary heart disease, as well as heart failure, and a large proportion of the variation in plasma ACE2 levels has been attributed to hereditary factors. The ACE2 gene maps to chromosome Xp22 and this paper reviews the evidence associating ACE2 gene variation with CVD and considers clues to potential functional ACE2 variants that may alter gene expression or transcriptional activity. Studies to date have investigated ACE2 gene associations in hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary artery disease, but the results have been inconsistent. The discrepancies may reflect the sample size of the studies, the gender or ethnicity of subjects, the cardiovascular phenotype or the ACE2 SNP investigated. The frequent observation of apparent sex-dependence might be of special importance, if confirmed. As yet, there are no studies to concurrently assess ACE2 gene polymorphisms and circulating ACE2 activity. Large-scale carefully conducted clinical studies are urgently needed to clarify more precisely the potential role of ACE2 in the CVD continuum.","Burrell, Louise M; Harrap, Stephen B; Velkoska, Elena; Patel, Sheila K",Clinical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013041/,851

We examined 184 diarrheic fecal specimens collected from 75 herds of adult cattle from seven provinces during the spring (warm), autumn (warm), and summer (hot) seasons. Bovine coronavirus-positive reactions were detected for 107 (58.2%) diarrheic fecal samples (in 47/75 herds). Of these 107 positive samples, 90 fecal samples from 33 herds tested positive for BCoV alone and 17 fecal samples from 14 herds also tested positive for other pathogens. Biological comparisons between the 9 BCoV strains isolated in this study and the 10 previously isolated WD-BCoV strains revealed that there was no receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) activity against mouse erythrocytes in the 9 BCoV strains but the 10 WD-BCoV strains had high RDE activity. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike (S) and hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) proteins revealed that all the Korean BCoVs clustered together regardless of season and were distinct from the other known BCoVs, suggesting a distinct evolutionary pathway for the Korean BCoVs.

We reviewed systematically data on smoking cessation rates from controlled trials that used biomedical risk assessment and feedback. OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy of biomedical risk assessment provided in addition to various levels of counselling, as a contributing aid to smoking cessation. SEARCH STRATEGY We systematically searched he Cochrane Collaboration Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), and EMBASE (1980 to 2004). We combined methodological terms with terms related to smoking cessation counselling and biomedical measurements. SELECTION CRITERIA Inclusion criteria were: a randomized controlled trial design; subjects participating in smoking cessation interventions; interventions based on a biomedical test to increase motivation to quit; control groups receiving all other components of intervention; an outcome of smoking cessation rate at least six months after the start of the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two assessors independently conducted data extraction on each paper, with disagreements resolved by consensus. MAIN RESULTS From 4049 retrieved references, we selected 170 for full text assessment. We retained eight trials for data extraction and analysis. One of the eight used CO alone and CO + Genetic Susceptibility as two different intervention groups, giving rise to three possible comparisons. Three of the trials isolated the effect of exhaled CO on smoking cessation rates resulting in the following odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 0.73 (0.38 to 1.39), 0.93 (0.62 to 1.41), and 1.18 (0.84 to 1.64). Combining CO measurement with genetic susceptibility gave an OR of 0.58 (0.29 to 1.19). Exhaled CO measurement and spirometry were used together in three trials, resulting in the following ORs (95% CI): 0.6 (0.25 to 1.46), 2.45 (0.73 to 8.25), and 3.50 (0.88 to 13.92). Spirometry results alone were used in one other trial with an OR of 1.21 (0.60 to 2.42). Two trials used other motivational feedback measures, with an OR of 0.80 (0.39 to 1.65) for genetic susceptibility to lung cancer alone, and 3.15 (1.06 to 9.31) for ultrasonography of carotid and femoral arteries performed in light smokers (average 10 to 12 cigarettes a day). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Due to the scarcity of evidence of sufficient quality, we can make no definitive statements about the effectiveness of biomedical risk assessment as an aid for smoking cessation. Current evidence of lower quality does not however support the hypothesis that biomedical risk assessment increases smoking cessation in comparison with standard treatment.

Biologically plausible reasons for a positive association between herd size and disease include a greater risk of introduction of pathogens from outside the herd, greater risk of transmission of pathogens within and among herds when the herd is large, and effects of management and environmental factors that are related to herd size. However, compared with owners of small herds, owners of large herds might more frequently adopt management and housing practices that mitigate this theoretically increased risk. We used studies of pleuritis, pneumonia and pseudorabies to describe the epidemiological issues involved in evaluations of the relationship between management factors, herd size and disease. In future studies, we recommend that (i) herd size be measured in a way that best characterizes the true population at risk; (ii) studies that evaluate management-related risk factors should account for herd size wherever possible; (iii) population-based studies of the interrelationships among management factors and between management factors, herd size, herd density and pig density be done; (iv) likely biological reasons for any herd-size effect be postulated; and (v) the distribution of herd sizes in the source population and the study sample be described.","Gardner, Ian A; Willeberg, Preben; Mousing, Jan",Animal health research reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12400869/,851

The need for new antibiotics is high, while the arsenal of available agents is decreasing, especially for the treatment of infections by Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are offering a promising route for novel antibiotic development and deep learning techniques can be utilised for successful AMP design. In this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) generative model and a bidirectional LSTM classification model were constructed to design short novel AMP sequences with potential antibacterial activity against E. coli. Two versions of the generative model and six versions of the classification model were trained and optimised using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation. These models were used to generate sets of short novel sequences that were classified as antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial. The validation accuracies of the classification models were 81.6-88.9% and the novel AMPs were classified as antimicrobial with accuracies of 70.6-91.7%. Predicted three-dimensional conformations of selected short AMPs exhibited the alpha-helical structure with amphipathic surfaces.

The raging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought a global crisis with its deadly spread all over the world. In the absence of an effective treatment and vaccine the efforts to control this pandemic strictly rely on personal preventive actions, e.g., handwashing, face mask usage, environmental cleaning, and most importantly on social distancing which is the only expedient approach to cope with this situation. Low light environments can become a problem in the spread of disease because of people's night gatherings. Especially, in summers when the global temperature is at its peak, the situation can become more critical. Mostly, in cities where people have congested homes and no proper air cross-system is available. So, they find ways to get out of their homes with their families during the night to take fresh air. In such a situation, it is necessary to take effective measures to monitor the safety distance criteria to avoid more positive cases and to control the death toll. In this paper, a deep learning-based solution is proposed for the above-stated problem. The proposed framework utilizes the you only look once v4 (YOLO v4) model for real-time object detection and the social distance measuring approach is introduced with a single motionless time of flight (ToF) camera. The risk factor is indicated based on the calculated distance and safety distance violations are highlighted. Experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits good performance with 97.84% mean average precision (mAP) score and the observed mean absolute error (MAE) between actual and measured social distance values is 1.01 cm.","Rahim, Adina; Maqbool, Ayesha; Rana, Tauseef",PLoS One,,851

METHODS: The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively. IC was necessary after 6% (17% in 2019 and 20% in 2018) of elective operations and 33% (11) of acute/emergency interventions. None of the patients treated electively were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Of the 34 patients treated in acute/emergency interventions, five (15%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. It was necessary to screen 14 (47%) vascular surgeons with NPS after contact with infected colleagues, but none for unprotected contact with patients; all were found to be negative on NPS and serological evaluation. CONCLUSION: A dedicated protocol allowed maintenance of regular elective vascular surgery activity during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no contamination of patients or physicians and minimal need for IC resources.","Pini, Rodolfo; Faggioli, Gianluca; Vacirca, Andrea; Gallitto, Enrico; Mascoli, Chiara; Attard, Luciano; Viale, Pierluigi; Gargiulo, Mauro",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,,851

In this overview, educators and course directors report their experiences in eteaching and share their innovative solutions. METHODS: We present a collection of methods that relate to teaching and assessment as well as student activation. RESULTS: A range of helpful tools for teaching were compiled. This includes instructional videos with simulated patients, structured homework to document a mental status examination, structured hand-offs, and practical examinations in video format. Motivational techniques include podcasts with interviews with clinicians and patients and teaching with the use of cinematic material. DISCUSSION: Switching to online formats creates opportunities and advantages for the advancement of time- and location-independent learning. A fast conversion in this direction might also pose some disadvantages. A direct patient-student interaction is critical for engaging with transference, countertransference and situational aspects for teaching in psychosocial disciplines.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe nursing faculty and student nurse factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine readiness. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of nursing faculty and student nurses at a university affiliated with an academic medical center was conducted. FINDINGS: Most full-time faculty (60%) intended to receive the vaccine; but only 45% of adjunct faculty and students reported intending to get vaccinated. The major reasons for not getting vaccinated were vaccine safety and side effects. Collectively, participants reported a low level of knowledge related to vaccine development. DISCUSSION: As the most trusted profession, nurses will play a decisive role in counseling patients about COVID-19 risks and benefits. Findings suggest that academic nursing leaders need to consider faculty and student vaccine concerns and provide vaccine development education.","Manning, Mary Lou; Gerolamo, Angela M; Marino, Marie Ann; Hanson-Zalot, Mary E; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika",Nurs. outlook,,851

A common finding in most COVID-19 patients is high D-dimer levels which are associated with a worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate coagulation abnormalities via traditional tests and whole blood thromboelastometry profiles in a group of 22 (mean age 67 ± 8 years, M:F 20:2) consecutive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Padova University Hospital for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Cases showed significantly higher fibrinogen and D-dimer plasma levels versus healthy controls (p < 0.0001 in both comparisons). Interestingly enough, markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles were observed in COVID-19 patients, as reflected by shorter Clot Formation Time (CFT) in INTEM (p = 0.0002) and EXTEM (p = 0.01) and higher Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM (p < 0.001 in all comparisons). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a brief online Mindfulness and Compassion-based Intervention to promote mental health among first year university students during COVID-19 home confinement. Methods: Participants (n=66) were first-year psychology students from a university in Spain with no prior meditation experience. Intervention lasted for 16 days and was designed ad-hoc. Using a pre-post within-subjects design, feasibility was assessed in five domains (acceptability, satisfaction, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy testing). Participants completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments of perceived stress, anxiety, and self-compassion. Results: The intervention showed to be feasible in all domains evaluated. It was implemented as planned with constrained resources, and limited efficacy testing showed promising results. After the intervention, stress and anxiety levels decreased significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.5146; p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6068, respectively) whereas self-compassion levels were augmented significantly (p<0.001, Hedges's g=0.6968). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a brief online mindfulness and compassion intervention may be a feasible way of promoting mental health among university students during COVID-19 lockdown. Further studies are required to address the limitations of the present study. We conclude that online interventions may constitute a promising pathway to buffer the mental health burden derived from the COVID-19 pandemic.","González-García, Marian; Álvarez, Jorge Crespo; Pérez, Elena Zubeldia; Fernandez-Carriba, Samuel; López, Javier González",Mindfulness (N Y),,851

Postponing cancer treatment without consideration of its implications could cost more lives than can be saved. In this special situation, we must continue to provide our cancer patients with the highest quality of medical services assuring the safety. This article provides general guidance on supporting curative treatment strategies in vulvar cancer patients. METHODS: At our institution, a vulvar cancer multidisciplinary team (Vul.Can MDT) of specialists is responsible for personalized treatment of this disease. The phase 2 period necessarily requires specific procedures for both outpatient and inpatient pathways and to provide strategies concerning the management of vulvar cancer patients even in case of an eventually concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. In brief, an accurate remote and in person triage must be provided routinely and patients submitted to specific diagnostic tests prior to every major treatment or procedure (surgery, RT, and CT) or in case of suspicion for COVID-19 syndrome. The decisional workflow for these women often old and frail, have been rapidly adjusted by our Vul.Can MDT to mitigate the potential risks of COVID-19. RESULTS: The team produced two types of recommendations concerning: (1) safety regulations of care pathways, patients and health care providers, (2) personalized treatment strategies. We present a protocol that can be applied in clinical practice: the flowcharts provided, include the modulation of treatment intensity designed for surgical procedures and radiation, stratified for FIGO stage of disease and intention.

The participants were given the option to use kinematic data and videos to develop workflow recognition models. Four tasks were proposed to the participants: three of them were related to the recognition of surgical workflow at three different granularity levels, while the last one addressed the recognition of all granularity levels in the same model. One ranking was made for each task. We used the average application-dependent balanced accuracy (AD-Accuracy) as the evaluation metric. This takes unbalanced classes into account and it is more clinically relevant than a frame-by-frame score. Six teams, including a non-competing team, participated in at least one task. All models employed deep learning models, such as CNN or RNN. The best models achieved more than 95% AD-Accuracy for phase recognition, 80% for step recognition, 60% for activity recognition, and 75% for all granularity levels. For high levels of granularity (i.e., phases and steps), the best models had a recognition rate that may be sufficient for applications such as prediction of remaining surgical time or resource management. However, for activities, the recognition rate was still low for applications that can be employed clinically.

Studies comparing patients with COVID-19 with contemporaneous controls of similar severity are lacking. METHODS: 22 COVID-19+ and 20 COVID-19- patients with respiratory failure admitted to intensive care were studied longitudinally. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the day of admission. APLA testing included anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-ß2glycoprotien 1 (ß2GP1), antidomain 1 ß2GP1 and antiphosphatidyl serine/prothrombin complex. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were detected by immunofluorescence and antibodies to cytokines by a commercially available multiplexed array. Analysis of variance was used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables with &#945;=0.05 and the false discovery rate at q=0.05. RESULTS: APLAs were predominantly IgG aCL (48%), followed by IgM (21%) in all patients, with a tendency towards higher frequency among the COVID-19+. aCL was not associated with surrogate markers of thrombosis but IgG aCL was strongly associated with worse disease severity and higher ANA titres regardless of COVID-19 status. An association between aCL and anticytokine autoantibodies tended to be higher among the COVID-19+.

335629,[Treatment strategy for gastrointestinal tumor under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China],2020,"What is an effective vaccination policy to end the COVID-19 pandemic? We address this question in a model of the dynamics of policy effectiveness drawing upon the results of a large panel survey implemented in Germany during the first and second waves of the pandemic. We observe increased opposition to vaccinations were they to be legally required. In contrast, for voluntary vaccinations, there was higher and undiminished support. We find that public distrust undermines vaccine acceptance, and is associated with a belief that the vaccine is ineffective and, if enforced, compromises individual freedom. We model how the willingness to be vaccinated may vary over time in response to the fraction of the population already vaccinated and whether vaccination has occurred voluntarily or not. A negative effect of enforcement on vaccine acceptance (of the magnitude observed in our panel or even considerably smaller) could result in a large increase in the numbers that would have to be vaccinated unwillingly in order to reach a herd-immunity target. Costly errors may be avoided if policy makers understand that citizens' preferences are not fixed but will be affected both by the crowding-out effect of enforcement and by conformism. Our findings have broad policy applicability beyond COVID-19 to cases in which voluntary citizen compliance is essential because state capacities are limited and because effectiveness may depend on the ways that the policies themselves alter citizens' beliefs and preferences.","Schmelz, Katrin; Bowles, Samuel",Proc.

The incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 and its impact on routine management for patients with pulmonary vascular disease is currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: For patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19. Evaluate the pandemic's impact on clinic operations at these centers. METHODS: A survey was emailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results. RESULTS: Seventy-seven center directors were successfully emailed a survey, 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.1 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general United States population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH and recognized COVID-19 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population. A large impact on clinic operations was observed including fewer clinic visits and substantially increased use of telehealth. A majority of centers curtailed diagnostic testing and a minority limited new starts of medical therapy. Most centers did not use experimental therapies in PAH/CTEPH patients diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in patients with PAH/CTEPH appears similar to the broader population, although outcomes may be worse. While the total number of patients with PAH/CTEPH recognized to have COVID-19 was small, the impact of COVID-19 on broader clinic operations, testing, and treatment was substantial.","Lee, Joshua D; Burger, Charles D; Delossantos, Genecelle B; Grinnan, Daniel; Ralph, David D; Rayner, Sam G; Ryan, John J; Safdar, Zeenat; Ventetuolo, Corey E; Zamanian, Roham T; Leary, Peter J",Ann.

In this study, we investigated the clinical benefits and initiation of favipiravir treatment in patients with non-severe coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to calculate the area under the curve, and the optimal cut-off values for the time to initiate favipiravir treatment were calculated to predict defervescence within seven days. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential influencing factors of defervescence. This was defined as a body temperature of less than 37 °C for at least 2 days. RESULTS: Data from 41 patients were used for the efficacy assessment. The days from the onset of fever to defervescence showed a positive correlation with the duration from the onset of fever to initiation of favipiravir treatment (r = 0.548, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value was the administration of favipiravir on day 4. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the optimal cut-off value from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment: early treatment group (within 4-days) and late treatment group (more than 4-days). In the multivariate analysis, when adjusted for age, sex, and days from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment, the significant factors were male sex and days of initiation of the favipiravir treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that if favipiravir is to be used for treatment, it should be initiated as early as possible.","Fujii, Satoshi; Ibe, Yuta; Ishigo, Tomoyuki; Inamura, Hirotoshi; Kunimoto, Yusuke; Fujiya, Yoshihiro; Kuronuma, Koji; Nakata, Hiromasa; Fukudo, Masahide; Takahashi, Satoshi",J Infect Chemother,,851
352399,[Novel coronavirus infection prevention and control measures in occupation health examination],2020,"This study takes an affiliative coping theory perspective to examine whether working adults reactivated dormant ties with individuals they had not contacted for at least 3 years to cope with stressors experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stressors originating in the workplace (job insecurity and remote work) and in the family (stressful familial social ties) were examined in a sample of 232 working adults in the southeastern United States. Individuals were more likely to reactivate their dormant ties when their job was insecure, and the magnitude of the reactivations was greater among individuals experiencing stressful social ties with family members than those not experiencing those stressors. We also found that there was a significant interaction between remote work and having a stressful tie within the household in dormant tie reactivation. Although previous theory has focused mostly on the benefits of frequent, active social relationships for coping, our results suggest that reactivating dormant ties might be a coping mechanism as well. Our study also suggests that workplace dormant tie research should broaden its focus beyond exchanged instrumental support to consider emotional support that might be transferred during reactivation.

The aim of our study was to learn more about the experiences of German patients and staff in the oncology services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted among cancer patients and their therapists (physicians, medical staff, psychologists, spiritual care givers) in Germany between April and May 2020 asking about burden, fears, and perceived changes in German oncology service system. Besides answer frequencies of different stakeholders, uni- and multivariate analyses were performed for selected items to identify areas of high impact. RESULTS: In total 752 participants were included. All groups have identified high mental burden as central problem. A majority was confused about varying information policies and strategies against the pandemic. Patient reported restricted visits, isolation and delay of treatment as central fears and problems. The majority of fears could be coped by the health care workers. The patients describe processes at the oncology services during the first wave. Personal experiences with COVID-19 have had no influence on the felt burden of the patients. Physicians, medical staff, psychologists and spiritual care givers were extremely stressed but repressed their own burden. They await financial, physical and mental problems for their own future. CONCLUSIONS: The presented personal views and experiences allow focusing the discussions about heath care systems during the on-going pandemic. Support for health care workers, as much routine as possible in oncology services, and transparency in information will be the keys for good management in futural situations of crisis.","Büntzel, Jens; Micke, Oliver; Klein, Michael; Büntzel, Judith; Walter, Stefanie; Keinki, Christian; Huebner, Jutta",J. cancer res. clin. oncol,,851

This note focuses on some potential effects on the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 'Zero Hunger' (Target 2.1) and, specifically, on the prevalence of undernourishment. After discussing the main changes induced by the Covid19 outbreak in various dimensions of food security, as identified by the preliminary literature on the topic, the note presents the dynamic estimates (GMM) of the recent determinants of food security, measured through the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG indicator 2.1.1), using a sample of 84 developing countries observed over the period 2000-2017. Since the rate of economic growth turns out to be a relevant determinant, the analysis quantifies the potential consequences that the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may have on the short- and long-run achievements of SDG 2 if proper counterbalancing measures will not be implemented. Such consequences in the short run would consist of millions of new undernourished people, while in the long run the progress made towards the 'Zero Hunger' goal are at risk of being completely reversed in the majority of countries. The note concludes by suggesting some directions for future research.","Saccone, Donatella",Eur. j. health econ,,851

This study aims to investigate the network structures of PTSD and the directions of relationships between symptoms among adolescent survivors in the year after the Yancheng Tornado in China. Method: A total of 395 youth survivors completed the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (Foa et al., 2001) at 3 months and 12 months following the tornado. Network analysis was used to compare networks of PTSD symptoms and changes over time. Results: Different centrality symptoms existed at different time points. Anger, startle responses, and physiological reactivity were important to the maintenance of PTSD symptoms arising from the tornado at 3 months, while dreams/nightmares and distancing/avoidance were important to maintaining PTSD symptoms at 12 months. Analysis suggested that sleep difficulty and intrusive thoughts were the key PTSD symptoms to be treated at 3 months; sleep remained to be the key symptoms to be treated at 12 months. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sleep difficulty could be a main cause of other symptoms and trigger the entire symptom system into undesirable psychopathological development among adolescent survivors in the year following major disasters.

Nursing staff are known to be at risk of developing back disorders, where low back pain has a prevalence from 16% to 60% in the world. This study aims to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain among nurses who working in a Roman hospital. METHODS: Cross sectional study was carried out in an Italian hospital and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire-IRSST was administered to 256 registered nurses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to understand risk factors associated with pain. RESULTS: Nurses reported different locations of pain related to musculoskeletal disorders. The prevalence of low back pain was 90.2% during life, 80% during the last year and 44.5% during the last week. Female sex increases the risk of being affected by low back pain (OR = 2.07, 95% CI= 1.00-4.32). CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain are reported by the majority of nurses interviewed, and a higher prevalence is observed in women. Pain does not depend on the amount of years of work, nor on age or body mass index. In order to assess the prevalence of low back pain carefully, it is recommended to study a greater number of Italian nurses in different hospitals.","Latina, Roberto; Petruzzo, Antonio; Vignally, Pascal; Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Vetri Buratti, Carlo; Mitello, Lucia; Giannarelli, Diana; D039,; Angelo, Daniela",Acta Biomed,,851

441244,"Accelerated menopausal changes as disease model for development of osteoarthritis, focum",2021,"Unprecedented travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused remarkable reductions in anthropogenic emissions, however, the Beijing area still experienced extreme haze pollution even under the strict COVID-19 controls. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were developed with respect to inter-annual variations, seasonal cycles, holiday effects, diurnal profile, and the non-linear influences of meteorological factors to quantitatively differentiate the lockdown effects and meteorology impacts on concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matters (PM2.5) at 34 sites in the Beijing area. The results revealed that lockdown measures caused large reductions while meteorology offset a large fraction of the decrease in surface concentrations. GAM estimates showed that in February, the control measures led to average NO2 reductions of 19 µg/m3 and average PM2.5 reductions of 12 µg/m3. At the same time, meteorology was estimated to contribute about 12 µg/m3 increase in NO2, thereby offsetting most of the reductions as well as an increase of 30 µg/m3 in PM2.5, thereby resulting in concentrations higher than the average PM2.5 concentrations during the lockdown. At the beginning of the lockdown period, the boundary layer height was the dominant factor contributing to a 17% increase in NO2 while humid condition was the dominant factor for PM2.5 concentrations leading to an increase of 65% relative to the baseline level. Estimated NO2 emissions declined by 42% at the start of the lockdown, after which the emissions gradually increased with the increase of traffic volumes. The diurnal patterns from the models showed that the peak of vehicular traffic occurred from about 12pm to 5pm daily during the strictest control periods. This study provides insights for quantifying the changes in air quality due to the lockdowns by accounting for meteorological variability and providing a reference in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures, thereby contributing to air quality mitigation policies.","Hua, Jinxi; Zhang, Yuanxun; de Foy, Benjamin; Shang, Jing; Schauer, James J; Mei, Xiaodong; Sulaymon, Ishaq Dimeji; Han, Tingting",J Environ Manage,,851

Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore ""via simulation"" plausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity. Our simulations suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and reinfection periods would play a dominant role in mitigating COVID-19.","Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian; Díaz-Infante, Saúl; Baca-Carrasco, David; Olmos-Liceaga, Daniel",Math Biosci,,851

We investigate private psychiatrists' uptake of (1) video- and telephone-telehealth consultations for Quarter-2 (April-June) of 2020 and (2) total telehealth and face-to-face consultations in Quarter-2, 2020 in comparison to Quarter-2, 2019 for Australia. METHODS: MBS item service data were extracted for COVID-19-psychiatrist-video- and telephone-telehealth item numbers and compared with a baseline of the Quarter-2, 2019 (April-June 2019) of face-to-face consultations for the whole of Australia. RESULTS: Combined telehealth and face-to-face psychiatry consultations rose during the first wave of the pandemic in Quarter-2, 2020 by 14% compared to Quarter-2, 2019 and telehealth was approximately half of this total. Face-to-face consultations in 2020 comprised only 56% of the comparative Quarter-2, 2019 consultations. Most telehealth provision was by telephone for short consultations of â©½15-30 min. Video consultations comprised 38% of the total telehealth provision (for new patient assessments and longer consultations).

484306,[Clinical cure strategies for hepatitis B: direct-acting antiviral drugs],2020,"Abstract Using the survey data collected on informal sector MSMEs in Senegal, this study performs logit and propensity score matching (PSM) both to examine the determinants of access to credit, the decline in sales, and the business growth prospect in the 12 months following the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the impact of credit on the MSMEs sales decline. We find that being a male manager and aged 46?55 years old reduces the likelihood of a decline in sales, whereas those who are 25?35 years present a high probability of experiencing a decrease in sales due to COVID-19. Being between 25 and 35 and 36?45 years old with a formalized MSME increases the probability of having access to loans. MSMEs that undertake manufacturing businesses appear more pessimistic about the future. More importantly, PSM findings show that MSMEs with loans have a higher average treatment effect of sales decline than their counterparts. This suggests that the greater the access to credit, the greater the difference in sales decline between MSMEs with credit and their counterpart without. The policy implications underline the importance of extended maturities and direct government financial support?not debt?to help the most affected informal sector MSMEs recover from the COVID-19 pandemic adverse effects.","Koloma, Yaya",African Development Review,,851

The aim of this study was to investigate the chest CT features associated with critical and non-critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A total of 1078 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent chest CT scans, including 169 critical cases and 909 non-critical cases, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The scans of all participants were reviewed and compared in two groups of study. In addition, the risk factors associated with disease in critical and non-critical patients were analyzed. Results Chest CT scans showed bilateral and multifocal involvement in most (86.4%) of the participants, with 97.6 and 84.3% reported in critical and non-critical patients, respectively. The incidences of pure consolidation (p = 0.019), mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation (p < 0.001), pleural effusion (p < 0.001), and intralesional traction bronchiectasis (p = 0.007) were significantly higher in critical compared to non-critical patients. However, non-critical patients showed higher incidence of pure GGOs than the critical patients (p < 0.001). Finally, the total opacity scores of the critical patients were significantly higher than those of non-critical patients (13.71 ± 6.26 versus 4.86 ± 3.52, p < 0.001), with an area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.94) for COVID-19 detection. Conclusions Our results revealed that the chest CT examination was an effective means of detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the natural course of COVID-19. It can distinguish the critical patients from the non-critical patients (AUC = 0.91), which is helpful for the judgment of clinical condition and has important clinical value for the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Jafari, Ramezan; Ashtari, Sara; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Maghsoudi, Houshyar; Cheraghalipoor, Fatemeh; Jafari, Nematollah Jonaidi; Saadat, Hassan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,851
493691,[Expert consensus for bronchoscopy during the epidemic of 2019 Novel Coronavirus infection (Trial version)],2020,"BACKGROUND: The current target oxygen saturation range for patients with COVID-19 recommended by the National Institutes of Health is 92-96%. MAIN BODY: This article critically examines the evidence guiding current target oxygen saturation recommendation for COVID-19 patients, and raises important concerns in the extrapolation of data from the two studies stated to be guiding the recommendation. Next, it examines the influence of hypoxia on upregulation of ACE2 (target receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry) expression, with supporting transcriptomic analysis of a publicly available gene expression profile dataset of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Finally, it discusses potential implications of specific clinical observations and considerations in COVID-19 patients on target oxygen saturation, such as diffuse systemic endothelitis and microthrombi playing an important pathogenic role in the wide range of systemic manifestations, exacerbation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the setting of pulmonary vascular endothelitis/microthrombi, the phenomenon of ""silent hypoxemia"" with some patients presenting to the hospital with severe hypoxemia disproportional to symptoms, and overburdened health systems and public health resources in many parts of the world with adverse implications on outpatient monitoring and early institution of oxygen supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The above factors and analyses, put together, call for an urgent exploration and re-evaluation of target oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients, both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Until data from such trials become available, where possible, it may be prudent to target an oxygen saturation at least at the upper end of the recommended 92-96% range in COVID-19 patients both in the inpatient and outpatient settings (in patients that are normoxemic at pre-COVID baseline). Home pulse oximetry, tele-monitoring, and earlier institution of oxygen supplementation for hypoxemic COVID-19 outpatients could be beneficial, where public health resources allow for their implementation.","Shenoy, Niraj; Luchtel, Rebecca; Gulani, Perminder",BMC Med,,851

To analyze the application of corticosteroids in patients with severe pneumonia. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, clinical characteristics, corticosteroids use, and outcomes of the 65 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from Jan 20 to Feb 23, 2020. The final follow-up date observed was April 15th, 2020. The number of patients with mild, general, severe, and critical type were 10 (15.38%), 32 (49.23%), 8 (12.31%), and 15 (23.08%), respectively. The median incubation period was 6 days. Notable outliers were 1 patient at 16 days and 1 patient at 21 days. In lymphocyte subgroup analysis, decreases in total, T, CD4, and CD8 lymphocytes were more common as the disease worsened (All P < 0.05). Methylprednisolone (mPSL) was applied to 31 (47.69%) patients with pneumonia, including 10 (31.25%) general, 8 (100%) severe, and 13 (86.67%) critical patients, respectively. Corticosteroids inhibited Interleukin-6(IL-6) production (P = 0.0215) but did not affect T lymphocyte (P = 0.0796). There was no significant difference between patients using lower dose (&#8804; 2 mg/kg day) and higher dose (> 2 mg/kg day) mPSL in inhibiting IL-6 production (P = 0.5856). Thirty of 31 patients (96.77%) had stopped mPSL due to improvement of pneumonia. Virus RNA clearance time lengthened with disease progression (P = 0.0001). In general type, there was no significant difference in virus clearance time between patients with (15, 12-19 days) and without (14.5, 11-18 days) (P = 0.7372) mPSL use. Lymphocyte, especially T lymphocyte, in severe and critical patients showed a dramatic decrease. Application of lower dose corticosteroids (&#8804; 2 mg/kg day) could inhibit IL-6 production (a representative of cytokines) as effectively as a higher dose. Proper use corticosteroids in general type patients did not delay virus clearance.","Liu, Fangfang; Ji, Chengcheng; Luo, Jiajun; Wu, Weiwei; Zhang, Junchang; Zhong, Zhiqiang; Lankford, Seth; Huang, Huang; Lin, Fang; Wang, Yonggang; Mo, Guoxin; Hu, Xingshuo; Jiang, Tianjun; Shao, Yanling; Ji, Sumin; Zhang, Yawei; Qin, Enqiang; Mu, Jinsong",Sci Rep,,851

To allocate medical resources efficiently, Korea implemented a novel institution for the purpose of treating patients with cohort isolation out of hospital, namely the Community Treatment Center (CTC). Herein, we report results of the initial management of patients at one of the largest CTC in Korea. A total of 309 patients were admitted to our CTC. During the first two weeks, 7 patients were transferred to the hospital because of symptom aggravation and 107 patients were discharged without any complication. Although it is a novel concept and may have some limitations, CTC may be a very cost-effective and resource-saving strategy in managing massive cases of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.","Park, Peong Gang; Kim, Chang Hyup; Heo, Yoon; Kim, Tae Suk; Park, Chan Woo; Kim, Choong Hyo",J Korean Med Sci,,851

Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between asthma and the risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients. Methods Systematic searches were performed through electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science to identify the potential articles reporting adjusted effect estimates on the association of asthma with fatal COVID-19. A random-effects model was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, meta-regression, Begg’s test and Egger’s test were also performed. Results The overall results based on sixty-two studies with 2,457,205 cases reporting adjusted effect estimates demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with asthma had a significantly reduced risk of mortality compared with those without (15 cohort studies-829,670 patients, pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.82-0.95], I 2 = 65.9%, P < 0.001; 34 cohort studies-1,008,015 patients, pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.88, 95% CI [0.82-0.94], I 2 = 39.4%, P = 0.011; 11 cross-sectional studies-1,134,738 patients, pooled OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.78-0.97], I 2 = 41.1%, P = 0.075).

592487,Fill the gap between traditional and new era: The medical educational reform in Taiwan,2019-09-16,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant shutdowns on mental health. This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. FINDINGS: Nearly one in five (19•7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15•5% had a history of IPV and 10•1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. INTERPRETATION: Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

Results indicated that free chlorine in SAEW, even at a low concentration (30 mg/L), was able to remove Cladosporium cladosporioides, a typical airborne fungus that degrades food, and spores such as Bacillus subtilis, a hardy bacterium. In an experiment involving spatial spraying, 3.43 log(10) CFU/100 L of Staphylococcus epidermidis was sprayed in a room-sized space; the same space was then sprayed with SAEW. The number of settling microbes was measured and the sterilizing ability of SAEW was assessed.

In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of caveolin-1 (mCav-1) from mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) and study on the roles of mCav-1 in the fish Jak–Stat signaling pathway and in virus infection. The cDNA sequence of mCav-1 was 707 bp in size, encoding a protein of 181 amino acids, which was different from the mammalian protein (178 amino acids). The deduced amino acid sequence of mCav-1 shared similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, but mCav-1 lacked a phosphorylation site (y14). The major subcellular location of mCav-1 was in the caveolae, where the protein appeared to have major functions. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression of the mandarin fish Mx, IRF-1, SOCS1, and SOCS3 genes involved in the poly(I:C)-induced Jak–Stat signaling pathway was impaired by the mCav-1 scaffolding domain peptide (mSDP). In mandarin fish fry (MFF-1) cells, the protein levels of mCav-1 were markedly up-regulated at 12 and 24 h post-infection with ISKNV (infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus). In addition, ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was significantly inhibited by mSDP, and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Thus, ISKNV infection was apparently associated with mCav-1 protein and may utilize the caveolae-related endocytosis pathway. The findings reported here further our understanding of the function of caveolin-1 in the complex signal transduction network in fish immune systems and in the cellular entry mechanism of iridoviruses.","Guo, Chang-Jun; Yang, Xiao-Bo; Wu, Yan-Yan; Yang, Li-Shi; Mi, Shu; Liu, Zhao-Yu; Jia, Kun-Tong; Huang, Yu-Xin; Weng, Shao-Ping; Yu, Xiao-Qiang; He, Jian-Guo",Mol Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589011000046; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2011.01.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589011000046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296425/,851
