To clarify the effects of FAdV-4 on immune organs in birds, we conducted a detailed examination of dynamic morphology and damage mechanisms in chickens randomly divided into 4 groups (FAdV-4, vaccination, FAdV-4 plus vaccination, and control). FAdV-4 caused the depletion of lymphocytes and subsequent growth impairment in the thymus and bursa. Chickens infected with FAdV-4 and subjected to vaccination experienced greater inhibition of antibody responses to inactivated vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian influenza virus subtype H9 than uninfected and vaccinated chickens. The mechanisms underlying adenovirus-mediated lymphoid organ damage were further investigated via transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and apoptotic genes transcription analyses. Notably, lymphocytes apoptosis in lymphoid organs and expression of specific gene transcripts was significantly upregulated after infection (P < 0.05). Furthermore, increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA was observed (P < 0.05), compared to the control group. Our collective findings suggested that FAdV-4 caused structural and functional damage of immune organs via apoptosis along with induction of a severe inflammatory response.","Niu, Yujuan; Sun, Qinqin; Shi, Yongyong; Ding, Yonghe; Li, Zhiqiang; Sun, Yuanchao; Li, Meihang; Liu, Sidang",Poult Sci,528,22

MATÉRIELS ET MÉTHODES: Cohorte prospective observationnelle auprès d’un échantillon aléatoire de médecins généralistes (MG) et pneumologues libéraux. L’efficacité était évaluée par le % de patients sans nouvelle consultation pour EABC à 3 mois. Le modèle de Cox a été utilisé pour la recherche de facteurs pronostiques. RÉSULTATS: 951 mg et 89 pneumologues ont inclus 4 994 patients. L’âge moyen était de 64,4 ans, avec 61,4 % d’hommes, 38,7 % d’anciens fumeurs, 35,7 % de fumeurs actuels. 2 ou 3 critères d’Anthonisen dont une expectoration muco-purulente étaient retrouvés chez 71,8 % des patients, 2 ou 3 critères hors expectoration mucopurulente chez 12,8 % et < 2 critères chez 15,4 %. Prescriptions : antibiothérapie (AB) à 91,9 % des patients, corticoïdes systémiques (41,5 %), mucolytiques (41,0 %) et bronchodilatateurs beta2-adrénergiques (30,7 %). L’absence d’une nouvelle consultation pour EABC à 3 mois concerne 63,8 % des patients. L’AB réduit le risque de survenue d’une nouvelle consultation (RR [IC 95 %] = 0,35 [0,13 ; 0,94]) chez les fumeurs actuels ayant au moins 2 critères dont une expectoration mucopurulente. Une corticothérapie systémique augmente le risque chez les patients ayant au moins 2 critères d’Anthonisen dont l’expectoration muco-purulente (1,16 [1,03 ; 1,30]) et chez les patients ayant deux critères d’Anthonisen hors expectoration muco-purulente ou moins de 2 critères (1,29 [1,06 ; 1,57]). CONCLUSION: Chez les fumeurs actuels ayant au moins deux critères d’Anthonisen dont l’expectoration muco-purulente, l’AB réduit de 65 % le risque de nouvelle consultation. La corticothérapie par voie générale augmente ce risque de 16 % à 29 % selon le groupe de patients.","Peyramond, D.; Demeaux, J.-L.; Housset, B.; Mayaud, C.; Pouchain, D.; Molimard, M.; Moore, N.",Med Mal Infect,528,1

Incidental COVID-19 in major trauma patients suggests higher than predicted rates of infection in London,22.719187,8.192124,2021-03-26,"Despite advances in medical knowledge, parasitic diseases remain a significant global health burden and their pharmacological treatment is often hampered by drug toxicity. Therefore, drug delivery systems may provide useful advantages when used in combination with conventional therapeutic compounds. Dendrimers are three-dimensional polymeric structures, characterized by a central core, branches and terminal functional groups. These nanostructures are known for their defined structure, great water solubility, biocompatibility and high encapsulation ability against a wide range of molecules. Furthermore, the high ratio between terminal groups and molecular volume render them a hopeful vector for drug delivery. These nanostructures offer several advantages compared to conventional drugs for the treatment of parasitic infection. Dendrimers deliver drugs to target sites with reduced dosage, solving side effects that occur with accepted marketed drugs. In recent years, extensive progress has been made towards the use of dendrimers for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic purposes for the management of parasitic infections. The present review highlights the potential of several dendrimers in the management of parasitic diseases.","Folliero, Veronica; Zannella, Carla; Chianese, Annalisa; Stelitano, Debora; Ambrosino, Annalisa; De Filippis, Anna; Galdiero, Marilena; Franci, Gianluigi; Galdiero, Massimiliano",Pharmaceutics,528,16

Methods This was a prospective cohort study of colorectal cancers operated on by NOTES (transanally for rectal tumours, transvaginally for sigmoid tumours) between December 2013 and December 2015, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Eligibility criteria included ASA fitness grade I-III, BMI below 25 kg/m2 and TNM stage T3 N0 M0. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or distant metastasis. The anastomosis was either handsewn or performed mechanically. Results Sixteen patients were operated on by a transanal and four by a transvaginal approach. There were ten men and ten women, with a mean(s.d.) age of 55·6(12·1) years. Mean BMI was 22·4(2·6) kg/m2. Four anterior, 11 low anterior and five intersphincteric resections were performed for 16 rectal and four low sigmoid tumours. The mean duration of surgery was 258(11) min. No conversion to laparotomy was needed, and there were no deaths. Five patients required additional ports, for intraoperative bleeding (1), suture of an intraoperative urethral injury with covering ileostomy (1) and difficulty in dissection (3). One patient had an anastomotic leak requiring transanal closure and ileostomy on day 7. Both ileostomies were closed after 2 months. The mean hospital stay was 6·4(1·8) days. All resections were R0. Conclusion In carefully selected patients NOTES for colorectal cancer resection was feasible and effective.","Hiep, P N; Thien, H H; Vu, P A; Thanh, P H; Xuan, N T",BJS open,528,16

METHODS We systematically searched online databases to identify any report on maternal depression during pregnancy or postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey (EPDS) and maternal anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) until 5th July 2020. The random-effects model was used to pool the effect sizes and standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Eight studies reported depressive and anxiety states of 7750 women, either pregnant or postpartum were included. The overall pooled EPDS score was higher among women during pandemic (SMD= 0.40, 95% CI: -0.05 - 0.86, p = .083) compared to previous non-pandemic times, without reaching a statistically significant difference. However, the overall pooled STAI score was significantly higher during pandemic (SMD= 0.82, 95% CI: 0.49 - 1.16, p < .001). No significant publication bias existed in selected studies (p > .05). CONCLUSION The present meta-analysis provides evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increases the risk of anxiety among women during pregnancy and perinatal period. Support measures should be considered for women during pregnancy or perinatal period to guarantee mental health for this susceptible population.","Hessami, Kamran; Romanelli, Chiara; Chiurazzi, Martina; Cozzolino, Mauro","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",528,31

In 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessary to alter priorities. In these challenging times, Cochrane Rehabilitation has firstly changed its internal organisation and established a new relevant project in line with pandemic needs: the REH-COVER (Rehabilitation - COVID-19 evidence-based response) action. The aim was to focus on the timely collection, review and dissemination of summarised and synthesised evidence relating to COVID-19 and rehabilitation. Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action has included in 2020 five main initiatives: 1) rapid living systematic reviews on rehabilitation and COVID-19; 2) interactive living evidence map on rehabilitation and COVID-19; 3) definition of the research topics on ""rehabilitation and COVID-19"" in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) rehabilitation programme; 4) Cochrane Library special collection on Coronavirus (COVID-19) rehabilitation; and 5) collaboration with COVID-END for the topics ""rehabilitation"" and ""disability."" Furthermore, we are still carrying on five different special projects: Be4rehab; RCTRACK; definition of rehabilitation for research purposes; ebook project; and a prioritization exercise for Cochrane Reviews production.

METHODOLOGY In this cross-sectional observational study, matched saliva and oral swabs were collected from a total of 115 subjects: 70 immunocompetent subjects with no mucosal abnormalities, 22 with mucosal abnormalities and 23 therapeutically immunocompromised individuals. Extracted DNA was analysed by multiplex qPCR for detection and quantification of human herpes viruses 1-6. RESULTS At least one human herpes virus was detected in 77.1% of immunocompetent individuals with no mucosal abnormalities, with EBV the most commonly detected at 61.4%. HHV-6 was detected in 17.1%, HSV-1 in 4.3% and CMV in 1.1%. Detection was higher in saliva than in oral swabs. There was no detection of HSV-2 or VZV. Neither presence of oral mucosal abnormality nor therapeutic immunocompromise was related to increased detection of human herpes virus. CONCLUSION Commensal detection rates of EBV are high and caution in clinical correlation of positive detection is warranted. Commensal CMV rates are low and detection is likely to be clinically relevant. This study presents a comprehensive commensal detection rate of human herpes viruses 1-6 by qPCR in saliva and swabs.","Yap, Tami; Khor, Shuan; Kim, Jung Seo; Kim, Jaeyoung; Kim, Sung Yun; Kern, Johannes S; Martyres, Raymond; Varigos, George; Chan, Hiu Tat; McCullough, Michael J; Thomas, Melissa L; Scardamaglia, Laura",Oral diseases,528,30

Using standardized self-report measures, we examined differences in stress and sleep by comparing responses from three independent samples of undergraduates in the United States. Samples were obtained prior to COVID-19 (Spring 2019) and at two periods during the pandemic (Spring 2020 and Summer 2020) which corresponded to an increasing impact of COVID-19 at the local level. Within the combined sample of 1,222 students, 94% identified as Hispanic. Contrary to our hypotheses, stress, sleep quality, and insomnia were not significantly higher in the samples collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in support of our hypotheses, bedtime and waketime were significantly later during the pandemic, and sleep duration was significantly longer. Although scores on the global measure of sleep quality did not differ across semesters, supplemental exploratory analyses demonstrated a more complex picture of differences in sleep variables. Among the findings, there was evidence of greater sleep latency, greater sleep medication use, and poorer sleep efficiency during the pandemic. Our results suggest that, within the U.S. college student population, COVID-19's impact on stress and sleep may not be entirely negative. This article is protected by copyright.

A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) should be considered in infants with exanthematous fever. More perplexing is the increasing incidence of an atypical form of KD. Pathogenesis of KD remains unclear even though an aberrant response of the immune system to an unidentified pathogen is often hypothesised. A 30-fold increase in the incidence of KD in Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests an immune response to a viral trigger. We report an infant clinically diagnosed with high probability as incomplete KD, who presented with reactivation of the BCG injection site even though fever with rash was only less than 3 days duration. Echocardiography confirmed coronary artery abnormalities and prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin facilitated rapid recovery.

Many viruses, including coronavirus and influenza virus, wreak havoc on the control of cytokine expression, leading to the formation of detrimental cytokine storms. Understanding the regulation and interplay between inflammatory cytokines is critical to the identification of targets involved in controlling the induction of cytokine expression. In this study, we focused on how the antiviral cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27) regulates signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 ligation, which recognize endosomal single-stranded RNA. Given that IL-27 alters bacterial-sensing TLR expression on myeloid cells and can inhibit replication of single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated whether IL-27 affects expression and function of TLR7 and TLR8. Analysis of IL-27-treated THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1-derived macrophages revealed changes in mRNA and protein expression of TLR7 and TLR8. Although treatment with IL-27 enhanced TLR7 expression, only TLR8-mediated cytokine secretion was amplified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, inhibited cytokine and chemokine production induced by a TLR8 agonist, TL8-506. Delineating the immunomodulatory role of IL-27 on TLR7 and TLR8 responses provides insight into how myeloid cell TLR-mediated responses are regulated during virus infection.","Odoardi, Natalya; Kourko, Olena; Petes, Carlene; Basta, Sameh; Gee, Katrina",Journal of innate immunity,528,1

This study aggregates existing evidence on neurodevelopmental outcome in these patients using meta-analysis. METHOD PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles published until October 2019. Out of the 5316 unique articles that were identified, 47 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included. Standardised mean differences (Cohen's d) between cognitive, motor and language outcome of patients with congenital gastrointestinal malformations and normative data (39 studies) or the studies' control group (8 studies) were aggregated across studies using random-effects meta-analysis. The value of (clinical) moderators was studied using meta-regression and diagnostic subgroups were compared. RESULTS The 47 included studies encompassed 62 cohorts, representing 2312 patients. Children with congenital gastrointestinal malformations had small-sized cognitive impairment (d=-0.435, p<0.001; 95% CI -0.567 to -0.302), medium-sized motor impairment (d=-0.610, p<0.001; 95% CI -0.769 to -0.451) and medium-sized language impairment (d=-0.670, p<0.001; 95% CI -0.914 to -0.425). Patients with short bowel syndrome had worse motor outcome. Neurodevelopmental outcome was related to the number of surgeries and length of total hospital stay, while no relations were observed with gestational age, birth weight, age and sex. INTERPRETATION This study shows that children with congenital gastrointestinal malformations exhibit impairments in neurodevelopmental outcome, highlighting the need for routine screening of neurodevelopment during follow-up.","Roorda, Daniëlle; Königs, Marsh; Eeftinck Schattenkerk, Laurens; van der Steeg, Lideke; van Heurn, Ernest; Oosterlaan, Jaap",Archives of disease in childhood.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant and, since 2016, of extensively drug-resistant cases is a continuous challenge for health care workers. The COVID-19 pandemic is making management more difficult. METHODOLOGY In the present study, a total of 52 confirmed cases of typhoid have been studied during 2019. Detailed clinical features, complications and, lab findings were studied. Typhoid culture and sensitivity were recorded and patients were treated accordingly. Patients were asked about risk factors to aim at informing prevention. RESULTS Out of the 52 having blood culture positive for Salmonella Typhi 47 (90.4%) and Salmonella Paratyphi 5 (9.6%), 4 (7.7%) were sensitive to first-line (Non-resistant), 11 (21.2%) MDR and 37 (71.2%) patient were XDR. One case was resistant to azithromycin. Nausea, vomiting or, abdominal pain was present in 12 (23%), abdominal distension present in 9 (17.3%), abdominal tenderness in 8 (15.4%), hepatomegaly in 10 (19.2%) and, splenomegaly in 22 (42.3%).There were ultrasound abnormalities in 58% of patients and GI complications in 19% of patients. No significant difference was found in clinical findings and complications between resistant and non-resistant cases. Only 23-27% of patients were aware of typhoid prevention and vaccination measures. CONCLUSIONS The increasing prevalence of resistance and higher degree of complications seen in typhoid fever raises the concern further about prevention and effective infection management in the community as well as clinical settings. Moreover, judicial use of antibiotics is much needed in developing countries like Pakistan.","Fida, Samina; Mansoor, Hala; Saif, Saba; Iqbal, Javed; Khan, Arif Qayyum",Journal of infection in developing countries,528,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 126 crowns with four identical buccal surfaces were fabricated using seven different CAD/CAM materials: CEREC Blocs unglazed (CBU), CEREC Blocs glazed (CBG), IPS Empress CAD (EMP), IPS e.max CAD (EMA), VITA SUPRINITY PC (SUP), inCoris TZI (TZI) and VITA ENAMIC (ENA). A total of 504 APC Flash-Free (APC FF)-precoated brackets were bonded applying three surface treatments: (1) MI; (2) MEP and (3) 9.6% HF. SBS was performed after 24 h and TC. Results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS MEP conditioning yielded lower SBS results compared with MI and 9.6% HF for CBG (24 h and TC) and EMA (TC) materials. EMP conditioning with MEP after 24 h obtained lower SBS values compared with MI; however, after TC, SBS was similar to MI group and higher than with 9.6% HF. After TC for TZI ceramic, MI protocol (sandblasting) obtained higher SBS scores than MEP, but similar than 9.6% HF. Treatment of ENA with MI and MEP produced higher results than 9.6% HF after TC. SBS results were similar for CBU and SUP, regardless of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS Although each CAD/CAM material requires specific surface treatment to obtain the highest SBS of APC FF brackets, the treatment with MEP is a valid orthodontic alternative for most of the materials tested. TC significantly decreased SBS for most of the materials. CLINICAL RELEVANCE MEP can be considered a valid and promising product to condition most of the CAD/CAM ceramics evaluated for APC FF bracket bonding purposes, allowing a faster and safer procedure.","González-Serrano, Carlos; Phark, Jin-Ho; Fuentes, María Victoria; Albaladejo, Alberto; Sánchez-Monescillo, Andrés; Duarte, Sillas; Ceballos, Laura",Clinical oral investigations,528,17

Development of biomarkers for preoperative risk prediction is of major relevance. As inflammation present before surgery might predispose to POD and postoperative NCD development, we aim to determine associations between preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and the incidence of POD and postoperative NCD. METHODS In this observational study, we analyzed 314 patients enrolled in the SuDoCo trial, who had a preoperative CRP measurement the day before surgery. Primary outcomes were POD assessed according DSM-4 from day 1 until day 7 after surgery and postoperative NCD assessed 3 months after surgery. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, randomization, body mass index, MMSE, ASA status, infection/autoimmune disease/malignoma and types of surgery to determine associations between CRP with POD and postoperative NCD, respectively. RESULTS Preoperative CRP was independently associated with POD [OR 1.158 (95%CI 1.040, 1.291); p=0.008]. Patients with CRP values ≥ 5 mg/L had a 4.8-fold increased POD risk [OR 5.771 (95%CI 1.765, 12.899; p=0.002)] compared to patients with lower CRP values. However, no association was seen between preoperative CRP and postoperative NCD [OR 0.552 (95%CI 0.193, 1.581); p=0.269]. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative CRP levels were independently associated with POD but not postoperative NCD after three months. Moreover, higher preoperative CRP levels showed higher risk for POD. This strengthens the role of inflammation in the development of POD. Assessment of CRP before surgery might allow risk stratification of POD. This article is protected by copyright.

By borrowing the skeletal structure of each of the host materials, a hypothetical crystal structure is created by substituting all lanthanide sites with Nd, all transition metal sites with Fe, and all light element sites with B. High-throughput first-principle calculations are applied to evaluate the phase stability of these structures. Twenty of them are found to be potentially formable. As the first investigative result, the descriptor-relevance analysis on the orbital field matrix (OFM) materials' descriptor reveals the average atomic coordination number as the essential factor in determining the structure stability of these substituted Nd-Fe-B crystal structures. 19 among 20 hypothetical structures that are found potentially formable have an average coordination number larger than 6.5. By applying the t-SNE dimensionality reduction method, all the local structures represented by the OFM descriptors are integrated into a visible space to study the detailed correlation between their characteristics and the stability of the crystal structure to which they belong. We discover that unstable substituted structures frequently carry Nd and Fe local structures with two prominent points: low average coordination numbers and fully occupied B neighboring atoms. Moreover, there are only three popular forms of B local structures appearing on all potentially formable substituted structures: cage networks, planar networks, and interstitial sites. The discovered relationships are promising to speed up the screening process for the new formable crystal structures.","Nguyen, Duong-Nguyen; Dao, Duc-Anh; Miyake, Takashi; Dam, Hieu-Chi",The Journal of chemical physics,528,1

Here, we report analysis of the fecal virome of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected at seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a period of 1 year. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses being associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found neither genetic footprints to known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.IMPORTANCE Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a concern for public health. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in multiple locations within New York City over a period of 1 year, we found a diverse collection of viruses that includes some previously not associated with house mice and others that appear to be novel. Although we found no known human pathogens, our findings provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models that have utility for clinical microbiology.","Williams, Simon H; Che, Xiaoyu; Garcia, Joel A; Klena, John D; Lee, Bohyun; Muller, Dorothy; Ulrich, Werner; Corrigan, Robert M; Nichol, Stuart; Jain, Komal; Lipkin, W Ian",mBio,528,1

Studies have also observed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria in such patients. Although a recent autopsy series of patients who died with severe COVID-19 in China found acute tubular necrosis in the kidney, a few patient reports have also described collapsing glomerulopathy in COVID-19. METHODS We evaluated biopsied kidney samples from ten patients at our institution who had COVID-19 and clinical features of AKI, including proteinuria with or without hematuria. We documented clinical features, pathologic findings, and outcomes. RESULTS Our analysis included ten patients who underwent kidney biopsy (mean age: 65 years); five patients were black, three were Hispanic, and two were white. All patients had proteinuria. Eight patients had severe AKI, necessitating RRT. All biopsy samples showed varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis, and one patient had associated widespread myoglobin casts. In addition, two patients had findings of thrombotic microangiopathy, one had pauci-immune crescentic GN, and another had global as well as segmental glomerulosclerosis with features of healed collapsing glomerulopathy. Interestingly, although the patients had confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by RT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining of kidney biopsy samples for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all ten patients. Also, ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy showed no evidence of viral particles in the biopsy samples. CONCLUSIONS The most common finding in our kidney biopsy samples from ten hospitalized patients with AKI and COVID-19 was acute tubular necrosis. There was no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the biopsied kidney tissue.","Sharma, Purva; Uppal, Nupur N; Wanchoo, Rimda; Shah, Hitesh H; Yang, Yihe; Parikh, Rushang; Khanin, Yuriy; Madireddy, Varun; Larsen, Christopher P; Jhaveri, Kenar D; Bijol, Vanesa",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,528,26

The SQL Challenge Game was aimed at engaging students in out-of-class learning activities and enhancing students' academic performance. This game platform is characterized by the availability of a challenge mode game, in which two players raced to answer questions of SQL. So far, we have not found such kind of SQL practice game with peer interaction and competition in other pieces of literature. This study inquired into which category of gamified learning activities, solo mode or challenge mode, was more appealing to students and helped them perform better academically.

This study describes a method for the detection of SARS associated coronavirus gene by the combination of functionalized nanoparticles and PCR-based assay. In this method, the target cDNA of SARS associated coronavirus was firstly captured and enriched from the mixture of target cDNA and non-target cDNA by the use of the functionalized silica coated superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Additionally, the enriched target cDNA were amplified through a general symmetry PCR and then was selectively isolated from the double strands PCR products by applying the silica coated superparamagnetic nanoparticles again. Finally, we detected the amplified target cDNA by employing the functionalized silica coated fluorescent nanoparticles as signaling probes with a sandwich hybridization format. The results show that the target cDNA can be assayed successfully with a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(3) copies and the nonspecific amplification could be inhibited. In addition, the detection procedure is rapid and can be completed in less than 6 h.

Microbial forensics has its origins in traditional forensics, microbiology, and epidemiology. Microbial forensics can be defined as a scientific discipline dedicated to analyzing evidence for attribution purposes from a bioterrorism act, biocrime, hoax, or inadvertent microorganism/toxin release. This is a very challenging task, since there are myriad microorganisms that can pose a threat, and analytical methods need to be used reliably. The Scientific Working Group on Microbial Genetics and Forensics (SWGMGF) has addressed some quality assurance and control issues, and particularly validation criteria (focusing on preliminary validation) due to the dynamic nature of evolving investigations. Unique identification of a microorganism may never be possible. Yet, qualitative and/or quantitative assessments of the evidence can be made. One approach to provide direction on gaps in the microbial forensics effort is to perform an end-to-end retrospective analysis of past cases. As an example, the case of a gastroenterologist who was accused of second degree attempted murder of his paramour using HIV as the weapon was reviewed. The scientific evaluation involves epidemiology, molecular biology, phylogenetics, and legal deliberations.","Budowle, Bruce; Harmon, Rockne",Croatian medical journal,528,24

Incidental COVID-19 in major trauma patients suggests higher than predicted rates of infection in London,22.537186,8.025882,2021,"Introduction Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) is a hyperinflammatory disorder seen in patients with history of COVID-19 infection. It is most commonly seen in children (MIS-C) and is rare in adults (MIS-A). We report a case of MIS-A with multiorgan failure in a previously healthy patient who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Case Presentation A 29-year-old Caucasian male with no medical history presented with fever to 103 degrees Fahrenheit, headache, syncope, and vomiting for 3 days. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 five weeks prior and recovered without complication. Patient was seen in the ED the previous day for fever and neck stiffness, at which time he had a negative repeat COVID-19 test and unremarkable lumbar puncture. Physical exam was normal. Labs revealed WBC 13.4, platelets 90, AST 92, ALT 120, total bilirubin 1.7, ferritin 1,033, CRP 312, and procalcitonin 1.35. Initial imaging revealed gallbladder sludge and inflammation of the mesentery and distal ileum with adenopathy. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, over the next 3 days, he developed an oxygen requirement up to 6 liters, tachycardia, increasing liver function tests, and acute kidney injury. Procalcitonin trended up to 16.03. Infectious workup was negative. CTA chest revealed right upper lobe pulmonary emboli, bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema. Pro-BNP was 24,554. Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction (EF) 45-50%, enlarged right ventricle, and small pericardial effusion. Patient was started on a heparin drip, without improvement. Diuresis was attempted but limited by hypotension. He was ultimately treated with dexamethasone, resulting in rapid improvement. Discussion The pathophysiology of MIS-A is poorly understood but is thought to be due to immune dysregulation. This may be a post-infectious process or could be due to persistent infection outside of the upper respiratory system, as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is known to affect other organs, such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system. MIS-A usually occurs 2-5 weeks after the patient has COVID-19. It disproportionately affects minority groups. Common presenting symptoms include fever, chest pain, dyspnea, myalgias, and gastrointestinal and dermatologic symptoms. Inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) are elevated. Severe dysfunction of at least one extrapulmonary organ system (e.g., cardiac dysfunction, hypotension, acute kidney or liver injury, thromboembolism) must be present. The mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids;intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor or inotrope support, and hemodialysis may also be required. The majority of patients with MIS-A survive. The long-term effects are unknown.","Homan, T. D.; Homan, C.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,528,18

Although he initially improved with systemic alteplase, he later developed a second large clot diagnosed in transit in the right atrium.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational questionnaire-based study to assess the satisfaction level of the students. The questionnaire had 25 items of which 23 were questions with responses on the Likert scale and two items on views and suggestions were open-ended. The online questionnaire was shared through various messaging/mailing platforms. Overall satisfaction was assessed, and a satisfaction index was calculated for each item. Data are presented in frequencies and percentages, and SPSS was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 1068 students participated in the study. The majority were from the age group 21–23 years (54%) and there was almost the same number of participants from both genders. The majority of the students were medical undergraduates (n=919), were in their second year (n=669), belonged to a government institution (n=897) and used a mobile phone for their online classes (n = 871). The majority of the students were dissatisfied (42%) with no significant difference between medical and nursing students (p = 0.192). First-year students were significantly dissatisfied compared with other senior students (p = 0.005). The maximum satisfaction index (78.23%) was observed with faculties being supportive and responsive in resolving the queries and the minimum (46.39%) was observed with issues related to communication and discussion with peer students. There were 662 responses as views which mostly contained negative comments regarding interaction and focus, practical learning, teaching content, and technological/infrastructural flaws. There was major dissatisfaction regarding the practical and clinical learning. CONCLUSION: Online learning is essential at current times but is not an effective alternative for medical and nursing education. Face-to-face classes and practical sessions along with online learning can be a viable option.","Dutta, Siddhartha; Ambwani, Sneha; Lal, Hina; Ram, Kishna; Mishra, Govind; Kumar, Tarun; Varthya, Shoban Babu",Adv Med Educ Pract,528,32

Several new platform technologies and traditional manufacturing approaches are being used to meet this demand. Among them, the mRNA vaccine platform technology holds great promise for obtaining an emergency use authorization to facilitate immunization against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19. However, this is a new technology, which means that there is significant uncertainty about possible production at a large scale and speed. Vaccines of mRNA work by providing our cells with the genetic code to make viral proteins. Once proteins that do not cause any disease are produced, the body triggers an immune response against the virus, allowing them to develop immunity. mRNA can be used to make any protein theoretically. Still, it is much easier to produce than the proteins themselves or the inactivated and attenuated versions of viruses commonly used in vaccines, which makes this technique attractive, says mRNA specialist Norbert Pardi, at the University of Pennsylvania.","Ghasemi, Shohreh; Dashti, Mahmood",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,528,12
