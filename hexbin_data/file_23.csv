23,23,23,"Comparisons of substitution, insertion and deletion probes for resequencing and mutational analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays",8.866302,5.7099266,2005-02-18,"Although oligonucleotide probes complementary to single nucleotide substitutions are commonly used in microarray-based screens for genetic variation, little is known about the hybridization properties of probes complementary to small insertions and deletions. It is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of disease-related genes. Here, we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions, and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene. Over 68 different dye-labeled single-stranded nucleic acid targets representing all ATM coding exons were applied to these microarrays. We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra- and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions. Overall, these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing and mutational analysis.","Karaman, Mazen W.; Groshen, Susan; Lee, Chi-Chiang; Pike, Brian L.; Hacia, Joseph G.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1
27,27,27,Torsional restraint: a new twist on frameshifting pseudoknots,9.036237,5.4853983,2005-03-30,"mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF). Though we previously presented a model for how mRNA pseudoknots might activate the mechanism for −1 PRF, it did not address the question of the role that they may play in positioning the mRNA relative to the ribosome in this process [E. P. Plant, K. L. M. Jacobs, J. W. Harger, A. Meskauskas, J. L. Jacobs, J. L. Baxter, A. N. Petrov and J. D. Dinman (2003) RNA, 9, 168–174]. A separate ‘torsional restraint’ model suggests that mRNA pseudoknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes directed to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery site positioned at the ribosome's A- and P-decoding sites [J. D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115–1127]. Here, experiments using a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’ having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model. The results of this study support the mechanistic hypothesis that −1 ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced by torsional resistance of the mRNA pseudoknot.","Plant, Ewan P.; Dinman, Jonathan D.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1
28,28,28,Correcting errors in synthetic DNA through consensus shuffling,8.945512,5.470581,2005-03-30,"Although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes, these suffer from the presence of 1–3 random errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population. The DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full-length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population. We show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) clones from ∼60 to >90% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5- to 4.3-fold to final values of ∼1 error per 3500 bp. In addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of GFPuv clones where all members were non-functional, to a population where 82% of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long DNA sequences.","Binkowski, Brock F.; Richmond, Kathryn E.; Kaysen, James; Sussman, Michael R.; Belshaw, Peter J.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1
38,38,38,Draft versus finished sequence data for DNA and protein diagnostic signature development,9.097534,5.4546437,2005-10-20,"Sequencing pathogen genomes is costly, demanding careful allocation of limited sequencing resources. We built a computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP) to guide decisions regarding the amount of genomic sequencing necessary to develop high-quality diagnostic DNA and protein signatures. SAP uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors or NNs) to sequence. We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that intermediate to high-quality draft with error rates of 10(−3)–10(−5) (∼8× coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of ∼1% (3× to 6× coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.","Gardner, Shea N.; Lam, Marisa W.; Smith, Jason R.; Torres, Clinton L.; Slezak, Tom R.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1
77,77,77,A novel endonuclease IV post-PCR genotyping system,8.948425,5.4952826,2006-09-29,"Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV) based assay utilizing a substrate that mimics the abasic lesions that normally occur in double-stranded DNA. The three component substrate is characterized by single-stranded DNA target, an oligonucleotide probe, separated from a helper oligonucleotide by a one base gap. The oligonucleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5′ end and fluorophore attached to the 3′ end through a special rigid linker. Fluorescence of the oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when not hybridized. Upon hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe and helper probe to their complementary target, the phosphodiester linkage between the rigid linker and the 3′ end of the probe is efficiently cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal. In this study, the use of the Endo IV assay as a post-PCR amplification detection system is demonstrated. High sensitivity and specificity are illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism detection.","Kutyavin, Igor V.; Milesi, Dave; Belousov, Yevgeniy; Podyminogin, Mikhail; Vorobiev, Alexei; Gorn, Vladimir; Lukhtanov, Eugeny A.; Vermeulen, Nicolaas M.

88,88,88,Positional clustering improves computational binding site detection and identifies novel cis-regulatory sites in mammalian GABA(A) receptor subunit genes,8.946272,5.6572375,2007-01-03,"Understanding transcription factor (TF) mediated control of gene expression remains a major challenge at the interface of computational and experimental biology. Computational techniques predicting TF-binding site specificity are frequently unreliable. On the other hand, comprehensive experimental validation is difficult and time consuming. We introduce a simple strategy that dramatically improves robustness and accuracy of computational binding site prediction. First, we evaluate the rate of recurrence of computational TFBS predictions by commonly used sampling procedures. We find that the vast majority of results are biologically meaningless. However clustering results based on nucleotide position improves predictive power. Additionally, we find that positional clustering increases robustness to long or imperfectly selected input sequences. Positional clustering can also be used as a mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling approaches for improvements in accuracy over each one alone. Finally, we predict and validate regulatory sequences partially responsible for transcriptional control of the mammalian type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) subunit genes. Positional clustering is useful for improving computational binding site predictions, with potential application to improving our understanding of mammalian gene expression. In particular, predicted regulatory mechanisms in the mammalian GABA(A)R subunit gene family may open new avenues of research towards understanding this pharmacologically important neurotransmitter receptor system.","Reddy, Timothy E.; Shakhnovich, Boris E.; Roberts, Daniel S.; Russek, Shelley J.; DeLisi, Charles",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

However, the factors driving recombination or promoting the selection of recombinants are still unclear. Here, we show that the small movement protein (2b) was able to promote selection of RNA 1/2–RNA 3 recombinants within a chimeric virus having RNAs 1 and 2 from cucumber mosaic virus, and RNA 3 from the related tomato aspermy virus, along with heterologous 2b genes. The source of the 2b also determined the selection of the acceptor RNA and the crossover site, as well as affecting the rate of selection of the recombinant RNAs. The nature of the RNA 3 also influenced the selection of the recombinant RNAs. A 163-nt tandem repeat in RNA 3 significantly affected the rate of selection of the recombinant RNA, while a single nucleotide within the repeat affected the crossover site. The recombination occurred in a non-random manner, involved no intermediates and probably was generated via a copy-choice mechanism during (+) strand RNA synthesis.","Shi, Bu-Jun; Symons, Robert H.; Palukaitis, Peter",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1
199,199,199,Unifying evolutionary and thermodynamic information for RNA folding of multiple alignments,8.959969,5.6915903,2008-10-04,"Computational methods for determining the secondary structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding, compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.","Seemann, Stefan E.; Gorodkin, Jan; Backofen, Rolf",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

It is more efficient and user-friendly than the previously published version in the 2004 web server issue of Nucleic Acids Research. The development of whole genome-based alignment-free CV method has provided an independent verification to the traditional phylogenetic analysis based on a single gene or a few genes. This new implementation attempts to meet the challenge of ever increasing amount of genome data and includes in its database more than 850 prokaryotic genomes which will be updated monthly from NCBI, and more than 80 fungal genomes collected manually from several sequencing centers. This new CVTree web server provides a faster and stable research platform. Users can upload their own sequences to find their phylogenetic position among genomes selected from the server's; inbuilt database. All sequence data used in a session may be downloaded as a compressed file. In addition to standard phylogenetic trees, users can also choose to output trees whose monophyletic branches are collapsed to various taxonomic levels. This feature is particularly useful for comparing phylogeny with taxonomy when dealing with thousands of genomes.","Xu, Zhao; Hao, Bailin",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1
296,296,296,ORMA: a tool for identification of species-specific variations in 16S rRNA gene and oligonucleotides design,8.95598,5.3079495,2009-06-16,"16S rRNA gene is one of the preferred targets for resolving species phylogenesis issues in microbiological-related contexts. However, the identification of single-nucleotide variations capable of distinguishing a sequence among a set of homologous ones can be problematic. Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences.","Severgnini, Marco; Cremonesi, Paola; Consolandi, Clarissa; Caredda, Giada; De Bellis, Gianluca; Castiglioni, Bianca",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

The MPP algorithm is scalable to larger target sets than other available software, and it does not require a multiple sequence alignment. We applied it to questions in viral detection, and demonstrated that there are no universally conserved priming sequences among viruses and that it could require an unfeasibly large number of primers (∼3700 18-mers or ∼2000 10-mers) to generate amplicons from all sequenced viruses. We then designed primer sets separately for each viral family, and for several diverse species such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of influenza A virus, Norwalk virus, and HIV-1.

While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different compositional and structural requirements, have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence- and 5′-triphosphate-dependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor-3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA. We also demonstrated that retinoic-acid-inducible gene I, and not melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 or toll-like receptor 3, is the cytoplasmic sensor for intracellularly expressed shRNAs that trigger IFN activation.","Kenworthy, Rachael; Lambert, Diana; Yang, Feng; Wang, Nan; Chen, Zihong; Zhu, Haizhen; Zhu, Fanxiu; Liu, Chen; Li, Kui; Tang, Hengli",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

466,466,466,A molecular clamp ensures allosteric coordination of peptidyltransfer and ligand binding to the ribosomal A-site,9.191786,5.45098,2010-07-21,"Although the ribosome is mainly comprised of rRNA and many of its critical functions occur through RNA–RNA interactions, distinct domains of ribosomal proteins also participate in switching the ribosome between different conformational/functional states. Prior studies demonstrated that two extended domains of ribosomal protein L3 form an allosteric switch between the pre- and post-translocational states. Missing was an explanation for how the movements of these domains are communicated among the ribosome's functional centers. Here, a third domain of L3 called the basic thumb, that protrudes roughly perpendicular from the W-finger and is nestled in the center of a cagelike structure formed by elements from three separate domains of the large subunit rRNA is investigated. Mutagenesis of basically charged amino acids of the basic thumb to alanines followed by detailed analyses suggests that it acts as a molecular clamp, playing a role in allosterically communicating the ribosome's tRNA occupancy status to the elongation factor binding region and the peptidyltransferase center, facilitating coordination of their functions through the elongation cycle. The observation that these mutations affected translational fidelity, virus propagation and cell growth demonstrates how small structural changes at the atomic scale can propagate outward to broadly impact the biology of cell.","Meskauskas, Arturas; Dinman, Jonathan D.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

Our aim was to define, through a mutational analysis, regions of HIV-1 IRES that are important for its activity. A dual-luciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle.","Gendron, Karine; Ferbeyre, Gerardo; Heveker, Nikolaus; Brakier-Gingras, Léa",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

However, the primary drawback of this approach is poor cell and in vivo oligonucleotide uptake efficacy. Biological activities can be significantly enhanced through the use of synthetically conjugated cationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs). Studies to date have focused on the delivery of a single SSO conjugated to a CPP, but here we describe the conjugation of two phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) SSOs to a single CPP for simultaneous delivery and pre-mRNA targeting of two separate genes, exon 23 of the Dmd gene and exon 5 of the Acvr2b gene, in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Conjugations of PMOs to a single CPP were carried out through an amide bond in one case and through a triazole linkage (‘click chemistry’) in the other. The most active bi-specific CPP–PMOs demonstrated comparable exon skipping levels for both pre-mRNA targets when compared to individual CPP–PMO conjugates both in cell culture and in vivo in the mdx mouse model. Thus, two SSOs with different target sequences conjugated to a single CPP are biologically effective and potentially suitable for future therapeutic exploitation.","Shabanpoor, Fazel; McClorey, Graham; Saleh, Amer F.; Järver, Peter; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Gait, Michael J.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

Earlier we showed that mutants unable to form the side chain at position 5 (ncm(5) or mcm(5)) or lacking sulphur at position 2 (s(2)) of U(34) result in pleiotropic phenotypes, which are all suppressed by overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs. This observation suggests that the observed phenotypes are due to inefficient reading of cognate codons or an increased frameshifting. The latter may be caused by a ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA*eEF1A*GTP) with a modification deficient tRNA inefficiently being accepted to the ribosomal A-site and thereby allowing an increased peptidyl-tRNA slippage and thus a frameshift error. In this study, we have investigated the role of wobble uridine modifications in reading frame maintenance, using either the Renilla/Firefly luciferase bicistronic reporter system or a modified Ty1 frameshifting site in a HIS4A::lacZ reporter system. We here show that the presence of mcm(5) and s(2) side groups at wobble uridines are important for reading frame maintenance and thus the aforementioned mutant phenotypes might partly be due to frameshift errors.","Tükenmez, Hasan; Xu, Hao; Esberg, Anders; Byström, Anders S.",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

2729,2729,2729,Coordination among tertiary base pairs results in an efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot,8.825424,5.584844,2017-06-02,"Frameshifting is an essential process that regulates protein synthesis in many viruses. The ribosome may slip backward when encountering a frameshift motif on the messenger RNA, which usually contains a pseudoknot structure involving tertiary base pair interactions. Due to the lack of detailed molecular explanations, previous studies investigating which features of the pseudoknot are important to stimulate frameshifting have presented diverse conclusions. Here we constructed a bimolecular pseudoknot to dissect the interior tertiary base pairs and used single-molecule approaches to assess the structure targeted by ribosomes. We found that the first ribosome target stem was resistant to unwinding when the neighboring loop was confined along the stem; such constrained conformation was dependent on the presence of consecutive adenosines in this loop. Mutations that disrupted the distal base triples abolished all remaining tertiary base pairs. Changes in frameshifting efficiency correlated with the stem unwinding resistance. Our results demonstrate that various tertiary base pairs are coordinated inside a highly efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot and suggest a mechanism by which mechanical resistance of the pseudoknot may persistently act on translocating ribosomes.","Chen, Yu-Ting; Chang, Kai-Chun; Hu, Hao-Teng; Chen, Yi-Lan; Lin, You-Hsin; Hsu, Chiung-Fang; Chang, Cheng-Fu; Chang, Kung-Yao; Wen, Jin-Der",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

Usb1 is an exoribonuclease that shortens the oligo-uridine tail of U6 snRNA, resulting in a terminal 2′,3′ cyclic phosphate group in most eukaryotes, including humans. Loss of function mutations in human Usb1 cause the rare disorder poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN), and result in U6 snRNAs with elongated 3′ ends that are aberrantly adenylated. Here, we show that human Usb1 removes 3′ adenosines with 20-fold greater efficiency than uridines, which explains the presence of adenylated U6 snRNAs in cells lacking Usb1. We determined three high-resolution co-crystal structures of Usb1: wild-type Usb1 bound to the substrate analog adenosine 5′-monophosphate, and an inactive mutant bound to RNAs with a 3′ terminal adenosine and uridine. These structures, along with QM/MM MD simulations of the catalytic mechanism, illuminate the molecular basis for preferential deadenylation of U6 snRNA. The extent of Usb1 processing is influenced by the secondary structure of U6 snRNA.","Nomura, Yuichiro; Roston, Daniel; Montemayor, Eric J; Cui, Qiang; Butcher, Samuel E",Nucleic Acids Res,23,1

Simulation is a cost- and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors: interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraph’s modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). METHODS: Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. RESULTS: We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions. Results show that a diminishing relative humidity of 10% produces an increment of about 1.6% in the final infection rate. The effect of temperature changes on the infection spread is also noticeable, with a decrease of 1.1% per extra degree.Conclusions: Using a tool like ours could help predict the shape of developing epidemics and its peaks, and would permit to quickly run scenarios to determine the evolution of the epidemic under different conditions. We make EpiGraph source code and epidemic data publicly available.","Singh, David E.; Marinescu, Maria-Cristina; Carretero, Jesus; Delgado-Sanz, Concepcion; Gomez-Barroso, Diana; Larrauri, Amparo",BMC Infect Dis,23,19

It is of critical importance to study PPV pathogenesis for the prevention and control of the disease. NS1, a PPV non-structural protein, is participated in viral DNA replication, transcriptional regulation, and cytotoxicity. Our previous research showed that PPV can activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and then up-regulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6. OBJECTIVES: Herein, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the non-structural protein NS1 of PPV also has the same function. METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, immunofluorescence assay and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that PPV NS1 protein can up-regulate the expression levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PPV NS1 protein was found to induce the phosphorylation of IκBα, then leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In addition, the NS1 protein activated the upstream pathways of NF-κB. Meanwhile, TLR2-siRNA assay showed TLR2 plays an important role in the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway induced by PPV-NS1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that PPV NS1 protein induced the up-regulated of IL-6 expression through activating the TLR2 and NF-κB signaling pathways. In conclusion, these findings provide a new avenue to study the innate immune mechanism of PPV infection.","Jin, Xiaohui; Yuan, Yixin; Zhang, Chi; Zhou, Yong; Song, Yue; Wei, Zhanyong; Zhang, Gaiping",J Vet Sci,23,1

The total microbial load per sample was calculated by measuring the mean percentage area of SYTO-9 positive staining. The cleaning efficacy was evaluated by comparing the total microbial coverage before and after cleaning. The cleaning performance between an UAS and a non UAS were compared and results have shown that an exposure of 60 s to an UAS demonstrated an 87.94 ± 2.22% removal of the bacterial contaminants, exceeding that of non UAS (21.85 ± 13.63% removal). UAS is capable of removing bacterial contaminants without the use of antimicrobial agents, therefore its cleaning mechanism can potentially prevent infection and reduce antimicrobial resistance. The cleaning mechanism of UAS can be adapted for the development of a new hay cleaning strategy for effective removal of bacterial contaminant to improve feed safety.","Chong, Weng Yee; Cox, Christian; Secker, Thomas J.; Keevil, Charles W.; Leighton, Timothy G.",Ultrason Sonochem,23,1

PTM was endorsed by Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Audiology leadership in 2009. Factors affecting implementation of PTM are unknown. We conducted a study to: 1) estimate levels of PTM program implementation in VA Audiology and Mental Health clinics across the country; and 2) identify barriers and facilitators to PTM implementation based on the experiences of VA audiologists and mental health providers. METHOD: We conducted an anonymous, web-based survey targeting Audiology and Mental Health leaders at 144 major VA facilities. Quantitative analyses summarized respondents’ facility characteristics and levels of program implementation (full PTM, partial PTM, or no PTM). Qualitative analyses identified themes in factors influencing the implementation of PTM across VA sites. RESULTS: Surveys from 87 audiologists and 66 mental health clinicians revealed that few facilities offered full PTM; the majority offered partial or no PTM. Inductive analysis of the open-ended survey responses identified seven factors influencing implementation of PTM: 1) available resources, 2) service collaboration, 3) prioritization, 4) Veterans’ preferences and needs, 5) clinician training, 6) awareness of (evidence-based) options, and 7) perceptions of scope of practice. CONCLUSION: Results suggest wide variation in services provided, a need for greater engagement of mental health providers in tinnitus care, and an interest among both audiologists and mental health providers in receiving tinnitus-related training. Future research should address barriers to PTM implementation, including methods to: 1) improve understanding among mental health providers of their potential role in tinnitus management; 2) enhance coordination of tinnitus-related care between health care disciplines; and 3) collect empirical data on Veterans’ need for and interest in PTM, including delivery by telehealth modalities.","Zaugg, Tara L.; Thielman, Emily J.; Carlson, Kathleen F.; Tuepker, Anaïs; Elnitsky, Christine; Drummond, Karen L.; Schmidt, Caroline J.; Newell, Summer; Kaelin, Christine; Choma, Christie; Henry, James A.",PLoS One,23,1

Acute anal fissure can be cured by surgery or medical treatment. There is an increase in the use of topical therapy for the treatment of anal fissures. A common topical drug used is Diltiazem (DTZ), a calcium-channel blocker, which relaxes the anal sphincter and thus promotes healing of the anal fissure. Moist exposed burn ointment (MEBO) is an ointment that is effective for the treatment of burns and wound healing and is becoming popular in the treatment of anal fissures. METHODS: This is a 1:1:1 randomized, controlled, parallel design, with endpoint measures of change in pain score, wound healing, defecation strain score and patient’s global impression of improvement. The study will be conducted at AUBMC over a 10-week period. Patients will be randomized to three treatment arms: MEBO, Diltiazem, and a combination of MEBO and Diltiazem ointments. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will allow physicians to assess the efficacy and safety of MEBO in the treatment of acute anal fissure, and also in comparison to Diltiazem.

Digital notch filters (DNFs) have been widely used to remove the PLI such that actual features, which are weak in energy and strongly connected to brain states, can be extracted explicitly. However, DNFs are mathematically implemented via discrete Fourier analysis, the problem of overlapping between spectral counterparts of PLI and those of EEG features is inevitable. In spite of their effectiveness, DNFs usually cause distortions on the extracted EEG features, which may lead to incorrect diagnostic results. To address this problem, we investigate an adaptive sparse detector for reducing PLI. This novel approach is proposed based on sparse representation inspired by self-adaptive machine learning. In the coding phase, an overcomplete dictionary, which consists of redundant harmonic waves with equally spaced frequencies, is employed to represent the corrupted EEG signal. A strategy based on the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm is employed to optimize the associated representation coefficients. It is verified that spectral components related to PLI are compressed into a narrow area in the frequency domain, thus reducing overlapping with features of interest. In the decoding phase, eliminating of coefficients within the narrow band area can remove the PLI from the reconstructed signal. The sparsity of the signal in the dictionary domain is determined by the redundancy factor. A selection criteria of the redundancy factor is suggested via numerical simulations. Experiments have shown the proposed approach can ensure less distortions on actual EEG features.","Chen, Bin-qiang; Zheng, Bai-xun; Wang, Chu-qiao; Sun, Wei-fang",Front Public Health,23,1

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We derived and validated a case-ascertainment model to identify OSA using linked provincial health administrative and clinical data from all consecutive adults who underwent a diagnostic sleep study (index date) at two large academic centers (Ontario, Canada) from 2007 to 2017. The presence of moderate/severe OSA (an apnea–hypopnea index≥15) was defined using clinical data. Of 39 candidate health administrative variables considered, 32 were tested. We used classification and regression tree (CART) methods to identify the most parsimonious models via cost-complexity pruning. Identified variables were also used to create parsimonious logistic regression models. All individuals with an estimated probability of 0.5 or greater using the predictive models were classified as having OSA. RESULTS: The case-ascertainment models were derived and validated internally through bootstrapping on 5099 individuals from one center (33% moderate/severe OSA) and validated externally on 13,486 adults from the other (45% moderate/severe OSA). On the external cohort, parsimonious models demonstrated c-statistics of 0.75–0.81, sensitivities of 59–60%, specificities of 87–88%, positive predictive values of 79%, negative predictive values of 73%, positive likelihood ratios (+LRs) of 4.5–5.0 and –LRs of 0.5. Logistic models performed better than CART models (mean integrated calibration indices of 0.02–0.03 and 0.06–0.12, respectively). The best model included: sex, age, and hypertension at the index date, as well as an outpatient specialty physician visit for OSA, a repeated sleep study, and a positive airway pressure treatment claim within 1 year since the index date. INTERPRETATION: Among adults who underwent a sleep study, case-ascertainment models for identifying moderate/severe OSA using health administrative data had relatively low sensitivity but high specificity and good discriminative ability. These findings could help study trends and outcomes of OSA individuals using routinely collected health care data.","Kendzerska, Tetyana; van Walraven, Carl; McIsaac, Daniel I; Povitz, Marcus; Mulpuru, Sunita; Lima, Isac; Talarico, Robert; Aaron, Shawn D; Reisman, William; Gershon, Andrea S",Clin Epidemiol,23,1

After each in-custody death, ICE produces detainee death reviews, which describe the circumstances of the death and determine whether ICE Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) were violated. OBJECTIVE: To describe factors associated with deaths in ICE detention facilities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series used data extracted from detainee death reviews of deaths among individuals detained in ICE facilities for whom these reviews were available from January 2011 to December 2018. EXPOSURES: All individuals were in the custody of ICE at the time of death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data including demographic information, medical histories, recorded medical data, and reported violations of PBNDS were systematically extracted and summarized. RESULTS: Among 71 individuals who died in an ICE detention facility during the study period, detainee death reviews were available for 55 (77.5%). Most were male (47 [85.5%]), and the mean (SD) age at death was 42.7 (11.5) years. Individuals resided in the US for a mean (SD) of 15.8 (13.2) years before detention and were in ICE custody for a median of 39 days (interquartile range, 9-76 days) before death. Most had low burdens of preexisting disease, with 18 (32.7%) having a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 0 and 15 (27.3%) having a score of 1 or 2. A total of 47 deaths (85.5%) were attributed to medical causes and 8 (14.5%) to suicide. Markedly abnormal vital signs were documented in the death reviews before 29 of 47 deaths from medical causes (61.7%), and 21 of these 29 deaths (72.4%) were preceded by abnormal vital signs during 2 or more encounters with ICE personnel before death or terminal hospital transfer. Overall, 43 detainee death reviews (78.2%) identified PBNDS violations related to medical care, with a mean (SD) of 3.2 (3.0) deficiencies per detainee death review. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case series, deaths in ICE detention facilities from 2011 to 2018 occurred primarily among young men with low burdens of preexisting disease. Markedly abnormal vital signs preceded death or hospital transfer for most nonsuicide deaths. The PBNDS were violated in most detainee death reviews. These results suggest that additional oversight and external evaluation of practices related to medical and psychiatric care within ICE facilities are needed.","Grassini, Molly; Terp, Sophie; Fischer, Briah; Ahmed, Sameer; Ross, Madeline; Frenzen, Niels; Burner, Elizabeth; Parmar, Parveen",JAMA Netw Open,23,1

Clinical evidence regarding the use of tigecycline in the treatment of S. maltophilia infections is scarce. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of tigecycline treating ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to S. maltophilia in comparison with fluoroquinolones. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between January 2017 and December 2020 with the diagnosis of VAP caused by S. maltophilia receiving either tigecycline or fluoroquinolones as the definitive therapy ≥ 48 h. Clinical outcomes including 28-day mortality, clinical cure and microbiological cure were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 82 patients with S. maltophilia VAP included, 46 received tigecycline, and 36 received fluoroquinolones; 70.7% of patients had polymicrobial pneumonia, and the appropriate empiric therapy was applied to only 14.6% of patients. The overall 28-day mortality was 39%. Compared with patients receiving fluoroquinolones, tigecycline therapy resulted in worse clinical cure (32.6% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.009) and microbiological cure (28.6% vs. 59.1%, p = 0.045), while there was no statistical difference between 28-day mortality (47.8% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.105) in the two groups. Similar results were also shown in the inverse probability of treatment weighted univariable regression model and multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The standard dose of tigecycline therapy was associated with a lower clinical and microbiological cure rate but not associated with an increased 28-day mortality in patients with S. maltophilia VAP compared with fluoroquinolones.

In this paper, we study how evolution mechanisms traditionally observed within social networks can affect information diffusion. We present an approach that merges two models: model of information diffusion through social networks and model of network evolution. Since epidemics provide a reference in application domains of information spreading, we measure the impact of basic network structure changes on epidemic peak value and timing. Then we investigate observed trends in terms of changes appearing in the network structure. Our results provide promising results on how and why network dynamics is a strong parameter to integrate in requirements for information spreading modelling.","Stattner, Erick; Collard, Martine; Vidot, Nicolas","Information Systems, E-learning, and Knowledge Management Research",23,7

This problem has been exacerbated in recent years by the move from desktop to mobile technologies which has rendered prior software platforms less accessible to general users. This paper explores a web-enabled 3D rendering architecture that enables real-time fingerspelling on a human avatar that can address these issues. In addition it is capable of producing more realistic motion than prior efforts that were video-based and provides greater interactivity and customization that will support further enhancements to self-practice tools for fingerspelling reception.,"Montgomery, Jami; McDonald, John; Gong, Eric; Baowidan, Souad; Wolfe, Rosalee",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,23,0

The purpose of this study was to describe the baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a major hotspot in the U.S. Southeast. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective chart review included adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, defined by laboratory-detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, in Southwest Georgia. The primary outcome was mortality, which was assessed through discharge or June 14, 2020, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes included comorbidities, laboratory and radiographic findings, as well as clinical course. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included with a median age of 61 years (IQR 50–72). The majority were African American (73%) and female (56%). Comorbidities on admission were present in 88% of patients; most prevalent were hypertension (76%), diabetes mellitus (55%), and chronic pulmonary disease (27%). Median Charlson comorbidity index was 4 (IQR 2–6) and BMI was 32.8 kg/m(2) (IQR 26.2–39.5). On presentation, patients most often complained of dyspnea (69%), fever (63%), and cough (53%), with a median SOFA score of 2 (IQR 2–4). Most patients were admitted to the general ward (71%), of which 17% were subsequently transferred to ICU. During hospitalization, 27% were mechanically ventilated for a median 11 days (IQR 5–13.5), 18% developed ARDS, and 43% developed AKI. Median length of stay was 9.5 days (IQR 3.75–14). Overall mortality was 20%, which was significantly higher among patients with comorbidities (p = 0.047), as well as those who developed ARDS (p < 0.001) or AKI (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Most reports of COVID-19 have focused on large urban settings. However, early during the pandemic, we identified a large cluster of cases with a high-case fatality rate in a semirural setting in Southwest Georgia in the U.S. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","Chastain, Daniel B; Osae, Sharmon P; Burt, Ashley M; VanLandingham, Kevin; Sibold, Natalie; Henao-Martinez, Andres; Franco-Paredes, Carlos; Young, Henry N",Open Forum Infect Dis,23,0

METHODS: Continuous pressure NIV was applied to 20 subjects using Total Face, Nasal, and Face masks for 10 min each. Tidal volume (VT) and respiratory period (RP) were estimated from respiratory inductance plethysmography. Electrodermal activity was estimated from conductance signals. Heart rate variability was measured using the time-domain indices SDNN and RMSSD, and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitude (RSAp). Parameters were referenced to 5-min rest periods at beginning and end of protocol. A Likert-like scale of subjective discomfort with the masks and the ventilation was applied after 1, 5, and 9 min using each mask. RESULTS: RP and VT increased with the three mask models. Whereas the mean heart rate and RSAp did not change, both SDNN and RMSSD increased during NIV with Nasal and Face masks. Spontaneous electrodermal activity fluctuations were less frequent during NIV than at rest, with significant differences for Total Face and Nasal masks. Discomfort with all masks increased from minutes 1 to 9, markedly in the Total Face mask, considered most uncomfortable by 11 subjects. CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, the three masks resulted in similar respiratory responses to NIV. Correspondence between changes in physiological parameters and discomfort with NIV interface could not be detected, whereas self-report with the Likert-like scale identified progressive discomfort and the Total Face mask as the most uncomfortable interface.

The analysis was carried out with a new method based on the combined use of a 3 Way Decisions model and graph theory. Specifically, the data about infected people in the Italian regions is assessed by means of an evaluation function which allows the tri-partitioning of Italy and the identification of high, medium or low critical regions. The tri-partition is performed, along the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 diffusion, by calculating two threshold values which take into account the containment actions that, from time to time, the decision makers have implemented. The effects of a containment action are related to a reduction in the centrality value of a region. To estimate the effect of containment actions, we evaluated two approaches. The first is based on a uniform reduction in the centrality values of the regions, the second estimates the effects of containment actions starting from the mobility changes data provided by the Google Community Mobility reports. The results of our evaluation based on real data of the COVID-19 diffusion in Italy are encouraging and represent a good starting point for future extensions of the method.","Gaeta, Angelo; Loia, Vincenzo; Orciuoli, Francesco",Appl Intell,23,0

Targeting the pro-metastatic immune cell in the ccRCC microenvironment could provide a solution to this problem. In this study, B cells in ccRCC biopsies were identified by using scRNA-seq and flow cytometry. The findings indicated the presence of a pro-metastatic B cell type which could be further classified into 3 subpopulations, MARCH3, B2M and DTWD1, based on their large-scaled genetic profiles, rather than traditional Immature/Mature ones. Although all of the 3 subpopulations appeared to contribute to distant metastasis, B cell (B2M) was deemed to be the most essential. Moreover, STX16, CLASRP, ATIC, ACIN1 and SEMA4B, were genes found to be commonly up-regulated in the 3 subpopulations and this was correlated to a poor prognosis of ccRCC. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of plasma cells in ccRCC was also found to contribute to metastasis of the disease. This study offers potential novel therapeutic targets against distant metastasis of cancers, and can help to improve the therapeutic efficiency of ccRCC patients.","Yang, Fafen; Zhao, Jingjie; Luo, Xiuzhuang; Li, Tong; Wang, Zechen; Wei, Qiuju; Lu, Heming; Meng, Yiliang; Cai, Kai; Lu, Liuying; Lu, Yushi; Chen, Lifen; Sooranna, Suren Rao; Luo, Linxue; Song, Jian; Meng, Lingzhang",Front Oncol,23,1

This fact, in addition to the high mortality rate in the working age, became the main reasons for the reduction in the number of labor resources. Under these conditions, one possible approach to the problem of labor resources is the use of the labor of pensioners.

METHODS Prospective study comparing three different pulse oximeters: Masimo Radical-7 compared simultaneously with Ohmeda Biox 3700 or with Nellcor N395, in newborn infants who required resuscitation. Members of the research team placed the sensors for each of the pulse oximeters being compared simultaneously, one sensor on each foot of the same baby. Care provided routinely, without interference by the research team. The time elapsed until a reliable SpO2 was obtained was recorded using a digital chronometer. Statistical comparisons included chi-square and student's T-test. RESULTS Thirty-two infants were enrolled; median gestational age 32 weeks. Seventeen paired measurements were made with the Radical-7 and Biox 3700; mean time to a stable reading was 20.2±7 sec for the Radical-7 and 74.2±12 sec for the Biox 3700 (p=0.02). The Radical-7 and the N- 395 were paired on 15 infants; the times to obtain a stable reading were 20.9±4 sec and 67.3±12 sec, respectively (p=0.03). CONCLUSION The time to a reliable reading obtained simultaneously in neonatal critical situations differs by the type of the pulse oximeter used, being significantly faster with Masimo Signal Extraction Technology. This may permit for better adjustments of inspired oxygen, aiding in the prevention of damage caused by unnecessary exposure to high or low oxygen.","Baquero, Hernando; Alviz, Ramiro; Castillo, Armando; Neira, Fredy; Sola, Augusto",Acta paediatrica,23,16

It has a good water solubility and the detection limit was determined to be 6.92 ppb in 100% aqueous solution. In particular, Hcy-DCV exhibited good selectivity towards malononitrile over other interfering substances including hydrazine and other active methylene compounds. The probe was applied successfully to quantitate malononitrile in pure water with satisfying recovery and relative standard deviation. Additionally, the ability of visualizing malononitrile by using probe-coated strip papers was displayed, which may facilitate the on-site detection of malononitrile. Moreover, the bioimaging of malononitrile in living H1975 cells and zebrafish larvae was also demonstrated.

However, adherence is improved when discharge instructions are provided in Spanish. This study was designed to assess the frequency of providing written discharge instructions in Spanish to patients who speak Spanish and request interpretation services, and to determine factors associated with receiving written discharge instructions in the preferred language in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all discharges of Spanish-speaking patients who requested an interpreter in 1 year from a large urban pediatric ED and an associated community ED. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify patient and visit level characteristics associated with receiving written discharge instructions in Spanish. RESULTS Sixty-one percent of 11,545 patient encounters where a Spanish interpreter was requested received written discharge instructions in Spanish. Patients aged 1 to 3 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.18-3.77) and aged 4 to 12 years (aOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.6-2.65), those seen without a trainee (aOR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.25-1.5), and those with low acuity triage levels (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.29-1.97) were more likely to receive discharge instruction in Spanish. Female patients were less likely to receive Spanish discharge instructions (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97). CONCLUSIONS Discharged pediatric ED patients often do not receive written instructions in the preferred language. Patient and provider factors are associated with receiving written instructions in Spanish.

METHODS CC chief executives at all NCI-CCs and a random sample of non-NCI-CCs were surveyed from April to August 2018. Twelve questions examined the executives' attitudes towards palliative care integration, perceived barriers and self-assessments. The primary outcome was agreement on the statement 'a stronger integration of palliative care services into oncology practice will benefit patients at my institution.' Survey findings from 2018 were compared with data from 2009 to examine changes in attitudes. RESULTS 52 of 77 (68%) NCI-CCs and 88 of 126 (70%) non-NCI-CCs responded to the survey. A vast majority of executives at NCI-CCs and non-NCI-CCs endorsed palliative care integration (89.7% vs 90.0%; p>0.999). NCI-CCs were more likely to endorse increasing funding for palliative care (52.5% vs 23.1%; p=0.01) and hiring physician specialists (70.0% vs 37.5%; p=0.004) than non-NCI-CCs. The top three perceived barriers among NCI-CCs and non-NCI-CCs were limited institutional budgets (57.9% vs 59.0%; p=0.92), poor reimbursements (55.3% vs 43.6%; p=0.31), and lack of adequately trained palliative care physicians and nurses (52.6% vs 43.6%; p=0.43). Both NCI-CCs and non-NCI-CCs favourably rated their palliative care services (89.7% vs 71.8%; p=0.04) with no major changes since 2009. CONCLUSION CC executives endorse integration of palliative care, with greater willingness to invest in palliative care among NCI-CCs. Resource limitation continues to be a major barrier.","Chen, Joseph; de la Rosa, Allison; Lai, Dejian; Dev, Rony; Revere, Frances Lee; Lairson, David; Wermuth, Paige; Bruera, Eduardo; Hui, David",BMJ supportive & palliative care,23,1

Dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells, as newly discovered T-helper cells, have the functions of Th2 and Th17 cells and can coproduce Th2 and Th17 cytokines. Previous studies have shown that dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells increase the chances of asthma and correlate with asthma severity. However, the exact role of dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells in asthma is not known. Since there is no mature differentiation method for dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells, the present study aimed to clarify the strict differentiation conditions and reveal how dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells regulate asthma phenotypes. In this study, we confirmed that IL-1β, IL-6, anti-IFN-γ, and IL-21 promoted biphenotypic cell differentiation. Moreover, more proportion of dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells can be obtained by conditioned differentiation of mouse CD4+ T cells after classical allergic asthma modeling. Before asthma modeling, adoptive dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells promoted T cells to differentiate into the same biphenotype cells and exacerbated the severity of asthma. Together, our results clarify the differentiation conditions of dual-positive Th2-Th17 cells and further confirm that it stimulates asthma T cells to differentiate into the same biphenotype cells, leading to exacerbation of asthma.","Sun, Wenjin; Yuan, Yu; Qiu, Lulu; Zeng, Qingping; Jia, Jingsi; Xiang, Xudong; Jia, Aijun; Ma, Libing; Liu, Shaokun; Xiao, Bing",Canadian respiratory journal,23,17

In MR-RFA scanner-induced RF heating is channeled to the ablation site via a Larmor frequency RF pickup device and needle system, and controlled via the pulse sequence. MR-RFA was evaluated with simulation of electric and magnetic fields to predict the increase in local specific-absorption-rate (SAR). Temperature-time profiles were measured for different configurations of the device in agar phantoms and ex vivo bovine liver in a 1.5 T scanner. Temperature rise in MR-RFA was imaged using the proton resonance frequency method validated with fiber-optic thermometry. MR-RFA was performed on the livers of two healthy live pigs. Simulations indicated a near tenfold increase in SAR at the RFA needle tip. Temperature-time profiles depended significantly on the physical parameters of the device although both configurations tested yielded temperature increases sufficient for ablation. Resected livers from live ablations exhibited clear thermal lesions. MR-RFA holds potential for integrating RF ablation tumor therapy with MRI scanning. MR-RFA may add value to MRI with the addition of a potentially disposable ablation device, while retaining MRI's ability to provide real time procedure guidance and measurement of tissue temperature, perfusion, and coagulation.","Hue, Yik-Kiong; Guimaraes, Alexander R; Cohen, Ouri; Nevo, Erez; Roth, Abraham; Ackerman, Jerome L",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,23,4

However, it remains unclear whether mucinous tumors directly affect local recurrence or not, and if so, the mechanism is not known. Therefore, we investigated whether mucinous tumors are associated with locoregional recurrence after pulmonary resection and whether mucus extension is a risk factor for locoregional recurrence. METHODS The data of 152 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for metastases were reviewed. When mucus was partially or wholly present in the tumor based on macro- or microscopic identification, we assigned the tumor as mucinous. In mucinous tumors, when mucus was identified within the air spaces in the normal lung parenchyma, beyond the edge of the tumor, we assigned the tumor as positive for ""mucus extension."" RESULTS The 5-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence in patients with mucinous tumors was 48.1%, which was significantly higher than that observed in those with non-mucinous tumors (14.9%). Within the mucinous tumor, the presence of mucus extension beyond the tumor edge was an independent risk factor for locoregional recurrence after pulmonary resection (hazard ratio, 5.52; P = 0.019).

Based on the documented benefits, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended PrEP as a prevention method for high-risk groups. Moreover, for those HIV-infected individuals, antiretroviral therapy has been shown to serve as both as a treatment and prevention method for HIV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This systematic review protocol was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Analyses (PRISMA) P framework. Medline (1980-present), Embase (1980-present), CINAHL (1980-present), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and clinicaltrials.gov will be used to identify relevant articles based on a piloted search strategy. Peer-reviewed observational and experimental studies will be included. A narrative style will be used to describe descriptive data. A meta-analysis will be conducted if heterogeneity is not significant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Recent evidence suggests that there is an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among high-risk persons that use PrEP. Furthermore, there is a paucity of data on the relationship of treatment as prevention and incidence of STIs. The findings of this review will assess this emerging public health phenomenon and serve to inform future public health policy. No formal ethical review is required for this protocol.

OBJECTIVE To investigate if P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values are associated with hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications after treatment with the PED and to find an optimal range of preprocedural PRU values. METHODS Two hundred thirty-one patients with 248 cerebral aneurysms treated with the PED were retrospectively identified. Patients were started on dual-antiplatelet treatment at least 10 days before the intervention. PRU values were checked. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Youden Indices were calculated to determine cutoffs for optimal PRU values. RESULTS Mean patient age was 57 years. Mean last preprocedural PRU was 132 (range: 1-382). The combined rate of major hemorrhagic complications (4%) and major thromboembolic complications (5.6%) was 9.6%. Analysis using Youden indices suggested an optimal PRU range of 70 to 150 with higher odds of complications outside this range (P = .01, odds ratio [OR] = 3 [1.2-7.5]). PRU <60 was a significant predictor of hemorrhagic complications (P = .04, OR = 2.45 [1.01-5.9]) and PRU >240 was a significant predictor of any thromboembolic complication (P = .04, OR = 3.6 [1.04-12]) and cerebral thromboembolic complications (P = .02, OR = 4 [1.2-14]). CONCLUSION Target preoperative PRU values should be between 60 and 240 and ideally between 70 and 150. Values below this range and above it carry higher odds of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, respectively.","Daou, Badih; Starke, Robert M; Chalouhi, Nohra; Barros, Guilherme; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Neurosurgery,23,16

We examined Canadians' online relative search interest in five common solid tumors (breast, colon, lung, prostate, and thyroid) during the COVID-19 pandemic to that observed in the same months in the prior 5 years. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study using Google Trends aggregate anonymous online search data from Canada. We compared the respective relative search volumes for breast, colon, lung, prostate, and thyroid cancers for the months March-November 2020 with the mean for the same months in 2015-2019. Welch's two-sample t tests were performed and the raw P values were then adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple comparisons. The level of statistical significance was defined by choosing false discovery rate at .05 for the primary analysis. RESULTS We observed temporary statistically significant reductions in Canadians' relative search volumes for various cancers, largely early in the pandemic, in the spring of 2020. Specifically, significant reductions (after adjustment for multiple comparisons) were observed for breast cancer in April, May, and October 2020; colon cancer in March and April of 2020; lung cancer in April and September 2020; and prostate cancer in April and May 2020. Thyroid cancer relative search volumes were not significantly different from those observed prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSION Although Canadians' online interest in various cancers temporarily waned early in the COVID-19 pandemic, recent relative search volumes for various cancers are largely not significantly different from prior to the pandemic.","Xu, Ruoyong; Brown, Patrick; Baxter, Nancy; Sawka, Anna M",JCO clinical cancer informatics,23,8

Aerobic exercise is widely recommended to improve glycaemic control, yet its acute effect on glycaemia and glucoregulatory hormones has not been systematically reviewed and analysed in healthy adults. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a single bout of continuous aerobic exercise on circulating glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations in healthy adults. METHODS CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, HMIC, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 2020. Papers were included if they reported a randomised, crossover study measuring glucose and/or insulin and/or glucagon concentrations before and immediately after a single bout of continuous aerobic exercise (≥ 30 min) compared to a time-matched, resting control arm in healthy adults. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE approach, respectively. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for glucose, insulin, and glucagon. Sub-group meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed for categorical (metabolic state [postprandial or fasted], exercise mode [cycle ergometer or treadmill]) and continuous (age, body mass index, % males, maximal aerobic capacity, exercise duration, exercise intensity) covariates, respectively. RESULTS 42 papers (51 studies) were considered eligible: glucose (45 studies, 391 participants), insulin (38 studies, 377 participants) and glucagon (5 studies, 47 participants). Acute aerobic exercise had no significant effect on glucose concentrations (mean difference: - 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI, - 0.22 to 0.13 mmol/L; P = 0.589; I2: 91.08%, large heterogeneity; moderate-quality evidence). Acute aerobic exercise significantly decreased insulin concentrations (mean difference: - 18.07 pmol/L; 95% CI, - 30.47 to - 5.66 pmol/L; P = 0.004; I2: 95.39%, large heterogeneity; moderate-quality evidence) and significantly increased glucagon concentrations (mean difference: 24.60 ng/L; 95% CI, 16.25 to 32.95 ng/L; P < 0.001; I2: 79.36%, large heterogeneity; moderate-quality evidence). Sub-group meta-analyses identified that metabolic state modified glucose and insulin responses, in which aerobic exercise significantly decreased glucose (mean difference: - 0.27 mmol/L; 95% CI, - 0.55 to - 0.00 mmol/L; P = 0.049; I2: 89.72%, large heterogeneity) and insulin (mean difference: - 42.63 pmol/L; 95% CI, - 66.18 to - 19.09 pmol/L; P < 0.001; I2: 81.29%, large heterogeneity) concentrations in the postprandial but not fasted state. Meta-regression revealed that the glucose concentrations were also moderated by exercise duration and maximal aerobic capacity. CONCLUSIONS Acute aerobic exercise performed in the postprandial state decreases glucose and insulin concentrations in healthy adults. Acute aerobic exercise also increases glucagon concentrations irrespective of metabolic state. Therefore, aerobic exercise undertaken in the postprandial state is an effective strategy to improve acute glycaemic control in healthy adults, supporting the role of aerobic exercise in reducing cardiometabolic disease incidence.

RECENT FINDINGS When the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved robot-assisted device, the daVinci surgical system, was approved for use in gynecology in April 2005, many procedures were translated to a robotic approach. In the field of urogynecology, much attention was given to the use of robotic assistance for sacrocolpopexy. In oncology, there was an attraction to the use of robotics for radical hysterectomies. There are a number of published observational studies comparing the outcomes of both robot-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (RALS) and robot-assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH) to their conventional laparoscopic and open versions. Overall, the literature suggests that the use of robotics for these procedures increases operative time and cost, but decreases estimated blood loss and length of stay. The complication rates appear to be similar. Recurrence of apical prolapse after RALS appears to be similar to that in conventional laparoscopic or open sacrocolpopexy. The number of lymph nodes harvested is the same or increases with RRH, whereas the disease-free progression and overall survival are similar for all the methods of radical hysterectomy. SUMMARY Literature suggests that RALS and RRH have equivalent outcomes when compared to conventional laparoscopic and open techniques. The question is whether the use of robotics that combines the outcomes of an open procedure, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, and easy adoptability will outweigh the increased cost and time associated with robotic surgery.","Swan, Kimberly; Advincula, Arnold P",Current opinion in urology,23,5

It is a promising prostate cancer treatment due to sparing of the tissues associated with morbidity risk from conventional therapies. IRE effects depend on electric field strength and tissue properties. These characteristics are organ-dependent, affecting IRE treatment outcomes. This study characterizes the relevant properties to improve treatment planning and outcome predictions for IRE prostate cancer treatment. METHODS Clinically relevant IRE pulse protocols were delivered to a healthy canine and two human cancerous prostates while measuring electrical parameters to determine tissue characteristics for predictive treatment simulations. Prostates were resected 5 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks post-IRE. Lesions were correlated with numerical simulations to determine an effective prostate lethal IRE electric field threshold. RESULTS Lesions were produced in all subjects. Tissue electrical conductivity increased from 0.284 to 0.927 S/m due to IRE pulses. Numerical simulations show an average effective prostate electric field threshold of 1072 ± 119 V/cm, significantly higher than previously characterized tissues. Histological findings in the human cases show instances of complete tissue necrosis centrally with variable tissue effects beyond the margin. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary experimental IRE trials safely ablated healthy canine and cancerous human prostates, as examined in the short- and medium-term. IRE-relevant prostate properties are now experimentally and numerically defined. Importantly, the electric field required to kill healthy prostate tissue is substantially higher than previously characterized tissues. These findings can be applied to optimize IRE prostate cancer treatment protocols.","Neal, Robert E; Millar, Jeremy L; Kavnoudias, Helen; Royce, Peter; Rosenfeldt, Franklin; Pham, Alan; Smith, Ryan; Davalos, Rafael V; Thomson, Kenneth R",The Prostate,23,13

The main objective of our study was to determine the incidence of airway complications related to continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions. METHODS In consecutive adult patients with continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions, we prospectively recorded clinical airway complications during the period after extubation. A multidetector computed tomography of the neck was performed during the period of 5 days following extubation to classify subglottic and tracheal lesions as mucosal thickening, cartilage thickening or deep ulceration. RESULTS In the 86 patients included in the study, 6 (6.9%) had transient dyspnea, 7 (8.1%) had upper airway obstruction and 18 (20.9%) had dysphonia at extubation. Univariate analysis identified more attempts required for intubation (2.3 ± 1.1 vs. 1.2 ± 0.5; p = 0.001), difficult intubation (71.4 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001) and Cormack score III-IV (71.4 vs. 8.8%; p < 0.001) as risk factors for having an upper airway obstruction at extubation. The incidence of failed extubation among patients after planned extubation was 18.9% and 11 patients (12.7%) required tracheostomy. A multidetector computed tomography was performed in 37 patients following extubation, and injuries were observed in 9 patients (24.3%) and classified as tracheal injuries in 2 patients (1 cartilage thickening and 1 mild stenosis with cartilage thickening) and as subglottic mucosal thickenings in 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of upper airway obstruction after extubation in patients with continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions was 8.1%, and the injuries observed by computed tomography were not severe and located mostly in subglottic space.","Vallés, Jordi; Millán, Susana; Díaz, Emili; Castanyer, Eva; Gallardo, Xavier; Martín-Loeches, Ignacio; Andreu, Marta; Prenafeta, Mario; Saludes, Paula; Lema, Jorge; Batlle, Montse; Bacelar, Néstor; Artigas, Antoni",Annals of intensive care,23,31

Our knowledge regarding the generation and/or maintenance of immunity by parenchymal or circulating T cells has been gathered from either persistent (>60 d) or rapidly cleared (<10 d) infections. However, the roles of these distinct T cell pools in infections that are cleared over the course of several weeks are not understood. Clearance of the highly virulent intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis (Ftt) following pulmonary infection of immune animals is a protracted T cell-dependent process requiring ∼30-40 d and serves as a model for infections that are not acutely controlled. Using this model, we found that intranasal vaccination increased the number of tissue-resident CD4+ effector T cells, and subsequent challenge of immune mice with Ftt led to a significant expansion of polyfunctional parenchymal CD4+ effector T cells compared with the circulating pool. Despite the dominant in vivo response by parenchymal CD4+ T cells after vaccination and challenge, circulating CD4+ T cells were superior at controlling intracellular Ftt replication in vitro. Further examination in vivo revealed temporal requirements for resident and circulating T cells during Ftt infection. These requirements were in direct contrast to other pulmonary infections that are cleared rapidly in immune animals. The data in this study provide important insights into the role of specific T cell populations that will be essential for the design of novel effective vaccines against tularemia and potentially other agents of pulmonary infection.","Roberts, Lydia M; Wehrly, Tara D; Ireland, Robin M; Crane, Deborah D; Scott, Dana P; Bosio, Catharine M",Journal of immunology,23,1

This technique provides for decreased convalescence, less postoperative pain, and improved cosmesis. The use of LA for pheochromocytoma (PHE) has been questioned due to concerns of increased morbidity and negative hemodynamic sequelae. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of LA for PHE with the results of LA for other adrenal pathologies. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for an 11-year period from July 1997 to December 2008. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and outcomes were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0. Statistical significance was defined as a p value less than 0.05. RESULTS A total of 102 LA procedures were completed for 95 patients. The data for 33 PHE cases were compared with the data for 69 non-PHE cases (26 adenomas, 14 aldosteronomas, 5 cortisol-secreting tumors, 5 multinodular hyperplasias, and 19 other disorders). Five LA procedures were converted to open surgery. Four of these conversions involved patients with PHE (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the mean estimated blood loss (p = 0.2) or operative time (p = 0.1) between the two groups. The frequency of intraoperative hypertension and hypotension did not differ between the PHE and non-PHE cohorts. The complication rate was 7.5% for the PHE group and 6.9% for the non-PHE group (p = 0.7). The patients with PHE had a longer postoperative hospital stay (3.6 vs 2.3 days; p < 0.001) and overall hospital stay (4.9 vs 2.6 days; p < 0.001). Time in the intensive care unit (1.1 vs 0.1 days; p < 0.001) and time until oral intake (1.5 vs 1.0 days; p = 0.02) also were increased in the PHE population. There was one death in the PHE group secondary to congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS Concerns of increased morbidity related to a laparoscopic approach for patients with a diagnosis of PHE are unfounded. In this series, the only disparity in outcomes between the two groups was an increased conversion rate with PHE.","Nau, Peter; Demyttenaere, Sebastian; Muscarella, Peter; Narula, Vimal; Hazey, Jeffrey W; Ellison, E Christopher; Melvin, W Scott",Surgical endoscopy,23,1

The aim of the current review is to give an update on the current status and future recommendations for VAP prevention. METHODS This article gives an updated review of the current literature on VAP. The first part briefly reviews pathogenesis and epidemiology while the second includes an in-depth review of evidence-based practice guidelines (EBPG) and new technologies developed for prevention of VAP. RESULTS VAP remains a frequent and costly complication of critical illness with a pooled relative risk of 9-27% and mortality of 25-50%. Strikingly, VAP adds an estimated cost of more than $40,000 to a typical hospital admission. An important aetiological mechanism of VAP is gross or micro-aspiration of oropharyngeal organisms around the cuff of the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the distal bronchi. Prevention of VAP is preferable. Preventative measures can be divided into two main groups: the implemen- tation of EBPGs and use of device-based technologies. EBPGs have been authored jointly by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The Canadian Critical Care Trials group also published VAP Guidelines in 2008. Their recommendations are detailed in this review. The current device-based technologies include drainage of subglottic secretions, silver coated ETTs aiming to influence the internal bio-layer of the ETT, better sealing of the lower airways with ultrathin cuffs and loops for optimal cuff pressure control. CONCLUSIONS EBPG consensus includes: elevation of the head of the bed, use of daily ""sedation vacations"" and decontamination of the oropharynx. Technological solutions should aim to use the most comprehensive combination of subglottic suction of secretions, optimization of ETT cuff pressure and ultrathin cuffs. VAP is a type of hospital-acquired pneumonia that develops more than 48 h after endotracheal intubation. Its incidence is estimated to be 9-27%, with a mortality of 25-50% [Am J Respir Crit Care Med 171:388-416 (2005), Am J Med 85:499-506 (1988), Chest 122:2115-2121 (2002), Intensive Care Med 35:9-29 (2009)]. The most important target in VAP handling is its prevention. The aim of this article is to review the pathogenesis, epidemiology and the different strategies/technologies for prevention of VAP.","Efrati, Shai; Deutsch, Israel; Antonelli, Massimo; Hockey, Peter M; Rozenblum, Ronen; Gurman, Gabriel M",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,23,1

Almost all the data were collected while strict lockdown conditions were in place. RESULTS Relative to carers of children without intellectual disability, carers of both children and adults with intellectual disability had significantly greater levels of a wish fulfilment coping style, defeat/entrapment, anxiety, and depression. Differences were 2-3 times greater than reported in earlier pre-pandemic studies. Positive correlations were found between objective stress scores and all mental health outcomes.

In instant delivery services, it is important to dispatch massive orders to limited couriers, especially in rush hours. To meet this need, an efficient courier displacement mechanism not only can balance the demand (picking up orders) and supply (couriers’ capacity) but also improve the efficiency of order delivery by reducing idle displacing time. Existing studies on fleet management of rider-sharing or bike rebalancing cannot apply to courier displacement problems in instant delivery due to unique practical factors of instant delivery including region difference and strict delivery time constraints. In this work, we propose an efficient cross-region courier displacement method Courier Displacement Reinforcement Learning (short for CDRL), based on multi-agent actor-critic, considering the dynamic demand and supply at the region level and strict time constraints. Specifically, the multi-agent actor-critic reinforcement learning-based courier displacement framework utilizes a policy network to generate displacement decisions considering multiple practical factors and designs a value network to evaluate decisions of the policy network. One month of real-world order records data-set of Shanghai collecting from Eleme (i.e., one of the biggest instant delivery services in China) are utilized in the evaluation and the results show that our method offering up to 36% increase in courier displacement performance and reduce idle ride time by 17%. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hu, S.; Guo, B.; Wang, S.; Zhou, X.","16th International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems, and Applications, WASA 2021",23,13

Fields spontaneously breaking the $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry couple to new quarks charged under the ordinary color $SU(3)_C$ and a new $SU(N)$ gauge group. The theory flows into an IR fixed point where the $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ breaking fields hold a large anomalous dimension leading to the suppression of $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-violating higher dimensional operators. The spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ makes the new quarks massive. The $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry is anomalous under the $SU(3)_C$ but not under the $SU(N)$ so that the axion couples to only the color $SU(3)_C$ and the usual axion potential is generated. We also comment on a model that the $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ breaking fields are realized as meson superfields in a new supersymmetric QCD.,"Nakai, Yuichiro; Suzuki, Motoo",,23,15

As COVID-19 case rates decline and state and county restrictions are lifted, facility managers, local and state health agencies are challenged with defining their own policies moving forward to appropriately mitigate disease transmission. The continued emergence of variants of concern has highlighted the need for a readily available tool that can be employed at the facility-level to determine best practices for mitigation and ensure resident and staff safety. To assist leadership in determining the impact of various infection surveillance and response strategies, we developed an agent-based model and an online dashboard interface that simulates COVID-19 infection within congregate care settings under various mitigation measures. In this paper, we demonstrate how this dashboard can be used to quantify the continued risk for COVID-19 infections within a facility given a designated testing schedule and vaccine requirements. Our results highlight the critical nature of testing cadence, test sensitivity and specificity, and the impact of removing asymptomatic infected individuals from the workplace. We also show that monthly surveillance testing at long-term care facilities is unlikely to successfully mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate care settings.","Fosdick, B.

The main sources of air pollutants are motorized vehicles in urban areas and airports and industrial activities. At the airports, NO2 is the main pollutant of concern besides aerosols particles, yet gap in data availability prevent studies to describe their patterns and quantify their effects on human health and climate change. In this study NO2 data from TROPOMI sensor on board Sentinel 5-P satellite was used to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of NO2 tropospheric column amounts at major airports in Malaysia. The results demonstrate that NO2 amounts from aircrafts and ground traffic activities are generally higher and/or similar to the amounts found in urban areas. Total tropospheric column amounts of NO2 during the movement restriction imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic between March and April 2020 was approximately 50% lower the total emission during the same period in 2019 (representing a business as usual period). Assessing the spatial pattern and temporal variations in NO2 (both surface and total vertical profile) is important for monitoring the impact of air pollutants on climate change and human health in Malaysia. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 201 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled consecutively. The patients' chest CT scans were analyzed, and the disease severity was rated using two methods: (1) total lung involvement (TLI) in which each lobe is scored from 0 to 4 based on the percentage of involvement;and (2) modified TLI in which each lobe involvement score is multiplied by the number of its segments, and the sum is recorded as the modified TLI. The patients were categorized into four groups depending on their prognosis (patients admitted to hospital wards, patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), patients with intubation during hospitalization, and expired patients). The relationship between both scoring methods and the clinical outcomes of patients was examined in the four groups. Results: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed no significant difference between the two scoring methods (TLI and modified TLI) in predicting the patients' prognosis. The average disease severity based on the two scoring methods was significantly different between the four groups. Patients who were intubated during hospitalization and patients who expired had significantly higher scores than patients admitted to the ICUs and hospital wards (P = 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of mortality was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72 - 0.90;P &lt; 0.001);the TLI score of 18.5 could predict mortality with specificity of &gt; 95%. Conclusion: The TLI scoring system can be used for predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. This scoring method can help us devise a better strategic healthcare plan during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Aminzadeh, B.; Layegh, P.; Foroughian, M.; Tavassoli, A.; Emadzadeh, M.; Teimouri, A.; Maftouh, M.",Iranian Journal of Radiology,23,1
185757,185757,185757,Infectious agents associated with diarrhoea in commercial rabbits: a field study.,9.004961,5.380257,1984,"Group singing events have been linked to several outbreaks of infection during the CoVID-19 pandemic, leading to singing activities being banned in many areas across the globe. This link between singing and infection rates supports the possibility that aerosols are partly responsible for person-to-person infection. In contrast to droplets, the smaller aerosol particles do not fall to the ground within a short distance after being expelled by e.g. a singer. Aerosol particles hover and spread via convection in the environmental air. According to the super-spreading theory, choir singing and loud talking (theater and presentations) during rehearsals or performances may constitute a high risk of infectious virus transmission to large numbers of people. Thus, it is essential to define the safety distances between singers in super-spreading situations. The aim of this study is to investigate the impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing and speaking in comparison to breathing and coughing. Ten professional singers (5 males and 5 females) of the Bavarian Radio Chorus performed 9 tasks including singing a phrase of Beethovens 9th symphony, to the original German text. The inhaled air volume was marked with small aerosol particles produced via a commercial e-cigarette. The expelled aerosol cloud was recorded with three high definition TV cameras from different perspectives. Afterwards, the dimensions and dynamics of the aerosol cloud was measured by segmenting the video footage at every time point. While the median expansion was below 1m, the aerosol cloud was expelled up to 1.4m in the singing direction for individual subjects. Consonants produced larger distances of aerosol expulsion than vowels. The dispersion in the lateral and vertical dimension was less pronounced than the forward direction. After completion of each task, the cloud continued to distribute in the air increasing its dimensions. Consequently, we propose increasing the current recommendations of many governmental councils for choirs or singing at religious services from 1.5m to the front and 1m to the side to a distance between choir singers of 2m to the front and 1.5m to the sides.","Echternach, M.; Gantner, S.; Peters, G.; Westphalen, C.; Benthaus, T.; Jakubass, B.; Kuranova, L.; Doellinger, M.; Kniesburges, S.",,23,9

A subset of these patients develops refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarize the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimized while receiving ECMO so as to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimize resource allocation. CONCLUSION The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.","Lim, Joel Kian Boon; Qadri, Syeda Kashfi; Toh, Theresa Shu Wen; Lin, Cheryl Bin; Mok, Yee Hui; Lee, Jan Hau","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",23,17

To date, no studies have examined the strengths and weaknesses of emergency health services (EHS) administrative databases, as perceived by researchers. We undertook a qualitative study to determine, from a researcher's perspective, the strengths and weaknesses of EHS administrative databases. The study also elicited researchers' suggestions to improve these databases. METHODS We conducted taped interviews with 4 Canadian health services researchers. The transcriptions were subsequently examined for common concepts, which were finalized after discussion with all the investigators. RESULTS Five common themes emerged from the interviews: clinical detail, data quality, data linkage, data use and population coverage. Data use and data linkages were considered strengths. Clinical detail, data quality and population coverage were considered weaknesses. CONCLUSION The 5 themes that emerged from this study all serve to reinforce the call from the Health Council of Canada for national data on emergency services, which could be readily captured through a national EHS administrative database. We feel that key stakeholders involved in emergency services across Canada should work together to develop a strategy to implement an accurate, clinically detailed, integrated and comprehensive national EHS database.","Kennedy, Sherry; Young, Wendy; Schull, Michael J; Isaac, Winston",CJEM,23,1

METHODS 146 cases, all clinically diagnosed as SARS with positive SARS-CoV IgG, were followed up. 362 serum samples were collected from the onset of the disease to 660 days afterward. Total IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV were tested with commercial ELISA kits. For recombinant nucleoprotein and spike protein, we developed an ELISA to test these two antibodies. RESULTS Within 20 days of the onset, the positive rate of anti-SARS-CoV IgM was 46.5% (20/43); it reached a peak after 21 - 40 days (80.6%, 25/31). Then, the positive rate of IgM went down gradually to 8.2% (6/73) until 550 days after the onset. The patient's IgG positive rate was lower (34.9%, 15/43) than that of IgM within 20 days of the onset. Then it went up rapidly to 100%. It remained positive (98.6%, 70/71) until 600 - 660 days after the onset. When N-IgG and S-IgG were tested 40 days after the onset of the disease at three different times, the positive rate of N-IgG (92.5%, 37/40) was higher than that of S-IgG (67.5%, 27/40), but the two structure protein antibodies were always lower than the total IgG. CONCLUSIONS In SARS patients with definite clinical and etiological diagnosis, the highest positive rate of the antibodies against SARS-CoV was found at 21 - 40 days after the onset. IgM disappeared almost 500 days (91.8%) after the onset. Total IgG positive rate could reach 100% and 98.6% and the positivity might persist nearly two years. So it is speculated that the total IgG antibody may be positive 3 to 5 years after infection, but it seems that N-IgG and S-IgG keep positive shorter in time than total IgG antibody.","Yan, Hui-ping; Tan, Yu-fen; Zhuang, Hui; Zhou, Yu-sen; Zhao, Chun-hui; Feng, Xia; Jin, Rong-hua; Wu, Hao; Fu, Yan",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,23,28

First, to offer an overview of recent advances in the technical strategies applied to the production of transgenic large domestic animals, and second, to review how transgenic technology can be applied to the modification of milk composition. Transgenic sheep and cattle obtained through nuclear transfer are now a reality, opening up a means of ruminant transgenic production with an efficiency that entitles us to consider it a serious alternative to microinjection. Nuclear transfer also consistently reduces the time needed to establish a transgenic production herd, and what is more important, it opens up the way to homologous recombination in large species, which at the moment is restricted to mice. Other interesting technological contributions have also taken place lately, some of them towards the modification of the male germ line, and others developing viral vectors with the ability to alter the genetic information of animals. The simplification of the methodology and the consistent reduction of the time needed to carry out a transgenic experiment will allow us to test several hypotheses directed at the modification of milk components. This may help towards the application of transgenic technology in the dairy industry, which unlike pharmaceutical companies, has been somehow reluctant over these approaches.","Pintado, B; Gutiérrez-Adán, A","Reproduction, nutrition, development",23,16

We determined whether this selection occurred in the presence of an oligoclonal or polyclonal T cell response using soluble MHC/peptide tetramers in direct ex vivo analyses of CNS-derived lymphocytes. A total of 42% (range, 29-60%) of CD8 T cells in the CNS of mice with acute encephalitis recognized epitope S-510-518. A total of 34% (range, 18-62%) of cells from mice with hind limb paralysis (and chronic demyelination) were also epitope specific, even though only virus expressing mutated epitope is detected in these animals. Sequence analysis of the beta-chain CDR3 of 487 tetramer S-510-518-positive cDNA clones from nine mice showed that a majority of clonotypes were identified in more than one mouse. From these analyses, we estimated that 300-500 different CD8 T cell clonotypes responsive to epitope S-510-518 were present in each acutely infected brain, while 100-900 were present in the CNS of each mouse with chronic disease. In conclusion, a polyclonal CD8 T cell response to an epitope does not preclude the selection of T cell escape mutants, and epitope-specific T cells are still present at high levels even after RNA-encoding wild-type sequence is no longer detectable.","Pewe, L; Heard, S B; Bergmann, C; Dailey, M O; Perlman, S",Journal of immunology,23,16

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify factors that predict the overall survival rate for COVID-19 cases and develop a COVID-19 prognosis score (COPS) system based on these factors. In addition, disease severity and the length of hospital stay for patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a nationwide cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases between January and April 2020 in Korea. The cohort was split randomly into a development cohort and a validation cohort with a 2:1 ratio. In the development cohort (n=3729), we tried to identify factors associated with overall survival and develop a scoring system to predict the overall survival rate by using parameters identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model with bootstrapping methods. In the validation cohort (n=1865), we evaluated the prediction accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The score of each variable in the COPS system was rounded off following the log-scaled conversion of the adjusted hazard ratio. RESULTS: Among the 5594 patients included in this analysis, 234 (4.2%) died after receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis. In the development cohort, six parameters were significantly related to poor overall survival: older age, dementia, chronic renal failure, dyspnea, mental disturbance, and absolute lymphocyte count <1000/mm3. The following risk groups were formed: low-risk (score 0-2), intermediate-risk (score 3), high-risk (score 4), and very high-risk (score 5-7) groups. The COPS system yielded an area under the curve value of 0.918 for predicting the 14-day survival rate and 0.896 for predicting the 28-day survival rate in the validation cohort. Using the COPS system, 28-day survival rates were discriminatively estimated at 99.8%, 95.4%, 82.3%, and 55.1% in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups, respectively, of the total cohort (P<.001). The length of hospital stay and disease severity were directly associated with overall survival (P<.001), and the hospital stay duration was significantly longer among survivors (mean 26.1, SD 10.7 days) than among nonsurvivors (mean 15.6, SD 13.3 days). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed predictive COPS system may assist in making risk-adapted decisions for the allocation of medical resources, including intensive care, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cho, Sung-Yeon; Park, Sung-Soo; Song, Min-Kyu; Bae, Young Yi; Lee, Dong-Gun; Kim, Dong-Wook",J Med Internet Res,23,24

An integrative article review was done. The source of data were documents from WHO, Euro-surveillance, CDC, Saudi CDC, MOH, and journals from PubMed, Medline, etc. The inclusion searching criteria were surveillance, Covid-19, types, benefits and challenges, during the period 2005-2020. Published studies, reviews and guidelines that determined these criteria were collected. Data extraction and analysis were completed for all included articles. A critical appraisal was done based on the University of Michigan Practice Guideline's levels of evidence. The final sample for the integrative review comprised 30 studies. Results revealed that types of Covid-9 surveillance includes routine surveillance (comprehensive, case-based, and aggregated weakly methods), active, wildlife, syndromic, sentinel and sentinel-syndromic methods. Laboratory and hospital-based surveillance are another important types. Help-lines, surveys, participatory electronic, digital and event-based surveillance are relatively new cost-effective methods. Many surveillance indicators can be calculated. Timely and accurate of surveillance data is an essential element for effective Covid-19 interventions. Regarding challenges, the quality of surveillance in developing countries is constrained by resources and training. The main limitations of surveillance are under-ascertainment/under-reporting, lack of timeliness and completeness of surveillance data. In conclusion, surveillance is a cornerstones for controlling Covid-19 pandemic. Enhancing Covid-19 surveillance is vital for rapid cases detection, containing spread & ending pandemic.","Ibrahim, Nahla Khamis",J Infect Public Health,23,20

Like the other viruses belonging to the same family of coronaviruses, it can cause from mild flu-like symptoms, such as cold, sore throat, cough and fever, to more severe ones such as pneumonia and breathing difficulties, and it can even lead to death. Since no effective specific drug therapy has been found yet, nor any vaccine capable of limiting the spread of this pathogen, it is important for ways of preventing the spread of this infection to be established. The purpose of our research was to provide a protocol to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in light of the limited information related to this coronavirus. In detail, we analysed and searched targeted evidence-based guidelines issued in the various countries affected by this epidemic up till now. In addition, we analyzed the recommendations for the prevention and control of other epidemics caused by other pathogens belonging to the same family of coronaviruses or others that present the same mechanisms of transmission. General organizational measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency of COVID-19 have been imposed by the competent authorities for an adequate and proportionate management of the evolution of the epidemiological situation. The prevention and protection organizational measures therefore aim to minimize the probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, measures must also be taken at work to avoid new infections or even the spread of the virus where it has already been present. Furthermore, environmental measures are aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to individuals through contact with infected subjects, objects, equipment, or contaminated environmental surfaces. Protective devices must be used whenever there is potentially close contact with a suspect case, especially when the potentially infected person does not wear a surgical mask that could reduce the spread of viruses in the environment. By adopting this specific prevention and protection measures recommended in the workplace, it will be possible to help overcome this COVID-19 pandemic.","Cirrincione, Luigi; Plescia, Fulvio; Ledda, Caterina; Rapisarda, Venerando; Martorana, Daniela; Moldovan, Raluca Emilia; Theodoridou, Kelly; Cannizzaro, Emanuele",Sustainability,23,32

Our aim was to describe the planning of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in terms of timing related to the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and research question evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a living mapping of RCTs registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We systematically search the platform every week for all RCTs evaluating preventive interventions and treatments for COVID-19 and created a publicly available interactive mapping tool at https://covid-nma.com to visualize all trials registered. RESULTS: By August 12, 2020, 1,568 trials for COVID-19 were registered worldwide. Overall, the median ([Q1-Q3]; range) delay between the first case recorded in each country and the first RCT registered was 47 days ([33-67]; 15-163). For the 9 countries with the highest number of trials registered, most trials were registered after the peak of the epidemic (from 100% trials in Italy to 38% in the United States). Most trials evaluated treatments (1,333 trials; 85%); only 223 (14%) evaluated preventive strategies and 12 postacute period intervention. A total of 254 trials were planned to assess different regimens of hydroxychloroquine with an expected sample size of 110,883 patients. CONCLUSION: This living mapping analysis showed that COVID-19 trials have relatively small sample size with certain redundancy in research questions. Most trials were registered when the first peak of the pandemic has passed.","Nguyen, Van Thu; Rivière, Philippe; Ripoll, Pierre; Barnier, Julien; Vuillemot, Romain; Ferrand, Gabriel; Cohen-Boulakia, Sarah; Ravaud, Philippe; Boutron, Isabelle",J Clin Epidemiol,23,20

However, current evidence is rather based on limited measurements, losing sight of the temporal pattern of these changes. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis on a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up for more than 6 months. Neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. IgG antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA against the S2 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects models. Findings: We found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity, which persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of anti-RBD, S2 or NP antibody titers, all of them showing a constant decline over the follow-up period. Conclusions: Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the quality of the neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2 evolves over the post-convalescent stage.

Addressing reachability queries on such datasets is important for a wide range of applications (surveillance, public health, social networks, etc.) A spatiotemporal reachability query identifies whether a physical item (or information etc.) could have been transferred from the source object $O_S$ to the target object $O_T$ during a time interval $I$ (either directly, or through a chain of intermediate transfers). In previous research on spatiotemporal reachability queries, the number of such transfers is not limited, and the weight of a piece of transferred information remains the same. This paper introduces novel reachability queries, which assume a scenario of information decay. Such queries arise when the value of information that travels through the chain of intermediate objects decreases with each transfer. To address such queries efficiently over large spatiotemporal datasets, we introduce the RICCdecay algorithm. Further, the decay scenario leads to an important extension: if there are many different sources of information, the aggregate value of information an object can obtain varies. As a result, we introduce a top-k reachability problem, identifying the k objects with the highest accumulated information. We also present the RICCtopK algorithm that can efficiently compute top-k reachability with transfer decay queries. An experimental evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithms over previous approaches.","Strzheletska, Elena V.; Tsotras, Vassilis J.",,23,16

Symptoms of COVID-19 are not disease-specific. Differential diagnosis is challenging and the exclusion of other life-threatening diseases has major caveats. In the era of this pandemic, diagnosis of other life-threatening diseases might delay treatment. The Food and Drug Administration has recently authorized the first antibody-based test for COVID-19; however, RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs remains the recommended test for diagnosis. We present the first report of a false positive COVID-19 antibody test in a case of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA). Specifically, the case concerns an 82-year-old female, never smoker, who was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of fever and general fatigue that had lasted 7 days. She already had a positive IgM test for COVID-19, yet multiple RT-PCR tests had returned as negative for SARS-CoV-2. In the following days, her renal function deteriorated, while hematuria and proteinuria with active urinary sediment developed.

Since it was first recognized in December 2019, it has resulted in the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Although acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main features of the disease, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. There has been a growing concern regarding the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and poor outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Based on current observational data, AKI is the 2nd most common cause of morbidity and mortality behind ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been shown to be the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly plays a significant role in the occurrence of renal injury. The pathogenesis of AKI is likely multifactorial that involves not only direct viral invasion but also dysregulated immune response in the form of cytokine storm, ischemia to kidneys, hypercoagulable state, and rhabdomyolysis, among others. We performed a literature search of the Pubmed and Google Scholar database from 1996 to 2020 using the following keywords: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and acute kidney injury to find the most pertinent and highest-quality of evidence.

Agriculture is an important sector in the Northern Australian economy with significant production capabilities and the potential for creating national economic benefits. Northern Australia's fundamental supply chain deficiency constitutes the key source of comparative disadvantage the region faces, despite its significant resources, people and locational advantages. Drawing on reviews of several previous studies, critical analysis of the current value chain situations and consultations with key stakeholders, this article argues that there is a need to rethinking agricultural supply chains in Northern Australia. Several issues impeding the connectivity between production and market require systematic consideration, including the priorities for Northern agricultural development, integrated supply chain planning, workforce shortages and skills gaps, supply chain infrastructure, capitalizing on Asian market opportunities, transport and non-freight subsidies, east-west and north-south supply chain hubs and improved coordination and collaboration. Corona Virus Disease-2019 has had serious impacts across the supply chains;therefore, re-thinking supply chains is crucial as the business as usual approach is not sustainable. It is now a critical time to re-think supply chains to address the challenges of developing effective and resilient Northern supply chains to enhance agricultural expansion and boost the national economy.","Babacan, H.; McHugh, J.",Australasian Journal of Regional Studies,23,24

Following the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several immunotherapies were applied to modulate the immune responses of the affected patients. In this review, we aimed to describe the role of the immune system in response to COVID-19. We also provide a systematic review to collate and describe all published reports of the using immunotherapies, including convalescent plasma therapy, monoclonal antibodies, cytokine therapy, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and intravenous immunoglobulin and their important outcomes in COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A thorough search strategy was applied to identify published research trials in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and EMBASE from Dec 1, 2019, to May 4, 2020, for studies reporting clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with immunotherapies along with other standard cares. KEY FINDINGS: From an initial screen of 80 identified studies, 24 studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of immunotherapies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, including convalescent plasma therapy (33 patients), monoclonal antibodies (55 patients), interferon (31 patients), mesenchymal stem cell therapy (8 patient), and immunoglobulin (63 patients). Except for nine severe patients who died after treatment, most patients were recovered from COVID-19 with improved clinical symptoms and laboratory assessment. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the available evidence, it seems that treatment with immunotherapy along with other standard cares could be an effective and safe approach to modulate the immune system and improvement of clinical outcomes.","Mansourabadi, Amir Hossein; Sadeghalvad, Mona; Mohammadi-Motlagh, Hamid-Reza; Rezaei, Nima",Life Sci,23,16

Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARSCoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates the host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In the context of vaccine design, similar to many other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the glycan shield and the protein structure, stability, and dynamics. End-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which can be harnessed for vaccine development. In addition, a dynamic analysis of the main antibody epitopes is provided. Finally, beyond shielding, a possible structural role of N-glycans at N165 and N234 is hypothesized to modulate and stabilize the conformational dynamics of the spike’s receptor binding domain, which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its glycan coat, which may be exploited by therapeutic efforts targeting this essential molecular machine.","Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Dommer, Abigail C.; Harbison, Aoife M.; Fogarty, Carl A.; Barros, Emilia P.; Taylor, Bryn C.; Fadda, Elisa; Amaro, Rommie E.",bioRxiv,23,28

The first survey involved 4–12-day-old calves in six dairy-calf distribution centres, collecting calves from seven Administrative Regions (Aquitaine, Bretagne, Franche-Comté, Lorraine, Normandie, Nord, Pays de Loire). For each region, 20 calves were selected every month for 12 consecutive months (October 1995–September 1996). Prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was 17.9% (Confidence Intervals (C.I.) 95%=[16.1%; 19.8%]) among the 1628 selected calves, of which only 5.3% had diarrhoea. The second survey conducted between November 1995 and May 1996 involved 4–21-day-old calves examined by veterinary practitioners who selected 189 livestock farms of dairy- or suckler-type in ten Administrative Departments (Allier, Cantal, Creuse, Doubs, Ille-et-Vilaine, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Pas-de-Calais, Saône-et-Loire, Vendée). Cryptosporidia were detected in 105 (55.6%) of the farms. Among the 440 calves examined, of which 398 (90.5%) presented diarrhoea, cryptosporidia were found in 191 animals, i.e. a prevalence of 43.4% (C.I. 95%=[38.8%; 48.0%]). Breed of calves and type of housing had very little impact on prevalence in this survey. Some regional variations could be noticed, even if cryptosporidia infection is widespread. Monthly variations could be related to seasonal peaks in calving with a lower infection rate during summer.","Lefay, Didier; Naciri, Muriel; Poirier, Pierre; Chermette, René",Vet Parasitol,23,17

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated toward modification by MG – residues with predicted or expected low pK(a) by neighboring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-CoV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.","Al-Motawa, Maryam S.; Abbas, Hafsa; Wijten, Patrick; de la Fuente, Alberto; Xue, Mingzhan; Rabbani, Naila; Thornalley, Paul J.",Front Pharmacol,23,16

Methods: Taiwan has a nationwide neonatal BCG vaccination program that was launched in 1965. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control established a web-based National Immunization Information System (NISS) in 2003 and included all citizens’ BCG vaccination records in NISS for those born after 1985. We identified COVID-19 Taiwanese patients born after 1985 between 21 January and 19 March 2021. Study participants were further classified into ages 4–24 years (birth year 1996–2016) and 25–33 years (birth year 1986–1995). We described their clinical syndrome defined by the World Health Organization and examined the relation between the COVID-19 severity and BCG vaccination status. Results: In the 4–24 age group, among 138 BCG vaccinated individuals, 80.4% were asymptomatic or had mild disease, while 17.4% had moderate disease, 1.5% had severe disease, and 0.7% had acute respiratory distress syndrome but none of them died. In contrast, all 6 BCG unvaccinated individuals in this age group experienced mild illness. In the 25–33 age group, moderate disease occurred in 14.2% and severe disease occurred in 0.9% of the 106 patients without neonatal BCG vaccination records, as compared to 19.2% had moderate disease and none had severe or critical disease of the 78 patients with neonatal BCG vaccination records. Conclusions: Our finding indicated that BCG immunization might not relate to COVID-19 severity in the young population.","Su, Wei-Ju; Chang, Chia-Hsuin; Wang, Jiun-Ling; Chen, Shu-Fong; Yang, Chin-Hui",Int J Environ Res Public Health,23,29

It is thus of importance to study solid-phase forms of VLM in order to be able to ensure its polymorphic purity in drug formulations. The previously available solid-state NMR (SSNMR) data are combined with the plane-wave DFT computations in the NMR crystallography framework. Structural/spectroscopical predictions (the PBE functional/GIPAW method) are obtained to characterize four polymorphs of VLM. Interactions which confer a conformational stability to VLM molecules in these crystalline forms are described in detail. The way how various structural factors affect the values of SSNMR parameters is thoroughly analyzed, and several SSNMR markers of the respective VLM polymorphs are identified. The markers are connected to hydrogen bonding effects upon the corresponding ((13)C/(15)N/(1)H) isotropic chemical shifts of (C(O), N(amid), H(amid), H(α)) VLM backbone nuclei.

While epidemiologists and public health officials have suggested social distancing and shelter-in-place orders to halt the spread of this virus, the ability to comply with these guidelines is dependent on neighborhood, household, and individual characteristics related to social vulnerability. We use structural equation modeling and multiple data sources, including anonymized mobile phone location data from SafeGraph, to examine the effects of different social vulnerability and built environment factors on COVID-19 prevalence over two overlapping time periods (March to May and March to November of 2020). We use Chicago, Illinois as a case study and find that zip codes with low educational attainment consistently experienced higher case rates over both periods. Though population density was not significantly related to the prevalence in any period, movement of people made a significant contribution only during the longer time period. This finding highlights the significance of analyzing different timeframes for understanding social vulnerability. Our results suggest social vulnerability played an influential role in COVID-19 prevalence, highlighting the needs to address socioeconomic barriers to pandemic recovery and future pandemic response.","Kashem, Shakil Bin; Baker, Dwayne M.; González, Silvia R.; Lee, C.

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96 % aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors.

We observed that participants exhibited improved reaction times with a shared avatar than alone. Moreover, the reach trajectory of the shared avatar was straighter than that of either participant and correlated with their subjective embodiment of the avatar. Finally, the jerk of the avatar's hand was less than either participant's own hand, both when they reached alone and in the shared body.

METHODS: A retrospective multi-centre (8 hospital) cohort at Beaumont Health, Michigan, USA, reporting on COVID-19 patients diagnosed between 1 March and 1 April 2020 was used for score validation. The COVID-19 Risk of Complications Score was automatically computed by the EHR. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to predict hospital admission and in-hospital mortality using individual variables constituting the score. Validation was performed using both discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: Compared to Green scores, Yellow Scores (OR: 5.72) and Red Scores (OR: 19.1) had significantly higher odds of admission (both p < .0001). Similarly, Yellow Scores (OR: 4.73) and Red Scores (OR: 13.3) had significantly higher odds of in-hospital mortality than Green Scores (both p < .0001). The cross-validated C-Statistics for the external validation cohort showed good discrimination for both hospital admission (C = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77–0.81)) and in-hospital mortality (C = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71–0.78)).

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) impedes the permeation and access of most drugs to the central nervous system (CNS), and consequently, many neurological diseases remain undertreated. For past decades, to circumvent this effect, several nanocarriers have been developed to deliver drugs to the brain. Importantly, intranasal (IN) administration can allow direct delivery of drugs into the brain through the anatomical connection between the nasal cavity and brain without crossing the BBB. In this regard, dendrimers may possess great potential to deliver drugs to the brain by IN administration, bypassing the BBB and reducing systemic exposure and side effects, to treat diseases of the CNS. In this original concise review, we highlighted the few examples advocated regarding the use of dendrimers to deliver CNS drugs directly via IN. This review highlighed the few examples of the association of dendrimer encapsulating drugs (e.g., small compounds: haloperidol and paeonol; macromolecular compounds: dextran, insulin and calcitonin; and siRNA) using IN administration. Good efficiencies were observed. In addition, we will present the in vivo effects of PAMAM dendrimers after IN administration, globally, showing no general toxicity.","Mignani, Serge; Shi, Xiangyang; Karpus, Andrii; Majoral, Jean-Pierre",Eur J Med Chem,23,6

Some leaders in the field have made the disturbing observation that the overall quality of digital forensic examination is declining and the comprehension of cybercrime is diminishing. This reliable observation appears to be in conflict with the simultaneous improvement in the general public’s knowledge of technology and its attendant utility irrespective of the level of economic development. Further, such a decline is occurring at a time when all communities are becoming more dependent on technology and therefore individuals are generating more digital traces representing thoughts, behaviours and actions that might be used in evidence in any proceedings. The decline is a great concern as the consequences of errors and omissions in forensic science result in miscarriages of justice, and dangerous criminals will continue to be at large to perpetrate further crimes against persons and organisations. The public rightfully expects that its justice system will continuously improve in meeting the needs of the community and to have confidence in the evidence that might be presented.","Reedy, Paul",Strategic Leadership in Digital Evidence,23,5

There is, however, a scarcity of data on the perception of patients in Uganda towards the highly infectious disease. We aimed to assess the awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 preventive measures among patients at Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH), Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted in August, 2020, among patients in surgical and medical wards at MNRH. An interviewer-administered, pre-validated questionnaire was used to collect data that was entered into Google Forms and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and STATA 16. Descriptive statistics was used to present data from univariate analysis. Patients whose knowledge and practice scores were greater or equal to the average score were regarded to have good knowledge and practices respectively. Chi-square, Fisher’s Exact tests and binary logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with COVID-19 knowledge and practices. A P<0.05 was statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, 114 patients were approached and 102 consented to participate. Most were females (53.8%), aged above 45 years (31.4%) with 40.2% reporting primary level as the highest level of education. About 55.9% (n=57) had adequate knowledge for COVID-19 and its related practices, and 52% (n=53) had good COVID-19 related practices. Knowledge significantly differed by marital status at bivariate analysis (P=0.020), however this lost significance at logistic regression. Female patients were thrice more likely to have good COVID-19 prevention practices compared to males (COR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.8, P=0.020). Some 47 (46.1%) participants perceived that COVID-19 preventive measures were not difficult at all to observe. CONCLUSION: About half of the patients at Mulago National Referral Hospital lack adequate knowledge and practice on COVID-19 prevention. Continued patient education is required to increase knowledge which will in turn improve adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices.","Twinamasiko, Nelson; Olum, Ronald; Gwokyalya, Anna Maria; Nakityo, Innocent; Wasswa, Enock; Sserunjogi, Emmanuel",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,23,1

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most viable solution that mitigates the threats of cyberattacks. Given the many constraints of the ever-changing network environment of IoT devices, an effective yet lightweight IDS is required to detect cyber anomalies and categorize various cyberattacks. Additionally, most publicly available datasets used for research do not reflect the recent network behaviors, nor are they made from IoT networks. To address these issues, in this paper, we have the following contributions: (1) we create a dataset from IoT networks, namely, the Center for Cyber Defense (CCD) IoT Network Intrusion Dataset V1 (CCD-INID-V1); (2) we propose a hybrid lightweight form of IDS—an embedded model (EM) for feature selection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for attack detection and classification. The proposed method has two models: (a) RCNN: Random Forest (RF) is combined with CNN and (b) XCNN: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is combined with CNN. RF and XGBoost are the embedded models to reduce less impactful features. (3) We attempt anomaly (binary) classifications and attack-based (multiclass) classifications on CCD-INID-V1 and two other IoT datasets, the detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT dataset (Balot) and the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset (DoH20), to explore the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. Using RCNN, we achieved an Area under the Receiver Characteristic Operator (ROC) Curve (AUC) score of 0.956 with a runtime of 32.28 s on CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 71.46 s on Balot, and 0.986 with a runtime of 35.45 s on DoH20. Using XCNN, we achieved an AUC score of 0.998 with a runtime of 51.38 s for CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 72.12 s for Balot, and 0.999 with a runtime of 72.91 s for DoH20. Compared to KNN, XCNN required 86.98% less computational time, and RCNN required 91.74% less computational time to achieve equal or better accurate anomaly detections. We find XCNN and RCNN are consistently efficient and handle scalability well; in particular, 1000 times faster than KNN when dealing with a relatively larger dataset-Balot. Finally, we highlight RCNN and XCNN’s ability to accurately detect anomalies with a significant reduction in computational time. This advantage grants flexibility for the IDS placement strategy. Our IDS can be placed at a central server as well as resource-constrained edge devices. Our lightweight IDS requires low train time and hence decreases reaction time to zero-day attacks.","Liu, Zhipeng; Thapa, Niraj; Shaver, Addison; Roy, Kaushik; Siddula, Madhuri; Yuan, Xiaohong; Yu, Anna",Sensors (Basel),23,1

Such social restrictions impacted on the people's possibilities to move deliberately in a public space and to gather with other people. In the present study, we investigated the impact of COVID-19-related restrictions (“confinement”) on physical activity (PA) patterns before and during the confinement among team sports participants. Such PA patterns were further related to current mood states, and possible sex differences were also explored. Methods: A total of 476 adults exercising team sport (football, futsal, volleyball, handball, and basketball; mean age: 24.66 years; 48.1% females) completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, former and current PA patterns, and current mood states. Results: Compared with the period before the confinement, PA intensity decreased, but PA frequency increased during the confinement. Past, current, and changes in physical activity patterns were unrelated to participants' mood states. Sex differences in mood were spurious. Sex differences in physical activity patterns were modest, with male participants reporting a higher physical activity intensity during the confinement. Conclusions: The present pattern of results suggests that the COVID-19-related confinement did not impact in a uniform fashion on PA patterns of adults attending team sports. Furthermore, mood states were unrelated to current physical activity patterns. Given the complex psychosocial situation of COVID-19-related confinement, it appeared very unlikely that sole physical activity patterns could counterbalance possible impaired states of mood and behavior.","Aghababa, Alireza; Zamani Sani, Seyed Hojjat; Rohani, Hadi; Nabilpour, Maghsoud; Badicu, Georgian; Fathirezaie, Zahra; Brand, Serge",Front Psychol,23,16

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted assessing ED imaging volumes between March 1, 2020, and May 11, 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis. A rolling 7-day total value was used for volume tracking and comparison. Total imaging utilization in the ED was compared with new COVID-19 cases in our region. Utilization was first categorized by modality and then by plain films and computed tomography (CT) scans grouped by body part. CT imaging of the chest was specifically investigated by assessing both CT chest only exams and CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis (C/A/P) exams. Ultimately, matching pair-wise statistical analysis of exam volumes was performed to assess significance of volume change. RESULTS: Our multicenter health system experienced a 46% drop in imaging utilization (p < 0.0001) during the pandemic. Matching pair-wise analysis showed a statistically significant volume decrease by each modality and body part. The exceptions were non-contrast chest CT, which increased (p = 0.0053), and non-trauma C/A/P CT, which did not show a statistically significant volume change (p = 0.0633). CONCLUSION: ED imaging utilization trends revealed through actual health system data will help inform evidence-based decisions for more accurate volume predictions and therefore institutional preparedness for current and future pandemics.","Parikh, Keval D.; Ramaiya, Nikhil H.; Kikano, Elias G.; Tirumani, Sree Harsha; Pierce, Jonathan; Butcher, Carl; Sunshine, Jeffrey L.; Plecha, Donna M.",Emerg Radiol,23,20

This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to receptor binding domain (RBD), nucleocapsid, and spike S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 develop over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219/255 SARS-CoV-2(+) patient specimens, 86%), suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were different based on patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age. Analyses of these findings may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the levels of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients throughout infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2(+) patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-18, and gamma interferon [IFN-γ]) and chemotactic markers (IP-10 and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), GRO-α, and MIP-1α relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients who succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Furthermore, patients who succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and had a higher ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies. This study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity implicating the magnitude and specificity of response in relation to patient outcomes. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to impact the global population, and knowledge of the immune response to COVID-19 is still developing. This study assesses the interplay of different parts of the immune system during COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate that COVID-19 patients produce antibodies to three proteins of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and identify many other immunological proteins that are involved during infection. The data suggest that one of these proteins (CXCL13) may be a novel biomarker for severe COVID-19 that can be readily measured in blood. This information combined with our broad-scale analysis of immune activity during COVID-19 provides new information on the immunological response throughout the course of disease and identifies a novel potential marker for assessing disease severity.","Horspool, Alexander M.; Kieffer, Theodore; Russ, Brynnan P.; DeJong, Megan A.; Wolf, M.

Vaccinia virus (VacV) encodes two decapping enzymes (D9, D10) that remove protective 5′ caps on mRNAs, presumably generating substrates for degradation by the host exonuclease Xrn1. Surprisingly, we find VacV infection of Xrn1-depleted cells inhibits protein synthesis, compromising virus growth. These effects are aggravated by D9-deficiency and dependent upon a virus transcription factor required for intermediate and late mRNA biogenesis. Considerable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation in Xrn1-depleted cells is accompanied by activation of host dsRNA-responsive defenses controlled by PKR and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), which respectively inactivate the translation initiation factor eIF2 and stimulate RNA cleavage by RNase L. This proceeds despite VacV-encoded PKR and RNase L antagonists being present. Moreover, Xrn1-depletion sensitizes uninfected cells to dsRNA treatment. Thus, Xrn1 is a cellular factor regulating dsRNA accumulation and dsRNA-responsive innate immune effectors.","Burgess, Hannah M.; Mohr, Ian",Cell Host & Microbe,23,9

Novel coronavirus called COVID-19 is a newly emerged virus that appeared in many countries of the world, but the actual source of the virus is not yet known. The outbreak has caused pandemic with 26,622,706 confirmed infections and 874,708 reported deaths worldwide till August 31, 2020, with 17,717,911 recovered cases. Currently, there exist no vaccines officially approved for the prevention or management of the disease, but alternative drugs meant for HIV, HBV, malaria and some other flus are used to treat this virus. In the present paper, a fractional-order epidemic model with two different operators called the classical Caputo operator and the Atangana–Baleanu–Caputo operator for the transmission of COVID-19 epidemic is proposed and analyzed. The reproduction number [Formula: see text] is obtained for the prediction and persistence of the disease. The dynamic behavior of the equilibria is studied by using fractional Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion and fractional La Salle invariant principle. Special attention is given to the global dynamics of the equilibria. Moreover, the fitting of parameters through least squares curve fitting technique is performed, and the average absolute relative error between COVID-19 actual cases and the model’s solution for the infectious class is tried to be reduced and the best fitted values of the relevant parameters are achieved. The numerical solution of the proposed COVID-19 fractional-order model under the Caputo operator is obtained by using generalized Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method, whereas for the Atangana–Baleanu–Caputo operator, we have used a new numerical scheme. Also, the treatment compartment is included in the population which determines the impact of alternative drugs applied for treating the infected individuals. Furthermore, numerical simulations of the model and their graphical presentations are performed to visualize the effectiveness of our theoretical results and to monitor the effect of arbitrary-order derivative.","Naik, Parvaiz Ahmad; Yavuz, Mehmet; Qureshi, Sania; Zu, Jian; Townley, Stuart",Eur Phys J Plus,23,16

Globally, Indigenous peoples may experience a different burden of ARI compared to non-Indigenous peoples. This protocol outlines our process for conducting a systematic review to investigate whether associations between ARI and seasonal or meteorological parameters differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups residing in the same geographical region. METHODOLOGY: A search string will be used to search PubMed(®), CAB Abstracts/CAB Direct(©), and Science Citation Index(®) aggregator databases. Articles will be screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria applied first at the title and abstract level, and then at the full article level by two independent reviewers. Articles maintained after full article screening will undergo risk of bias assessment and data will be extracted. Heterogeneity tests, meta-analysis, and forest and funnel plots will be used to synthesize the results of eligible studies. DISCUSSION AND REGISTRATION: This protocol paper describes our systematic review methods to identify and analyze relevant ARI, season, and meteorological literature with robust reporting. The results are intended to improve our understanding of potential associations between seasonal and meteorological parameters and ARI and, if identified, whether this association varies by place, population, or other characteristics.
