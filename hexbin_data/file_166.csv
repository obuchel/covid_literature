1076,Estimation of the National Disease Burden of Influenza-Associated Severe Acute Respiratory Illness in Kenya and Guatemala: A Novel Methodology,2013-02-27,"BACKGROUND: Knowing the national disease burden of severe influenza in low-income countries can inform policy decisions around influenza treatment and prevention. We present a novel methodology using locally generated data for estimating this burden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This method begins with calculating the hospitalized severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence for children <5 years old and persons ≥5 years old from population-based surveillance in one province. This base rate of SARI is then adjusted for each province based on the prevalence of risk factors and healthcare-seeking behavior. The percentage of SARI with influenza virus detected is determined from provincial-level sentinel surveillance and applied to the adjusted provincial rates of hospitalized SARI. Healthcare-seeking data from healthcare utilization surveys is used to estimate non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI. Rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI are applied to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The method was field-tested in Kenya, and validated in Guatemala, using data from August 2009–July 2011. In Kenya (2009 population 38.6 million persons), the annual number of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI cases ranged from 17,129–27,659 for children <5 years old (2.9–4.7 per 1,000 persons) and 6,882–7,836 for persons ≥5 years old (0.21–0.24 per 1,000 persons), depending on year and base rate used. In Guatemala (2011 population 14.7 million persons), the annual number of hospitalized cases of influenza-associated pneumonia ranged from 1,065–2,259 (0.5–1.0 per 1,000 persons) among children <5 years old and 779–2,252 cases (0.1–0.2 per 1,000 persons) for persons ≥5 years old, depending on year and base rate used. In both countries, the number of non-hospitalized influenza-associated cases was several-fold higher than the hospitalized cases. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus was associated with a substantial amount of severe disease in Kenya and Guatemala. This method can be performed in most low and lower-middle income countries.","Fuller, James A.; Summers, Aimee; Katz, Mark A.; Lindblade, Kim A.; Njuguna, Henry; Arvelo, Wences; Khagayi, Sammy; Emukule, Gideon; Linares-Perez, Nivaldo; McCracken, John; Nokes, D.

1978,Estimating the Potential Effects of a Vaccine Program Against an Emerging Influenza Pandemic—United States,2015-05-01,"Background. Human illness from influenza A(H7N9) was identified in March 2013, and candidate vaccine viruses were soon developed. To understand factors that may impact influenza vaccination programs, we developed a model to evaluate hospitalizations and deaths averted considering various scenarios. Methods. We utilized a model incorporating epidemic curves with clinical attack rates of 20% or 30% in a single wave of illness, case hospitalization ratios of 0.5% or 4.2%, and case fatality ratios of 0.08% or 0.53%. We considered scenarios that achieved 80% vaccination coverage, various starts of vaccination programs (16 or 8 weeks before, the same week of, or 8 or 16 weeks after start of pandemic), an administration rate of 10 or 30 million doses per week (the latter rate is an untested assumption), and 2 levels of vaccine effectiveness (2 doses of vaccine required; either 62% or 80% effective for persons aged <60 years, and either 43% or 60% effective for persons aged ≥60 years). Results. The start date of vaccination campaigns most influenced impact; 141 000–2 200 000 hospitalizations and 11 000–281 000 deaths were averted when campaigns started before a pandemic, and <100–1 300 000 hospitalizations and 0–165 000 deaths were averted for programs beginning the same time as or after the introduction of the pandemic virus. The rate of vaccine administration and vaccine effectiveness did not influence campaign impact as much as timing of the start of campaign. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that efforts to improve the timeliness of vaccine production will provide the greatest impacts for future pandemic vaccination programs.","Biggerstaff, Matthew; Reed, Carrie; Swerdlow, David L.; Gambhir, Manoj; Graitcer, Samuel; Finelli, Lyn; Borse, Rebekah H.; Rasmussen, Sonja A.; Meltzer, Martin I.; Bridges, Carolyn B.",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610126/,166
2927,"Laboratory-based respiratory virus surveillance pilot project on select cruise ships in Alaska, 2013–15()",2017-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks can occur among passengers and crews during the Alaska summertime cruise season. Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013–2015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2–3 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83% tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71% tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. However, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.","Rogers, Kimberly B.; Roohi, Shahrokh; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Montgomery, David; Parker, Jayme; Fowler, Nisha H.; Xu, Xiyan; Ingram, Deandra J.; Fearey, Donna; Williams, Steve M.; Tarling, Grant; Brown, Clive M.; Cohen, Nicole J.",Journal of Travel Medicine,https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-pdf/24/6/tax069/21576761/tax069.pdf,166
3135,Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma: a nationwide high-risk cohort study,2018-04-10,"BACKGROUND: Research has revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may prevent cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The comparative chemopreventive effects of ACEIs and ARBs in high-risk populations with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have yet to be investigated. METHODS: From 2005 to 2014, high-risk HBV and HCV cohorts of hypertensive patients without HCC history were recruited from three linked national databases of Taiwan, and were classified into two groups based on the ACEI or ARB exposure within the initial six months after initiating antiviral agent. Intergroup differences in clinical characteristics and duration of drug exposure within study period were evaluated. HCC-free survival was compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression including time-dependent variables for the use of ACEIs or ARBs and other medications was applied to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Among the 7724 patients with HBV and 7873 with HCV, 46.3% and 42.5%, respectively, had an initial exposure to ACEIs or ARBs. The median durations of exposure were 36.4 and 38.9 months for the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. The median durations of ACEI or ARB use during study period between initial exposure and nonexposure groups were 41.8 vs. 18.3 months and 46.4 vs. 22.7 months for the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. No significant difference was observed in HCC risk within 7 years between the initial exposure and non-exposure groups. After adjustment for comorbidities, namely liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hyperlipidemia, and medications, namely aspirin, metformin, and statins, the hazard ratios (HRs) for ACEI or ARB exposure for HCC risk were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81–1.16) and 0.96 (0.80–1.16) in the HBV and HCV cohorts, respectively. In the HCV cohort, the increased HCC risk was associated with ACEI or ARB use in patients without cirrhosis, DM, and hyperlipidemia (HR: 4.53, 95% CI: 1.46–14.1). CONCLUSION: Compared with other significant risk and protective factors for HCC, ACEI or ARB use in the HBV and HCV cohorts was not associated with adequate protective effectiveness under standard dosages and may not be completely safe.

3880,Development of a Rhinovirus Inoculum Using a Reverse Genetics Approach,2019-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Experimental inoculation is an important tool for common cold and asthma research. Producing rhinovirus (RV) inocula from nasal secretions has required prolonged observation of the virus donor to exclude extraneous pathogens. We produced a RV-A16 inoculum using reverse genetics and determined the dose necessary to cause moderate colds in seronegative volunteers. METHODS: The consensus sequence of RV-A16 from a previous inoculum was cloned, and inoculum virus was produced using reverse genetics techniques. After safety testing, volunteers were inoculated with either RV-A16 (n = 26) or placebo (n = 10), Jackson cold scores were recorded, and nasal secretions were tested for shedding of RV-A16 ribonucleic acid. RESULTS: The reverse genetics process produced infectious virus that was neutralized by specific antisera and had a mutation rate similar to conventional virus growth techniques. The 1000 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) dose produced moderate colds in most individuals with effects similar to that of a previously tested conventional RV-A16 inoculum. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse genetics techniques produced a RV-A16 inoculum that can cause clinical colds in seronegative volunteers, and they also serve as a stable source of virus for laboratory use. The recombinant production procedures eliminate the need to derive seed virus from nasal secretions, thus precluding introduction of extraneous pathogens through this route.","Gern, James E; Lee, Wai Ming; Swenson, Cheri A; Nakagome, Kazuyuki; Lee, Iris; Wolff, Michele; Grindle, Kristine; Sigelman, Steven; Liggett, Stephen B; Togias, Alkis; Evans, Michael; Denlinger, Loren; Gangnon, Ronald; Bochkov, Yury A; Crisafi, Gina",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6581892/,166
5133,Bacteria killing nanotechnology Bio-Kil effectively reduces bacterial burden in intensive care units,2013-10-18,"Currently available prognostic tools are inadequate to discern the molecular basis of the heterogenic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with the current standard of therapy. The expression and biological function of immune mediators have been shown to be critical in all phases of the immune response to HCV infection and likely therefore influence host response. Herein, a biometric multiplex serum cytokine assay was utilized to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of host response in 10 HCV patients. Serum levels of 17 cytokines were compared before and after 1 month of treatment and against controls. Overall serum cytokine levels were significantly higher in patients (P < 0.05) than controls. Additionally, viral titers decreased in all patients after 1 month of therapy, as did overall serum cytokine levels in the cohort (P < 0.05). To assess relationships between changes in cytokine levels and changes in viral titer, the cohort was divided into three statistically distinct subgroups based on changes in viral titers. Specific sets of cytokines decreased in each group: decreases in CCL4, interleukin (IL)-2, CXCL8, and IL-1β correlated with the greatest drops in viral titer, decreases in IL-5, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and CCL4 correlated with moderate drops in viral titer, and only CCL2 correlated with the lowest drops in viral titer. Interestingly, decreases in CCL4 levels correlated with decreases in viral titers in all patients. CCL4 controls leukocyte influx and thus propagates inflammation. In conclusion, these data raise the possibility that characteristic changes in host response modulate the therapeutic response, demonstrating the prognostic power of serum cytokine profiling in chronic HCV.","Wright, Harlan; Alex, Philip; Nguyen, Thuan; Bader, Teddy; Gurakar, Ahmet; Sebastian, Anthony; Gonzales, Liberty; Wallis, Gemma; Naylor, Mark; Dozmorov, Igor; Centola, Michael; Nour, Bakr",Dig Dis Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087834/,166
5193,Serological evidence of viral orMycoplasma pneumoniae infection in acute maxillary sinusitis,1989,"Coughs and sneezes feature turbulent, multiphase flows that may contain pathogen-bearing droplets of mucosalivary fluid. As such, they can contribute to the spread of numerous infectious diseases, including influenza and SARS. The range of contamination of the droplets is largely determined by their size. However, major uncertainties on the drop size distributions persist. Here, we report direct observation of the physical mechanisms of droplet formation at the exit of the mouth during sneezing. Specifically, we use high-speed imaging to directly examine the fluid fragmentation at the exit of the mouths of healthy subjects. We reveal for the first time that the breakup of the fluid into droplets continues to occur outside of the respiratory tract during violent exhalations. We show that such breakup involves a complex cascade of events from sheets, to bag bursts, to ligaments, which finally break into droplets. Finally, we reveal that the viscoelasticity of the mucosalivary fluid plays an important role in delaying fragmentation by causing the merger of the droplet precursors that form along stretched filaments; thereby affecting the final drop size distribution farther downstream.

6441,"Measles-induced respiratory distress, air-leak and ARDS",2009-12-13,"Purpose. Traditionally, vaccines have been administered by needle injection. Topical immunization through the intact skin with either protein- or DNA-based vaccines has attracted much attention recently. We sought to enhance the immune responses induced by DNA-based vaccines after topical application by developing novel ethanol-in-fluorocarbon (E/F) microemulsion systems to aid in the delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). Methods. Ten different fluorosurfactants were selected or synthesized and screened by pseudo-phase-diagram construction for their ability to form E/F microemulsions. Plasmid DNA was successfully incorporated into E/F microemulsions using several different fluorosurfactants and perfluorooctyl bromide as the continuous fluorocarbon phase. For several reasons, Zonyl® FSN-100 (an ethoxylated nonionic fluorosurfactant) was selected for further studies. In vivo studies were performed in mice to assess pDNA expression in skin and immunologic responses after topical application of this system using a luciferase-encoding plasmid (CMV-luciferase) and a CMV-β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, respectively. Results. Plasmid DNA incorporated into E/F microemulsion using FSN-100 as the surfactant was found to be stable. After topical application of this E/F microemulsion system, significant enhancements in luciferase expression and antibody and T-helper type-1 biased immune responses were observed relative to those of “naked” pDNA in saline or ethanol. For example, with the E/F microemulsion system, the specific serum IgG and IgA titers were increased by 45-fold and over 1000-fold, respectively. Conclusion. A novel fluorocarbon-based microemulsion system for potential DNA vaccine delivery was developed.","Cui, Zhengrong; Fountain, William; Clark, Michael; Jay, Michael; Mumper, Russell J.",Pharm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101539/,166
6510,Corticosteroids combined with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for treatment of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by Puumala virus infection,2006-03-21,"Rituximab, a humanized monoclonal antibody approved for malignant lymphoma, is being increasingly, effectively, and safely used for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and other humoral autoimmune disorders. We report the case of a 43-year-old man with ITP refractory to steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after a single infusion of rituximab. Dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pleuritic chest pain occurred within 24 hours of rituximab administration, and there was no other apparent explanation. Progressive hypoxemia mandated endotracheal intubation 1 week after rituximab administration and led to death 4 weeks after admission. ARDS has been associated with the administration of other monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and OKT3 and is believed to be directly mediated by release of proinflammatory cytokines. ARDS is rarely associated with rituximab infusion for lymphoproliferative disorders, but it should be considered by those administering rituximab, especially when a patient develops severe pulmonary symptoms soon after infusion.","Montero, Alberto J.; McCarthy, John J.; Chen, George; Rice, Lawrence",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101654/,166
6547,Chemokines as Molecular Targets for Therapeutic Intervention,1999,"Progressive hepatic fibrosis is the final common pathway for most chronic liver injuries, leading to cirrhosis with risk of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is now recognized that fibrosis is a dynamic process, and may be reversible prior to the establishment of advanced architectural changes to the liver. The most effective antifibrotic strategy is to cure the underlying disease process before advanced fibrosis has developed. Unfortunately, this is often not possible, and specific antifibrotic therapies are needed. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis have identified several potential novel therapeutic targets, but unfortunately clinical development has been disappointing. One major limitation has been the often prolonged natural history of fibrosis compared to experimental models, and difficulties in accurate noninvasive fibrosis assessment, thus making clinical trial design difficult. In this review, we highlight the most promising current antifibrotic strategies.","Thompson, Alexander James; Patel, Keyur",Curr Gastroenterol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101726/,166
6548,Group A streptococcal sepsis,2003,"PURPOSE: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may cure approximately 50% of patients, however, a significant part of the other half might benefit from a high-quality palliative care medicine at the end of life. Somatic, psychic and spiritual needs of these patients may differ from those of patients suffering from incurable solid tumours and are not comprehensively evaluated so far. METHODS: To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. RESULTS: Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0–1) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities. Severe pain, dyspnoea and obstipation, as known from patients suffering from advanced solid tumours, were rare. In consequence, use of opioids seemed to be less frequent than in patients with solid tumours. Measures of intensive care and i.v.-drug administration were applied to a significant proportion of patients. CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicates that the somatic, psychic and spiritual end-of-life-care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be optimised. A significant problem for the transplantation team seems to be the realisation of necessity to switch the curative concept into a palliative ambition. Requirements are a subsequent prospectively conducted investigation and an intensification of cooperation between transplant and palliative care teams.","Busemann, Christoph; Jülich, Andreas; Buchhold, Britta; Schmidt, Vanessa; Schneidewind, Laila; Pink, Daniel; Schmidt, Christian Andreas; Neumann, Thomas; Krüger, William H.",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101727/,166
6604,Personalized medicine in severe influenza,2016-03-02,"A patient is reported who presented in the newborn period with an unusual combination of congenital lactic acidosis and bilateral calcifications in the adrenal medulla, visible on standard abdominal x-ray and ultrasound examination. At birth, the proband was hypotonic and dystrophic. She developed respiratory insufficiency, cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly and died at the age of 38 d. Examination of postmortem heart muscle revealed multiple areas of myocardial infarction with dystrophic calcifications. In the medulla of the adrenal glands, foci of necrosis and calcifications, and in the liver, multiple zones of necrosis and iron deposition were detected. Biochemical analysis in heart muscle revealed a decreased activity of complex IV of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and in liver a combined deficiency involving the complexes I, III, IV, and V. The findings were suggestive of a defect in biosynthesis of the mitochondrially encoded subunits of the OXPHOS complexes. Extensive analysis of the proband's mitochondrial DNA revealed neither pathogenic deletions and point mutations nor copy number alterations. Relative amounts of mitochondrial transcripts for the ribosomal mitochondrial 12S rRNA (12S) and mitochondrial 16S rRNA (16S) were significantly increased suggesting a compensatory mechanism involving the transcription machinery to low levels of translation.

6763,Urine samples as a possible alternative to serum for human immunodeficiency virus antibody screening,1996,"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor is effective therapy for patients with bone marrow failure states and those with hematologic malignancies. However, only a minority of them will have an HLA-identical sibling donor; unrelated donors, matched or partially mismatched, have been used successfully for patients lacking a related donor. Even though results with allogeneic transplants using unrelated donors are encouraging, the incidence of complications including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection or late graft failure is increased compared to identical sibling transplants. The combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) has been used as an effective preparative regimen for allogeneic transplants, however, the total dosage and dosing schedule of both the cyclophosphamide and TBI has varied significantly among studies. To decrease the rate of graft rejection and late graft failure with volunteer donors, we evaluated a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, days −8, −7, −6, −5) followed by fractionated TBI (1400 cGy administered in eight fractions over 4 days, days −4, −3, −2, −1). GVHD prophylaxis included FK506 and methotrexate. From July 1993 to January 1996, 43 adult patients, median age 38 years (range 18–58 years), were treated with this preparative regimen. Seventeen patients had low-risk disease and 26 had high-risk disease. Thirty-one donor/recipient pairs were matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR by serology and molecular typing. Seven additional pairs were minor mismatched at the HLA-A or HLA-B loci. Four other donor/recipient pairs were HLA-A,-B, and -DR identical by serology but allele mismatched at either DRB1 or DQB. Forty patients were evaluable for myeloid engraftment. Engraftment occurred in all 40 patients at a median of 19 days. There were no cases of graft rejection or late graft failure. Nephrotoxicity was the primary adverse event with 26 patients (60%) experiencing a doubling of their creatinine. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred in seven patients, six of whom had high-risk disease. All patients who had relapsed or refractory disease prior to BMT achieved a complete remission following BMT. Six patients transplanted for high-risk disease relapsed a median of 377 days post-BMT. None of the patients with low-risk disease have relapsed following transplant; the Kaplan–Meier survival for those patients with low-risk disease is 62% and 37% for those patients transplanted with high-risk disease (P = 0.0129). The median Karnofsky performance status is 100% (range 70–100%). Therefore, a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fractionated TBI is an acceptable regimen for patients receiving an allograft from unrelated donors.","Geller, RB; Devine, SM; O’Toole, K; Persons, L; Keller, J; Mauer, D; Holland, HK; Dix, SP; Piotti, M; Redei, I; Connaghan, G; Heffner, LT; Hillyer, CD; Waller, EK; Winton, EF; Wingard, JR",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102093/,166

Very few studies have documented unusual manifestations of dengue in South India. This prospective study was undertaken from July 2011 to June 2013 to document rare manifestations of dengue fever in 175 hospitalized patients. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of NS1Ag, dengue IgM, or IgG by ELISA and/or a RT-PCR and CDC real-time PCR for dengue virus (DENV) RNA. The daily profiles of the hematological and biochemical investigations were followed and recorded. Unusual and rare manifestations of dengue were documented for 115 patients (66 %). Hepatitis was observed in 70 % of the cases. Pleural effusion was seen in 11 %, acute renal failure in 10 %, neurological complications such as encephalitis in 7.4 %, myocarditis in 9 %, and bleeding gastric ulcers in 3.4 % of the cases.

7187,Expanding Existing Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs in Pediatrics: What Comes Next,2017-12-18,"Poor growth and/or weight gain was identified in the initial reports of children with AIDS (Oleske et al. 1983, Rubinstein et al. 1983). However, in the past 12 years little progress has been made to understand the mechanisms for these observations. Data from the NIAID/NICHD multicenter Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS) demonstrated that a decline in weight occurred in the first four months of life followed by decreased linear growth (Rich et al. 1993). In older children weight and height seem to decline in parallel (McKinney et al. 1993), but loss of lean body mass may occur prior to a decline in weight (Miller et al. 1993). Adequate caloric intake can improve weight gain, but has little effect on height velocity and lean body mass (Henderson et al. 1994, Miller et al. 1992). Long-term survivors with HIV infection are shorter than anticipated, and these changes cannot be explained solely by inadequate nutrition or by endocrine abnormalities. The immune system, gastrointestinal tract function, malnutrition, and chronic or recurrent infection interact and contribute to the nutritional deficiencies and problems with growth observed in the HIV-infected child.","Winter, Harland",J Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107469/,166
7192,Adenoviral Infections in Singapore: Should New Antiviral Therapies and Vaccines Be Adopted?,2020-02-15,"Acute febrile illness is a common cause of hospital admission, and its associated infectious causes contribute to substantial morbidity and death among children worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Declining transmission of malaria in many regions, combined with the increasing use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, has led to the increasing recognition of leptospirosis, rickettsioses, respiratory viruses, and arboviruses as etiologic agents of fevers. However, clinical discrimination between these etiologies can be difficult. Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs is common, even in the setting of a negative test result, as is overtreatment with empiric antibacterial drugs. Viral etiologies remain underrecognized and poorly investigated. More-sensitive diagnostics have led to additional dilemmas in discriminating whether a positive test result reflects a causative pathogen. Here, we review and summarize the current epidemiology and focus particularly on children and the challenges for future research.","Iroh Tam, Pui-Ying; Obaro, Stephen K.; Storch, Gregory",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107506/,166

7240,Parechovirus A Infections in Healthy Australian Children During the First 2 Years of Life: A Community-based Longitudinal Birth Cohort Study,2019-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Before kidney transplantation, donors and recipients are routinely screened for viral pathogens using specific tests. Little is known about unrecognized viruses of the urinary tract that potentially result in transmission. Using an open metagenomic approach, we aimed to comprehensively assess virus transmission in living-donor kidney transplantation. METHODS: Living kidney donors and their corresponding recipients were enrolled at the time of transplantation. Follow-up study visits for recipients were scheduled 4–6 weeks and 1 year thereafter. At each visit, plasma and urine samples were collected and transplant recipients were evaluated for signs of infection or other transplant-related complications. For metagenomic analysis, samples were enriched for viruses, amplified by anchored random polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. Viruses detected by sequencing were confirmed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 30 living kidney donor and recipient pairs, with a follow-up of at least 1 year. In addition to viruses commonly detected during routine post-transplant virus monitoring, metagenomic sequencing detected JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) in the urine of 7 donors and their corresponding recipients. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed infection with the donor strain in 6 cases, suggesting transmission from the transplant donor to the recipient, despite recipient seropositivity for JCPyV at the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic sequencing identified frequent transmission of JCPyV from kidney transplant donors to recipients. Considering the high incidence rate, future studies within larger cohorts are needed to define the relevance of JCPyV infection and the donor’s virome for transplant outcomes.","Schreiber, Peter W; Kufner, Verena; Hübel, Kerstin; Schmutz, Stefan; Zagordi, Osvaldo; Kaur, Amandeep; Bayard, Cornelia; Greiner, Michael; Zbinden, Andrea; Capaul, Riccarda; Böni, Jürg; Hirsch, Hans H; Mueller, Thomas F; Mueller, Nicolas J; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108204/,166

However, there have been no controlled studies to show whether this approach is effective. During the winter of 1994–1995, 1059 patients in 12 geriatric medical long-term-care sites, randomized for vac.cination of HCWs, were studied. In hospitals where HCWs were offered vaccination, 653 (61%) of 1078 were vaccinated. Vaccination of HCWs was associated with reductions in total patient mortality from 17% to 10% (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40–0.80) and in influenza-like illness (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34–0.94). Vaccination of patients was not associated with significant effects on mortality (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.81–1.64). Results of this study support recommendations for vaccination against influenza of HCWs in long-term geriatric care. Vaccination of frail elderly long-term-care patients may not give clinically worthwhile benefits.","Potter, J.; Stott, D. J.; Roberts, M. A.; Elder, A. G.; O'Donnell, B.; Knight, P. V.; Carman, W.

LRV generates a short transcript, corresponding to the 5' end of the positive- sense RNA (320 nt), via a cleavage event mediated by the viral capsid protein on the full-length positive sense RNA transcript. To address the possibility that the RNA cleavage represents a regulatory mechanism for maintaining persistent infection, the interactions between Leishmania cytoplasmic proteins and in vitro synthesized viral transcripts were studied. In gel mobility shift experiments, three specific RNA/protein complexes were formed between cellular proteins and the cleaved viral transcript, and three major proteins were labeled by UV cross-linking. No protein binding activity was observed for either the short (320 nt) or full-length RNA transcripts. However, the two cleavage reaction products were able to form stable RNA/RNA complexes. We present a model in which the virus is targeting its own transcript for cleavage to promote binding of host factors to cryptic domains inaccessible in the full-length transcript.","Saiz, Margarita; Ro, Young-Tae; Wirth, Dyann F.; Patterson, Jean L.",J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109934/,166

These antibodies protect CD13-negative and -positive cells from CMV infection only if incubated with the virus inoculum, suggesting they bind to CMV virions. The association of a CD13-like molecule with virions was further supported by the transfer of CD13 immunoreactivity to the surface of CD13-negative cells upon binding of CMV; the binding of CD13-specific antibodies directly to the surface of CMV virions; and the presence of anti-CD13 immunoreactive bands, including one with mobility similar to that of native cellular CD13 on immunoblots of proteins of purified CMV particles. Importantly, CD13-specific antibodies neutralize CMV in urine of neonates with congenital CMV, indicating that the CD13-like molecule is associated with natural CMV and not acquired in vitro. These studies demonstrate that a CD13-like molecule is associated with CMV particles and may be important in CMV pathogenesis.","Giugni, Terrence D.; Söderberg, Cecilia; Ham, Debby J.; Bautista, Robert M.; Hedlund, Kjell-Olof; Moller, Erna; Zaia, John A.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110010/,166

However, there is emerging evidence that even reference genes can be regulated under different conditions. qRT-PCR has only recently been used in terms of zebrafish gene expression studies and there is no validated set of reference genes. This study characterizes the expression of nine possible reference genes during zebrafish embryonic development and in a zebrafish tissue panel. All nine reference genes exhibited variable expression. The β-actin, EF1α and Rpl13α genes comprise a validated reference gene panel for zebrafish developmental time course studies, and the EF1α, Rpl13α and 18S rRNA genes are more suitable as a reference gene panel for zebrafish tissue analysis.

Antibody concentrates derived from these materials were fed to germ-free piglets that were subsequently inoculated with HRV Wa. Both viral shedding and diarrhea were effectively reduced or eliminated in a dose-dependent manner as a result of HRV immune antibody feeding.

7489,Evaluation of New Anti-Infective Drugs for the Treatment of Respiratory Tract Infections,1992-11-11,"Continual advances in the ability to produce transgenic animals make it likely that such animals will become important components of animal agriculture. The full benefit of the technology, and justification of its initial cost outlay, will be dependent on the establishment within these animals of new traits not easily achievable by other means. Potential applications include enhanced nutrient digestibility with reduced fecal losses, significantly altered milk composition with superior nutritional properties, and enhanced disease resistance. Our goal is to enhance mastitis resistance of dairy cows by enabling the cells of the mammary gland to secrete additional antibacterial proteins. Proof of concept has been obtained through experimentation with a transgenic mouse model. Three lines of mice were developed that produce varying levels of lysostaphin in their milk. This protein has potent anti-staphylococcal activity and its secretion into milk confers substantial resistance to infection caused by intramammary challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, a major mastitis pathogen. Additional antibacterial proteins are being sought that will complement lysostaphin. A potential benefit of transgenic application of antibacterial proteins is the concomitant sparing in the agricultural use of antibiotics currently used as human therapeutics. Antibacterial proteins, such as lysostaphin, are not typically used as injectable or oral therapeutics because of immune-mediated or digestive destruction of their activity. In contrast, the immune system of transgenic animals will not consider the transgenic protein as being foreign. In addition we are exploring the potential of involution or mastitis responsive promoter elements for use in subsequent transgenic experiments designed to restrict lysostaphin production to these important time points. It is anticipated that genomics will play a role in unveiling candidate genes whose promoter elements will enable desired temporal expression patterns. The transgenic approach to insertion of new genetic material into agriculturally important animals is feasible but requires extensive prior evaluation of the transgene and transgene product in model systems.","Kerr, D.

Beck-Speier et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2006;316:842–851). In a follow up study, we hypothesized that OMZ generates pro-resolving lipoxins being paralleled by production of immune-modulating prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and anti-inflammatory 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] and depletion of pro-inflammatory leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)). Human neutrophils (PMN) were chosen as the cellular system. The effect of OMZ on these parameters as well as on respiratory burst activity and oxidative stress marker 8-isprostane was analyzed in unstimulated and co-stimulated PMN by ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), respectively. In unstimulated cells, OMZ induced formation of PGE(2), 15(S)-HETE, and LXA(4). The levels of LTB(4) and 8-isoprostane were not affected, whereas respiratory burst activity was drastically inhibited. In UCP- and OZ-stimulated control cells, all parameters were elevated. Here, OMZ maintained the increased levels of PGE(2), 15(S)-HETE, and LXA(4), but substantially suppressed levels of LTB(4) and 8-isoprostane and inhibited the respiratory burst activity. These findings suggest a switch from the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB(4) to the pro-resolving LXA(4). Since LXA(4) is most relevant in returning inflamed tissue to homeostasis, OMZ is postulated to terminate rhinitis-related inflammation, thus contributing to shortening of disease duration.","Beck-Speier, Ingrid; Oswald, Barbara; Maier, Konrad L.; Karg, Erwin; Ramseger, René",J Pharmacol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128694/,166

From primary and secondary biosynthetic sites in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, respectively, proteins and lipids are distributed to more than 30 final destinations in membranes or membrane-bound spaces, where they carry out their programmed function. Molecular sorting is defined, in its most general sense, as the sum of the mechanisms that determine the distribution of a given molecule from its site of synthesis to its site of function in the cell. The final site of residence of a protein in a eukaryotic cell is determined by a combination of various factors, acting in concert: (1) site of synthesis, (2) sorting signals or zip codes, (3) signal recognition or decoding mechanisms, (4) cotranslational or posttranslational mechanisms for translocation across membranes, (5) specific fusion–fission interactions between intracellular vesicular compartments, and (6) restrictions to the lateral mobility in the plane of the bilayer. Improvements in cell fractionation, protein separation, and immune precipitation procedures in the past decade have made them possible. Very little is known about the mechanisms that mediate the localization and concentration of specific proteins and lipids within organelles. Various experimental model systems have become available for their study.

With the implementation of enhanced recovery protocols, the use of drains should decrease. METHODS: The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database was queried for the years 2015–2017. Our inclusion criteria included all patients undergoing a primary LRYGB, SG, and revisions. We examined demographics, operative characteristics, the use of drains, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and proportions. Student’s T test (Wilcoxon sum rank test in the case of skewed data) and chi-squared analysis were used to assess the baseline differences in drain utilization. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2017, there were 388,239 bariatric cases performed without drains and 100,221 performed with drains. Twenty-nine percent of LRYGB patients had a drain placed but only 16.7% of SG patients. The percentage of LRYGB that had a drain dropped from 33.1 to 24.6% during the study period and that of SG dropped from 20.3 to 13.6%. Patients that had drains placed were more likely to have a provocative test at the time of surgery (prevalence ratio (PR) 2.24) and to have a postoperative swallow study (PR 1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Drains are still commonly used in bariatric patients. Over the study period, there was a decrease in the use of drains in both bypass and sleeve patients. Patients with a drain were more likely to have had a provocative test and a swallow study and have a higher rate of complications and mortality.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of observational studies that enrolled adult patients with acute respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen from inception to 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies evaluating 10,755 patients were included. The overall pooled rate of do-not-intubate orders was 27%. The pooled rate of do-not-intubate orders in studies from North America was 14% (range 9–22%), from Europe was 28% (range 13–58%), and from Asia was 38% (range 9–83%), p = 0.001. Do-not-intubate rates were higher in studies with higher patient age and in studies where do-not-intubate decisions were made without reported patient/family input. There were no significant differences in do-not-intubate orders according to illness severity, observed mortality, malignancy comorbidity, or methodological quality. Rates of do-not-intubate orders increased over time from 9% in 2000–2004 to 32% in 2015–2019. Only 12 studies (46%) reported information about do-not-intubate decision-making processes. Only 4 studies (15%) also reported rates of do-not-resuscitate. CONCLUSIONS: One in four patients with acute respiratory failure (who receive noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen) has a do-not-intubate order. The rate of do-not-intubate orders has increased over time. There is high inter-study variability in do-not-intubate rates—even when accounting for age and illness severity. There is high variability in patient/family involvement in do-not-intubate decision making processes.

At 12 months, there was no difference in ‘success’ rate (p = 0.58); MMR was achieved in 80% (IM) vs 92% (IM/HCQ) (p = 0.21). At 24 months, the ‘success’ rate was 20.8% higher with IM/HCQ (p = 0.059). No patients progressed. Seventeen serious adverse events, including four serious adverse reactions, were reported; diarrhoea occurred more frequently with combination.

This study seeks to describe the use of syndromic surveillance systems in Ontario and users' perceptions of the value of these systems within the context of other surveillance systems. METHODS: Ontario's 36 public health units, the provincial ministry of health and federal public health agency completed a web survey to identify traditional and syndromic surveillance systems used routinely and during the pandemic and to describe system attributes and utility in monitoring pandemic activity and informing decision-making. RESULTS: Syndromic surveillance systems are used by 20/38 (53%) organizations. For routine surveillance, laboratory, integrated Public Health Information System and school absenteeism data are the most frequently used sources. Laboratory data received the highest ratings for reliability, timeliness and accuracy (‘very acceptable’ by 92, 51 and 89%). Hospital/clinic screening data were rated as the most reliable and timely syndromic data source (50 and 43%) and ED visit data the most accurate (48%). During the pandemic, laboratory data were considered the most useful for monitoring the epidemiology and informing decision-making while ED screening and visit data were considered the most useful syndromic sources. CONCLUSIONS: End user perceptions are valuable for identifying opportunities for improvement and guiding further investments in public health surveillance.","Savage, Rachel; Chu, Anna; Rosella, Laura C.; Crowcroft, Natasha S.; Varia, Monali; Policarpio, Michelle E.; Vinson, Norman G.; Winter, Anne-Luise; Hay, Karen; Davies, Richard F.; Gemmill, Ian; Willison, Don; Johnson, Ian",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313939/,166

Documentation that 77% of highly active people and 58% of low active people exercised as much or more following the institution of a nationwide lockdown was impressive, given that the cases of COVID-19 were accelerating at that time. The Belgian government’s central promotion of exercise, to boost both the mental and physical health of the population, likely contributed to the health, tolerance, and ultimate success of lockdown. In this commentary, we wish to pose a follow-up query which highlights the potential detrimental effects of intense exercise (competition) performed without social distancing measures. The proposed graphical abstract elucidates these possible risks, in contrast to the favorable results outlined in Constandt et al.’s study.","Hew-Butler, Tamara; Smith-Hale, Valerie; Van Sumeren, Matthew; Sabourin, Jordan; Levy, Phillip",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459777/,166
12966,Outbreak of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Shigella flexneri in northern Australia due to an endemic regional clone acquiring an IncFII plasmid,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding an infant exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) carries the risk of HIV acquisition whilst not breastfeeding poses a higher risk of death from malnutrition, diarrhea, and pneumonia. In Uganda, mothers living with HIV are encouraged to discontinue breastfeeding at 12 months but data are limited. We examined the frequency and factors associated with cessation of breastfeeding at 1 year among mothers living with HIV at Ndejje Health Center IV, a large peri-urban health facility in Uganda. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all mothers living with HIV and enrolled in HIV care for ≥12 months between June 2014 and June 2018. We abstracted data from registers, held focus group discussions with mothers living with HIV and key informant interviews with healthcare providers. Cessation of breastfeeding was defined as the proportion of mothers living with HIV who had discontinued breastfeeding at 1 year. We summarized quantitative data descriptively, tested differences in outcome using Chi-square and t - tests, and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis at 5% statistical significance level. We thematically analyzed qualitative data to enrich and triangulate the quantitative results. RESULTS: Of 235 participants, 150 (63.8%) had ceased breastfeeding at 1 year and this was independently associated with the infant being male (Adjusted Risk Ratio [aRR] 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.50), the mother being multiparous (aRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04–1.53), and the initiation of breastfeeding being on the same-day as birth (aRR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.41). The reasons for ceasing breastfeeding included male infants over breastfeed than females, maternal literacy and knowledge adequacy about breastfeeding, support and reminders from the partner, and boys can bite once they get teeth. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal proportion of infants were ceased from breastfeeding at 1 year and this might increase the risk of mother to child transmission of HIV. Cessation of breastfeeding was more likely among male infants and multiparous mothers but less likely when breastfeeding was initiated on the same-day as birth. Interventions to enhance cessation of breastfeeding should target none multiparous mothers and those with female infants.","Ngbapai, Jackslina Gaaniri; Izudi, Jonathan; Okoboi, Stephen",Int Breastfeed J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7476247/,166
15900,Socioeconomic Impact of RSV Hospitalization,2021-03-03,"Naringenin (NRG) is a polyphenolic phytochemical belonging to the class of flavanones and is widely distributed in citrus fruits and some other fruits such as bergamot, tomatoes, cocoa, and cherries. NRG presents several interesting pharmacological properties, such as anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the therapeutic potential of NRG is hampered due to its hydrophobic nature, which leads to poor bioavailability. Here, we review a wide range of nanocarriers that have been used as delivery systems for NRG, including polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), nanosuspensions, and nanoemulsions. These nanomedicine formulations of NRG have been applied as a potential treatment for several diseases, using a wide range of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models and different routes of administration. From this review, it can be concluded that NRG is a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, liver diseases, ocular disorders, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, and diabetes when formulated in the appropriate nanocarriers.","Bhia, Mohammed; Motallebi, Mahzad; Abadi, Banafshe; Zarepour, Atefeh; Pereira-Silva, Miguel; Saremnejad, Farinaz; Santos, Ana Cláudia; Zarrabi, Ali; Melero, Ana; Jafari, Seid Mahdi; Shakibaei, Mehdi",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926828/,166

16129,A Case of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Missed by Newborn Screening,2021-03-12,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common among extremely preterm infants. In selected cases, surgical PDA ligation may be required. The timing for PDA ligation may depend upon a variety of factors, with potential clinical implications. We aimed to investigate the impact of different surgical PDA managements on ligation timing and neonatal outcomes. Inborn infants < 32 weeks of gestation and < 1500 g admitted at two tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Units that underwent PDA ligation between 2007 and 2018 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study and split into the following groups based on their surgical management: on-site bedside PDA ligation (ONS) vs. referral to an off-site pediatric cardiac surgery (OFS). Neonatal characteristics, surgical timing, and clinical outcomes of the enrolled infants were compared between the groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of PDA ligation timing on significantly different outcomes. Seventy-eight neonates (ONS, n = 39; OFS, n = 39) were included. Infants in the ONS group underwent PDA ligation significantly earlier than those in the OFS group (median age 12 vs. 36 days, p < 0.001) with no increase in postoperative mortality and complications. The multivariate analysis revealed a significant association between PDA ligation timing, late-onset sepsis prevalence (OR 1.045, 0.032), and oxygen need at discharge (OR 1.037, p = 0.025). Conclusions: Compared with off-site surgery, on-site bedside ligation allows an earlier surgical closure of PDA, with no apparent increase in mortality or complications. Earlier PDA ligation may contribute to reduced rates of late-onset sepsis and post-discharge home oxygen therapy, with possible cost-benefit implications.

The objectives of this study are to describe the current pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia practice patterns in European emergency departments, to perform a needs assessment-like analysis, and to identify barriers to implementation. A survey study of European emergency departments treating children was conducted. Through a lead research coordinator identified through the Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine (REPEM) network for each of the participating countries, a 30-question questionnaire was sent, targeting senior physicians at each site. Descriptive statistics were performed. One hundred and seventy-one sites participated, treating approximately 5 million children/year and representing 19 countries, with a response rate of 89%. Of the procedural sedation and analgesia medications, midazolam (100%) and ketamine (91%) were available to most children, whereas propofol (67%), nitrous oxide (56%), intranasal fentanyl (47%), and chloral hydrate (42%) were less frequent. Children were sedated by general pediatricians in 82% of cases. Safety and monitoring guidelines were common (74%), but pre-procedural checklists (51%) and capnography (46%) less available. In 37% of the sites, the entire staff performing procedural sedation and analgesia were certified in pediatric advanced life support. Pediatric emergency medicine was a board-certified specialty in 3/19 countries. Physician (73%) and nursing (72%) shortages and lack of physical space (69%) were commonly reported as barriers to procedural sedation and analgesia. Nurse-directed triage protocols were in place in 52% of the sites, mostly for paracetamol (99%) and ibuprofen (91%). Tissue adhesive for laceration repair was available to 91% of children, while topical anesthetics for intravenous catheterization was available to 55%. Access to child life specialists (13%) and hypnosis (12%) was rare. Conclusion: Procedural sedation and analgesia are prevalent in European emergency departments, but some sedation agents and topical anesthetics are not widely available. Guidelines are common but further safety nets, nurse-directed triage analgesia, and nonpharmacologic support to procedural sedation and analgesia are lacking. Barriers to implementation include availability of sedation agents, staff shortage, and lack of space.

Nevertheless, mortality from HIV-related CNS diseases, including those associated with ART (e.g., immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) remains significant. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can improve the outlook for people with HIV through early diagnosis and prompt treatment. For example, HIV encephalopathy shows a diffuse bilateral pattern, whereas progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma, and CNS toxoplasmosis show focal patterns on MRI. Among the other diseases caused by opportunistic infections, CNS cryptococcosis and CNS tuberculosis have extremely poor prognoses unless diagnosed early. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome shows distinct MRI findings from the offending opportunistic infections. Although distinguishing between HIV-related CNS diseases based on imaging alone is difficult, in this review, we discuss how pattern recognition approaches can contribute to their early differentiation.","Sakai, Mio; Higashi, Masahiro; Fujiwara, Takuya; Uehira, Tomoko; Shirasaka, Takuma; Nakanishi, Katsuyuki; Kashiwagi, Nobuo; Tanaka, Hisashi; Terada, Hitoshi; Tomiyama, Noriyuki",Jpn J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202053/,166

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children with airway foreign bodies rescued by first-aid fast track channels admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to December 2020. The corresponding clinical features, treatments, and prognoses were summarized. RESULTS: Clinical data from 21 cases of first-aid fast track channel patients were retrospectively collected, including 12 males and 9 females aged 9–18 months. Cough was the most frequently exhibited symptom (100.0%), followed by III inspiratory dyspnoea (71.4%). Regarding the location of foreign bodies, 5 cases (23.8%) had glottic foreign bodies, 10 cases (47.6%) had tracheal foreign bodies, and 6 cases (28.6%) had bilateral bronchial foreign bodies. The most common type of FB was organic. FB removal was performed by rigid bronchoscopy in every case, and there were no complications of laryngeal oedema, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumothorax. No tracheotomy was performed in any of the children. CONCLUSION: The first-aid fast track channel for airway foreign bodies saves a valuable time for rescue, highlights the purpose of rescue, improves the success rate of rescue and the quality of life of children, and is of great value for the treatment of critical tracheal foreign bodies. It is necessary to regularly summarize the experience of the first-aid fast track channel of airway foreign bodies and further optimize the setting of the first-aid fast track channel.","Chen, Yong-chao; Xian, Zhi-xiong; Han, Sai-hong; Li, Lan; Teng, Yi-shu",BMC Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293538/,166
19617,The epidemiology of norovirus gastroenteritis in China: disease burden and distribution of genotypes,2019-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Text Matching (TM) is a fundamental task of natural language processing widely used in many application systems such as information retrieval, automatic question answering, machine translation, dialogue system, reading comprehension, etc. In recent years, a large number of deep learning neural networks have been applied to TM, and have refreshed benchmarks of TM repeatedly. Among the deep learning neural networks, convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular networks, which suffers from difficulties in dealing with small samples and keeping relative structures of features. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture based on capsule network for TM, called CapsTM, where capsule network is a new type of neural network architecture proposed to address some of the short comings of CNN and shows great potential in many tasks. METHODS: CapsTM is a five-layer neural network, including an input layer, a representation layer, an aggregation layer, a capsule layer and a prediction layer. In CapsTM, two pieces of text are first individually converted into sequences of embeddings and are further transformed by a highway network in the input layer. Then, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is used to represent each piece of text and attention-based interaction matrix is used to represent interactive information of the two pieces of text in the representation layer. Subsequently, the two kinds of representations are fused together by BiLSTM in the aggregation layer, and are further represented with capsules (vectors) in the capsule layer. Finally, the prediction layer is a connected network used for classification. CapsTM is an extension of ESIM by adding a capsule layer before the prediction layer. RESULTS: We construct a corpus of Chinese medical question matching, which contains 36,360 question pairs. This corpus is randomly split into three parts: a training set of 32,360 question pairs, a development set of 2000 question pairs and a test set of 2000 question pairs. On this corpus, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed CapsTM and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods. CapsTM achieves the highest F-score of 0.8666. CONCLUSION: The experimental results demonstrate that CapsTM is effective for Chinese medical question matching and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for comparison.","Yu, Xiaoming; Shen, Yedan; Ni, Yuan; Huang, Xiaowei; Wang, Xiaolong; Chen, Qingcai; Tang, Buzhou",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322831/,166

Most patients progress to a chronic phase of the disease in which neuropsychiatric symptoms upsurge. The biological processes underlying the progression of these symptoms are yet unclear. Peripheral inflammation mounted against Brucella may condition neurochemical shifts and hence unchained neuropsychiatric disorders. Our work aimed at establishing whether neurological, behavioral, and neurochemical disarrays are circumstantially linked to peripheral inflammation uprise secondary to Brucella abortus 2308 infections. We then evaluated, in control and Brucella-infected mice, skeletal muscle strength, movement coordination, and balance and motivation, as well as dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin availability in the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and corticosterone in vehicle-injected and -infected mice were also estimated. All estimates were gathered at the infection acute and chronic phases. Our results showed that infected mice displayed motor disabilities, muscular weakness, and reduced motivation correlated with neurochemical and peripheral immunological disturbances that tended to decrease after 21 days of infection. The present observations support that disturbed peripheral inflammation and the related neurochemical disruption might lead to mood disorders in infected mice. Future experiments must be aimed at establishing causal links and to explore whether similar concepts might explain neurological and mood disorders in humans affected by brucellosis.","Maldonado-García, José Luis; Pérez-Sánchez, Gilberto; Becerril Villanueva, Enrique; Alvarez-Herrera, Samantha; Pavón, Lenin; Gutiérrez-Ospina, Gabriel; López-Santiago, Rubén; Maldonado-Tapia, Jesús Octavio; Pérez-Tapia, Sonia Mayra; Moreno-Lafont, Martha C.",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470318/,166

23235,Respiratory Viral Infections in Multiple Myeloma Patients,2017-10-04,"A central problem in managing risk is dealing with social processes that either exaggerate or understate it. A longstanding approach to understanding such processes has been the social amplification of risk framework. But this implies that some true level of risk becomes distorted in social actors’ perceptions. Many risk events are characterised by such uncertainties, disagreements and changes in scientific knowledge that it becomes unreasonable to speak of a true level of risk. The most we can often say in such cases is that different groups believe each other to be either amplifying or attenuating a risk. This inherent subjectivity raises the question as to whether risk managers can expect any particular kinds of outcome to emerge. This question is the basis for a case study of zoonotic disease outbreaks using systems dynamics as a modelling medium. The model shows that processes suggested in the social amplification of risk framework produce polarised risk responses among different actors, but that the subjectivity magnifies this polarisation considerably. As this subjectivity takes more complex forms it leaves problematic residues at the end of a disease outbreak, such as an indefinite drop in economic activity and an indefinite increase in anxiety.","Busby, J S; Onggo, S",J Oper Res Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099211/,166

It is again being applied, after earlier failures, because well-trained teams and improved equipment and techniques are available following the success of neonatal ECMO. In addition, in Europe extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) in adults has been more successful. The use of ECMO for pulmonary failure in children does not have fixed indications and has had considerably less success than neonatal ECMO. Patients who require inspired oxygen fractions of over 0.5 and positive end-expiratory pressures of over 6 cm H(2)O for more than 12 h after being treated for more than 48 h should be considered candidates, given the high mortality of children with ARDS (70%). Survival averages 50% to 60%. Circuits and patient management techniques are very similar to those for newborn ECMO, but patients usually require longer times on ECMO. There are many more options for cannulation for both venoarterial and venovenous techniques than in neonatal and cardiac ECMO. The improving results indicate that ECMO will play a part in treating children with pulmonary failure. Further studies will be required to determine which patients can benefit from ECMO as well as the exact application in each case.","Klein, Michael D.; Whittlesey, Grant C.; Lieh-Lai, Mary",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100091/,166

23434,Seligman (2007; 195:609),2007-04-15,"BACKGROUND: BK polyoma virus (BKV) nephropathy (BKVN) is a well-established cause of allograft loss after kidney transplantation. In contrast BKVN is rarely been reported in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Renal dysfunction after HCT is common and often attributed to total body irradiation, drug toxicity, hypertension or microangiopathy. As kidney biopsies are rarely performed after HCT, BKVN may be underdiagnosed. We report a Single-center experience of BKVN in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of HCT recipients from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017. Only cases of BKVN confirmed by immunohistochemical stain on renal biopsy are included. Urine and blood BKV PCR was performed at Viracor Eurofins (Lee’s Summit, MO). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2017, 320 patients received HCT and 6 patients underwent kidney biopsy and 4 had BKVN. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Three patients (75%) received ex vivo T-cell depleted (CD34+ selected) peripheral blood (PB) HCT and did not receive pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis; one patient received cord blood allograft. All patients had BKV viruria with a median BKV viral load of 9.3 log(10) copies/mL (range, 8.6–10.0) and median onset 18 days (range 6–41) post HCT. BKVN was diagnosed at a median of 275.5 days post-HCT (range, 141–637). All patients presented with decreased GFR (median 47.5% reduction, range 16–75%) from GFR at transplant. One patient had proteinuria (3 g over 24 hours); one patient had hydronephrosis. At BKVN diagnosis plasma BKV viral load was a median of 6.2 log(10) copies/mL; range, 6.0–6.3), absolute lymphocyte count median 1027 (range 335–2,536) and CD4+ lymphocyte count median 145 (range 64–172). CONCLUSION: (1) BKVN should be considered in HCT recipients with worsening renal function and high BKV viremia. (2) Early, noninvasive predictors of BKVN could aid in identifying high-risk patients for early intervention prior to irreversible loss of kidney function. (3) Reduction of immunosuppression is often not feasible in HCT. The role of preemptive antiviral therapy and/or adoptive cell therapy for BKV viremia in HCT should be evaluated in clinical trials.

26894,NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS,2000-05-01,"In Chapter 2 we introduced vaccine efficacy parameters that require conditioning on exposure to infection. Household studies were used as the basis for defining exposure to infection in vaccine studies as early as the 1930s in evaluating the efficacy of pertussis vaccines (Kendrick and Eldering 1939). In addition to evaluating vaccine efficacy, household studies have been used to learn about transmission and natural history of many infections. Aspects of the natural history studied in households include the transmissibility, the incubation and latent periods, the duration of infectiousness, and the serial interval between cases (Hope-Simpson 1952; Bailey 1957). Household studies have also been used to evaluate other interventions, such as post-exposure prophylaxis with influenza antiviral agents (Welliver et al 2001; Hayden et al 2004). Exposure to an infectious case within a household can be used as a natural challenge study, for example, when studying immunological correlates of protection (Storsaeter et al 1998). Longitudinal studies of pneumococcal carriage in households and schools have been used to estimate the acquisition and clearance rates for asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage. The general idea of a transmission unit is that individuals make contact sufficient for transmission within it. Households are the most common form of transmission unit used in studies. It allows easy identification of contacts between a case and susceptibles, and families are convenient units of study. Many other settings are also used as transmission units in studies and analyses that condition on exposure to infection. These include sexual partnerships, classrooms, schools, school buses, airplanes, day care centers, and workplaces, among others. Here we talk mostly about household studies, but many of the study designs and analyses are applicable with possibly slight modification to other transmission units as well. The term household is much easier for exposition than is “transmission unit”.","Halloran, M.

It explores how Schwabe’s work influenced, and was reconfigured by, this movement, and locates its early development in several different research and policy networks, which produced not one but several different forms of One Health. The chapter also examines how human–animal health relationships have inspired and shaped One Health, and how they are represented—in sometimes contradictory ways—in the texts and images produced by One Health researchers and advocates. It argues that in foregrounding the roles of animals as transmitters of diseases to humans, and as experimental models of human disease, One Health rebrands existing longstanding research agendas that are more concerned with the health of humans than that of animals.","Cassidy, Angela",Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124078/,166
27011,From Anthrax to Zika: memoirs of a disease detective,2017-02-23,"Whether gender influences the outcome of severe sepsis remains a matter of debate. Because many confounding variables may affect observed associations between gender and mortality, high-quality statistical analyses are essential to carefully adjust the two groups of patients. About 55% to 65% of patients with sepsis have chronic co-morbidities associated with immune dysfunction (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, and alcohol abuse), which increase the susceptibility to sepsis [1]. Genetic polymorphisms that affect the susceptibility to infection and/or the severity of the systemic response to infection [2] may lead to variability among individuals and between males and females [3]. Access to healthcare, another determinant of the incidence and outcome of sepsis, varies according to age, ethnic group, and gender, although a recent study conducted in the USA found only relatively small quality-of-care differences between males and females or across income groups compared to the gap for each subgroup between observed and desirable quality of health care [4]. Here, we review the data on the existence of, and reasons for, associations between gender and outcome of severe sepsis (Fig. 1).","Adrie, C.; Azoulay, E.; Timsit, J. -F.",Intensive Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124082/,166

This research has provided significant new insight into the functions and activities of the coronavirus replicase–transcriptase complex, a multiprotein complex that directs coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis to replicate and transcribe the large coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of ~30 kb. In this chapter, we review our current understanding of the expression and functions of key replicative enzymes, such as RNA polymerases, helicase, ribonucleases, ribose-2′-O-methyltransferase and other replicase gene-encoded proteins involved in genome expression, virus–host interactions and other processes. Collectively, these recent studies reveal fascinating details of an enzymatic machinery that, in the RNA virus world, is unparalleled in terms of the number and nature of virally encoded activities involved in virus replication and host interactions.","Ulferts, Rachel; Imbert, Isabelle; Canard, Bruno; Ziebuhr, John",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124140/,166

Mucins are produced in partby the conjunctial goblet cells, and are complemented by non-globet secretions. This review focuses on secreted ocular mucins. They are present in the tear film, probably both in gel and soluble form, and play a role in lubrication and ocular defense. It is apparent that mucins are highly adapted to their functions. State of the art techniques for mucin purification and analysis are presented. Density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and agarose gel electrophoresis are discussed, together with methods of oliogosaccharide analysis. Reagents for the detection of mucin are considered in conjunction with these methods, which we have employed in the analysis of human and canine ocular mucins. The general structure of mucins is reviewed. The biosyntheas and glycosylation of ocular mucins are not yet fully understood, and are discussed in relation to currently established concepts. The impaact of disease on the nature and secretion of mucins is considered, as well as the physiological and pathological significance of mucus degradation.","Corfield, Anthony P.; Carrington, Stephen D.; Hicks, Sally J.; Berry, Monica; Ellingham, Roger",Prog Retin Eye Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128873/,166

Redundancy properties are also used by procedures which simplify formulas in conjunctive normal form by removing redundant clauses. Revisiting the covered clause elimination procedure, we prove the correctness of an explicit algorithm for identifying covered clauses, as it has previously only been implicitly described. While other elimination procedures produce redundancy witnesses for compactly reconstructing solutions to the original formula, we prove that witnesses for covered clauses are hard to compute. Further, we show that not all covered clauses are propagation redundant, the most general, polynomially-verifiable standard redundancy property. Finally, we close a gap in the literature by demonstrating the complexity of clause redundancy itself.","Barnett, Lee A.; Cerna, David; Biere, Armin",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324129/,166

This paper introduces fault, a Python embedded hardware verification language that aims to empower design teams to realize the full potential of generators.","Truong, Lenny; Herbst, Steven; Setaluri, Rajsekhar; Mann, Makai; Daly, Ross; Zhang, Keyi; Donovick, Caleb; Stanley, Daniel; Horowitz, Mark; Barrett, Clark; Hanrahan, Pat",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363199/,166
36972,"Natural history, prognostic factors and patient perceived response to treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria",2020-07-15,"Neural networks provide quick approximations to complex functions, and have been increasingly used in perception as well as control tasks. For use in mission-critical and safety-critical applications, however, it is important to be able to analyze what a neural network can and cannot do. For feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation functions, although exact analysis is NP-complete, recently-proposed verification methods can sometimes succeed. The main practical problem with neural network verification is excessive analysis runtime. Even on small networks, tools that are theoretically complete can sometimes run for days without producing a result. In this paper, we work to address the runtime problem by improving upon a recently-proposed geometric path enumeration method. Through a series of optimizations, several of which are new algorithmic improvements, we demonstrate significant speed improvement of exact analysis on the well-studied ACAS Xu benchmarks, sometimes hundreds of times faster than the original implementation. On more difficult benchmark instances, our optimized approach is often the fastest, even outperforming inexact methods that leverage overapproximation and refinement.","Bak, Stanley; Tran, Hoang-Dung; Hobbs, Kerianne; Johnson, Taylor T.",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363204/,166

We aimed to assess the validity of computed tomography (CT) quantitative and qualitative analysis in COVID-19 pneumonia and how it can predict the disease severity on admission. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled in our study, 98 (81.7%) of them were males, and 22 (18.3%) of them were females with a mean age of 52.63 ± 12.79 years old, ranging from 28 to 83 years. Groups B and C showed significantly increased number of involved lung segments and lobes, frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram. The total lung severity score and the total score for crazy-paving and consolidation are used as severity indicators in the qualitative method and could differentiate between groups B and C and group A (90.9% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, and 93.2% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, respectively), while the quantitative indicators could differentiate these three groups. Using the quantitative CT indicators, the validity to differentiate different groups showed 84.1% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity for the opacity score, and 90.9% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity for the percentage of high opacity. CONCLUSION: Advances in CT COVID-19 pneumonia assessment provide an accurate and rapid tool for severity assessment, helping for decision-making notably for the critical cases.","Gouda, Walaa; Yasin, Rabab",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7516225/,166

Beginning in July, 2020, we explored the impact of the pandemic on disruptions to care and older adults’ use of telehealth. Preliminary results from 53 older adults aged 66 to 93 (mean: 72.6) found that many older adults experienced disruptions in their care, ranging from 30-50% depending on the type of care. The most commonly disrupted care types were mental health and rehabilitation care (occupational, physical, or speech therapy), with 50% of older adults reporting disruptions to mental health and 50% to rehabilitation care. The most common reason for the disruptions was closed care providers’ offices. Similar results were found for primary care (46% reporting disruptions), dental care (44%), and vision care (30%), with between 62-71% citing closed offices as a reason for the disruption. The use of telehealth among the sample was high (44%), and the majority (83%) of these older adults reported never having used it previously. All who used it reported being very or somewhat comfortable with the technology, and 83% said they would use it again even if in-person care was available. These findings suggest the pandemic has had a significant impact on older adults’ care and that the expansion of telehealth could be increase access to care during and after the pandemic.","Prusaczyk, Beth; Carpenter, Brian; Morrow-Howell, Nancy; Lenze, Eric",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742142/,166

44034,540. Prolonged Viral Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 In Solid Organ Transplant Recipients,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for all adults over the age of 65 to reduce S. pneumoniae pneumonia. Our institution follows a standing order for nurses to vaccinate adults who meet the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) criteria. During the COVID-19 pandemic surge, the pneumococcal vaccine and influenza vaccine nurse-driven protocol was determined to be non-essential on 3/23, and 4/2 respectively. Our study aims to characterize missed vaccine opportunities among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during this surge. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to an inner-city hospital and discharged alive between the dates of 3/23 and 4/21/2020. Patients under the age of 65 were excluded. Data collected included patient age, gender, race, length of stay, co-morbidities that would indicate a vaccine opportunity, prior vaccinations, and whether there was a vaccine opportunity for PPSV23 and influenza defined by ACIP indications. Vaccine history was evaluated using the electronic medical record (EMR) and Michigan Care Improvement Registry. If there was a vaccine opportunity, we documented whether a vaccine was given before hospital discharge. Total numbers of vaccines given for time periods in 2019 and 2020 were collected from EMR for comparison. RESULTS: 100 patients over the age of 65 were included. The average age was 72.8 years, and most patients (66%) were of African American race. The mean length of stay was five days. 52 patients were identified as having an opportunity to receive PPSV23, and 0 patients received the vaccine. 67.3% had more than one indication for PPSV23. 37 patients were eligible to receive influenza vaccine, and 0 received the vaccine. Results are summarized in table 1. Figures 1 and 2 display the number of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines given per EMR, respectively. Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] Table 1 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Due to prioritization of potential staffing shortages and clustering nursing care, an opportunity to vaccinate patients with pneumococcal and influenza vaccines was missed.

44047,443. Comparison of Clinical Characteristics of Endemic vs. SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Infection in Patients Admitted to a Community Teaching Hospital,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is limited, making it difficult to estimate the true prevalence of disease and control the spread of new cases. Therefore, finding other ways to diagnose new cases of Covid-19 early is essential for preventing further spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other people in the community and prevent further outbreaks from occurring. METHODS: CovidIQ is a confidential and secure text messaging platform that works by collecting participants’ self-reported symptoms. Upon agreeing to participate, users are asked some basic demographic questions including gender, age range, ethnic background, and zip code. Participants are then queried via text message on a weekly or biweekly basis as to what symptoms they are experiencing: none, temperature >99.6F, cough, shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, diarrhea, body ache, sore throat, and/or chills. The symptoms are further broken down into major and minor criteria, allowing presumptive cases to be identified with more accuracy. The major criteria include elevated body temperature, cough, and shortness of breath. If a participant has any 2 major criteria, 1 major or 2 minor, or 3 minor criteria, they are considered a presumptive positive case. While CovidIQ cannot be used to diagnose individuals, the combined results from many individuals show real-time changes in rates of infection for entire counties. Not all people who develop Covid-19 will need hospitalization. They may remain out in the community unaware of the risk they pose to others. And, because the official count of confirmed cases is delayed by 2–4 weeks from the time of actual infection, CovidIQ can sound the alarm much earlier when rates of infection begin to spike. Advanced warning can help communities and individuals make informed decisions about how they should conduct themselves. RESULTS: CovidIQ identified the spike in COVID-19 cases in Jacksonville/Duval County, Florida a full two weeks before it was reported by the Florida Department of Health and Johns Hopkins University. Prevalence of Suspected COVID-19 Cases Through the Use of the CovidIQ Platform in Relation to Dates of OfficiallyReported Cases, Duval County, FL [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: CovidIQ is a novel tool developed to augment the public health response to this ongoing crisis by informing the public sector of potential new hot spots before areas experience a surge as compared to the current reporting structure.

44136,1503. Risk Factors for Contracting Infection with SARS-CoV-2: a Prospective Case-control Study,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to describe the clinical course, risk factors and outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19 around the globe comparing cancer to non-cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 confirmed cases through an international multicenter collaboration including 17 centers around the world including the United States of America, Brazil, Europe, Far East, Middle East and Australia from January to date. We evaluated the patients’ clinical characteristics, clinical course of the disease, hospitalization and outcome. Death was considered to be COVID-associated if it occurred within 30 days from the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Preliminary data on 571 patients included 186 cancer patients and 385 non-cancer patients. Cancer patients were more likely to have COPD and received steroids but were less likely to have COVID-related symptoms compared to non-cancer patients (84% vs 97%, p< 0.0001). The rate of pneumonia with hypoxia, non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation were similar in both groups. Despite the fact that hospital admissions were significantly higher in non-cancer patients (70% vs 56%, p< 0.001), promising antiviral and immune-related therapy including remdesivir, convalescent plasma and immunomodulators were more commonly used in cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients (P=0.04). Cancer patients had a higher COVID-associated mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (20% vs 11%, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that cancer patients received more frequent antiviral and immune-related therapy, the mortality rate among cancer patients was significantly higher than non-cancer patients.

We evaluate the utility of commonly-used investigational agents combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). METHODS: This multicenter observational cohort study included patients admitted with COVID-19 between March - May 2020 in Detroit, Michigan who received at least 2 doses of HCQ. Our primary outcome was the change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from presentation to day 5 of HCQ therapy with a secondary outcome of in-hospital mortality. Data collected included demographics, Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI), daily SOFA score, laboratory data and COVID-directed therapies. Multiple linear regressions were performed to control for potential confounders between different therapies and change in SOFA score. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-five patients receiving HCQ were included. Patients were 62 ± 14.8 years of age, male (54%) and African-American (82%) with a mean CCI of 1.7 ± 1.9. In our cohort, 32% were admitted to the intensive care unit and 35% expired. Therapies received by more than 20% of patients in addition to HCQ included azithromycin (80%), zinc (76%) and vitamin D (29%). In our unadjusted analysis, a significant improvement in SOFA score was observed with zinc (0.76) while no significant change was observed with azithromycin (-0.46) or vitamin D (0.05). However, there was no significant change in SOFA score after adjusting for confounders for azithromycin, zinc and vitamin D. No difference in mortality was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: Overall, no benefit in end-organ damage or mortality was observed with the addition of azithromycin, zinc or vitamin D to HCQ. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation.

44897,Early and specific targeted mass spectrometry-based identification of bacteria in endotracheal aspirates of patients suspected with ventilator-associated pneumonia,2021-01-23,"Over the past twenty years, the field of “gender and politics” has flourished in European political science. An example of this is the growing number of “gender and politics” scholars and the increased attention paid to gender perspectives in the study of the political. Against this backdrop, we take stock of how the “gender and politics” field has developed over the years. We argue that the field has now entered a stage of “consolidation”, which is reflected in the growth, diversification and professionalization of the subfield, as well as in the increased disciplinary recognition from major gatekeepers in political science. But while consolidation comes with specific opportunities, it also presents some key challenges. We identify five such challenges: (1) the potential fragmentation of the field; (2) persisting hierarchies in knowledge production; (3) the continued marginalization of feminist political analysis in “mainstream” political science; (4) the changing link between academia and society; and (5) growing opposition to gender studies in parts of Europe and beyond. We argue that both the “gender and politics” field and political science in general should address these challenges in order to become a truly inclusive discipline.","Ahrens, Petra; Erzeel, Silvia; Evans, Elizabeth; Kantola, Johanna; Kuhar, Roman; Lombardo, Emanuela",Eur Polit Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817964/,166
52090,Measles-associated pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient: Persistent shortcomings in vaccination guidelines,2021-01-18,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus outbreak has had significant impact on medical students worldwide. SMILE is a free online access medical education (FOAMed) platform. SMILE delivered 200 lectures during lockdown with up to 1400 students per session from both UK medical schools and 33 abroad. Here we discuss student perceptions to SMILE during lockdown METHOD: An electronic survey was used to collect information from students who had utilised the platform during lockdown. This examined access to learning, impact on their mental health during lockdown and the differences between FOAMed and more traditional based campus lecture based learning. RESULTS: 1306 students responded to the anonymous survey with 94% of students stating SMILE had been “extremely useful” or “very useful” at supplementing learning during covid. 71% of students stated lockdown had affected their stress levels and 44% reported deterioration in their mental health. >80% felt SMILE improved stress levels by adding structure and providing motivation. Students attended 4.3hours/week of university teaching, vs 7.9hours/week by SMILE.

Here we provide an assessment of the mitigation potential of assisted gene flow in 46 populations of the widespread boreal conifer Picea mariana, grown in two 42-year-old common garden experiments and established in contrasting Canadian boreal regions. We use a dendroecological approach taking into account phylogeographic structure to retrospectively analyse population phenotypic variability in annual aboveground net primary productivity (NPP). We compare population NPP phenotypes to detect signals of adaptive variation and/or the presence of phenotypic clines across tree lifespans, and assess genotype-by-environment interactions by evaluating climate and NPP relationships. Our results show a positive effect of assisted gene flow for a period of approximately 15 years following planting, after which there was little to no effect. Although not long lasting, well-informed assisted gene flow could accelerate the transition from carbon source to carbon sink after disturbance.","Girardin, Martin P; Isabel, Nathalie; Guo, Xiao Jing; Lamothe, Manuel; Duchesne, Isabelle; Lenz, Patrick",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21222-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608515/,166

Usually, after viral pneumonia were clinical cured, the pulmonary lesions of majority patients will gradually be absorbed to complete dissipation, very few severe patients may retain pulmonary interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (1-3). In this case, we described one unique COVID-19 patient, the symptoms were: dry cough, fatigue, poor appetite and subjective fever, moreover, the patient was a non-smoker, had no pulmonary bullous, no history of tuberculosis, and also no hypertension or diabetes. The patient received antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, recombinant human interferon-α2a, vitamin C and oxygen inhalation. After two weeks of treatment and observation, the patient was clinical cured and discharged. However, two days later, the patient had a sudden chest stuffiness, CT images indicted: his lung didn't heal like others, but developed a large pulmonary cavity in the lower lobe of right lung. In hospital, the patient showed no symptoms of infection for another 14 days, and the pulmonary cavity remain unchanged.

We aim to explore the phenomenology of burnout and CFS in a historical context as this may provide some insight into the links and relationship between these conditions. METHOD A narrative review based on literature in the fields of history, social science and medicine. RESULTS The origins of CFS lie within medicine, whereas burnout developed in a psychological setting. As well as symptoms, burnout and CFS also share similar themes such as an overload process triggering illness onset, the need for restoration of depleted energy, external causal attributions and the characteristics of people suffering from these illnesses. However, these themes are expressed in either psychological or medical terms according to the historical background. CONCLUSION Despite their similarities, there have been few direct comparisons of the two concepts. Culture, illness perceptions and accountability are important issues in both conditions and could contribute to their differences. Comparing burnout and CFS within one sample frame, thus looking beyond the psychology/medicine divide, could be a useful first step towards understanding their relationship.","Leone, Stephanie S; Wessely, Simon; Huibers, Marcus J H; Knottnerus, J André; Kant, Ijmert",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870440903494191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20437294/,166
119985,Characterization of Mycobacterium chimaera in a heater-cooler unit in Latvia.,2020-10-12,"INTRODUCTION Brain atrophy (BA) is often found in neuroimaging of hemodialysis patients, representing parenchymal cerebral damage. Likely contributing factors to BA are age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors of atherosclerosis that are also common among hemodialysis patients. BA may also occur due to focal ischemia and hypoperfusion during hemodialysis. However, data on optimal blood pressure (BP) in these patients are limited. The goal of this study was to determine whether the prevalence and severity of BA would be higher among hemodialysis patients with lower BP. METHODS A blinded neuroradiologist graded BA of all hemodialysis patients who underwent brain non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) from 2015 to 2017 in our institution. Age- and sex-matched patients with normal kidney function who underwent brain CT during the same period and technique served as the control group. RESULTS A total of 280 patients were included in this retrospective study, with average BP of 140/70 mmHg among hemodialysis patients and 142/75 mmHg in the control group. BA was more common in dialysis patients and its severity increased with age and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. We observed a significant negative correlation between diastolic BP (DBP) at dialysis initiation and BA. Average DBP decreased with increasing severity of BA. These findings were observed in both hemodialysis and non-CKD patients. CONCLUSION BA was associated with lower DBP, which may induce cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia. This finding should discourage over-treatment of hypertension among hemodialysis patients. This article is protected by copyright.

In cases where several determinants are important in the wave function expansion, i.e., we have to deal with nondynamic correlation effects, a multi-reference version of the coupled-cluster method is required. The multi-reference coupled-cluster approaches are based on the effective Hamiltonian formulation providing a two-step procedure, in which dynamic correlation effects can be efficiently evaluated by the wave operator, while nondynamic correlation contributions are given by diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian in the final step. There are two classical multi-reference coupled-cluster formulations. In this paper, the focus is on the so-called Fock-space coupled-cluster method in its basic version with one- and two-particle operators in the exponent. Computational schemes using this truncation of the cluster operator have been successfully applied in calculations in one- and two-valence sectors of the Fock space. In this paper, we show that the approach can be easily extended and effectively employed in the three-valence sector calculations.","Meissner, Leszek; Musiał, Monika; Kucharski, Stanisław A",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0014941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962357/,166
134376,Preventing medical-device-borne outbreaks: High-level disinfection policy for duodenoscopes.,2020-12-14,"OBJECTIVES To conduct a systematic review of mortality and factors independently associated with mortality in older patients admitted to ICU. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and references of included studies. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently selected studies conducted after 2000 evaluating mortality of older patients (≥ 75 yr old) admitted to ICU. DATA EXTRACTION General characteristics, mortality rate, and factors independently associated with mortality were extracted independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were solved by discussion within the study team. DATA SYNTHESIS Because of expected heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was performed. We selected 129 studies (median year of publication, 2015; interquartile range, 2012-2017) including 17 based on a national registry. Most were conducted in Europe and North America. The median number of included patients was 278 (interquartile range, 124-1,068). ICU and in-hospital mortality were most frequently reported with considerable heterogeneity observed across studies that was not explained by study design or location. ICU mortality ranged from 1% to 51%, in-hospital mortality from 10% to 76%, 6-month mortality from 21% to 58%, and 1-year mortality from 33% to 72%. Factors addressed in multivariate analyses were also heterogeneous across studies. Severity score, diagnosis at admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were the independent factors most frequently associated with ICU mortality, whereas age, comorbidities, functional status, and severity score at admission were the independent factors most frequently associated with 3- 6 and 12 months mortality. CONCLUSIONS In this systematic review of older patients admitted to intensive care, we have documented substantial variation in short- and long-term mortality as well as in prognostic factors evaluated. To better understand this variation, we need consistent, high-quality data on pre-ICU conditions, ICU physiology and treatments, structure and system factors, and post-ICU trajectories. These data could inform geriatric care bundles as well as a core data set of prognostic factors to inform patient-centered decision-making.","Vallet, Helene; Schwarz, Gabriele Leonie; Flaatten, Hans; de Lange, Dylan W; Guidet, Bertrand; Dechartres, Agnes",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332816/,166
136909,Respiratory viruses on personal protective equipment and bodies of healthcare workers.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Bilastine is a non-sedating second-generation H(1) antihistamine with proven efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and urticaria. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of bilastine in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). METHODS In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients with symptomatic PAR (n = 650) from Argentina, Europe, and South Africa received bilastine 20 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean area under the curve (AUC) of reflective total 6-symptom scores (rT6SS) from baseline visit to day 28 (D28). Secondary outcome measures included mean AUC of instantaneous total 6-symptom scores (iT6SS), and mean AUCs of reflective and instantaneous total 4-nasal symptom scores (T4NSS) and total 2-ocular symptom scores (T2OSS) from baseline to D28. An open-label extension phase evaluated the safety of bilastine 20 mg administered to patients (n = 513) for one year. RESULTS In the overall population no significant differences in efficacy outcomes were found between active treatments and placebo. On account of the high placebo response in South Africa, a post-hoc analysis was conducted. This analysis demonstrated that statistically significant differences existed between active treatments and placebo in the mean AUC of rT6SS (p < 0.05) and T4NSS (p < 0.02), respectively, from baseline to D28 visit for the intent-to-treat population in patients from Europe and Argentina, whereas the difference was not statistically significant in South Africa. Whether this is related to differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics of South African patients (they had PAR for longer and reported more severe symptoms) and/or the disease management process compared with their European and Argentinean counterparts warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS A post-hoc analysis indicated that bilastine and cetirizine were similarly effective and more effective than placebo during a 4-week treatment period in patients with PAR. In addition, bilastine was shown to be safe and well-tolerated over a 1-year treatment period.

138406,Transmission and prevention of acute viral respiratory tract infections in hospitals.,2019,"OPINION STATEMENT The treatment of malignant gliomas has undergone a significant intensification during the past decade, and the interdisciplinary treatment team has learned that all treatment opportunities, including surgery and radiotherapy (RT), also have a central role in recurrent gliomas. Throughout the decades, re-irradiation (re-RT) has achieved a prominent place in the treatment of recurrent gliomas. A solid body of evidence supports the safety and efficacy of re-RT, especially when modern techniques are used, and justifies the early use of this regimen, especially in the case when macroscopic disease is present. Additionally, a second adjuvant re-RT to the resection cavity is currently being investigated by several investigators and seems to offer promising results. Although advanced RT technologies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) have become available in many centers, re-RT should continue to be kept in experienced hands so that they can select the optimal regimen, the ideal treatment volume, and the appropriate techniques from their tool-boxes. Concomitant or adjuvant use of systemic treatment options should also strongly be taken into consideration, especially because temozolomide (TMZ), cyclohexyl-nitroso-urea (CCNU), and bevacizumab have shown a good safety profile; they should be considered, if available. Nonetheless, the selection of patients for re-RT remains crucial. Single factors, such as patient age or the progression-free interval (PFI), fall too short. Therefore, powerful prognostic scores have been generated and validated, and these scores should be used for patient selection and counseling.","Straube, Christoph; Kessel, Kerstin A; Zimmer, Claus; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike; Schlegel, Jürgen; Gempt, Jens; Meyer, Bernhard; Combs, Stephanie E",Current treatment options in oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11864-019-0673-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324990/,166

The reported transformation features a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation and a Rh-catalyzed enantioselective 1,4-conjugate addition, effectively converting simple allyl enol carbonate precursors into enantioenriched cyclic ketones with two remote stereocenters. Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to > 99% ee, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst-control, this one-pot reaction is enantio- and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers starting from the same set of starting materials.","Masson-Makdissi, Jeanne; Prieto, Liher; Abel-Snape, Xavier; Lautens, Mark",Angewandte Chemie,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202105800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046992/,166

METHODS This retrospective study included 330 patients suspected of having COVID-19 from March 15 to April 16, 2020. We examined 306 patients upon initial presentation using both CT and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR). The diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using rRT-PCR as a reference. Clinical and laboratory data, CT characteristics, and lesion distribution were assessed for patients with a confirmed diagnosis via rRT-PCR. RESULTS A total of 250 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory findings included myalgia or fatigue (76%), fever (64.8%), dry cough (60.8%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (86.4%), procalcitonin (62%), and D-dimer (58.2%), increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (54.8%), and lymphopenia (34%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the initial CT scan were 90.4% (95% IC, 86%-93%), 64.2% (95% IC, 50%-76%), 91.8% (95% IC, 88%-94%), and 60% (95% IC, 49%-69%), respectively. The percentage of patients diagnosed on the initial rRT-PCR test was 51.6% (n=129). Most frequent CT characteristics of COVID-19 in the subgroup of rRT-PCR-positive patients were multiple lesion (97.4%, n=220), followed by bilateral involvement (88.5%, n=200), peripheral distribution (74.3%, n=168), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (69.2%, n=157), subpleural curvilinear opacity (41.6%, n=104), and mixed GGOs (27.6%, n=67). CONCLUSION rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. For this reason, typical CT findings for COVID-19 should be known especially by radiologists. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.","Aslan, Serdar; Bekçi, Tumay; Çakır, İsmet Miraç; Ekiz, Mehmet; Yavuz, İlknur; Şahin, Ahmet Melih",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2020.20350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876571/,166
164971,Subclinical pericarditis long after SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report,2021,"Background: The feasibility and the safety of the thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (TLE) was proved by several prominent academic institutions. This technique is technically challenging and requires advanced laparoscopic and thora-coscopic skills. With experience gained from open esophagectomy as well as laparoscopic surgery, thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy was introduced in our hospital in 2016. We report our experience in performing TLE. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized, observational study in Hue central hospital, which is one of the biggest hospitals in Vietnam, from January 2016 to January 2021. This study included the esophageal cancers that were diagnosed by endoscopy and confirmed by pathology. Esophageal cancer with cT1b-3N0M0 using chest CT, ultrasound-endoscopy, abdominal CT was indicated for resection initially, while esophageal cancer with cT4N0M0 or T3N(+)M0 was indicated for resection after neoadjuvant therapy. The patients had the ASA I-III. All the data were analyzed statistically using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Results: We used the TLE technique to operate for 52 consecutive patients. All patients were in a semi-prone position. The male/female ratio was 47/5. The mean age was 57.3±6.3 years, and the mean BMI was 20.5±3.3 kg/m2. The preoperative location of the esophageal cancer was the upper one-third in two (3.8%), the middle one-third in 24 (46.1%), and the lower one-third in 26 (50.0%). The majority of our patients had cTNM stage II (30, 57.7%). Only seven patients (13.7%) had cTNM stage I, whereas 15 patients (31.4%) had cTNM stage III. Of the 45 patients (stage II and III) who needed the neoadjuvant therapy, 30 (57.7%) received short-courses, 15 (28.8%) received long-course of chemotherapy. For 24 patients (46.1%), the histopathology was squamous cell carcinoma. The remaining 28 patients (53.8%) had adenocarcinomas. The operative time was 311.2±45.9 minutes. We did not record either conversion or intraoperative events. The mortality and morbidity rates were 1.9% and 23%, respectively. The hospital stay was 15.6±7.2 days. The median follow-up time was 22±1.5 months, and the overall survival rate at one year was 84.7%. Conclusion: Thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with the patient in a semi-prone position is safe and effective, including the lower morbidity rate and the shorter operative time while preserving the long-term outcomes. © 2021, PJD Publications Ltd.

Trauma related grave injuries cause exsanguination and lead to death. 50% of deaths especially in the armed forces are due to trauma injuries. Restricting blood loss usually requires the presence of first responders, which is not feasible in certain cases. Hemostatic nanoparticles have been developed to tackle these kinds of situations to help achieve efficient blood coagulation. Hemostatic nanoparticles were administered into trauma induced porcine animals (pigs) to observe impact on the cytokine and blood loss experienced by them. In this paper we present temporal models to study the impact of the hemostatic nanoparticles and provide snapshots about the trend in cytokines and blood loss in the porcine data to study their progression over time. We utilized Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, Similarity based Merging and clustering to evaluate the impact of the different hemostatic nanoparticles administered. In some cases the fluctuations in the cytokines may be too small. So in addition we highlight situations where temporal modelling that produces a smoothed time series may not be useful as it may remove out the noise and miss the overall fluctuations resulting from the nanoparticles. Our results indicate certain nanoparticles stand out and lead to novel hypothesis formation.","Kulkarni, Chhaya; Maisha, Nuzhat; Schaub, Leasha J; Glaser, Jacob; Lavik, Erin; Janeja, Vandana P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.445617,166

METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of sick visits in an academic primary care clinic from March-August 2019 and 2020 and recorded demographics and visit diagnoses. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the two time periods. RESULTS Patient age, gender, and insurance type were similar across years. In 2020, there were 1,868 sick visits (247 telehealth, 4%-36% of monthly visits) compared to 4,007 (0 telehealth) in 2019. The proportion of infectious diagnoses decreased (35% vs 48%); non-infectious diagnoses increased, including dermatological (25% vs 19%) and genitourinary/reproductive (9% vs. 6%) diagnoses. Conclusion: Similar to pediatric emergency departments, we found decreased primary care sick visits. Telehealth increased in 2020 and varied with COVID-19 community prevalence. Visits for contagious illnesses decreased in 2020, likely related to mitigation measures.","Kelly, Jessica M; Watts, Delma-Jean; Heinly, Allison; Chu, Tzu-Chun; Golova, Natalia; Kamath, Shuba; Riese, Alison",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582512/,166
188132,No room at the inn: fever and respiratory illness precautions and the placement of patients within an Ontario acute care institution.,2007,"Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein H (gH) is one of the four virion envelope proteins which are required for virus entry and for cell-cell fusion in a transient system. In this report, the role of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in membrane fusion was investigated by generating chimeric constructs in which these regions were replaced with analogous domains from other molecules and by introducing amino acid substitutions within the membrane-spanning sequence. gH molecules which lack the authentic transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail were unable to mediate cell-cell fusion when coexpressed with gB, gD, and gL and were unable to rescue the infectivity of a gH-null virus as efficiently as a wild-type gH molecule. Many amino acid substitutions of specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain also affected cell-cell fusion, in particular, those introduced at a conserved glycine residue. Some gH mutants that were impaired in cell-cell fusion were nevertheless able to rescue the infectivity of a gH-negative virus, but these pseudotyped virions entered cells more slowly than wild-type virions. These results indicate that the fusion event mediated by the coexpression of gHL, gB, and gD in cells shares common features with the fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane, they point to a likely role for the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in both processes, and they suggest that a conserved glycine residue in the membrane-spanning sequence is crucial for efficient fusion.","Harman, Andrew; Browne, Helena; Minson, Tony",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12368313/,166

Until recently, the evidence has been limited to only a few small randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVE We present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of mesh prophylaxis on rates of parastomal hernia. We examine ongoing and unpublished trials via online registries and propose recommendations for future research. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to March 2016 for published randomized controlled trials. Sixteen international trial registries were inspected for ongoing and unpublished trials. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials comparing mesh versus no mesh on the incidence of parastomal hernia after colostomy or ileostomy formation were selected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was rate of parastomal hernia at least 12 months after stoma formation. Secondary outcomes included rates of stoma-related complications. RESULTS Of 3005 studies identified, 7 randomized controlled trials (432 patients) were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. All were at high risk of bias. Mesh reduced the incidence of clinically detected parastomal hernia (10.8% vs 32.4%; p = 0.001) (risk ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.65; I = 39%) and the rate of radiologically detected parastomal hernia (34.6% vs 55.3%; p = 0.01) (risk ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89; I = 44%). No increase in the incidence of stoma-related complications was observed with the use of prophylactic mesh. Results from ongoing and unpublished randomized controlled trials are expected, but few will report on alternative mesh types or surgical techniques. LIMITATIONS Heterogeneity of interventions, small patient populations, and a high risk of bias seen in all studies implicate cautious interpretation of the results. CONCLUSION Mesh prophylaxis at the time of stoma formation appears safe and effective in preventing parastomal hernia; however, limitations of the primary evidence justify larger, more rigorous randomized controlled trials.","Chapman, Stephen J; Wood, Benjamin; Drake, Thomas M; Young, Neville; Jayne, David G",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27926564/,166
189251,[Two genotypes of Canine coronavirus simultaneously detected in the fecal samples of healthy foxes and raccoon dogs].,2005,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method in which reagents react rapidly and efficiently, with a high specificity, under isothermal conditions. We used a LAMP assay for the detection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The virus specificities of primers were confirmed by using 50 HSV-1, 50 HSV-2, and 8 VZV strains. The assay was performed for 45 min at 65 degrees C. The LAMP assay had a 10-fold higher sensitivity than a PCR assay. An analysis of nucleotide sequence variations in the target and primer regions used for the LAMP assay indicated that 3 of 50 HSV-1 strains had single nucleotide polymorphisms. No HSV-2 or VZV strains had nucleotide polymorphisms. Regardless of the sequence variation, there were no differences in sensitivity with the HSV-1-specific LAMP assay. To evaluate the application of the LAMP assay for clinical diagnosis, we tested clinical samples from 40 genital herpes patients and 20 ocular herpes patients. With the LAMP assay, 41 samples with DNA extraction and 26 direct samples without DNA extraction were identified as positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2, although 37 samples with DNA extraction and just one without DNA extraction were positive by a PCR assay. Thus, the LAMP assay was less influenced than the PCR assay by the presence of inhibitory substances in clinical samples. These observations indicate that the LAMP assay is very useful for the diagnosis of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV infections.","Kaneko, Hisatoshi; Iida, Tomohiro; Aoki, Koki; Ohno, Shigeaki; Suzutani, Tatsuo",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000450/,166

195638,A prediction rule for clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2005,"Viral respiratory infections can predispose to the development of asthma by mechanisms that are presently undetermined. Using a murine model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, acute infection is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness as well as enhanced responses to subsequent sensitization to allergen. We demonstrate that acute viral infection results in increased airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine and pulmonary neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation. This response is associated with predominant production of Th-1-type cytokines in peribronchial lymph node cells in vitro. Mice sensitized to ovalbumin via the airways after RSV infection developed increased airway responsiveness to methacholine and pulmonary eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, associated with the predominant production of Th-2-type cytokines. Treatment of the mice with anti-IL-5 antibody abolished airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic but not neutrophilic inflammation in both acutely infected mice and mice sensitized after infection. We conclude that RSV infection results in airway hyperresponsiveness in the acute phase and leads to changes in immune function that can enhance the effects of airway sensitization to antigen after infection. In both situations, airway hyperresponsiveness is closely associated with pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation. This model provides a means for further analyzing the influence of viral respiratory infections on airway sensitization and the development of altered airway responsiveness.","Schwarze, J; Hamelmann, E; Bradley, K L; Takeda, K; Gelfand, E W",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9202075/,166

The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of individuals aged 64 or older during the first COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in a convenience sample of 19 older adults (aged 64+) living at home in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland during the first COVID-19 lockdown, between April and May 2020. Participants varied in terms of gender, education, age, nationality, and socio-economic status. We conducted semi-structured phone interviews to elicit emotions, expectations and hopes in relation to the present situation, and the post-pandemic world. We inquired about opinions on the enforced public health measures, including those specifically targeting older adults, and on the societal portrayal of older adults. FINDINGS: We found that the epidemic and the public health response to it had both generated a variety of resentments and a high degree of ambivalence at the individual, micro-, meso- and macro-social levels. We also found that labelling older adults as an at-risk sub-population inevitably contributed to public and self-stigmatization. DISCUSSION: We conducted an in-depth qualitative investigation of lived experiences of older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in one of the most gravely hit region in Europe. Our findings on the complexity of unintended, detrimental consequences of outbreak responses on older adults have relevant implications for local adaptions of public health measures, and suggest that public health authorities should engage vulnerable sub-populations and promote bi-directional communication to inform and support communities.","Falvo, Ilaria; Zufferey, Maria Caiata; Albanese, Emiliano; Fadda, Marta",PLoS One,,166

207415,A Rosetta Stone for Understanding Infectious Drops and Aerosols,2020,"Background. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the world and in Russia remains the main event in 2020. A comprehensive study of the patterns of development and manifestations of the epidemic process of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is an urgent line of research. One of the important aspects of the fight against COVID-19 is the study of population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to assess seroprevalence and the formation process of post-infectious humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2, forecast the development of the epidemiological situation, identify the features of the epidemic process, as well as planning measures for specific and non-specific disease prevention. The aim of the research is to determine the level and structure of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 among the humans of the Irkutsk region during the COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and methods. As part of the Rospotrebnadzor project to assess population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the population of the Russian Federation, research is being conducted among the population of the Irkutsk region in the periods from 06/23/2020 to 07/19/2020 (stage 1), from 09/16/2020 to 09/25/2020 (Stage 2) and from 12/07/2020 to 12/18/2020 (stage 3), taking into account the reacted one recommended by the WHO. The content of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was determined by ELISA using a set of tests for human serum or plasma for specific immunoglobulins of class G to the nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus produced by FBUN GNCPMiB Rospotrebnadzor (Obolensk). The results of a research of the humoral immunity of volunteers show that during the period of an epidemic rise in the incidence of COVID-19 in the Irkutsk region, a low level of seroprevalence was formed (stage 1 – 5.8 ± 0.5%, stage 2 – 12,1 ± 0,7%), and in conditions of a long-term maximum increase in the incidence rate ¬– 25,9±1,0% (stage 3). A significant proportion (stage 1 – 81,2±3,2%, stage 2 – 90.9 ±1,9%) of asymptomatic forms of infection characterize the high intensity of the latently developing epidemic process in the first two stages. High levels of IgG in reconvalescents of COVID-19 persisted for an average of 3 to 4.5 months. Conclusion. The results of assessing the population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population of the Irkutsk region indicate that the seroprevalence level at the 3rd stage of the research was 25.9%. After the disease, on average, 41.6% of persons did not detect antibodies. The results obtained should be taken into account when organizing preventive measures, including vaccination, and predicting morbidity. © 2021, Numikom. All rights reserved.","Balakhonov, S.

Also, we aim to evaluate breastfeeding rates predischarge and postdischarge. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from symptomatic and high-risk women in the delivery room. Mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were separated from the newborns. Newborns were screened within 48 hours of delivery, and anti-infectious guidelines were imparted to the mothers before discharge. Rescreening took place &#8805;14 days postdischarge. Data regarding SARS-CoV-2-positive household members and breastfeeding were obtained by follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: A total of 73 newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were born in Israel during the â¼3-month period under study. Overall, 55 participated in this study. All neonates tested negative for the virus postdelivery. A total 74.5% of the neonates were fed unpasteurized expressed breast milk during the postpartum separation until discharge. Eighty-nine percent of the neonates were discharged from the hospital after their mothers were instructed in anti-infection measures.

However, a quarter of women with pelvic pain is diagnosed with external genital endometriosis (EGE) during laparoscopy. A special group is represented by patients with PP that did not stop after the removal of endometrial foci. The mechanisms of the pathogenesis of the formation of pain syndrome are not completely explored yet. According to several authors, a significant role in the pathogenesis of pelvic pain recurrence after surgical treatment of EGE is played by active neuroangiogenesis, both in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. The aim of the study was to expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of pelvic pain that did not stop (recurrence) after surgical treatment of external genital endometriosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 2 stages. At the first stage (algological), data from B&B, NRS and VRS algological questionnaires, which were completed by patients with recurrent PP after surgical treatment of EGE, were analyzed (n = 130, aged 18-45 years old, average age 32.5 ± 7.6 years). All women were operated on for EGE no later than 3-6 months after assessing the patients by the algological questionnaires; they did not receive drug therapy after surgical treatment and sought medical attention for recurrent pelvic pain. Materials for the study of the endometrium were obtained by the pipelle biopsymethod. The control group was formed from a number of women with EGE without PP, who applied for surgical treatment of infertility (n = 30). RESULTS: The results of the study have shown that the basis of pathogenesis of pelvic pain recurrence in patients who did not receive medical therapy after surgical treatment of EGE is the activation of neuro-angiogenesis processes and reduction of apoptosis. The results show a statistically significant 1.6 times increasing expression of NGF in eutopic endometrium (57.9 ± 2.5 vs 35.3 ± 2.1% of patients with the silent form of the gene and its receptor NTRK1 1.8 times (2.78 ± 0.25 versus 1.56 ± 0.21.e. respectively). Conclusion: The pathogenesis of pelvic pain in patients who did not receive medical therapy after surgical treatment of endometriosis compared to no pain form of the disease is the activation of the processes of neurogenesis in the eutopic endometrium.","Radzinsky, Victor; Orazov, Mekan; Sharapova, Olga; Khamoshina, Marina",Gynecol Endocrinol,,166

(Special Issue: New coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) and the outbreak of the respiratory illness (COVID-19): part-VI.),2020,"OBJECTIVE: The recent COVID-19 outbreak has forced notable adjustments to surgical procedure preparation, including neurosurgical services. However, due to the uniqueness of the recent situation, neurosurgical centers, especially those located in low-resource settings, are facing several challenges such as a lack of coordination, poor equipment, and shortage of medical personnel. Therefore, several guidelines from local authorities and international neurosurgical bodies have been published to help clinicians manage their patients. In addition, the academic health system (AHS), which is an integrated system containing a medical institution, universities, and a teaching hospital, may play some role in the management of patients during COVID-19. The objective of this study was to describe how each hospital in the authors' network adjusted their neurosurgical practice and how the AHS of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) played its role in the adaptation process during the pandemic. METHODS: The authors gathered both local and national data about the number of COVID-19 infections from the government's database. To assess the contribution of the AHS to the efforts of each hospital to address the pandemic, questionnaires were given to 6 neurosurgeons, 1 resident, and 2 general surgeons about the management of neurosurgical cases during the pandemic in their hospitals. RESULTS: The data illustrate various strategies to manage neurosurgical cases by hospitals within the authors' networks. The hospitals were grouped into three categories based on the transmission risk in each region. Most of these hospitals stated that UGM AHS had a positive impact on the changes in their strategies. In the early phase of the outbreak, some hospitals faced a lack of coordination between hospitals and related stakeholders, inadequate amount of personal protective equipment (PPE), and unclear regulations. As the nation enters a new phase, almost all hospitals had performed routine screening tests, had a sufficient amount of PPE for the medical personnel, and followed both national and international guidelines in caring for their neurosurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of neurosurgical procedures during the outbreak has been a challenging task and a role of the AHS in improving patient care has been experienced by most hospitals in the authors' network. In the future, the authors expect to develop a better collaboration for the next possible pandemic.","Pramusinto, Handoyo; Tamba, Daniel Agriva; Subagio, Yoyok; Numberi, Tommy J; Pramujo, Bangun; Sinanu, Franklin L; Ariasthapuri, Gheanita; Bismantara, Haryo; Meliala, Andreasta",Neurosurg Focus,,166
225477,HIV-1 Infection Does Not Change Disease Course or Inflammatory Pattern of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients Presenting at a Large Urban Medical Center in New York City,2021,"Resumo: Introdução: A pandemia causada pelo novo coronavírus (Covid-19) promoveu mudanças em todo o mundo, gerando modificações na estrutura organizacional do ensino superior. A educação médica teve que suspender atividades presenciais e estágios práticos, e adotar a metodologia de ensino a distância e avaliações on-line para os discentes de Medicina. Objetivo: Discorrer sobre o impacto da pandemia na saúde mental dos universitários e na educação médica. Método: Trata-se de uma revisão de literatura realizada nas seguintes bases de dados: Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) e Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE). Utilizaram-se, na busca de artigos, os Descritores em Ciências da Saúde (DeCS): ""saúde mental"", ""pandemia"", ""educação superior"", ""estudantes"" e ""Covid-19"". Foram considerados estudos com seres humanos e estudos de literatura publicados de 2018 até o momento do levantamento de dados. Resultado: Nas bases de dados, encontraram-se 1.473 artigos que foram submetidos aos critérios de inclusão e exclusão. Desconsiderando a duplicidade em outras bases de dados, obtiveram-se 43 artigos, dos quais 31 foram utilizados nesta revisão de literatura. Tem-se um grande número de estudos experimentais sobre a educação superior que são úteis na disseminação de conhecimento e possibilidade de replicação. Os dados referentes à saúde mental dos estudantes universitários abordam aspectos sobre a presença de transtornos psiquiátricos relacionados à temática, como depressão, ansiedade, e estresse pós-traumático, a partir de testes de triagem diagnóstica, nas variações presencial e on-line. Conclusão: Como os estudantes de Medicina apresentam incertezas sobre o futuro de sua formação em decorrência dessas transformações, são submetidos a uma carga emocional que causa/deflagra danos à saúde mental deles.

226216,"Potential Simultaneous Inhibitors of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of corticosteroids therapy on the inflammatory response in a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient. METHODS: A 55-year old female patient with critical ill COVID-19 was admitted in Taizhou Hospital on January 19, 2020. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 80 mg on the 2nd day after admission. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days. The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3+T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK cells, B cells), as well as serum levels of lymphocyte factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³) were dynamically monitored. RESULTS: On D1 of admission, the numbers of peripheral blood CD3+ T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells were significantly lower than the normal range. With the improvement of the disease, the numbers of CD3+ T, CD8+ T and CD4 + T cells gradually recovered and showed a linear growth trend (linear fitting equation: Y=18.59X+109.4, P<0.05). On D2 of admission, the patient's IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher than normal values, IFN-Î³ was at a normal high value, and then rapidly decreased; IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-&#945; were all in the normal range. On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time. On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative. On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged. At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.","Zhagn, Sheng; Li, Danping; Chen, Huazhong; Zheng, Dan; Zhou, Yiping; Chen, Baoguo; Shi, Weiwu; Lin, Ronghai",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,166

BACKGROUND: Individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression report increased symptoms and decreased quality of life compared with individuals with IBS alone. The current COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to further influence symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. STUDY: Individuals who met the Rome-IV IBS criteria and reported mild to severe anxiety and/or depression were included. Participants completed an online survey with questions about anxiety, depression, impact of COVID on activities and symptoms, and demographics. RESULTS: Fifty-five individuals participated in the study. The COVID-19 pandemic most commonly influenced their ability to spend time with friends and family, shop for certain types of food, and access health care. Participants also reported increased stress (92%), anxiety (81%), and depressive symptoms (67%). Finally, around half the sample reported increases in abdominal pain (48%), diarrhea (45%), or constipation (44%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is related to self-reported increases in psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Additional research is needed to intervene on these symptoms.","Kamp, Kendra J; Levy, Rona L; Munson, Sean A; Heitkemper, Margaret M",J. clin. gastroenterol,,166

237616,Using the spike protein feature to predict infection risk and monitor the evolutionary dynamic of coronavirus,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to health care systems all over the world. The speed of the viral spread results in a tsunami of patients, which begs for a reliable screening tool using readily available data to predict disease progression. Methods: Multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed to develop and validate a triage model. Patient demographic and non-laboratory clinical data were recorded. Using only the data from Zhongnan Hospital, step-wise multivariable logistic regression was performed, and a prognostic nomogram was constructed based on the independent variables identifies. The discrimination and calibration of the model were validated. External independent validation was performed to further address the utility of this model using data from Jinyintan Hospital. Results: A total of 716 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Zhongnan Hospital were included for model construction. Men, increased age, fever, hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, dyspnea, cough, and myalgia are independent risk factors for disease progression. External independent validation was carried out in a cohort with 201 cases from Jinyintan Hospital. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.787 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.747-0.827) in the training group and 0.704 (95% CI: 0.632-0.777) in the validation group. Conclusions: We developed a novel triage model based on basic and clinical data. Our model could be used as a pragmatic screening aid to allow for cost efficient screening to be carried out such as over the phone, which may reduce disease propagation through limiting unnecessary contact. This may help allocation of limited medical resources.","Tu, Yuexing; Zhou, Xianlong; Shao, Lina; Zheng, Jiayin; Wang, Jiafeng; Wang, Yixin; Tong, Weiwei; Wang, Mingshan; Wu, Jia; Zhu, Junpeng; Yan, Rong; Ji, Yemin; Chen, Legao; Zhu, Di; Wang, Huafang; Chen, Sheng; Liu, Renyang; Lin, Jingyang; Zhang, Jun; Huang, Haijun; Zhao, Yan; Ge, Minghua",Front Public Health,,166

Students in the Lane College Science Club, affiliated with the ASBMB Student Chapters, demonstrated a science interactive with second graders at Lincoln Elementary School. During the Fall 2020 semester, Science Club students, including S- STEM Scholars, and faculty advisors visited the school. Due to the devastating and unforeseen circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic, the faculty and students took a different approach for the annual interactive experiments. During this visit, Science club students worked with second graders where they demonstrated two fun and relevant experiments which represented the coexistence of germs on their hands and the spread of COVID-19. Following the CDC guidelines, only 25 children were able to participate in this event that occurred in the gym. The two experiments used were a part of the Coronavirus Kit from the Science Tools. Within the first experiment, four volunteers were selected to participate in four hand-washing experiences. Each volunteer was given blue glow powder to put on their hands. One volunteer performed a cold-water rinse without rubbing their hands, while another performed a hot water rinse without rubbing their hands. Another volunteer did a cold water and soap hand wash, while the last volunteer performed a hot water and soap hand wash. The results were observed with a UV light to see if there were any glow germ residues from each participant. The result showed the volunteer who performed the hot water and soap hand wash had very little germ residue left. Our second experiment involved three balloons and three scoops of glow germ powder mixed with water in a spray bottle. Three volunteers were selected to draw on the balloons which represent people. One of the science club members held the balloon, while another person sprayed it from a 1-foot distance. We repeated this process twice at a three feet distance with one balloon covered with a napkin. Then we observed the outcome of all three balloons. The results showed that the balloon covered with the napkin had very little residue as opposed to the other balloons standing at a similar distance without being provided with the napkins as a face cover. The children were amazed and enthusiastic by both demonstrations and were able to understand the necessary safety precautions for preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Adams, Valeanna Billings Ryan Lauderdale Tra039; Mya, Brown LeShaundria Barnhill Serena Van Stry Melanie Jones Candace",The FASEB Journal,,166

Many jurisdictions in the United States have therefore accelerated the release of low-risk offenders. Early release, however, does not address how arrest and pretrial detention practices may be contributing to disease spread. Using data from Cook County Jail-one of the largest known nodes of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States-in Chicago, Illinois, we analyzed the relationship between jailing practices and community infections at the ZIP code level. We found that jail-community cycling was a significant predictor of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), accounting for 55 percent of the variance in case rates across ZIP codes in Chicago and 37 percent of the variance in all of Illinois. Jail-community cycling far exceeds race, poverty, public transit use, and population density as a predictor of variance. The data suggest that cycling people through Cook County Jail alone is associated with 15.7 percent of all documented COVID-19 cases in Illinois and 15.9 percent of all documented cases in Chicago as of April 19, 2020.

RESULTS: Of 328 patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes included in the study cohort, 30.5% (100/328) were in the metformin group. In the mixed-effected model, metformin use was associated with the lower incidence of ARDS. There was no significant association between metformin use and 30-day all-cause mortality. Propensity score-matched analysis confirmed the results. In the subgroup analysis, metformin use was associated with the lower incidence of ARDS in females. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin may have potential benefits in reducing the incidence of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes. However, this benefit differs significantly by gender.","Jiang, Nan; Chen, Zhenyuan; Yin, Xiaoxv; Liu, Li; Yang, Heping; Tan, Xiangping; Wang, Jing; Li, Hui; Tian, Mengge; Lu, Zuxun; Xiong, Nian; Gong, Yanhong",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,166
269441,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers: potential allies in the COVID-19 pandemic instead of a threat?,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the increasing problem of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the world, improving the image resolution of COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) becomes a very important task. At present, single-image super-resolution (SISR) models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) generally have problems such as the loss of high-frequency information and the large size of the model due to the deep network structure. METHODS: In this work, we propose an optimization model based on multi-window back-projection residual network (MWSR), which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods. Firstly, we use multi-window to refine the same feature map at the same time to obtain richer high/low frequency information, and fuse and filter out the features needed by the deep network. Then, we develop a back-projection network based on the dilated convolution, using up-projection and down-projection modules to extract image features. Finally, we merge several repeated and continuous residual modules with global features, merge the information flow through the network, and input them to the reconstruction module. RESULTS: The proposed method shows the superiority over the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset, and generates clear COVID-19 CT super-resolution images. CONCLUSION: Both subjective visual effects and objective evaluation indicators are improved, and the model specifications are optimized. Therefore, the MWSR method can improve the clarity of CT images of COVID-19 and effectively assist the diagnosis and quantitative assessment of COVID-19.","Qiu, Defu; Cheng, Yuhu; Wang, Xuesong; Zhang, Xiaoqiang",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,166

271974,1503. Risk Factors for Contracting Infection with SARS-CoV-2: a Prospective Case-control Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Effective physician communication improves care, and many medical schools and residency programs have adopted communication focused curricula. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the doctor-patient communication paradigm with the rapid adoption of video-based medical appointments by the majority of the medical community. The pandemic has also necessitated a sweeping move to online learning, including teaching and facilitating the practice of communication skills remotely. We aimed to identify effective techniques for surgeons to build relationships during a video consult, and to design and pilot a class that increased student skill in communicating during a video consult. METHODS: Fourth-year medical students matched into a surgical internship attended a 2-hour class virtually. The class provided suggestions for building rapport and earning trust with patients and families by video, role play sessions with a simulated patient, and group debriefing and feedback. A group debriefing generated lessons learned and best practices for telemedicine communication in surgery. RESULTS: Students felt the class introduced new skills and reinforced current ones; most reported higher self-confidence in target communication skills following the module. Students were particularly appreciative of opportunity for direct observation of skills and immediate faculty feedback, noting that the intimate setting was unique and valuable. Several elements of virtual communications required increased focus to communicate empathy and concern. Proper lighting and positioning relative to the camera were particularly important and body movement required ""narration"" to minimize misinterpretation. A patient's distress was more difficult to interpret; asking direct questions was recommended to understand the patient's emotional state. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to teach video-conference communication skills to enable surgical teams to build rapport in this distinct form of consultation. Our training plan appears effective at engaging learners and improving skills and confidence, and identifies areas of focus when teaching virtual communication skills.","Newcomb, Anna B; Duval, Margaret; Bachman, Sharon L; Mohess, Denise; Dort, Jonathan; Kapadia, Muneera R",J. surg. educ,,166

275163,Detection of influenza and other respiratory viruses in air sampled from a university campus: A longitudinal study,2020,"Introduction La pandémie de COVID-19 a gravement affecté les personnes âgées. Rares études ont évalué la réponse anticorpale anti-SARS-CoV-2 dans cette population, qui a une diminution attendue des réponses immunitaires humorales et cellulaires due à l’immunosénescence. Matériels et méthodes Nous décrivons les caractéristiques cliniques et sérologiques de patients âgés hospitalisés dans cinq unités de soins de longue durée d’un CHU, touchés par deux grandes flambées épidémiques de COVID-19, en mars et novembre 2020. Dans un contexte d’urgence hospitalière, des tests sérologiques ont été réalisés pour le dépistage, le diagnostic et la réorganisation des services. Quatre-vingt-onze patients infectés en mars-avril ont été inclus rétrospectivement et suivis, cliniquement et par sérologies, pendant 12 mois. La réponse anticorpale a été évaluée 3, 6, 9 et 12 mois après l’infection, en utilisant le test Roche Elecsys pour détecter les anticorps anti-Spike et le test GenScript cPass comme test de neutralisation du virus. Résultats L’âge moyen des 91 patients était 86±7 ans, 68 % étaient des femmes. Les comorbidités les plus fréquentes étaient le diabète (23 %), l’hypertension artérielle (67 %), la coronaropathie (13%) ou le cancer (3%). La médiane d’indice de Charlson était 7 [6–8]. Tous les patients étaient fortement dépendants avec des ADL&lt;2. L’infection à SARS-CoV-2 était diagnostiquée par une RT-qPCR nasopharyngée chez 75 d’eux ou par une sérologie positive. 85 % d’eux étaient symtpomatiques et 25 % nécessitaient d’une oxygénothérapie. À trois, 6 et 9 mois le titre moyen d’anti-Spike était respectivement de 207±84, 189±90, 181±93U/mL et la moyenne du pourcentage d’inhibition de la cPass était respectivement de 86±15, 77±20, 71±24 %. Les résultats sérologiques à 12 mois sont en cours d’analyse. Le titre d’anti-Spike et le pourcentage d’inhibition étaient fortement corrélés (r=0,85, p&lt;0,0001). À 9 mois, tous les patients avaient des anti-Spike détectables, mais seulement 5 patients (5 %) avaient des titres inférieurs au seuil d’inhibition de 30% du test cPass. Aucun n’a développé de réinfection après la réexposition au SARS-CoV2 lors de la deuxième flambée épidémique. Conclusion Cette étude montre que, chez les personnes âgées, les anticorps neutralisants, évalués avec le test de neutralisation cPass, persistent au moins 9 mois après l’infection et semblent protéger contre une réinfection. À la lumière de ces données et dans un contexte global de pénurie de vaccins, un suivi sérologique pourrait être proposé pour évaluer la protection des personnes âgées précédemment infectées et économiser des doses de vaccins.","Collarino, R.; Vauloup-Fellous, C.; Allemang-Trivalle, A.; Mouna, L.; Duron, E.; Neiss, M.; Trikha, Z.; Guichardon, M.; Roque, A.; Trivalle, C.",Infectious Diseases Now,,166

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most dangerous complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. To date, no specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines have been proven efficacious. Ventilatory support is still a significant challenge for physicians facing COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying hypoxemia in those patients are not fully understood, but a new physiopathology model has been proposed. Oxygen therapy should be delivered to patients with mild to moderate hypoxemia. More severe patients could benefit from other treatments (high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation or intubation, and invasive ventilation). Given the rapid evolution of COVID-19, there has been a paucity of the high-quality data that typically inform clinical practice guidelines from professional societies, and a worldwide consensus is still lacking. This chapter aims to illustrate the potentials of ventilatory support as therapeutic options for adult and pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia.","Leone, Paolo Maria; Siciliano, Matteo; Simonetti, Jacopo; Lopez, Angelena; Zaman, Tanzira; Varone, Francesco; Richeldi, Luca",Adv Exp Med Biol,,166

This study considered sachet water quality during the advent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using multivariate statistics and Water Quality Index, Water Pollution Index and, hygienic and sanitation practices of sixty-two (62) sachet water vendors using a panel assessment approach. The findings showed that vendors did not adhere to proper hygienic practices as ninety-four (94%) of them did not have health clearance, ninety (90%) did not frequently wash their receptacles for selling daily, and most of them stored and sold in unhygienic environments. Majority of the producers violated Food and Drugs Authority Regulations. The Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis showed that total iron, Total Heterotrophic Bacteria, Salmonella, Cl−, E. coli, and fecal and total coliforms were the controlling elements in the water. All the brands were below threshold limits based on the physical water assessment. However, enteric bacteria were observed in all the brands. Water Quality and Water Pollution Indices (WQI and WPI) described all the sachet water brands (vendors and production sites) as excellent for drinking. The WQI computations for samples from the production and vending sites respectively ranged from 0.12-0.36 and 0.27-0.42 whereas WPI presented 0.22-0.31 and 0.23-0.32. Comparatively, samples from vendors had elevated elemental concentrations and loads. This suggests that besides sachet water contamination during production and transportation, vendors significantly impacted the quality of sachet water. Sensitization on proper hygienic practices for sachet water production and vending and routine assessment of the quality of sachet water produced or sold is recommended.","Amuah, Ebenezer Ebo Yahans Bekoe Emmanuel Martin Obeng Kazapoe Raymond Webrah Dankwa Paul Nandomah Solomon Douti Nang Biyogue Abanyie Samuel Kojo Okyere Isaac Kwaku",Environmental Challenges,,166

For scholastics, control approaches established by most nations have inferred an unexpected change to work from home, a progress to internet educating and tutoring, and an alteration of research works. In this paper we talk about in what way the COVID-19 emergency is influencing the work of academics. We contend that scholarly world must cultivate a culture of care, assist us with new focus on what is generally significant, and rethink greatness in educating and examination. Such re-direction can make scholastic practice more conscious and reasonable, presently during control yet in addition once the pandemic has passed. We finish up giving functional proposals on the best way to reestablish our training, which definitely involves re-surveying the social-mental, political, and ecological ramifications of scholastic exercises and our scale of values. Work from home turned into a need because of lockdown requirements. As governments are right now detailing conventions to permit organizations to resume their commercial establishments and reboot the economic juncture, a few colleges and educational institutions are continuing warily and making arrangements to provide teaching distantly toward the beginning of the new academic year. In any case, the pandemic has made it compulsory to work from home and this has demonstrated testing in various manners for the academics. The corona virus has closed down institutional offices, including research centers, libraries and documents, and halted field activities. Libraries are attempting their best to offer computerized assets;however a significant number of these have not been digitized or bought. Be that as it may, reality paints an alternate picture. Academics have needed to figure out how to utilize new innovation rapidly to educate team up, and give understudy oversight. They have needed to locate a tranquil space in their homes - which is more diligently when the family unit remembers small children for need of recreation or self-teaching - to keep arranging and writing papers.

There is limited information about presenting characteristics and outcomes of Swiss patients requiring hospitalisation. Furthermore, outcomes 30 days after onset of symptoms and after hospital discharge have not been described. AIMS: To describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes 30 days after onset of symptoms and in-hospital mortality of a cohort of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a Swiss area. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all inpatients hospitalised with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March and 12 April 2020 in the public hospital network of a Swiss area (Fribourg). Demographic data, comorbidities and outcomes were recorded. Rate of potential hospital-acquired infection, outcomes 30 days after onset of symptoms and in-hospital mortality are reported. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-six patients were included in the study. In our population, 119 (61%) were male and the median age was 70 years. Forty-nine patients (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The rate of potential hospital-acquired infection was 7%. Overall, 30 days after onset of symptoms 117 patients (60%) had returned home, 23 patients (12%) were in a rehabilitation facility, 18 patients (9%) in a medical ward, 6 patients (3%) in ICU and 32 (16%) patients had died. Among patients who returned home within 30 days, 73 patients (63%) reported persistent symptoms. The overall in-hospital mortality was 17%. CONCLUSION: We report the first cohort of Swiss patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Thirty days after onset of the symptoms, 60% had returned home. Among them, 63% still presented symptoms.

288090,Performance of 30 commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays in testing symptomatic COVID-19 patients,2021,"Periods of absence from supervised group exercise while maintaining physical activity might be a frequent pattern in adults' exercise habits. The aim of the present study was to determine detraining effects on musculoskeletal outcomes after a 3-month detraining period in early post-menopausal, osteopenic women. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated the 18-month randomized controlled ACTLIFE exercise intervention immediately after the 13-month follow-up assessment. This put an abrupt stop to the high-intensity aerobic and resistance group exercise sessions undertaken three times per week by the exercise group (EG: n = 27) and the gentle exercise program performed once per week for the attention control group (CG: n = 27); but both groups were permitted to conduct individual outdoor activity for the 3-month lock-down period. Study endpoints were lean body mass (LBM), bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS), maximum hip-/leg extension strength and power. Detraining-induced reductions of LBM, hip/leg strength and power (but not BMD-LS) were significantly greater (p < 0.001 to p = 0.044) compared with the CG. Significant exercise effects, i.e. differences between EG and CG, present after 13 months of exercise, were lost after 3 months of detraining for LBM (p = 0.157) and BMD-LS (p = 0.065), but not for strength (p < 0.001) and power (p < 0.001). Of note, self-reported individual outdoor activities and exercise increased by about 40% in both groups during the lock-down period. Three months' absence from a supervised group exercise protocol resulted in considerable detraining effects for musculoskeletal parameters. Thus, exercise programs for adults should be continuous rather than intermittent.Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04420806, 06.05.2020.","Kemmler, Wolfgang; Hettchen, Michael; Kohl, Matthias; Murphy, Marie; Bragonzoni, Laura; Julin, Mikko; Risto, Tapani; von Stengel, Simon",Calcif Tissue Int,,166

In the present study, we investigate the evolution of air quality in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, focusing on nine atmospheric pollutants (NO2, NO, PM10, PM2.5, O3, VOC, CO, SO2, and isoprene). In Lyon, center of the region, the results indicated that NO2, NO, and CO levels were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in a decrease in road traffic by 80%. However, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 were increased by 105%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is explained by the dropping in NO and other gases linked to human activity, which consume ozone. Thus, the increase of solar radiation, sunshine, temperature, and humidity promoted the O3 formation during the lockdown. Besides, rising temperature enhances the BVOC emissions such as isoprene. In addition, volatile organic component (VOC) and SO2 remain almost stable and oxidation of these species leads to the formation of ozone and organic aerosol, which also explains the increase in PM during the lockdown.

Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID-19 associated PE. METHODS: We studied COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19-03-2020 and 17-05-2020. Point-of-care fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activation/maturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L. Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE (as diagnosed on CT angiography) during or after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE. The median (IQR) time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 (7-12) days. A significant increase in the immune-suppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16bright /CD62Ldim was observed on the day of ICU admission (p=0.014) in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16bright /CD62Ldim neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID19 patients.","Spijkerman, Roy; Jorritsma, Nikita Kn; Bongers, Suzanne H; Bindels, Bas Jj; Jukema, Bernard N; Hesselink, Lillian; Hietbrink, Falco; Leenen, Luke Ph; van Goor, Harriët Mr; Vrisekoop, N; Kaasjager, Karin Ah; Koenderman, Leo",Scand J Immunol,,166
295550,Response to Dawson et al,2020,"Purpose - This study aims to analyze the influence of job autonomy and unscripted agility on ambidextrous innovation in startups in times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted with founders and managers of Brazilian startups in the e-commerce segment, resulting in a sample of 84 startups. Symmetric (structural equation modeling) and asymmetric (fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis) analyses were performed. The variables' external financing and institutional ties were controlled. Findings - The symmetric findings indicate that unscripted agility is a full mediator between job autonomy and ambidextrous innovation. The asymmetric findings offer two solutions for startups to achieve high ambidextrous innovation. Research limitations/implications - The implications of the research for the literature are discussing elements associated with ambidextrous innovation, exploring the context of innovation in startups in times of crisis, specifically in the Covid-19 pandemic, and considering the role of resilience in startups. Practical implications - The study provides informational inputs to founders and managers of startups on how job autonomy and unscripted agility can propel incremental and radical innovations. Originality/value - This study provides new insights and success factors into startups, based on the discussion of entrepreneurship in times of crisis, as in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Frare, A.

297654,The utility of rapid nucleic acid amplification testing to triage symptomatic patients and to screen asymptomatic pre-procedure patients for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Aim: The present study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19. Background: This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of the ß-coronaviruses wages a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding atypical pneumonia being the primary symptom, the emergence of severe disease mainly resulting from the injury of non-pulmonary organs leaves no alternative, in some cases, other than a dreadful death. Methods: To provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint representing the prognostic values of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19, a meta-analysis was performed with the calculation of mean difference and 95% conï¬dence intervals of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Bili), and albumin (Alb) in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Results: While severe COVID-19 cases displayed higher values of ALT, AST, and Bili compared to non-severe patients (mean differences of 7.48, 12.07, and 3.07, respectively), the value of Alb was significantly lower in severe cases (mean differences of -6.15). There was also a correlation between alterations in all of the parameters; however, only correlations between ALT and Bili (R=0.98, p=0.0031), and Bili and Alb (R=-1, p=0.0012) were significant. Conclusion: Abnormal values of liver-related examinations outwardly contribute to reflect the progression of the disease toward an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, careful scrutiny of these parameters will provide clinicians with invaluable information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least in terms of liver injury.","Bashash, Davood; Olfatifar, Meysam; Hadaegh, Farzad; Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,,166

The infection can range from asymptomatic, mild to life threatening respiratory distress. It can affect almost every organ of the body. Ophthalmologists world over are reporting various manifestations of the infection in the eye. This review was undertaken to help ophthalmologists recognize the possible manifestations and the stage of the viral disease when they commonly appear. Literature search was performed for the publications on ophthalmic manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) between January 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. 46 case reports, 8 case series, 11 cross sectional/cohort observational studies, 5 prospective interventional studies, 3 animal models/autopsy studies and 6 reviews/meta-analysis were included. Conjunctivitis is the most common manifestation and can develop at any stage of the disease. Direct effect due to virus, immune mediated tissue damage, activation of the coagulation cascade and prothrombotic state induced by the viral infection, the associated comorbidities and drugs used in the management are responsible for the findings in the eye. The viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been isolated from ocular tissues but the role of eye as a route for infection is yet to be substantiated. Ophthalmic manifestations may be the presenting feature of COVID-19 infection or they may develop several weeks after recovery. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the possible associations of ocular diseases with SARS-CoV-2 in order to ask relevant history, look for specific signs, advise appropriate tests and thereby mitigate the spread of infection as well as diagnose and initiate early treatment for life and vision threatening complications.","Sen, Mrittika; Honavar, Santosh G; Sharma, Namrata; Sachdev, Mahipal S",Indian J Ophthalmol,,166
298091,Asymptomatic SARS coronavirus 2 infection: Invisible yet invincible-Reply to Malagón-Rojas et al,2020,"There has been increasing recognition that climate change may lead to risk of summertime overheating in UK dwellings with potentially adverse consequences for human comfort and health. This paper investigates the magnitude of summertime overheating over one month in 2017, in four new flats built to identical thermal standards, with similar occupancy patterns and located in the same block in a development in Southeast England. Both static and adaptive methods were used to assess the overheating risk, while the variation in indoor temperatures across the flats was examined through key building characteristics including floor level, glazing orientation, exposed surface area to floor area ratio (SA/FA), glazing area to floor area ratio, and ventilation. Data collection included continuous monitoring of indoor and outdoor temperature, relative humidity, CO2 levels and opening/closing of windows. Summertime overheating was found to be prevalent in all four flats but was most pronounced in two top floor flats with high SA/FA ratio and east/west facing glazing. Due to limited window opening and locational limitations of one flat, some conclusions were derived from three flats. Though the study sample is small, it is clear that overheating in new housing is a current issue and designing for avoidance of summertime overheating should become mainstream.","Gregg, Matt",Energies,,166

This paper provides an empirical approach to the assessment of the (in)equity of accessibility from universities to sustainable transport modes: Light Rail Transit, Bus Rapid Transit, buses, and bicycle infrastructure in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (Mexico). In particular, the study designed and calculated an Access to Sustainable Transport from University Index by combining governmental and crowdsourced Open Access Data. It used spatial analysis techniques within a Geographic Information Systems environment, and multivariate statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis. The findings highlight the weakness in the accessibility to sustainable transport modes from the universities in the Metropolitan Area. Furthermore, this study revealed an unfavourable bias in the location of sustainable transport stations/stops in the vicinity of public universities.

Iran was one of those first countries facing the second wave of coronavirus, due to the lack of appropriate public restrictions because of economic problems the country is facing. The clinical and demographic characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in 192 patients in Tehran, Iran, between June 16 and July 11, 2020, were investigated. The patients were divided into severe cases (n = 82) and non-severe cases (n = 110). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study clusters. The mean age was 54.6 ± 17.2 years, and the most common presenting symptom was persistent cough (81.8%) and fever (79.7%). The logistic regression model revealed that age, BMI, and affected family members were statistically associated with severity. Patients with complicated conditions of disorders faced more hospitalization days and medical care than the average statistical data. As the coronavirus spike in the case and death reports from June 2020, we observed the rise in the incidence of severe cases, where 42.7% (82/192) of cases have resulted in severe conditions.

The effectivity of vitamin D as a therapeutic intervention in critical illness remains less defined. The current study analyzed clinical and immunologic effects of vitamin D levels in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients receiving intensive care with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ARDS. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell subsets were measured on admission as well as after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters were extracted from the patient data management system. Standard operating procedures included the daily administration of vitamin D3 via enteral feeding. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were eligible, of which 26 were included in this study as data on vitamin D status was available. 96% suffered from severe COVID-19 ARDS. All patients without prior vitamin D supplementation (n = 22) had deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but not did not increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters did not differ between patients with sufficient or deficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Only circulating plasmablasts were higher in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &#8805;30 ng/ml (p = 0.029). Patients with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 pg/ml required longer mechanical ventilation (p = 0.045) and had a worse acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: The vast majority of COVID-19 ARDS patients had vitamin D deficiency. 25-hydroxyvitamin D status was not related to changes in clinical course, whereas low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and a worse APACHE II score.","Notz, Quirin; Herrmann, Johannes; Schlesinger, Tobias; Kranke, Peter; Sitter, Magdalena; Helmer, Philipp; Stumpner, Jan; Roeder, Daniel; Amrein, Karin; Stoppe, Christian; Lotz, Christopher; Meybohm, Patrick",Clin. nutr.

Therefore, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, the psychosocial precursors of correct sanitation and sanitization were assessed. METHODS: An Italian sample of hospital health workers (nurses, healthcare assistants, cleaners; N=250), replied to a validated questionnaire measuring: a) knowledge of HAI; b) favorable attitude towards the correct sanitation and sanitization procedure; c) perception that the management and colleagues give importance to the government of infectious risk; d) perception of being able to implement risk management behaviors; e) perception of having received proper training for the prevention of HAI. RESULTS: The results show many mistakes about knowledge, the perception of insufficient specific training, and not always favorable attitude towards sanitation and sanitization practices. Workers also perceive that they can act the required behaviors and that the management of infectious risk represents a value in the group they belong to, but they believe that the management does not offer sufficient support. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement of the factors considered (knowledge, personal attitudes, actions of management and colleagues, perception of being able to implement the required behaviors) is affected by proper training. This is one of the aspects on which management should invest more.","Ricci, Federico; Aldini, Alice; Ciramini, Marlene; Gioia, Maria Grazia; Quintero, Narcisa; Ronsval, Daniela; Vecchiatini, Silvia; Artioli, Giovanna; Sarli, Leopoldo",Acta Biomed,,166

However, the diagnosis and treatment of the disease need further exploration. Therefore, this retrospective analysis was conducted on multiple indicators of peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 to determine the role of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of COVID-19. Baseline information and clinical records of 40 patients were collected, including demographic data, disease status, medication, and laboratory routine. The correlation between the inspection indicators and disease classification, as well as prognostic factors, was analyzed. Decreased eosinophils were detected in 33 out of 40 patients with COVID-19 on admission, while lymphocytes and eosinophils were inversely related to the severity of the disease, according to the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Thus, it could be deduced that eosinophils have better sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and play a major role similar to lymphocytes in assessing the prognosis of patients.","Tan, Yingzheng; Zhou, Juan; Zhou, Qing; Hu, Lingli; Long, Yunzhu",J. med. virol,,166

We find that under the best-case scenario, the poverty rate will increase from 9.2% in September 2019 to 9.7% by the end of 2020, pushing 1.3 million more people into poverty. Under the worst-case scenario, the poverty rate will increase to 16.6%, close to the level seen in 2004 when the poverty rate was 16.7%. This means that 19.7 million more people will become poor, substantially reversing Indonesia’s progress in reducing poverty.

(Special Issue: Influenza and other respiratory viruses.),2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we found that 3 of the drugs fulfils the criterions well among which the antiretroviral drug Amprenavir (DrugBank ID-DB00701) would probably be the most effective drug based on the selected criterions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.","Mohapatra, Sovesh; Nath, Prathul; Chatterjee, Manisha; Das, Neeladrisingha; Kalita, Deepjyoti; Roy, Partha; Satapathi, Soumitra",PLoS One,,166

326832,The Wrong Cure: Financial Incentives for Unimpressive New Antibiotics,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Several intensive-care units (ICUs) in Wuhan are nonstandard wards that were repurposed from general wards. Considering the shortage of medical resources and the need to prevent nosocomic infection, the respiratory-treatment strategy in these nonstandard ICUs is different from those in general wards and standard ICUs. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) plays an important role in nonstandard ICUs and is beneficial to the patients therein. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we analyzed four cases of HFNC-treated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a makeshift ICU and summarized our experience. DIAGNOSES: Four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were admitted to the makeshift ICU. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had oxygen treatment with HFNC, as well as regular treatment of antivirals and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: Two patients survived after treatment, while the other two died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 often have poor prognoses after mechanical ventilation, exhibiting corresponding complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis, which significantly prolongs length of stay in the ICU. HFNC could prevent intubation in some patients, thereby avoiding the above complications; however, this needs confirmation in further clinical studies. This treatment reduced difficulty and workloads for healthcare professionals, had good tolerability for patients, might not significantly increase the risk of infection for healthcare professionals, and do not require additional preventive measures against nosocomic infection. HFNC treatment has its advantages in providing oxygen therapy in COVID-19, but healthcare professionals should still pay close attention to changes in patients' oxygenation rates and respiratory frequency.","Lu, Xiao; Xu, Shanxiang",Medicine (Baltimore),,166

335637,Circulating CD4 T cells elicited by endemic coronaviruses display vast disparities in abundance and functional potential linked to both antigen specificity and age,2021,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation and guidance were introduced in Scotland permitting medical abortion at home by telemedicine for pregnancies at less than 12 weeks' gestation. Women had a telephone consultation with a clinician. Routine ultrasound was not performed. Medications and a low-sensitivity pregnancy test to confirm success of treatment were collected by or delivered to the woman, with telephone support provided as needed. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 663 women choosing medical abortion at home via the NHS Lothian telemedicine abortion service between 1 April and 9 July 2020. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were completed 4 and 14 days following treatment. Regional hospital databases were reviewed to verify abortion outcomes and complications within 6 weeks. Outcome measures included efficacy, complications and acceptability. RESULTS: Almost all (642/663, 98.2%) the women were under 10 weeks' gestation. For 522/663 (78.7%) women, gestation was determined using last menstrual period alone. Some 650/663 (98%) women had a complete abortion, 5 (0.8%) an ongoing pregnancy and 4 (0.6%) an incomplete abortion. No one was treated inadvertently beyond 12 weeks' gestation, but one woman was never pregnant. One woman who had a pre-abortion ultrasound was later managed as a caesarean scar ectopic. There were two cases of haemorrhage and no severe infections. Some 123 (18.5%) women sought advice by telephone for a concern related to the abortion and 56 (8.4%) then attended a clinic for review. Most (628, 95%) women rated their care as very or somewhat acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: This model of telemedicine abortion without routine ultrasound is safe, and has high efficacy and high acceptability among women.","Reynolds-Wright, John Joseph; Johnstone, Anne; McCabe, Karen; Evans, Emily; Cameron, Sharon",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,166

Here, we describe the outcome of a cross-sectional study on a healthcare worker cohort (WEL-COME-NYPH), in which we assessed whether IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to the S-protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were present in serum and saliva samples. Anti-S-protein IgG was detected in 14/31 and 66/66 of saliva samples from uninfected participants after vaccine dos-es-1 and-2, respectively.

(Special Issue: New coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) and the outbreak of the respiratory illness (COVID-19): part-VI.),2020,"OBJECTIVE: Low viral load from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during infection late stage easily lead to false negative nucleic acid testing results, thus having great challenges to the prevention and control of the current pandemic. In present study, we mainly aimed to evaluate specimen types and specimen collection timepoint on the positive detection of 2019 novel coronavirus from patients at infection late stage based on RT-PCR testing. METHODS: Paired nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and anal swabs were collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during infection late stage before washing in the morning and afternoon on the same day. Then virus RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV identification by RT-PCR within 24 h. RESULTS: Viral load was low at late infection stage. Specimens collected before washing in the morning would increase the detection ratio of 2019-nCoV. Detection ratio of nasopharyngeal swab [65 (95 % CI: 49.51-77.87) vs 42.5(95 % CI: 28.51-57.8)] or nasal swab [57.5 (95 % CI: 42.2-71.49) vs 35 (95 % CI: 22.13-50.49)] is higher not only than oropharyngeal swab[22.5 (95 % CI: 12.32-37.5) vs 7.5 (95 % CI: 2.58-19.86)], but also anal swab[2.5 (95 % CI: 0.44-12.88) vs 5 (95 % CI: 1.38-16.5)]. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our research discovers that nasopharyngeal or nasal swab collected before washing in the morning might be more suitable for detecting of large-scale specimens from patients infected with low SARS-CoV-2 load during infection late stage. Those results could facilitate other laboratories in collecting appropriate specimens for improving detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patients during infection late stage as well as initially screening.","Liu, Min; Li, Qianyuan; Zhou, Jun; Ai, Wen; Zheng, Xiaoling; Zeng, Jingjing; Liu, Yuwen; Xiang, Xiying; Guo, Rong; Li, Xiaoyin; Wu, Xiandi; Xu, Haiying; Jiang, Ling; Zhang, Huaqin; Chen, Jing; Tian, Lili; Luo, Jun; Luo, Chunhua",J Virol Methods,,166

To ensure high production through effective decision-making and auditable standards, producers are required to have better traceability and record systems. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) reviewing the current recording/data management and animal traceability systems used by small-scale farmers in developing countries and (2) analyzing how data management systems should be designed to enhance efficient decision-making and animal traceability from farm to fork. This study found that, still, a majority of small-scale farmers do not keep records leading to poor decision-making on the farm and policymaking. We also found that those who keep records do not store their data in electronic format, which again poses another challenge in data analysis. Moreover, this study found that the majority of traceability tools used by farmers in developing countries do not meet international standards based on tools they use for tracing animals; farmers were reported to use tools like branding and ear tagging, which provide very little information about the animal. Such tools lack the capability to keep track of useful information about an animal, e.g., information about feeding and animal health. In conclusion, this study recommended a better electronic system to be used at the farm level to facilitate data analysis, hence promoting informed decision-making and adherence to the international animal traceability standards. Otherwise, there is a need for researchers to conduct more studies in developing different analytical models for exploring on-farm data in order to improve the decision-making process by farmers and other stakeholders.","Mwanga, G; Mbega, E; Yonah, Z; Chagunda, M G G",ScientificWorldJournal,,166

One consensus is that the classical hierarchical automation system design needs to be flattened while supporting the functionality of both Operation Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) within the same network infrastructure. To achieve the goal of IT/OT convergence in process automation, an evolutionary transition is preferred. Challenges are foreseen during the transition, mainly caused by the traditional automation architecture, and the main challenge is to identify the gap between the current and future network architectures. To address the challenges, in this paper, we describe one desired future scenario for process automation and carry out traffic measurements from a pulp and paper mill. The measured traffic is further analyzed, which reveals representative traffic characteristics in the process automation. Finally, the key challenges and future directions towards a system architecture for factories of the future are presented.","Åkerberg, Johan Åkesson Johan Furunäs Gade Jorgen Vahabi Maryam Björkman Mats Lavassani Mehrzad Rahul Nandkumar Gore Lindh Thomas Jiang Xiaolin",Applied Sciences,,166

The results of the study show that COVID-19 cases spiked amid ease of lockdown in the country and the spread of novel coronavirus pandemic has significant socioeconomic impact on the lives of mountain communities in Gilgit-Baltistan. Financial uncertainty, decrease in income, fear of job loss, and food insecurity are some major challenges that mountain communities face due to outbreak of coronavirus in the region. The results further show that lack of community cooperation with government agencies, lack of awareness about the severity of coronavirus, and insufficient COVID-19 testing kits are the major factors that caused the spread of coronavirus cases. This study suggests that the short-, medium-, and long-term policies are required to mitigate the consequences of this pandemic and to revitalize the mountain economy of Gilgit-Baltistan, and in this regard, this study provides baseline information for policy-makers and practitioners to devise such demanding policies.","Ali, Amjad; Ahmed, Mumtaz; Hassan, Nazia",J Public Aff,,166

This regulation is commonly used by viruses such as coronaviruses and retroviruses but rarely by host human cells, and for this reason, it has long been considered as a therapeutic target for antiviral drug development. Understanding the molecular mechanism of −1 PRF is one step toward this goal. Minus-one PRF occurs with a certain efficiency when translating ribosomes encounter the specialized mRNA signal consisting of the frameshifting site and a downstream stimulatory structure, which impedes translocation of the ribosome. The impeded ribosome can still undergo profound conformational changes to proceed with translocation;however, some of these changes may be unique and essential to frameshifting. In addition, most stimulatory structures exhibit conformational dynamics and sufficient mechanical strength, which, when under the action of ribosomes, may in turn further promote −1 PRF efficiency. In this review, we discuss how the dynamic features of ribosomes and mRNA stimulatory structures may influence the occurrence of −1 PRF and propose a hypothetical frameshifting model that recapitulates the role of conformational dynamics.","Chang, Kai-Chun Wen Jin-Der",Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,,166
364400,"Maternal, placental and neonatal outcomes after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester of pregnancy: A case report",2021,"There is an accumulating body of literature surrounding the impact of COVID-19 infection in solid organ transplant recipients. The aim of this review was to summarize the existing literature specifically in kidney transplant (KTx) recipients, with an emphasis on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, post-operative outcomes, and therapeutic strategies currently employed. We identified thirty-seven studies published between January 1, 2020, and June 10, 2020, that were included in our analysis. As is reported in the general population, there is a wide variation in COVID-19 presentation among KTx patients, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening end-organ failure. The most common symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever. On laboratory evaluation, many patients present with lymphopenia and increased CRP, which are both associated with inferior outcomes. The majority of patients with severe symptoms have been managed with reduction of immunosuppression, including decreased doses of CNIs and withdrawal of MMF. Lastly, although there are no high-level data supporting the use of immunomodulatory drugs, such as IL-6 inhibitors, early experiences have suggested these drugs may improve outcomes in KTx patients with severe COVID-19.","Moris, Dimitrios; Kesseli, Samuel J; Barbas, Andrew S",Transpl Infect Dis,,166

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin decreased COVID-19 mortality compared with the standard of care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched up to 25 July 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and patients managed with standard of care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients &#8805;18 years old with confirmed COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. METHODS: Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess drug safety. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, three were randomized controlled trials, one was a non-randomized trial and 25 were observational studies, including 11 with a critical risk of bias and 14 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical risk of bias, the meta-analysis included 11 932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12 930 for the control group. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled relative risk (RR) 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.06, n = 17 studies) for all studies and RR = 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.24, n = 3 studies) for randomized controlled trials. Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.04-1.54, n = 7 studies). We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine alone was not associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin significantly increased mortality.","Fiolet, Thibault; Guihur, Anthony; Rebeaud, Mathieu Edouard; Mulot, Matthieu; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Mahamat-Saleh, Yahya",Clin. microbiol. infect,,166

377658,High antibody response to two-dose SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccination in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases,2021,"BACKGROUND: Kidney involvement is a feature of COVID-19 and it can be severe in Black patients. Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS: To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six Black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS: This case series included six Black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collapsing glomerulopathy in Black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a ""two-hit"" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given this entity's resemblance with HIV-associated nephropathy, we propose the term COVID-19-associated nephropathy to describe it.","Wu, Huijuan; Larsen, Christopher P; Hernandez-Arroyo, Cesar F; Mohamed, Muner M B; Caza, Tiffany; Sharshir, Moh039; Chughtai, Asim; Xie, Liping; Gimenez, Juan M; Sandow, Tyler A; Lusco, Mark A; Yang, Haichun; Acheampong, Ellen; Rosales, Ivy A; Colvin, Robert B; Fogo, Agnes B; Velez, Juan Carlos Q",J Am Soc Nephrol,,166

Concerns related to fall 2020 school re-opening and getting back into in-person teaching-whether full-time, part-time or some other approved hybrid model-plus ongoing uncertainty with how the state and federal government will be handling matters about mandates for virtual learning, rapid testing, vaccine distribution, etc. These concerns were related to both their experience as educational professionals and genuine interest in personal and student well-being. This study was a cross-sectional online survey in early fall from mid-September-early October 2020. Of a possible maximum participation of 740 New Jersey (NJ) supervisory-level HS teachers and administrators (e.g., department chairs, district and school principals), 100 confirmed unique respondents (13.5%) consented and completed the survey. Of 100 experienced (mean 18 years teaching) participants, 70% responded to the gender identity question (overall, 61% female, 39% male;by NJ region, gender ratios were similar).

386339,A 67-Year-Old Woman with Sudden Hearing Loss Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Addressing overweight and obesity among men at-risk for obesity-related diseases and disability in rural communities is a public health issue. Commercial smartphone applications (apps) that promote self-monitoring for weight loss are widely available. Evidence is lacking regarding what support is required to enhance user engagement with and effectiveness of those technologies. Pragmatically comparing these apps effectiveness, including rural men's desired forms of support when using them, can lead to greater weight loss intervention impact and reach. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile technology application applied differently across two groups for weight loss. METHODS: In a two-armed, pragmatic pilot feasibility study, 80 overweight and obese men aged 40-69 were randomized using a 1:1 ratio to either an enhanced Mobile Technology Plus (MT+) intervention or a basic Mobile Technology (MT) intervention. The MT+ group had an enhanced smartphone app for self-monitoring (text messaging, discussion group, Wi-Fi scale) whereas the MT group received a basic app that allowed self-monitoring logging only. Assessments were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. App logs were analyzed to track engagement and adherence to self-monitoring. Acceptability was assessed via focus groups. Analysis included descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 men recruited, forty were allocated to each arm. All were included in the primary analysis. Recruitment ended after 10 months with a 97.5 and 92.5% (3 month, 6 month) retention rate. Over 90% of men reported via survey and focus groups that Lose-It app and smart scale (MT+) was an acceptable way to self-monitor weight, dietary intake and physical activity. Adherence to daily app self-monitoring of at least 800 dietary calories or more (reported respectively as MT+, MT) was positive with 73.4, 51.6% tracking at least 5 days a week. Adherence to tracking activity via recorded steps four or more days weekly was positive, 87.8, 64.6%. Men also adhered to self-weighing at least once weekly, 64, 46.3%. At 6 months, an observed mean weight loss was 7.03 kg (95% CI: 3.67, 10.39) for MT+ group and 4.14 kg (95% CI: 2.22, 6.06) for MT group, with 42.9 and 34.2% meeting &#8805;5% weight loss, respectively. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This National Institutes of Health-funded pilot study using mobile technologies to support behavior change for weight loss was found to be feasible and acceptable among midlife and older rural men. The interventions demonstrated successful reductions in weight, noting differing adherence to lifestyle behaviors of eating, monitoring and activity between groups, with men in the MT+ having more favorable results. These findings will be used to inform the design of a larger scale, clinical trial.

This study aimed to determine how microRNAs (miRNAs) and predicted targeted transcripts were altered in livers of zebrafish exposed to these stressors, and livers of their un-exposed F1 and F2 offspring. Following a 21 day exposure to multiple stressors (1 µg/L VFX, +5 °C ambient, 50% O2), then a subsequent 21 day recovery, relative abundances of cyp3a65, hsp70, hsp90, and ppargc1a and miRNAs predicted to target them (miR-142a, miR-16c, miR-181c, and miR-129, respectively) were measured in the liver via quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). There were significant decreases in miR-142a in the exposed F0 generation and the exposed F1 generation. While there were no changes detected in cyp3a65 relative abundance, there was a significant inverse relationship between cyp3a65 and miR-142a. Hsp70 expression significantly increased in the F1 generation, which persisted to the F2 generation and the relative abundance of hsp90 significantly increased in all generations. There was a significant reduction in miR-181c in the F1 generation, but there was no significant relationship between miR-181c and hsp90. Finally, there was a significant decrease in ppargc1a relative abundance in the F1 generation which was associated with an increase in miR-129.

388889,Systemic Inflammation Is Associated With Neurologic Involvement in Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Associated With SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection ranges from asymptomatic through to fatal COVID-19 characterized by a 'cytokine storm' and lung failure. Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated as a determinant of severity. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID-19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P = 0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect. Community-based placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID-19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Meanwhile, vitamin D supplementation should be strongly advised for people likely to be deficient.","Rhodes, J M; Subramanian, S; Laird, E; Griffin, G; Kenny, R A",J. intern. med,,166

A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.","Wang, Linda; Lin, Zhong Qiu; Wong, Alexander",Sci Rep,,166

390005,Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity Among US Health Care Personnel,2021,"Multivalent virus binding inhibitors are a promising new class of antivirals, preventing virus infection of cells by inhibiting the first step in the viral infection cycle - binding of viruses to the cell surface. The design of multivalent virus binding inhibitors is complex as many properties, such as inhibitor size and functionalization with virus attachment factors, have a strong impact on the inhibition efficiency. In this study, we synthesized virus binding inhibitors, the design of which has been inspired by mucins, which are naturally occurring glycosylated proteins with molecular weights in the MDa range and which show high affinity in the interaction with various viruses. Hyperbranched polyglycerols (hPG), serving as polymeric scaffolds, were functionalized with sialic acids and sulfate groups at degrees of functionalization as suggested from the structure of mucins. The molecular weights of the hPG-based inhibitors ranged between 10 and 2600 kDa, thereby hitting the size of mucins (MDa scale) and allowing for comparing the inhibition efficiency of the largest, mucin-sized inhibitor (2600 kDa) with related inhibitors of lower molecular weight. Inhibition efficiencies were determined by various methods based on the inhibition of influenza A virus (IAV) binding to lipid membranes, including an assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy that allows for probing the interaction of IAV with its native attachment factor, sialic acid. Potent inhibition is observed in all assays already at pM concentrations for the mucin-sized inhibitor, while decreasing the inhibitor's molecular weight also decreased its inhibition efficiency. In addition, a biphasic binding behavior of the inhibitors to IAV is observed, which is attributed to differences in the binding affinity to two IAV envelope proteins, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin.","Wallert, Matthias; Nie, Chuanxiong; Anilkumar, Parambath; Abbina, Srinivas; Bhatia, Sumati; Kizhakkedathu, Jayachandran N.; Haag, Rainer; Block, Stephan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08713v1.pdf,166

Typically, antibiotics are used for the primary treatment of C. difficile infections (CDIs), but they are not universally effective for all ribotypes and can result in antibiotic resistance and recurrent infection, while also disrupting the microbiota. Novel targeted therapeutics are urgently needed to combat CDI. Bacteriophage-derived endolysins are required to disrupt the bacterial cell wall of their target bacteria and are possible alternatives to antibiotics. These lytic proteins could potentially replace or augment antibiotics in CDI treatment. We discuss candidate therapeutic lysins derived from phages/prophages of C. difficile and their potential as antimicrobials against CDI. Additionally, we review the antibacterial potential of some recently identified homologues of C. difficile endolysins. Finally, the challenges of endolysins are considered with respect to the development of novel lysin-based therapies.","Mondal, Shakhinur Islam; Draper, Lorraine A; Ross, R Paul; Hill, Colin",Gut Microbes,,166

Such""nanoscale caterpillars""bind and unbind fluctuating""legs""to surfaces, whose fluctuations cause the nanocaterpillar to diffuse over long timescales. Quantifying this diffusion is a challenge, since binding events often occur on very short time and length scales. Here we present a robust analytic framework, validated by simulations, to coarse-grain these fast dynamics and obtain the long time diffusion coefficient of a nanocaterpillar in one dimension. We verify our theory experimentally, by measuring diffusion coefficients of DNA-coated colloids on DNA-coated surfaces. We furthermore compare our model to a range of other models and assumptions found in the literature,and find ours is the most general, encapsulating others as special limits. Finally, we use our model to ask: when does a nanocaterpillar prefer to move by sliding, where one leg is always linked to the surface, or by hopping, which requires all legs to unbind simultaneously? We classify a range of nanocaterpillar systems (viruses, molecular motors, white blood cells, protein cargos in the nuclear pore complex, bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and DNA-coated colloids) according to whether they prefer to hop or slide, and present guidelines for materials design.","Marbach, Sophie; Zheng, Jeana Aojie; Holmes-Cerfon, Miranda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03112v2.pdf,166

T cells were isolated on histopaque density gradient by differential centrifugation, and were cultured with the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), free radical generator (H2O2/FeSO4) and with different concentrations of L1 and [Cu(L1)] (1 - 100 µM). Proliferation (MTT assay), cytokines (Elisa kits), ATP levels, cytotoxic effect (micronucleus test) and oxidative markers (glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents) were investigated after 48-h incubation. Our results showed that H2O2/FeSO4 treatment induced a reduction in T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion and ATP levels associated to an evident intracellular oxidative stress, inflammatory profile and DNA damage. Addition of L1 at 100 µM was able to increase cell proliferation, IL-2, IL-4 and INFÎ³ secretion and ATP contents and to reduce hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents, catalase activity and micronuclei number in lymphocytes under oxidative stress, with a partial protection. The [Cu(L1)] exhibited protective effects in T lymphocytes by inhibiting H2O2/FeSO4 - induced cell proliferation suppression, inflammatory status, ATP loss and oxidative stress generation, whatever the concentration used. In conclusion, in the situation of excessive oxidative stress, [Cu(L1)] treatment improved T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, ATP contents and oxidant/antioxidant status.

Objective: To determine whether the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine attenuates organ injury in patients with septic shock. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trial of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine vs placebo for adult patients with septic shock. Two hundred five patients were enrolled between February 9, 2018, and October 27, 2019, at 14 centers in the United States. Follow-up continued until November 26, 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive parenteral ascorbic acid (1500 mg), hydrocortisone (50 mg), and thiamine (100 mg) every 6 hours for 4 days (n = 103) or placebo in matching volumes at the same time points (n = 102). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0-24; 0 = best) between enrollment and 72 hours. Key secondary outcomes included kidney failure and 30-day mortality. Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in analyses. Results: Among 205 randomized patients (mean age, 68 [SD, 15] years; 90 [44%] women), 200 (98%) received at least 1 dose of study drug, completed the trial, and were included in the analyses (101 with intervention and 99 with placebo group). Overall, there was no statistically significant interaction between time and treatment group with regard to SOFA score over the 72 hours after enrollment (mean SOFA score change from 9.1 to 4.4 [-4.7] points with intervention vs 9.2 to 5.1 [-4.1] points with placebo; adjusted mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.2; P = .12 for interaction). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of kidney failure (31.7% with intervention vs 27.3% with placebo; adjusted risk difference, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = .58) or in 30-day mortality (34.7% vs 29.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2; P = .26). The most common serious adverse events were hyperglycemia (12 patients with intervention and 7 patients with placebo), hypernatremia (11 and 7 patients, respectively), and new hospital-acquired infection (13 and 12 patients, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with septic shock, the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SOFA score during the first 72 hours after enrollment.

Our study aimed to assess whether new Urology referrals could be triaged and have an outcome arranged virtually before being seen by a specialist in clinic, thereby reducing referral to investigation wait-times. Method: Retrospective data was collected from 23rd March to 8th May 2020 of new patient referrals consulted virtually in Urology outpatient clinics. Referrals were grouped into categories of presentation and outcome. Results: 642 new patients were consulted virtually during the study period. 181 (28.1%) had further imaging requested;of these, the presentations with the greatest proportion of patients with this outcome were those referred with imaging findings (50%), UTI/cystitis (43.1%) and scrotal symptoms (34.3%). 116 patients (18.1%) were added to the waiting list for procedures;85 were for flexible cystoscopy, for which the commonest indications were UTI/cystitis (36;55.4%) and haematuria (15;55.5%). Conclusions: Certain urological presentations can be triaged straight to investigation by when directly referred from Primary Care, thus reducing referral to investigation wait-time and increasing outpatient protocol efficiency.","Madathilethu, S.

Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n=26â758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020.

We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262-0.952], pâ¯=â¯0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088-2.524], pâ¯=â¯0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events. FINANCIAL SUPPORT: Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the ""Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia"" (EudraCT Number: 2020-001110-38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

However, the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection remained unknown. Sixty-seven COVID-19 patients from the previous cohort were enrolled and classified into 2 groups (7 with HBsAg+ and 60 with HBsAg-). The association of HBV- and SARS-CoV-2-related markers were analyzed. During the acute course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, markers of HBV replication did not extensively fluctuate during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coinfection with HBV did not extend the viral shedding cycle or incubation periods of SARS-CoV-2. Effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the dynamics of chronic HBV infection seemed not apparent.

Herein, we utilized an established nationwide system of wastewater sampling and viral concentration approaches to perform large-scale surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in nine different locations across Israel that were sampled from August 2020 to February 2021 and sequenced (n = 58). Viral sequences obtained from the wastewater samples had high coverages of the genome, and mutation analyses successfully identified the penetration of the B.1.1.7 variant into Israel in December 2020 in the central and north regions, and its spread into additional regions in January and February 2021, corresponding with clinical sampling results. Moreover, the wastewater analysis identified the B.1.1.7 variant in December 2020 in regions in which non-sufficient clinical sampling was available. Other variants of concern examined, including P.1 (Brazil/Manaus), B.1.429 (USA/California), B.1.526 (USA/New York), A.23.1 (Uganda) and B.1.525 (Unknown origin), did not show consistently elevated frequencies. This study exemplifies that surveillance by sewage is a robust approach which allows to monitor the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the community. Most importantly, this approach can pre-identify the emergence of epidemiologically or clinically relevant mutations/variants, aiding in public health decision making.","Bar-Or, Itay; Weil, Merav; Indenbaum, Victoria; Bucris, Efrat; Bar-Ilan, Dana; Elul, Michal; Levi, Nofar; Aguvaev, Irina; Cohen, Zvi; Shirazi, Rachel; Erster, Oran; Sela-Brown, Alin; Sofer, Danit; Mor, Orna; Mendelson, Ella; Zuckerman, Neta S",Sci Total Environ,,166
427490,"Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers with risk of mortality, severity or SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in COVID-19 patients: meta-analysis",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine has the potential to improve access to care; however, its utility in the field of sexual medicine remains in question. AIM: To examine the importance of video visits for the treatment of male sexual medicine at our academic center during the period of peak telemedicine use in April 2020. METHODS: We collected and compared deidentified data from all nonprocedure, adult outpatient encounters conducted as either office visits in April 2019 (n = 1,949) or video visits in April 2020 (n = 608). The primary International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10) labeled as diagnoses from all encounters were collected, with most encounters linked to several disease codes (n = 4,584). Demographic data were also collected. We performed comparative analyses on Stata (College Station, TX, USA) with significance set at &#945; = .05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease codes were categorized based on their use and classification in urological care and the proportion that each category made up within the outpatient practice was calculated. RESULTS: In comparison to the office visits, which took place in April 2019, male sexual medicine visits in April 2020, during the peak of telemedicine use, made up a significantly larger overall share of our practice (P = .012), defined by relative rises in encounters pertaining to male hypogonadism, infertility, penile abnormalities, and testicular abnormalities. Outpatients seen over video visits were also younger than outpatients seen during the previous year over office visits (58.9 vs 60.8, P = .008). Further, race and ethnicity characteristics in the outpatient population were unaffected during the period of telemedicine use. CONCLUSIONS: During the period of historically high telemedicine use following the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, encounters associated with male sexual medicine made up a significantly larger portion of our outpatient practice. Although the full influence of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be delineated, our findings suggest telemedicine use is compatible with the field of sexual medicine.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to analyze the imaging findings of pulmonary COVID-19 in a large pediatric series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by either quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs or presence of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and who underwent chest radiograph or CT or both were included in this retrospective multicenter study. Three pediatric radiologists independently reviewed radiographs and CTs to identify the presence, localization, distribution and extension of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: We included 140 children (71 female; median age 6.3 years, interquartile range 1.6-12.1 years) in the study. Peribronchial thickening (93%), ground-glass opacities (79%) and vascular engorgement (63%) were the most frequent findings on 131 radiographs. Ground-glass opacities (91%), vascular engorgement (84%) and peribronchial thickening (72%) were the most frequent findings on 32 CTs. Peribronchial thickening (100%), ground-glass opacities (83%) and pulmonary vascular engorgement (79%) were common radiograph findings in asymptomatic children (n=25). Ground-glass opacity and consolidation were significantly higher in children who needed intensive care admission or died (92% and 48%), in contrast with children with a favorable outcome (71% and 24%, respectively; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic children and those with mild symptoms of COVID-19 showed mainly peribronchial thickening, ground-glass opacities and pulmonary vascular engorgement on radiographs.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of hydroxychloroquine on day 90 mortality in this specific population. Methods: This retrospective, multicenter, propensity matched cohort analysis, used data of adult patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 3 university affiliated intensive care units between March 7, 2020, to April 7, 2020 in Lyon, France. Patients received either hydroxychloroquine (loading dose of 400 mg twice daily at day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily from day 2 to day 10) or standard of care without hydroxychloroquine. We compared all-cause mortality at day-90 after ICU admission between propensity score matched groups receiving hydroxychloroquine or standard of care. Results: A total of 157 patients were included with a day-28 and day-90 mortality rate of 23.6% and 32.5%, respectively. The median (interquartile) age was 67 years (56-76 years), 105 (66.9%) were men, 65 (41.4%) fulfilled criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 64 (41%) received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 10 days (4-10 days). In the propensity score matched cohort (59 patients in each group), day-90 mortality was 35.6% for patients who received HCQ and 23.7% for patients who did not (P=0.23). Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed no statistically significant association between HCQ therapy and mortality (P=0.20 by log-rank test). Conclusions: In this study, off-label use of HCQ in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was not associated with any significant change in medium-term prognosis, confirming results of studies in less severe patients.","Cour, M.; Amaz, C.; Bohe, J.; Rimmele, T.; Ovize, M.; Argaud, L.",Annals of Translational Medicine,,166
430812,"Fulminant Myocarditis, a Rare Case Associated with Sars-cov-2 Infection",2021,"BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic has a devastating impact on the economies and health care system of sub-Saharan Africa. Healthcare workers (HWs), the main actors of the health system, are at higher-risk because of their occupation. Serology-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HWs represent a measure of HWs exposure to the virus and a guide to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. This information is currently lacking in Ethiopia and other African countries. This study aimed to develop an in-house antibody testing assay, assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Ethiopian high-risk frontline HWs. Methods and findingsA cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted among HWs in five public hospitals located in different geographic regions of Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaire-based interviews. From consenting HWs, blood samples were collected between December 2020 and February 2021, the period between the two peaks of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The collected sera were tested using an in-house immunoglobin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies on sera collected from HWs. Of 1,997 HWs who provided a blood sample, demographic and clinical data, 50.5% were female, 74.0% had no symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and 29.0% had history of contact with suspected or confirmed patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall seroprevalence was 39.6%. The lowest (24.5%) and the highest (48.0%) seroprevalence rates were found in Hiwot Fana Specialized Hospital in Harar and ALERT Hospital in Addis Ababa, respectively. Of the 821 seropositive HWs, 224(27.3%) had history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. A history of close contact with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases was strongly associated with seropositivity (Adjusted odds Ratio (AOR) =1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8; p=0.015). ConclusionHigh SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels were observed in the five Ethiopian hospitals.

432249,Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy: what is the evidence?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic requires urgent modification to existing head and neck cancer diagnosis and management practices. A protocol was established that utilises risk stratification, early investigation prior to clinical review and a reduction in aerosol generating procedures to lessen the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 spread. METHODS: Two-week wait referrals were stratified into low, intermediate and high risk. Low risk patients were referred back to primary care with advice; intermediate and high risk patients underwent investigation. Clinical encounters and aerosol generating procedures were minimised. A combined diagnostic and therapeutic surgical approach was undertaken where possible. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were used to assess feasibility. Thirty-one per cent were low risk, 35 per cent were intermediate and 33 per cent were high risk. Thirty-three per cent were discharged with no imaging. CONCLUSION: Implementing this protocol reduces the future burden on tertiary services, by empowering primary care physicians to re-refer low risk patients. The protocol is applicable across the UK and avoids diagnostic delay.","Warner, E; Scholfield, D W; Adams, A; Richards, P; Ali, S; Ahmed, J; Ghufoor, K",J Laryngol Otol,,166

The coronavirus-associated death tolls have been increasing rapidly in a country. The provincial status of confirmed cases of coronavirus is higher in Punjab, followed by the Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and Balochistan. The case fatality ratio shows that KPK has a higher ratio, i.e., 5.11%, followed by the Punjab, i.e., 1.82%; Sindh, i.e., 1.80%; Balochistan, i.e., 1.28%; Gilgit-Baltistan, i.e., 0.71%; and Federal territory, i.e., 0.66%. The country has a less testing capacity to identify more suspected coronavirus patients. The study calculated that if we increase five times our testing capacity from the current date, the total registered cases will be reached to 137,370 and death tolls will increase up to 3090. It is highly needed to increase testing capacity across Pakistan in order to minimize the outbreak of coronavirus. The provincial government should follow the Federal Government instructions to contain coronavirus by increasing testing capacities, tracing suspected patients, smart lockdowns, emergency relief to the poor, and vigilant monitoring system.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Yousaf, Zahid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Vo, Xuan Hinh; Zaman, Khalid",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,166

(Special issue on new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) and the outbreak of the respiratory illness (COVID-19): part-VII.),2020,"BACKGROUND: Social media platforms such as YouTube are used by many people to seek and share health-related information that may influence their decision-making about COVID-19 vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to improve the understanding about the sources and content of widely viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Using the keywords ""coronavirus vaccination,"" we searched for relevant YouTube videos, sorted them by view count, and selected two successive samples (with replacement) of the 100 most widely viewed videos in July and December 2020, respectively. Content related to COVID-19 vaccines were coded by two observers, and inter-rater reliability was demonstrated. RESULTS: The videos observed in this study were viewed over 55 million times cumulatively. The number of videos that addressed fear increased from 6 in July to 20 in December 2020, and the cumulative views correspondingly increased from 2.6% (1,449,915 views) to 16.6% (9,553,368 views). There was also a large increase in the number of videos and cumulative views with respect to concerns about vaccine effectiveness, from 6 videos with approximately 6 million views in July to 25 videos with over 12 million views in December 2020. The number of videos and total cumulative views covering adverse reactions almost tripled, from 11 videos with approximately 6.5 million (11.7% of cumulative views) in July to 31 videos with almost 15.7 million views (27.2% of cumulative views) in December 2020.

OBJECTIVE: We compared daily large-scale RT-PCR test results to monitor recent reports of anosmia through a web-based app to assess the dynamics of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions among individuals with COVID-19 in France. METHODS: Between March 21 and November 18, 2020, users of the maladiecoronavirus.fr self-triage app were asked questions about COVID-19 symptoms. Data on daily hospitalizations, large-scale positive results on RT-PCR tests, emergency department visits, and ICU admission of individuals with COVID-19 were compared to data on daily reports of anosmia on the app. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, recent anosmia was reported 575,214 times from among approximately 13,000,000 responses. Daily anosmia reports during peak engagement with the app on September 16, 2020, were spatially correlated with the peak in daily COVID-19-related hospitalizations in November 2020 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [&#961;]=0.77; P<.001). This peak in daily anosmia reports was observed primarily among young adults (age range 18-40 years), being observed 49 days before the peak of hospitalizations that corresponded to the first wave of infections among the young population, followed by a peak in hospitalizations among older individuals (aged &#8805;50 years) in November 2020. The reduction in the daily reports of anosmia associated with the peaks in the number of cases preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by 10 and 9 days during the first and the second waves of infection, respectively, although the reduction in the positivity rates on RT-PCR tests preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by only 2 days during the second wave of infections. CONCLUSIONS: Data on daily reports of anosmia collected through a nationwide, web-based self-assessment app can be a relevant tool to anticipate surges in outbreaks, hospitalizations, and ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS: Providers and sponsoring organizations shared challenges and mechanisms for troubleshooting barriers during online webinars to provide support, education, and resources to SBHCs. DISCUSSION: Lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate the value of SBHCs, which continue to target barriers to health care access, protect the most vulnerable, and decrease the spread of disease. Telehealth implementation by SBHCs can support schools and communities, mitigate future strain on the health care system by continuing to keep youth from over-burdened emergency departments and provide needed mental health care.

Most of the universities in Vietnam were based on face to face learning until the sudden outbreak of COVID-19. This research study was conducted with 145 respondents and Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used for data analysis. The participants were undergraduate and post-graduate students in public and private universities who studied online during the pandemic in Vietnam. The purpose of this study was to understand what factors have an impact on students' intentions to study online. The results show that institutional support and perceived enjoyment (satisfaction) affects the students' intentions to study the course online in the future. Perceived enjoyment (PE) affects the online learning intentions (OLI) and PE is affected by ICT infrastructure and internet speed and access. Hence, this research adds new research variable defined as extrinsic factors (ICT infrastructure and access to the internet), which indirectly influences students' intentions to learn online. Given the increased use of smart phones with this generation, it is advisable to integrate mobile technology in online learning and QR codes can be one of the ways to integrate that in the course materials. It is further recommended that to increase the perceived enjoyment of the students with the online learning, the lecturers might be encouraged to use videos, audios and instant messaging to contact and provide the feedback to the students. It is important for universities to prepare for any such future crisis. This study results will provide a useful insight to design the online courses effectively by considering all the factors impacting students' intention and satisfaction.","Maheshwari, Greeni",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,166

The virus infects human using its spike glycoprotein mediated by a crucial area, receptor-binding domain (RBD), to bind to the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Mutations on RBD have been observed in different countries and classified into nine types: A435S, D364Y, G476S, N354D/D364Y, R408I, V341I, V367F, V483A and W436R. Employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we investigated dynamics and structures of the complexes of the prototype and mutant types of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBDs and hACE2. We then probed binding free energies of the prototype and mutant types of RBD with hACE2 protein by using an end-point molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. According to the result of MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations, we found that V367F and N354D/D364Y mutant types showed enhanced binding affinities with hACE2 compared to the prototype. Our computational protocols were validated by the successful prediction of relative binding free energies between prototype and three mutants: N354D/D364Y, V367F and W436R. Thus, this study provides a reliable computational protocol to fast assess the existing and emerging RBD mutations.

444375,Linear Regression Analysis to predict the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 6 weeks from day 0 (100 cases - March 14th 2020),2020,"In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. Six weeks later, the outbreak was successfully contained. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of interventions in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimated the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. We estimated R0 at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6-3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95% CI: 31-68 days), causing 9,216 more cases (95% CI: 1,317-25,545).","Liu, Quan-Hui; Bento, Ana I; Yang, Kexin; Zhang, Hang; Yang, Xiaohan; Merler, Stefano; Vespignani, Alessandro; Lv, Jiancheng; Yu, Hongjie; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Tao; Ajelli, Marco",PLoS Comput Biol,,166

447601,Negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing following COVID-19 infection in Two MS patients treated with ocrelizumab,2020,"BACKGROUND: Optimal management of patients with cancer during COVID-19 pandemic is still pending. METHODS: Our patients were advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, and planned cancer treatment was continued without unnecessary delays in an outpatient setting. Additional strict preventive infection measures were rapidly implemented at our outpatient department. When COVID-19 test became widely available, universal testing of healthcare workers and vigorous screening of all patients coming to our facility for COVID-19 infection were performed by SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR on rhinopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: As of the data cut-off on 9 April 2020, a total of 156 oncology patients with a median age of 67 (range 26-86) years and 63 haematology patients (median age 69 years, range 23-89) were screened for COVID-19 during active cancer treatment. Prevalence (1.8%; 4/219) of COVID-19 in patients with cancer was significantly higher compared with a respective control group of asymptomatic counterparts (p=0.018). Outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients were good, with only one observed death due to progression of advanced metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that continuation of anticancer treatment in epidemic areas during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be safe and feasible, if adequate and strict preventive measures are vigorously and successfully carried out.","Fong, Dominic; Rauch, Simon; Petter, Christian; Haspinger, Eva; Alber, Monika; Mitterer, Manfred",,,166
451229,"Variations in respiratory pathogen carriage among a homeless population in a shelter for men in Marseille, France, March-July 2020: cross-sectional 1-day surveys",2021,"Introduction: Current guidelines recommend that patients given intravenous tPA (IV tPA) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) receive comprehensive stroke care for 24 hours post-treatment to monitor key physiologic variables. Early de-escalation of monitoring is likely feasible in a particular subset of patients, which may have implications in the post-COVID era. In this study, we examined when patients with AIS are susceptible to early neurologic decline (END) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) after IV tPA and whether those at low clinical risk of neurologic deterioration may be suitable for earlier transition to lower level of care. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of AIS receiving IV tPA based on AHA/ASA guidelines. We included those that presented within 4.5 hours of last seen well (LSW) without large vessel occlusion (LVO) or flow-limiting stenosis (FLS) on non-invasive angiographic imaging. Outcomes included END (≥4-point worsening of NIHSS at 24 hours) from any cause, parenchymal hemorrhage (PH1 or PH2), and/ or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH;≥4-point NIHSS worsening with presence of hemorrhage). Results: 1238 patients were included from 1/2013 - 6/2019. END and ICH occurred in 7.4% (91) and 9.4% (116), respectively. 63.7% of patients with END did not have ICH within 24 hours. In those with NIHSS &lt;12, 82% had END within 12 hours and most occurred within 5 hours. Predictive factors included older patients (72.6 ±16.1 vs 69.1 ±14.8, p=0.03), history of tobacco use (OR-2.1 [1.1-4.3], p = 0.04) and hyperlipidemia (OR-1.7 [1.1-2.8] p = 0.02). ICH occurred within 12 hours in 30% of patients, predictors included older age (74.6 ± 12.4 vs 68.8 ± 15.1, p ≤ 0.01), higher NIHSS (14.6 ±7.3 vs 10.8 ± 7.9, p ≤ 0.01), and higher presentation serum glucose levels (155.1 ± 87.5 vs 140.4 ±70.5, p = 0.04). Overall, only 2.7% (33) of patients developed sICH. There were no independentpredictive factors for delayed ICH (≥ 12 hours). Conclusion: In our selected post-IV tPA patients, a relatively small proportion suffered sICH andEND;most often within 12 hours of tPA administration. These findings may support earlier de-escalation of higher acuity monitoring for clinically stable post-IV tPA patients.","Clark, A.; Shah, K.; Desai, S.; Jadhav, A.",Stroke,,166

METHODS: Participants were 273 [M (SD) age = 22 (2.1) years, 55% female, 32% from minoritized groups] EA completed an online survey of adherence to 11 preventative health behaviors recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during summer 2020. Participants rated adherence via a visual analog scale. Participants also reported demographic information and completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA). RESULTS: Median levels of adherence to preventative recommendations ranged from 66% to 100%. Highest adherence levels (Mdn > 90%) were reported for quarantining if exposed to COVID-19; covering mouth when sneezing; avoiding the elderly/those at high risk; and avoiding large gatherings. Median adherence was <80% for mask wearing; maintaining a 6-foot distance; avoiding in-person visits with romantic partners or friends; and disinfecting surfaces. Female gender was the only variable significantly associated with overall adherence, and it explained 4% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Following guidelines related to social distancing practices may be particularly challenging for EA, possibly because of unique developmental needs of this group, and males may be at greater risk for non-adherence to CDC recommendations. Therefore, public health messaging and adherence intervention development should be designed with males and social distancing practices in mind.","Feldman, Estée C H; Balistreri, Kathryn A; Lampert, Sara; Durkin, Lindsay K; Bugno, Lindsey T; Davies, W Hobart; Greenley, Rachel Neff",J. pediatr. psychol,,166

There is a demand for high throughput testing protocols that can be used for efficient and rapid testing of clinical specimens. We evaluated a pooled-PCR protocol for testing nasopharyngeal swabs using known positive/negative and untested clinical samples that were assigned to pools of 5 or 10. Six-hundred and thirty (630) samples were used in this study. Individual positive samples with Ct values as high as 33 could be consistently detected when pooled with 4 negative samples (pool of 5) and individual positive samples with Ct values up to 31 could be consistently detected when pooled with 9 negative samples (pool of 10). Pooling of up to 5 samples can be employed in laboratories for the diagnosis of COVID-19 for efficient utilization of resources, rapid screening of a greater number of people, and faster reporting of test results.","More, Sunil; Narayanan, Sai; Patil, Girish; Ghosh, Parna; Pushparaj, Samuel; Cooper, Emily; Ritchey, Jerry; Cheruvu, Vinay K; Kaul, Anil; Ramachandran, Akhilesh",J. clin. microbiol,,166

456870,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Vaccination,2021,"In this paper, we propose a novel robust stochastic optimization approach with a distinctive consideration for rare events, in which divergence measures are used to bound the event-wise ambiguity sets. This is done by using the Poisson distribution with uncertain expected value parameter to model rare events and showing that the distribution possesses theoretical properties that enable the derivation of rare-event probability bounds. We employ the proven bijection between the Bregman divergence and the Poisson distribution to characterize variations within the probability bounds, and demonstrate that the explicit use of the Poisson-specific Bregman divergence results in reduced conservatism in decision-making. Moreover, we derive a probability bound on this conservatism reduction, which is a concept akin to the popular probability of constraint violation in robust optimization. The bound shows that the rarer the event, the more the rare-event information becomes powerful. Finally, we provide tractable reformulations for our robust counterparts under rare events. Our computational study, based on a realistic case study involving 18 years of Brazilian flood and landslide data, reveals that our new approach generates significantly better decisions than state-of-the-art approaches that are not driven by rare events.","Caunhye, Aakil M.; Alem, Douglas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01930v2.pdf,166

The proposed color filter is mainly composed of the etalon structure to generate the color by the structural resonance properties while the upper layer of the etalon is made of plasmonic nanogratings to promote polarization-dependent color properties. When the duty ratio of the silver nanogratings is fixed, the proposed color filter can maintain identical optical properties for orthogonal polarization, while the etalon structure of the proposed color filter can manipulate different color information depending on the cavity height for the horizontal polarization. Finally, we experimentally confirm that polarization-dependent security images can be generated using the proposed color filters with a fixed duty ratio of various nanograting arrays.","Jung, Yonghee; Jung, Hyunseung; Choi, Hyunyong; Lee, Hojin",Nano lett,,166

This ecological study considered the five Brazilian macro-regions to be units of analysis, with its 26 states and the Federal District. The population was composed of all COVID-19 cases confirmed from April 14th to August 31st, 2020. The source used to collect data was the COVID-19 Monitoring Panel from the National Prison Department. Descriptive analysis, scan statistics, and time series were performed. A total of 18,767 COVID-19 cases were reported among the incarcerated population, 4,724 in São Paulo. The scan statistic analysis resulted in 14 spatial risk clusters for COVID-19 among persons deprived of liberty; the highest-risk cluster was in the Federal District. Although the country ends the series with a decreasing behavior, a growing trend was verified in most of the study period. The conclusion is that there is a need to implement mass testing among the incarcerated population while continually monitoring and recording COVID-19 cases.","Crispim, Juliane de Almeida; Ramos, Antônio Carlos Vieira; Berra, Thaís Zamboni; Santos, Márcio Souza Dos; Santos, Felipe Lima Dos; Alves, Luana Seles; Costa, Fernanda Bruzadelli Paulino da; Arcêncio, Ricardo Alexandre",Cien Saude Colet,,166

The aim of this study was to examine loneliness in relation to risk assessment, measures taken against risks, concerns, and social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. The cross-sectional study collected data from 3474 individuals from the USA, the UK, Norway, and Australia. Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Multiple linear regression was used in the analysis of associations between variables. The results showed that concerns about finances were more strongly associated with social loneliness, while concerns about the future was more strongly associated with emotional loneliness. Longer daily time spent on social media was associated with higher emotional loneliness. In conclusion, pandemic-related concerns seem to affect perceptions of loneliness. While social media can be used productively to maintain relationships, and thereby prevent loneliness, excessive use may be counterproductive.","Bonsaksen, Tore; Schoultz, Mariyana; Thygesen, Hilde; Ruffolo, Mary; Price, Daicia; Leung, Janni; Geirdal, Amy Østertun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,166

470092,The Limited Sensitivity of Chest Computed Tomography Relative to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infection: A Systematic Review on COVID-19 Diagnostics,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world and intensified health management in many parts of the world. Sensitivity in burn patients' care and prevalence of COVID-19 have a major impact on this group's healthcare system and infection control strategies. The purpose of this study is to review burn care strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study is a narrative review study. In writing this paper, to access information, the keywords of Coronavirus, COVID-19, burn, strategy, care, and SARS were used. Due to the emergence of COVID disease, searches in Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SID, Magiran, Springer, and Elsevier databases were performed without time limit. Research articles were purposefully selected and approved to be investigated based on the criteria for entering the research. A total of 14 articles had a full text related to the research scope. The researchers used qualitative content analysis to analyze the data. Data analysis was conducted as a comprehensive review of articles, qualitative conclusions, and results. RESULTS: In this study, 14 articles related to burn care strategies in the COVID-19 epidemic were selected. Their results were reviewed in two areas of staff care strategies and burn patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings indicate that appropriate prevention and protection strategies and measures should be followed to prevent the transmission of the COVID-19 virus to burn care professionals. In addition, burn patient care strategies were proposed in two levels of minor and moderate to severe burns, so that patients with burns receive adequate burn care during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: Implementation of staff and burn patient care strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to treat burn patients and prevent the spread of the COVID virus.","Delfani, F.; Shoghi, M.",International Journal of Burns & Trauma,,166

Recent reports from most frontline researchers have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can also cause fatal non-respiratory conditions, such as fatal cardiovascular events. One of the important mechanisms underlying the multiple organ damage that is now known to occur during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is impairment of vascular function associated with inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. To manage the risk of vascular dysfunction-related complications in patients with COVID-19, it would be pivotal to clearly elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells to cause vascular dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the development of vascular dysfunction in the acute phase of COVID-19.","Nakano, Hiroki; Shiina, Kazuki; Tomiyama, Hirofumi",Int. j. mol. sci.

482882,Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the WHO Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) criteria in Middle Eastern children under two years over three respiratory seasons,2020,"Interstitial axon branching is an essential step during the establishment of neuronal connectivity. However, the exact mechanisms on how the number and position of branches are determined are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of Arl8B, an adaptor molecule between lysosomes and kinesins. In chick retinal ganglion cells, downregulation of Arl8B reduces axon branch density and shifts their location more proximally, while Arl8B overexpression leads to increased density and more distal positions of branches. These alterations correlate with changes in the location and density of lysosomes and autophagosomes along the axon shaft. Diminishing autophagy directly by knockdown of atg7, a key autophagy gene, reduces branch density, while induction of autophagy by rapamycin increases axon branching, indicating that autophagy plays a prominent role in axon branch formation. In vivo, local inactivation of autophagy in the retina using a mouse conditional knockout approach disturbs retino-collicular map formation which is dependent on the formation of interstitial axon branches. These data suggest that Arl8B plays a principal role in the positioning of axon branches by spatially controlling autophagy, thus directly controlling formation of neural connectivity in the brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe formation of interstitial axonal branches plays a prominent role in numerous places of the developing brain during neural circuit establishment. We show here that the GTPase Arl8B controls density and location of interstitial axon branches, and at the same time controls also density and location of the autophagy machinery. Up- or down-regulation of autophagy in vitro promotes or inhibits axon branching. Local disruption of autophagy in vivo disturbs retino-collicular mapping. Our data suggest that Arl8B controls axon branching by controlling locally autophagy. This work is one of the first reports showing a role of autophagy during early neural circuit development and suggests that autophagy in general plays a much more prominent role during brain development than previously anticipated.","Adnan, Gee; Rubikaite, Aine; Khan, Moqadisa; Reber, Michael; Suetterlin, Philip; Hindges, Robert; Drescher, Uwe",J. neurosci,,166

485655,Understanding epidemic data and statistics: a case study of COVID-19. (Special issue on new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) and the outbreak of the respiratory illness (COVID-19): Part-IV.),2020,"BACKGROUND: Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Kalot, Mohamad A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Sultan, Shahnaz; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin. infect. dis,,166

The current and predicted development trends in applied technologies affecting industry worldwide as formulated in the Industry 4.0 initiative have clearly emphasized the needs for constantly adapting curricula. The sensible socioeconomic changes generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have induced significant challenges to society in general and industry. Higher education, specifically when dealing with Industry 4.0, must take these new challenges rapidly into account. Modernization of the industrial engineering curriculum combined with its migration to a blended teaching landscape must be updated in real-time with real-world cases. The COVID-19 crisis provides, paradoxically, an opportunity for dealing with the challenges of training industrial engineers to confront a virtual dematerialized work model which has accelerated during and will remain for the foreseeable future after the pandemic. The paper describes the methodology used for adapting, enhancing, and evaluating the learning and teaching experience under the urgent and unexpected challenges to move from face-to-face university courses distant and online teaching. The methodology we describe is built on a process that started before the onset of the pandemic, hence in the paper we start by describing the pre-COVID-19 status in comparison to published initiatives followed by the real time modifications we introduced in the faculty to adapt to the post-COVID-19 teaching/learning era. The focus presented is on Industry 4.0. subjects at the leading edge of the technology changes affecting the industrial engineering and technology management field.

All models for COVID-19 epidemiology rely on parameters describing the dynamics of the infection process. The meanings of epidemiological parameters like R_0, R_t, the""serial interval""and""generation interval""can be challenging to understand, especially as these and other parameters are conceptually overlapping and sometimes confusingly named. Moreover, the procedures used to estimate these parameters make various assumptions and use different mathematical approaches that should be understood and accounted for when relying on parameter values and reporting them to the public. Here, we offer several insights regarding the derivation of commonly-reported epidemiological parameters, and describe how mitigation measures like lockdown are expected to affect their values. We aim to present these quantitative relationships in a manner that is accessible to the widest audience possible. We hope that better communicating the intricacies of epidemiological models will improve our collective understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and will help avoid possible pitfalls when using them.","Bar-On, Yinon M.; Sender, Ron; Flamholz, Avi I.; Phillips, Rob; Milo, Ron",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05362v1.pdf,166

496676,An Attenuation in the Incidence of Early Childhood Diabetes Correlates With Introduction of Rotavirus Vaccination in Israel,2020,"The rapid early spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. was experienced very differently by different socioeconomic groups and business industries. In this study, we study aggregate mobility patterns of New York City and Chicago to identify the relationship between the amount of interpersonal contact between people in urban neighborhoods and the disparity in the growth of positive cases among these groups. We introduce an aggregate Contact Exposure Index (CEI) to measure exposure due to this interpersonal contact and combine it with social distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of exposure on case growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth via contact exposure. Using the CEI, schools and restaurants are identified as high-exposure industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories are most effective. This analysis can be useful in providing insights for government officials targeting specific population groups and businesses to reduce infection spread as reopening efforts continue to expand across the nation.","Verma, Rajat; Yabe, Takahiro; Ukkusuri, Satish V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03698v1.pdf,166

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. RESULTS: 458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43-68)]; 56% of them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab). Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications.

506806,Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome and Rheumatic Diseases During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"AIMS & OBJECTIVES: A key measure to mitigate COVID-19 has been social distancing. Incorporating videoconferencing Apps in patients' handover process between HCWs can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This research aimed to describe PICU physicians' experience in using online videoconferencing App for handover during the pandemic. METHODS: This is a qualitative content analysis at a university hospital in Riyadh, KSA. Since May 15th, 2020, due to the pandemic, our PICU utilized Zoom® as a remote conferencing App, instead of face-to-face handover. After the IRB approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1-14th, 2020) through an online structured questionnaire. Demographic data and open-ended questions about the perceived efficacy of the remote handover were collected. The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. RESULTS: From the 36 PICU physicians who participated, 30 (83.3%) completed the survey. Participants included 6 attendings, 9 specialists, and 21 residents. They had variable previous teleconferencing experience (Table). Most physicians (75%) were comfortable conducting a remote endorsement. The majority found that SBAR handover elements were achieved through this remote handover process (Fig). The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. Perceived disadvantages were the paucity of non-verbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Videoconferencing Apps utilized for online handover could supplement traditional face-to-face ICU patients' endorsement during infectious disease outbreaks. Some changes should be implemented to optimize the users' experience.","Temsah, M.

One of the challenges is the scarcity of qualified instructors, and with COVID-19, another challenge is the difficulty with social distancing between learners and educators. The purpose of our study was to determine if ultrasound-naïve operators can learn ultrasound techniques and develop the psychomotor skills to acquire ultrasound images after reviewing SonoSim® online modules. METHODS: This was a prospective study evaluating first-year medical students. Medical students were asked to complete four SonoSim® online modules (aorta/IVC, cardiac, renal, and superficial). They were subsequently asked to perform ultrasound examinations on standardized patients utilizing the learned techniques/skills in the online modules. Emergency Ultrasound-trained physicians evaluated medical students' sonographic skills in image acquisition quality, image acquisition difficulty, and overall performance. Data are presented as means and percentages with standard deviation. All P values are based on 2-tailed tests of significance. RESULTS: Total of 44 medical students participated in the study. All (100%) students completed the hands-on skills evaluation with a median score of 83.7% (IQR 76.7-88.4%). Thirty-three medical students completed all the online modules and quizzes with median score of 87.5% (IQR 83.8-91.3%). There was a positive association between module quiz performance and the hands-on skills performance (R-squared = 0.45; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant association between module performance and hands-on performance for any of the four categories individually. In all four categories, the evaluators' observation of the medical students' difficulty obtaining views correlated with hands-on performance scores.

507427,SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in northeast Italy: A cross-sectional study on 916 patients,2020,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related policies have led to an unequal distribution of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. For Black women and birthing people, endemic vulnerabilities and disparities may exacerbate deleterious COVID-19 impacts. Historical and ongoing macro-level policies and forces over time have induced disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among Black women and birthing people, and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors continue to hold particular consequence. These factors induce detrimental psychological, health, and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people, as policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare contexts. The resulting consequences may form a 'vicious cycle', with upstream impacts that exacerbate upstream macro-level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population. Understanding the impacts of COVID-19 among Black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that can sufficiently conceptualize their multi-level, interacting, and dynamic nature. Thus, we advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities research and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

510511,Out of Sight but Not Out of Mind: Caring for Patients Receiving OPAT during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"Metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of many cancers, but how and when it contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted metabolomics and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is required for tumor cell immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells (NSCs) giving rise to tumors. Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD+ sensor, we show that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis through impaired NAD+ regeneration. Our work establishes a unique connection between cellular metabolism and immortalization of tumor-initiating cells.","Bonnay, François; Veloso, Ana; Steinmann, Victoria; Köcher, Thomas; Abdusselamoglu, Merve Deniz; Bajaj, Sunanjay; Rivelles, Elisa; Landskron, Lisa; Esterbauer, Harald; Zinzen, Robert P; Knoblich, Juergen A",Cell,,166

Compared to other countries, Seoul's approach has been highly nationalist and politicized, as the ruling party lauded its pandemic response as the global standard and linked it to a larger, leftist-nationalist agenda. This ""pandemic-leftist"" discourse peaked around the April 15 midterm elections, but subsided the following month, as domestic and foreign setbacks arose. To explain, firstly, a competitive-nationalist race to flatten the infection curve encouraged the government to infringe on the civil liberties of infected patients, and society to stigmatize them. Other countries contained Covid-19 without such rights violations and stigma. Secondly, critics distinguished between the government's relative success in pandemic response and its general failures in economic and foreign policies. Instead of asking other countries to learn from one's country, each country would do well to learn from the experiences of others and to continually improve its own policies.","Yi, Joseph; Lee, Wondong",Society,,166

Investment security is an important component of economic security, plays an important role during the sustainable development of the country's economy. Modern globalization processes play an important role during the development of the system for the formation and protection of investment security. In addition, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the identification of new negative factors, endogenous and exogenous changes, which have made significant adjustments to the development of a stable economy in the country. To combat this pandemic, a state of emergency was introduced, it concerned either an entire country or a separate region or a separate sphere. The countries of the world, for their part, introduced sanitary and epidemiological measures to avoid the spread of the disease. The rapid introduction of these measures, as well as the development and implementation of steps that dealt with mitigating the consequences of the pandemic, caused a slowdown in economic development not only in the countries of the world, but also in Ukraine. The main factor in determining the level of investment security can be a study of the state of the investment climate in the country. The pandemic significantly affected the stability of the economy, in particular, created a negative field for ensuring investment security. Investments, being a long-term ""feeding"" of the economy, is not only a key condition for modernizing the national economy, but also the main factor of its economic security. The ""safe"" properties of investments are determined by the ability to make capital investments and production savings at a level that guarantees sufficient rates of expanded reproduction, technological re-equipment and economic restructuring, directly increases the potential for protecting economic interests from threats of various approaches.

In this review, we applied data-driven approaches to evaluate the ability of each assay to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 leads. Multitarget assays were found to show advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency over single-target assays, whereas target-specific assays were more suitable for investigating compound mechanisms of action. Moreover, strict filtering with counter screens might be more detrimental than beneficial in identifying true positives.

The purpose of the study was to present the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Military Medical Academy, Sofia, Bulgaria. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted for a period of 3 months from March 2020 to June 2020 on this infection in our hospital. All participants were laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19. RT-PCR was performed for etiological diagnosis. The hospitalized patients were divided into two groups on admission, that is, nonsevere and severe. Results: One hundred thirty-eight COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and analyzed during the study period. The mean age was 52.9 years. Male was the dominant sex (sex ratio: male/female = 1/0.6). The leading clinical signs were fever, fatigue, cough, and headache. On comparative analysis of both groups (nonsevere and severe) was measured significant elevation of white blood cells (odds ratio [OR] = 1.238; p value = 0.006), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.021; p < 0.001), creatinine (OR = 1.037; p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (OR = 1.014; p = 0.040), lactate dehydrogenase (OR = 1.004; p < 0.001), ferritin (OR = 1.002; p < 0.001), fibrinogen (OR = 2.028; p < 0.001), and d-dimer (OR = 2.162; p = 0.002) in severe group than in nonsevere group. Interleukin 6 was tested in 17.4% of patients and high value was found-38.6 pg/mL (95% confidence interval: 16.5-60.7). Conclusion: The first Bulgarian retrospective study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was presented. Older age, male sex, comorbidity, and signs of dyspnea and nausea were estimated as higher risk factors for severe form.

METHODS: In this large prospective cohort study, lactating mothers (N = 2312) were included between October 12, 2020 and February 24, 2021. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine levels of IgA antibodies in human milk and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in serum against the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RESULTS: A total of 691 (30.6%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human milk and/or serum. Of these participants, 524 (23.1%) had IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk, and 356 (15.7%) had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. A total of 199 (8.8%) participants had antibodies in both human milk and serum. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies in human milk remain present at least 10 months after a polymerase chain reaction confirmed infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk was 23.1% in our cohort.

The mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses. Methods. We here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations. Findings. Our findings show a robust immune response to the Spike proteins RBD region after the first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time. Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose. Interpretation. The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Funding.

This paper explores the longitudinal relationship between resilience and PTG, as well as the role of job burnout in this relationship, among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic, who have been exposed to high‐risk work environments over extraordinarily long workdays. In Study 1, 134 Chinese frontline healthcare workers completed a three‐wave survey (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3) in February–May 2020. In Study 2, 401 frontline healthcare workers completed a cross‐sectional survey. The cross‐lagged analysis suggested that resilience at Time 1 positively predicted PTG at Time 2, which in turn positively predicted resilience at Time 3. PTG at Time 1 also positively predicted resilience at Time 2 (Study 1). However, job burnout was negatively related to both resilience and PTG; in particular, emotional exhaustion moderated the link between PTG and resilience (Study 2). Our findings support a cycle of reinforcement between resilience and PTG over time. The positive effect of PTG on resilience, however, is undermined by emotional exhaustion. Implications for future intervention research and workplace support are discussed.","Lyu, Yizhi; Yu, Yongju; Chen, Shuquan; Lu, Shuang; Ni, Shiguang",Appl Psychol Health Well Being,https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955174/,166

Political and governmental reforms impacted on immunization program sustainability both positively and negatively. This study aims to explore the sustainability of polio immunization in a decentralized health system taking lessons learned from a polio eradication initiative in Indonesia. METHODS: We collected qualitative data through in-depth interviews with 27 key informants from various backgrounds at district, provincial, and national levels, consisting of frontline workers, managers, and Non-government Organizations (NGOs). We conducted thematic analysis and triangulated using document reviews. We also conducted member checking and peer debriefing to ensure trustworthiness. RESULTS: Competing priority was identified as the significant challenge to sustain government commitment for polio immunization and AFP surveillance during the transition toward a decentralized health system. Variation of local government capacities has also affected immunization delivery and commitment at the sub-national level government. The government reform has led to a more democratic society, facilitating vaccine rejection and hesitancy. The multi-sector partnership played a significant role in maintaining polio immunization coverage. Strong and continuous advocacy and campaign were essential to raising awareness of the community and policymakers to keep polio in the agenda and to maintain the high polio immunization coverage.

This “cytokine storm” produces an excessive inflammatory and immune response, especially in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS), pulmonary edema and multi-organ failure. Alleviating this inflammatory state is crucial to improve prognosis. Pro-inflammatory factors play a central role in COVID-19 severity, especially in patients with comorbidities. In these situations, an overactive, untreated immune response can be deadly, suggesting that mortality in COVID-19 cases is likely due to this virally driven hyperinflammation. Administering immunomodulators has not yielded conclusive improvements in other pathologies characterized by dysregulated inflammation such as sepsis, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The success of these drugs at reducing COVID-19-driven inflammation is still anecdotal and comes with serious risks. It is also imperative to screen the elderly for risk factors that predispose them to severe COVID-19. Immunosenescence and comorbidities should be taken into consideration. In this review, we summarize the latest data available about the role of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 disease severity as well as potential therapeutic approaches to ameliorate it. We also examine the role of inflammation in other diseases and conditions often comorbid with COVID-19, such as aging, sepsis, and pulmonary disorders. Finally, we identify gaps in our knowledge and suggest priorities for future research aimed at stratifying patients according to risk as well as personalizing therapies in the context of COVID19-driven hyperinflammation.","de la Rica, Roberto; Borges, Marcio; Gonzalez-Freire, Marta",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072097/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.558898,166

There was a statistically significant negative correlation between serum iron levels and ADHD symptom severity. No correlation was found measuring serum ferritin levels. Conclusions Narcolepsy may be more common within ADHD patients than in the general population. Some of these patients could benefit from a change in medication. Low serum iron and ferritin levels could be relevant in ADHD pathophysiology. This requires further exploratory research.","Wilenius, Lukas; Partinen, Markku",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642351/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8436,166
595142,New clinical and seasonal evidence of infections by Human Parainfluenzavirus,2018-08-24,"Population genetic studies have clearly indicated that immunity and host defense are among the functions most frequently subject to natural selection, and increased our understanding of the biological relevance of the corresponding genes and their contribution to variable immune traits and diseases. Herein, we will focus on some recently studied forms of human adaptation to infectious agents, including hybridization with now-extinct hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, and admixture between modern human populations. These studies, which are partly enabled by the technological advances in the sequencing of DNA from ancient remains, provide new insight into the sources of immune response variation in contemporary humans, such as the recently reported link between Neanderthal heritage and susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, ancient DNA analyses, in both humans and pathogens, allow to measure the action of natural selection on immune genes across time and to reconstruct the impact of past epidemics on the evolution of human immunity.","Kerner, Gaspard; Patin, Etienne; Quintana-Murci, Lluis",Curr Opin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2021.04.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791521000455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992907/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791521000455,166

Initial treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction consists of individualized topical estrogen therapy and professional training in passive and active pelvic floor exercises with biofeedback, vibration plates, and a number of vaginal devices. The method of choice for the surgical repair of stress urinary incontinence consists of placement of a suburethral sling. A number of different methods are available for the surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse using either a vaginal or an abdominal/endoscopic approach and autologous tissue or alloplastic materials for reconstruction. This makes it possible to achieve optimal reconstruction both in younger women, many of them affected by postpartum trauma, and in older women later in their lives.

While COVID-19-related cognitive and psychological impairments are documented, long-term outcomes are not well understood as few case studies exist. The present case studies add to the growing body of literature describing the neuropsychological profile and outcomes in patients with a history of COVID-19 illness at 3 to 12 months post-illness. METHOD: Both patients had confirmed COVID-19 illness with symptoms including fever, headache, ageusia, anosmia, and fatigue. An MRI/DTI/MRS of the brain showed significant changes for both patients. Self-reported cognitive symptoms at the initial evaluation (3 to 6 months post-illness) included problems with memory and attention for both patients. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and irritability were reported. RESULTS: On the initial assessment, both patients showed decline in learning and memory. One patient showed additional decline in attention, executive functions, and processing speed. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were elevated in both patients. Following the initial evaluation, one patient participated in formal cognitive remediation. At the five to ten month follow-up, both patients reported improvements in cognition and psychological functioning. Neurocognitive testing showed improvements across most cognitive domains though residual deficits were noted for one patient in memory and executive functions. Emotionally, symptoms of anxiety and depression remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Results add to the growing body of literature on the course of cognitive decline following COVID-19 illness. While significant cognitive recovery occurs within several months, residual cognitive and emotional problems can remain measurable up to a year post-illness.","Ostroy, Elena; Campbell, Irma",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acab062.101,166
597525,One Outbreak Could Hide Another,2021,"Virus-like particles (VLPs) have received considerable attention due to their potential application in veterinary vaccines and, in particular, VLPs from rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) have successfully shown to be good platforms for inducing immune responses against an inserted foreign epitope in mice. The aim of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of chimeric RHDV-VLPs as vaccine vectors in pigs. For this purpose, we have generated chimeric VLPs containing a well-known T epitope of 3A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Firstly, RHDV-VLPs were able to activate immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (poBMDCs) in vitro. Secondly, pigs were inoculated twice in a two-week interval with chimeric RHDV-VLPs at different doses intranasally or intramuscularly. One intramuscularly treated group was also inoculated with adjuvant Montanide™ ISA 206 at the same time. Specific IgG and IgA antibodies against RHDV-VLPs were induced and such levels were higher in the adjuvanted group compared with other groups. Interestingly, anti-RHDV-VLP IgA responses were higher in groups inoculated intramuscularly than those that received the VLPs intranasally. Two weeks after the last immunisation, specific IFN-γ-secreting cells against 3A epitope and against RHDV-VLPs were detected in PBMCs by ELISPOT. The adjuvanted group exhibited the highest IFN-γ-secreting cell numbers and lymphoproliferative specific T cell responses against 3A epitope and RHDV-VLP. This is the first immunological report on the potential use of chimeric RHDV-VLPs as antigen carriers in pigs.","Crisci, E.; Fraile, L.; Moreno, N.; Blanco, E.; Cabezón, R.; Costa, C.; Mussá, T.; Baratelli, M.; Martinez-Orellana, P.; Ganges, L.; Martínez, J.; Bárcena, J.; Montoya, M.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X12001077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22306796/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12001077; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.069,166

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We identified the proportion of normal, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the social distancing restrictions in adults from southern Brazil. An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Most of the participants (n = 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (June–July, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18–30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic. Public policies such as physical activity promotion and strategies to reduce the economic strain caused by this pandemic are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Feter, N.; Caputo, E.L.; Doring, I.R.; Leite, J.S.; Cassuriaga, J.; Reichert, F.F.; da Silva, M.C.; Coombes, J.S.; Rombaldi, A.J.",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620305011; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33387848/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620305011,166

We developed a Bayesian framework for the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (Bayesian SIR), and estimated its underlying parameters based on day-by-day timeseries of the cumulative number of infectious individuals. The new Bayesian framework extends the deterministic SIR model to a probabilistic form, which provides an accurate estimation of the underlying system by a short and noisy data. We applied it to the data reported on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and made a month long prediction on its evolution. Our simulated test using past timeseries to predict the current data gives a reasonable reliability of the proposed method. Our analysis of the current data detected and warned a rising trend in the countries in Central Asia, Middle East, and South America, while United States or European countries, which have already experienced large numbers of infected cases, are predicted to slow down in the increase.","Hidaka, Shohei; Torii, Takuma",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20094953v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20094953,166

Specifically, we simulate the child poverty reductions that would occur if every state were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in four key policies: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and state Child Tax Credits (CTC). We find that adopting the most generous or inclusive state EITC policy would have the largest impact on child poverty, reducing it by 1.2 percentage points, followed by SNAP, TANF, and lastly state CTC. If all states were as generous or inclusive as the most generous or inclusive state in all four policies, the child poverty rate would decrease by 2.5 percentage points, and five and a half million children would be lifted out of poverty.","Pac, Jessica; Garfinkel, Irwin; Kaushal, Neeraj; Nam, Jaehyun; Nolan, Laura; Waldfogel, Jane; Wimer, Christopher",Child Youth Serv Rev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190740919313209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362701/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919313209?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105030,166
605459,Interaction effects between angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and steroid or antiviral therapies in COVID‐19: A population‐based study,2021-03-09,"Spanish flu and other influenza outbreaks, the recent Zika epidemics, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are the most profound examples of severe widespread diseases that are caused by RNA viruses. Perhaps less well known yet dangerous RNA viruses cause deadly diseases such as polio, Ebola, measles, rubella, yellow fever, dengue fever and many others. To combat a particular viral disease by diminishing its spread and number of fatal cases, effective vaccines and antivirals are indispensable. Therefore, quick access to the means of discovery of new treatments for any epidemic outbreak is of great interest and in vitro biochemical assays are the basis of drug discovery. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands an affordable and reliable assay for testing antivirals. Here, we developed a quick and inexpensive high-throughput fluorescent assay to test inhibitors of viral proteases. Accordingly, we employed this assay to sample inhibitors for papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we validated this assay for screening inhibitors of flaviviral protease from the tick-borne encephalitis virus to emphasize a broad range of applications of our approach. This fluorescent high-throughput assay is based on fluorescent energy transfer (FRET) between two distinct fluorescent proteins (eGFP and mCherry) connected via a substrate polypeptide. When the substrate is cleaved, FRET is abolished and the change in fluorescence corresponds to reaction progress. Our data show that this assay can be used for testing the inhibitors in the 96 or 384 well plates format with robust and reproducible outcomes.","Cihlova, Bara; Huskova, Andrea; Böserle, Jiri; Nencka, Radim; Boura, Evzen; Silhan, Jan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.357418,166

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of some Covid-19 patients which suggests the possibility that the virus could additionally be transmitted via the orofecal route. Methods This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of Covid-19. We conduct ongoing searches using LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and Google for Covid-19; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Where necessary authors are contacted for further details or clarification on the content of their articles. Results We found 59 studies: nine reviews and 51 primary studies or reports (one cohort study also included a review) examining the potential role of orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Half (n=29) were done in China. Thirty seven studies reported positive fecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results (n=1,034 patients). Six studies reported isolating the virus from fecal samples of nine patients, one study isolated the virus from rectal tissue and one laboratory study found that SARS-CoV-2 productively infected human small intestinal organoids. Eleven studies report on fecal samples found in sewage, and two sampled bathrooms and toilets. Conclusions Various observational and mechanistic evidence support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and be shed from the human gastrointestinal tract.

Poor outcome in COVID‐19 is at least partly attributed to hypercoagulability, resulting in a high incidence of thromboembolic complications. It is unknown whether commonly used antithrombotic therapies may protect the vulnerable NH population with COVID‐19 against mortality. This study aimed to investigate whether the use of oral antithrombotic therapy (OAT) was associated with a lower mortality in NH residents with COVID‐19. DESIGN: A retrospective case‐series SETTING: 14 NH facilities from the NH organization Envida, Maastricht, the Netherlands PARTICIPANTS: 101 NH residents with COVID‐19 were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality. The association between age, sex, comorbidity, OAT, and mortality was assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 47.5% in NH residents from 14 NH facilities. Age, comorbidity and medication use were comparable among NH residents who survived and who died. OAT was associated with a lower mortality in NH residents with COVID‐19 in the univariable analysis (OR 0.89 95%CI 0.41‐1.95). However, additional adjustments for sex, age and comorbidity, attenuated this difference. Mortality in males was higher compared with female residents (OR 3.96 (95%CI 1.62‐9.65)). Male residents who died were younger compared to female residents (82.2 (SD 6.3) vs. 89.1 years (SD 6.8), p<.001). CONCLUSION: NH residents in the 14 facilities we studied were severely affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic, with a mortality of 47.5%. Male NH residents with COVID‐19 had worse outcomes than females. We did not find evidence for any protection against mortality by OAT, necessitating further research into strategies to mitigate poor outcome of COVID‐19 in vulnerable NH populations.

Physical therapy (PT) licensure processes vary internationally. The OSCE is the tool used in Canada to assess clinical competency for PT graduates seeking licensure. Previous studies that examined the measurement properties of OSCEs present contradictory results. OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to investigate the reliability and validity of OSCEs when administered to PTs during their education or as part of a licensure process. The second objective was to conduct a structured review to report PT educational and licensing components and policies in 17 countries with well-developed PT regulation systems. METHODS: An electronic search was performed in four databases from inception to 31(st) March 2021 to identify relevant articles. Two reviewers performed the critical appraisal of the included studies using a validated quality assessment tool. We deployed a random effects meta-analysis on reliability and validity estimates of OSCEs and examined sources of heterogeneity with univariate meta-regressions. We searched websites of professional regulatory bodies and associations for data on educational and licencing components and policies. Educational and licensing components across countries were synthesized descriptively. RESULTS: A pooled estimate of Cronbach’s alpha of 0.55, (95% CI: 0.41, 0.67) was determined for OSCEs. The pooled estimate of Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between assessors was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.83). The pooled estimate of Pearson Correlation between multiple OSCE stations’ scores was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.39); and between each station score and the total score was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.79). The pooled estimates for kappa Coefficients were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.86) and 0.84, (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91) for intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the standardised patient respectively. From the 17 included countries, Canada (excluding Quebec) was the only country that required both a clinical and written competency exam following graduation from an accredited PT program. Two countries (USA, UAE) required a written competency exam. The remaining 14 countries did not require an additional competency examination after completion of degree requirements from an accredited program. CONCLUSIONS: We found weak evidence that OSCE examinations items are internally consistent when used to assess PTs. Canada (excluding Quebec) is the only country out of 17 implementing a national clinical competency examination for their PT graduates to achieve licensure after completing professional degree requirements.","Bobos, Pavlos; Pouliopoulou, Dimitra V.; Harriss, Alexandra; Sadi, Jackie; Rushton, Alison; MacDermid, Joy C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34343213/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255696,166

Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.","Pirouz, Behzad; Golmohammadi, Amirsina; Saeidpour Masouleh, Hasti; Violini, Galileo; Pirouz, Behrouz",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337,166

Methods: Using a semi-structured interview guide, we carried out phone interviews with key hospital leaders in 11 of the 14 hospitals. The data were transcribed and coded into thematic areas. We draw on these interviews to describe the status and awareness of infection prevention and control. Results: The infection prevention and control committee members are training health workers on infection prevention and control procedures and proper use of personal protective equipment and in addition, providing technical support to hospital managers. While some hospitals have also accessed additional funds to improve infection prevention and control, they tended to be small amounts of money. Long-standing challenges with supplies of infection prevention and control materials and low staff morale persist. Crucially, the reduced supply of personal protective equipment has led to fear and anxiety among health care personnel. Conclusions: As funds are mobilised to support care for COVID-19, we ask that funds prioritise infection prevention and control measures. This would have a profoundly positive effect on within hospital virus transmission, patient and staff safety but also lasting benefits beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maina, Michuki; Tosas-Auguet, Olga; English, Mike; Schultsz, Constance; McKnight, Jacob",Wellcome Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16222.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204846/,166

In addition, an antiviral effect of rPoIFNγ was demonstrable against the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection of porcine epithelial cells and of pulmonary macrophages. A rabbit anti-PoIFNγ antiserum was prepared and shown to specifically neutralize the antiviral effects of natural and recombinant porcine IFNγ preparations. This antiserum could also neutralize recombinant bovine IFNγ but not recombinant human IFNγ. These results suggest antigenic homology of porcine and bovine IFNγ but antigenic differences between these molecules and human IFNγ.","Charley, B.; McCullough, K.; Martinod, S.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165242788900013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2847405/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165242788900013,166
610688,Quarantine for pandemic influenza control at the borders of small island nations,2009-03-11,"Antimicrobials have allowed medical advancements over several decades. However, the continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance restricts efficacy in treating infectious diseases. In this context, the drug repositioning of already known biological active compounds to antimicrobials could represent a useful strategy. In 2002 and 2003, the SARS-CoV pandemic immobilized the Far East regions. However, the drug discovery attempts to study the virus have stopped after the crisis declined. Today’s COVID-19 pandemic could probably have been avoided if those efforts against SARS-CoV had continued. Recently, a new coronavirus variant was identified in the UK. Because of this, the search for safe and potent antimicrobials and antivirals is urgent. Apart from antiviral treatment for severe cases of COVID-19, many patients with mild disease without pneumonia or moderate disease with pneumonia have received different classes of antibiotics. Diarylureas are tyrosine kinase inhibitors well known in the art as anticancer agents, which might be useful tools for a reposition as antimicrobials. The first to come onto the market as anticancer was sorafenib, followed by some other active molecules. For this interesting class of organic compounds antimicrobial, antiviral, antithrombotic, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties have been reported in the literature. These numerous properties make these compounds interesting for a new possible pandemic considering that, as well as for other viral infections also for CoVID-19, a multitarget therapeutic strategy could be favorable. This review is meant to be an overview on diarylureas, focusing on their biological activities, not dwelling on the already known antitumor activity. Quite a lot of papers present in the literature underline and highlight the importance of these molecules as versatile scaffolds for the development of new and promising antimicrobials and multitarget agents against new pandemic events.","Catalano, Alessia; Iacopetta, Domenico; Pellegrino, Michele; Aquaro, Stefano; Franchini, Carlo; Sinicropi, Maria Stefania",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477901/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10010092,166
610835,STATIN USE AND OUTCOMES IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION,2021-05-11,"Background: Periodontal disease is the leading cause of tooth loss worldwide. Current periodontal treatment is limited by its dependency on patients learning and maintaining good dental habits, and repeated visits to oral health physicians. Vitamin C’s role in collagen synthesis and immune function makes it important in wound healing and possibly periodontal healing. Therefore, if some patients are deficient, this may worsen patient outcomes. Methods: Patients were invited to participate following assessment and treatment at the Westmead Centre of Oral Health Periodontic Clinic, regardless of current disease stage or treatment. Adults were eligible if they gave informed consent and had current periodontal disease. Study involvement consisted of periodontal assessment and care followed by an interview and measurement of serum vitamin C and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: A total of 6 out of 20 patients had vitamin C levels less than the institutional normal range, of whom 2 had levels <11.4 μmol/L and one <28 μmol/L. Low vitamin C was associated with higher periodontal disease stage (p = 0.03). Elevated CRP was found in 2/3 of people with low vitamin C and CRP was negatively correlated with vitamin C (p < 0.01). Vitamin C did not correlate with patient-reported fruit or vegetable consumption, but high processed meat intake was associated with lower vitamin C. Conclusion: Although a small study, this rate of vitamin C deficiency in the periodontal clinic is clinically important and correlations with disease severity and CRP suggests biological importance. This warrants further studies to assess vitamin C and whether supplementation improves periodontal outcomes, particularly in deficient subjects.","Munday, Molly-Rose; Rodricks, Rohan; Fitzpatrick, Michael; Flood, Victoria M.; Gunton, Jenny E.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731485/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082255,166

Intriguingly, we report the first observation of SREBP-2 C-terminal fragment in COVID-19 patients’ blood and propose SREBP-2 C-terminal fragment as an indicator for determining severity. We confirmed that SREBP-2-induced cholesterol biosynthesis was suppressed by Sestrin-1 and PCSK9 expression, while the SREBP-2-induced inflammatory responses was upregulated in COVID-19 ICU patients. Using an infectious disease mouse model, inhibitors of SREBP-2 and NF-κB suppressed cytokine storms caused by viral infection and prevented pulmonary damages.

However, the potential mechanism underlying the antiarthritic efficacy of Majoon Chobchini has not been elucidated so far. This study was aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism and scientifically validate the therapeutic basis of Majoon Chobchini in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The anti-arthritic efficacy of Majoon Chobchini was demonstrated in vivo using complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritic rat model and adjuvant-induced arthritic fibroblast-like synoviocytes (AA-FLS). The expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and enzymes was evaluated in the serum and synovial tissues of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats. In-vitro, AA-FLS, and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were co-cultured to evaluate the formation and activity of osteoclasts using TRAP staining analysis and pit formation assay, respectively. RANKL and OPG levels were detected using western blotting and qRT-PCR analysis. Furthermore, the involvement of JAK-STAT-3 signaling in the therapeutic efficacy of Majoon Chobchini was evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. Majoon Chobchini significantly reversed the physical symptoms in AIA rats with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Notably, Majoon Chobchini alleviated cartilage degradation and bone erosion in AIA rats via inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT-3 signaling pathway in the AIA rats. Consistent with its effect in vivo, Majoon Chobchini decreased osteoclast inducing potential of AA-FLS and thus attenuated osteoclast formation and bone resorption in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that the JAK/STAT-3 signaling inhibition may underlie the mechanism through which Majoon Chobchini provides relief against RA symptoms.

However, little is known about the optimal timing, effects on outcome, and complications. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective, observational study. This study included 153 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients from 11 intensive care units (ICUs). The primary endpoint was the median time to tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Secondary endpoints were survival rate, length of ICU stay, and post-tracheostomy complications, stratified by tracheostomy timing (early versus late) and technique (surgical versus percutaneous). Results: The median time to tracheostomy was 15 (1–64) days. There was no significant difference in survival between critically ill COVID-19 patients who received tracheostomy before versus after day 15, nor between surgical and percutaneous techniques. ICU length of stay was shorter with early compared to late tracheostomy (p < 0.001) and percutaneous compared to surgical tracheostomy (p = 0.050). The rate of lower respiratory tract infections was higher with surgical versus percutaneous technique (p = 0.007).

While transplant activity has largely recovered, appropriate management of deceased donor candidates who are asymptomatic but have positive nucleic acid test (NAT) for COVID‐19 is unclear as this may reflect active infection or prolonged viral shedding. Furthermore, candidates who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated continue to receive donor offers. In the absence of prospective data, transplant professionals at U.S. adult kidney transplant centers were surveyed to determine community practice (N: 92 centers, capturing 40.8% of centers and 56.6% of transplants performed). The majority (96.8%) of responding centers declined organs for asymptomatic NAT+ patients without documented prior infection. However, 31.6% of centers proceeded with kidney transplant in NAT+ patients who were at least 30 days from initial diagnosis with negative chest imaging. Less than 7% of programs reported inactivating patients who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. In conclusion, despite national recommendations to wait for negative testing, many centers are proceeding with transplant in patients with positive tests due to presumed viral shedding. Furthermore, very few centers are requiring COVID‐19 vaccination prior to transplantation despite early evidence suggesting reduced immunogenicity in transplant patients on immunosuppression.

Maintaining social connections, however, became increasingly difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic when stay-at-home orders were enacted, and social distancing became necessary. This study examines the social connectivity among Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the importance technological availability, income, and race. METHODS: Data from the 2020 Medicare Beneficiaries Survey COVID supplement was used to evaluate social connectedness during the spring and fall of 2020. Binomial logistic regression evaluated the relationship between feelings of social connectedness and race/ethnicity, urban status of residence, income, availability of household technologies, internet access, and chronic conditions. RESULTS: Lower social connectivity is significantly correlated with race and income. Blacks had a nearly 30% higher likelihood of feeling socially disconnected than other racial groups. Individuals with chronic conditions, particularly cancer, were significantly more likely to feel socially disconnected. Internet access and the availability of technological devices decreased the odds of feeling socially disconnected by 20% and 15% respectively. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic decreased the social connectedness of many vulnerable groups specifically Blacks, those living with chronic conditions, and individuals with limited access to technology.

622282,Adrenal infections,2006-02-17,"BACKGROUND: The risk of tuberculosis (TB) is high among people with HIV (PWH). Heavy alcohol drinking independently increases TB risk and approximately 25% of PWH globally engage in heavy drinking. While isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy decreases TB incidence and mortality among PWH, heavy drinking during INH is associated with liver toxicity and poor adherence. Interventions are, therefore, urgently needed to decrease alcohol use and improve adherence to INH in this population in settings with high prevalence of HIV and TB like Uganda. METHODS: The Drinkers’ Intervention to Prevent TB (DIPT) study is a 2×2 factorial randomized controlled trial among HIV/TB co-infected adults (≥18 years) who engage in heavy alcohol drinking and live in Uganda. The trial will allocate 680 participants with a 1:1:1:1 individual randomization to receive 6 months of INH and one of the following interventions: (1) no incentives (control), (2) financial incentives contingent on low alcohol use, (3) financial incentives contingent on high adherence to INH, and (4) escalating financial incentives for both decreasing alcohol use and increasing adherence to INH. Incentives will be in the form of escalating lottery-based monetary rewards. Participants will attend monthly visits to refill isoniazid medications, undergo liver toxicity monitoring, and, except for controls, determine eligibility for prizes. We will estimate (a) the effect of incentives contingent on low alcohol use on reduction in heavy drinking, measured via a long-term objective and self-reported metric of alcohol use, at 3- and 6-month study visits, and (b) the effect of incentives contingent on high adherence to INH, measured as >90% pill-taking days by medication event monitoring system cap opening. We will use qualitative methods to explore the mechanisms of any influence of financial incentives on HIV virologic suppression. DISCUSSION: This study will provide new information on low-cost strategies to both reduce alcohol use and increase INH adherence among people with HIV and TB infection who engage in heavy drinking in low-income countries with high HIV and TB prevalence.

622593,Exploration of the Effectiveness of Social Distancing on Respiratory Pathogen Transmission Implicates Environmental Contributions,2008-11-15,"Selenium is an essential trace element. Although this chalcogen forms a wide variety of compounds, there are surprisingly few small-molecule organic selenium compounds (OSeCs) in biology. Besides its more prominent relative selenocysteine (SeCys), the amino acid selenomethionine (SeMet) is one example. SeMet is synthesized in plants and some fungi and, via nutrition, finds its way into mammalian cells. In contrast to its sulfur analog methionine (Met), SeMet is extraordinarily redox active under physiological conditions and via its catalytic selenide (RSeR’)/selenoxide (RSe(O)R’) couple provides protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other possibly harmful oxidants. In contrast to SeCys, which is incorporated via an eloquent ribosomal mechanism, SeMet can enter such biomolecules by simply replacing proteinogenic Met. Interestingly, eukaryotes, such as yeast and mammals, also metabolize SeMet to a small family of reactive selenium species (RSeS). Together, SeMet, proteins containing SeMet and metabolites of SeMet form a powerful triad of redox-active metabolites with a plethora of biological implications. In any case, SeMet and its family of natural RSeS provide plenty of opportunities for studies in the fields of nutrition, aging, health and redox biology.","Nasim, Muhammad Jawad; Zuraik, Mhd Mouayad; Abdin, Ahmad Yaman; Ney, Yannick; Jacob, Claus",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072794/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10060882,166
625145,The disease burden of influenza beyond respiratory illness,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: Migration is a challenging life transition that may be a source of various problems related to well-being and mental health. However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacy—the beliefs in one's ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. METHODS: The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of N = 280 participants aged at least 18 years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6 months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. DISCUSSION: The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland.

625435,Globalization and Infectious Diseases,2011-07-02,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 associated with the early COVID-19 period to investigate evolution of the virus in Pakistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied ninety SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between March and October 2020. Whole genome sequences from our laboratory and available genomes were used to investigate phylogeny, genetic variantion and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Pakistan. Site specific entropy analysis compared mutation rates between strains isolated before and after June 2020. RESULTS: In March, strains belonging to L, S, V and GH clades were observed but by October, only L and GH strains were present. The highest diversity of clades was present in Sindh and Islamabad Capital Territory and the least in Punjab province. Initial introductions of SARS-CoV-2 GH (B.1.255, B.1) and S (A) clades were associated with overseas travelers. Additionally, GH (B.1.255, B.1, B.1.160, B.1.36), L (B, B.6, B.4), V (B.4) and S (A) clades were transmitted locally. SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered with global strains except for ten which matched Pakistani isolates. RNA substitution rates were estimated at 5.86 x10(−4). The most frequent mutations were 5’ UTR 241C > T, Spike glycoprotein D614G, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P4715L and Orf3a Q57H. Strains up until June 2020 exhibited an overall higher mean and site-specific entropy as compared with sequences after June. Relative entropy was higher across GH as compared with GR and L clades. More sites were under selection pressure in GH strains but this was not significant for any particular site. CONCLUSIONS: The higher entropy and diversity observed in early pandemic as compared with later strains suggests increasing stability of the genomes in subsequent COVID-19 waves. This would likely lead to the selection of site-specific changes that are advantageous to the virus, as has been currently observed through the pandemic.","Ghanchi, Najia Karim; Nasir, Asghar; Masood, Kiran Iqbal; Abidi, Syed Hani; Mahmood, Syed Faisal; Kanji, Akbar; Razzak, Safina; Khan, Waqasuddin; Shahid, Saba; Yameen, Maliha; Raza, Ali; Ashraf, Javaria; Ansar, Zeeshan; Dharejo, Mohammad Buksh; Islam, Nazneen; Hasan, Zahra; Hasan, Rumina",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464419/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256451,166

The aim of this study was to characterize membrane‐bound ACE2 expression in the myocardium and myocardial vasculature in patients undergoing heart transplantation and to assess the effect of pharmacological ACE inhibition. METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular (LV) tissue was obtained from 36 explanted human hearts from patients undergoing heart transplantation. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies directed against ACE2 co‐registered with cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and α‐smooth muscle cell actin (SMA) was performed across the entire cohort. ACE2 receptor expression was quantitatively assessed throughout the myocardium and vasculature. ACE2 was consistently expressed throughout the LV myocardium (28.3% ± 22.2% of cardiomyocytes). ACE2 expression was also detected in small calibre blood vessels (range, 2–9 μm), albeit at quantitatively much lower levels (5% ± 9% of blood vessels). There was no significant difference in ACE2 expression between patients receiving ACE inhibitors prior to transplantation and ACE inhibitor‐negative controls (P > 0.05). ACE2 expression did not differ significantly between the different diagnostic groups as the underlying reason for heart transplantation (ANOVA > 0.05). N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) (R (2) = 0.37, P = 0.0006) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (R (2) = 0.13, P = 0.043) assessed by right heart catheterization were significantly correlated with greater ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes.

While the evidence to date has attempted to describe clinical feature of acute illness, recent reports have also begun to describe persistent symptoms that extend beyond the initial period of illness. Adverse outcomes, in addition to respiratory, have been found to occur at different levels: cardiovascular, neurological, or immunological; skin, gastrointestinal or renal manifestations. The detrimental effect on mental health has also been described, not only in COVID-19 patients. The burden of disease secondary to this pandemic is likely to be enormous and not limited to acute disease alone, thus epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the long-term impact of this disease.

629016,Reply to Su et al,2021,"The COVID‐19 pandemic is the greatest global crisis of our lifetimes, and leadership has been critical to societies’ capacity to deal with it. Here effective leadership has brought people together, provided a clear perspective on what is happening and what response is needed, and mobilized the population to act in the most effective ways to bring the pandemic under control. Informed by a model of identity leadership (Haslam, Reicher & Platow, 2020), this review argues that leaders’ ability to do these things is grounded in their ability to represent and advance the shared interests of group members and to create and embed a sense of shared social identity among them (a sense of “us‐ness”). For leaders, then, this sense of us‐ness is the key resource that they need to marshal in order to harness the support and energy of citizens. The review discusses examples of the successes and failures of different leaders during the pandemic and organizes these around five policy priorities related to the 5Rs of identity leadership: readying, reflecting, representing, realizing, and reinforcing. These priorities and associated lessons are relevant not only to the management of COVID‐19 but to crisis management and leadership more generally.","Haslam, S.

By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association (GWAS) summary datasets (N = 680,128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2 and upstream of IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P = 2.57*10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P = 1.8*10-24). Gene-based association analysis also found IFNAR2 was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (P = 2.58*10-7). Integrative genomics analysis of combining GWAS with eQTL data showed the expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility than those with non-G alleles.","Ma, Yunlong; Huang, Yukuan; Zhao, Sen; Yao, Yinghao; Zhang, Yaru; Qu, Jia; Wu, Nan; Su, Jianzhong",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195685; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195685v1?rss=1,166

Methods: This phase 1 study was done in one centre in Western Australia in 151 healthy adult volunteers in two age groups (18 to 54 and 55 to 75 years), allocated to 15 groups (nine young and six older adults) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, or 3 {micro}g, 9 {micro}g or 30 {micro}g SCB-2019, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding and ACE2-competitive binding IgG antibodies by ELISA, and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay; cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. Findings: We report on 148 participants with at least 4 weeks follow-up post dose 2. Three participants withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated SAE (pituitary adenoma). Vaccination was well tolerated, with few Grade 3 solicited adverse events (AE). Most local AEs were mild injection site pain, which were more frequent with formulations containing AS03 than CpG/Alum or unadjuvanted SCB-2019. Systemic AEs, mostly transient headache, fatigue or myalgia, were more frequent in young adults than older adults after the first dose, but similar after second doses. Unadjuvanted SCB-2019 elicited minimal immune responses, but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of AS03 or CpG/Alum induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both young and older adults. Titres were higher than those observed in a panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera in all AS03 groups and high dose CpG/Alum groups. Both adjuvanted formulations elicited Th1-biased CD4+ T cell responses. Interpretation: SCB-2019 trimeric protein formulated with AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.","Richmond, P.; Hetchual, L.; Dong, M.; Ma, B.; Hu, B.; Smolenov, I.; Li, P.; Liang, P.; Han, H.

This synthesis method comprises the preparation of GQDs via hydrothermal route, which should be conjugated to the L(Cysteine) functionalized core–shell magnetic structure with the core of about 7.5-nm iron oxide nanoparticle and 3.5-nm L(Cysteine) shell. L(Cysteine,) as a biocompatible natural amino acid, was used to link magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) with GQDs. X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray were used to investigate the presence and formation of MNPs, [Formula: see text] functionalized MNPs, and final hybrid nanostructure. Morphology and size distribution of nanoparticles were demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, the magnetic and optical properties of the prepared nanocomposite were measured by vibrating sample magnetometer, ultraviolet–visible, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results show that Fe(3)O(4)–L(Cysteine)–GQDs nanocomposite exhibits a superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic coercivity, which are 28.99 emu/g and 0.09 Oe, respectively. This nanocomposite also shows strong and stable emission at 460 nm and 530 nm when it is excited with the 235 nm wavelength.

When the membrane-spanning domain of a protein which is efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane (VSV G protein) is replaced with m1, the resulting chimera (Gm1) is retained in the Golgi (Swift, A. M., and C. E. Machamer. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115:19-30). When assayed in sucrose gradients, we observed that Gm1 formed a large oligomer, and that much of this oligomer was SDS resistant and stayed near the top of the stacking gel of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The unusual stability of the oligomer allowed it to be detected easily. Gm1 mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the m1 domain that were retained in the Golgi complex formed SDS-resistant oligomers, whereas mutants that were rapidly released to the plasma membrane did not. Oligomerization was not detected immediately after synthesis of Gm1, but occurred gradually with a lag of approximately 10 min, suggesting that it is not merely aggregation of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, oligomerization did not occur under several conditions that block ER to Golgi transport. The lumenal domain was not required for oligomerization since another chimera (alpha m1G), where the lumenal domain of Gm1 was replaced by the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, also formed an SDS-resistant oligomer, and was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gm1 as revealed by coprecipitation experiments. SDS resistance was conferred by the cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, because proteolytic digestion of the tail in microsomes containing Gm1 oligomers resulted in loss of SDS resistance, although the protease-treated material continued to migrate as a large oligomer on sucrose gradients. Interestingly, treatment of cells with cytochalasin D blocked formation of SDS-resistant (but not SDS- sensitive) oligomers. Our data suggest that SDS-resistant oligomers form as newly synthesized molecules of Gm1 arrive at the Golgi complex and may interact (directly or indirectly) with an actin-based cytoskeletal matrix. The oligomerization of Gm1 and other resident proteins could serve as a mechanism for their retention in the Golgi complex.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8397214/,166
635758,"CSBF/C10orf99, a novel potential cytokine, inhibits colon cancer cell growth through inducing G1 arrest",2014-10-29,"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) can cause a lethal disease in cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection has been recognised in experimentally infected cats, and cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of FIP. To evaluate the importance of cellular immunity for FIPV infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against feline interferon (fIFN)-γ were first created to establish fIFN-γ detection systems using the MAbs. Six anti-fIFN-γ MAbs were created. Then, the difference in epitope which those MAbs recognise was demonstrated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IFN-γ neutralisation tests. Detection systems for fIFN-γ (sandwich ELISA, ELISpot assay, and two-colour flow cytometry) were established using anti-fIFN-γ MAbs that recognise different epitopes. In all tests, fIFN-γ production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from cats experimentally infected with an FIPV isolate that did not develop the disease was significantly increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation in comparison with medium alone. Especially, CD8(+)fIFN-γ(+) cells, but not CD4(+)fIFN-γ(+) cells, were increased. In contrast, fIFN-γ production from PBMCs isolated from cats that had developed FIP and specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats was not increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation. These results suggest that cellular immunity plays an important role in preventing the development of FIP. Measurement of fIFN-γ production with the anti-fIFN-γ MAbs created in this study appeared to be useful in evaluating cellular immunity in cats.","Satoh, Ryoichi; Kaku, Ayumi; Satomura, Megumi; Kohori, Michiyo; Noura, Kanako; Furukawa, Tomoko; Kotake, Masako; Takano, Tomomi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",J Feline Med Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2011.01.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X1100026X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X1100026X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21334239/,166

However, little is currently known about the biology of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes polyproteins, four structural proteins and six accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of various mammals. The imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor pathway in the renin-angiotensin system leads to multi-system inflammation. The early symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough and fatigue. Vigilant screening is important. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Isolation and quarantine of suspected cases is recommended. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antiviral drugs/vaccines under investigation.","Das, Subir Kumar",Indian J Clin Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12291-020-00919-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837036/,166

IFN-I promote anti-viral defense through two main mechanisms. First, IFN-I directly reinforce or induce de novo in potentially all cells the expression of effector molecules of intrinsic anti-viral immunity. Second, IFN-I orchestrate innate and adaptive anti-viral immunity. However, IFN-I responses can be deleterious for the host in a number of circumstances, including secondary bacterial or fungal infections, several autoimmune diseases, and, paradoxically, certain chronic viral infections. We will review the proposed nature of protective versus deleterious IFN-I responses in selected diseases. Emphasis will be put on the potentially deleterious functions of IFN-I in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, and on the respective roles of IFN-I and IFN-III in promoting resolution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We will then discuss how the balance between beneficial versus deleterious IFN-I responses is modulated by several key parameters including (i) the subtypes and dose of IFN-I produced, (ii) the cell types affected by IFN-I, and (iii) the source and timing of IFN-I production. Finally, we will speculate how integration of this knowledge combined with advanced biochemical manipulation of the activity of the cytokines should allow designing innovative immunotherapeutic treatments in patients. Specifically, we will discuss how induction or blockade of specific IFN-I responses in targeted cell types could promote the beneficial functions of IFN-I and/or dampen their deleterious effects, in a manner adapted to each disease.","Tomasello, Elena; Pollet, Emeline; Vu Manh, Thien-Phong; Uzé, Gilles; Dalod, Marc",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25400632/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00526,166

OBJECTIVE: This study examined how stress was associated with mental well‐being and weight loss behaviors during the COVID‐19 pandemic among adults enrolled in an internet‐based weight loss program. METHODS: Participants enrolled in a weight‐loss program residing in Rhode Island or Massachusetts, USA, completed a brief survey on their mental health and current weight‐loss behaviors during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Surveys were completed between 14 April 2020 and 21 April 2020, approximately one month after stay‐at‐home orders were mandated. Linear regression was used to examine associations between stress, mental health, and weight‐loss behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 99 participants completed the survey (79% female, 91% white, 52.2 ± 9.8 years, 34.0 ± 5.2 kg/m(2), 77% reported moderate to extreme stress). Greater stress was associated with higher BMI (p = 0.04), higher education (p = 0.04), working more hours (p = 0.003), and having school‐age children at home (p = 0.002). Greater stress was also associated with higher levels of anxiety, worry, and concern regarding COVID‐19 (p's < 0.001) and having less time to spend on weight‐loss efforts (p < 0.001), after controlling for BMI and education. CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals enrolled in a weight‐loss program experienced more stress during COVID‐19 compared to before the pandemic. This stress was related to more mental health challenges as well as more difficulties finding time for weight management efforts.","Pellegrini, Christine A.; Webster, Jennifer; Hahn, Korina R.; Leblond, Tiffany L.; Unick, Jessica L.",Obes Sci Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680497/; https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.465,166

In most countries, rigorous measures of mitigation, including national or subnational lockdowns were established. The present work aimed at quantifying the effect of national lockdown in France on hospital occupancy. Methods. A compartmental model describing patient hospital flows was developed, where the effect of lockdown was quantified on the hospitalization rate. Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling. Results. French lockdown led to a hospitalization rate decreased by thrice from 12 days after its beginning. However, lockdown may not to have decreased either hospital occupancy or deaths in hospital, which would have been both decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was started 20 and 30 days before this date, respectively.

Herein, we report the experience of stroke neurologists from three European countries, Italy, France and Germany, that faced the pandemic at diverse time points and with different approaches, depending on their resources and health care system organization. Pre‐hospital and in‐hospital acute stroke pathways were reorganized to prioritize COVID‐19 management, and, in severely affected regions of Italy and France, stroke care was centralized to a limited number of centers while remaining stroke units were dedicated to COVID‐19 patients. The access to acute stroke diagnostics and time dependent therapies was limited or delayed because of reduced capacities of emergency services due to the burden of COVID‐19 patients. A marked reduction in the number of patients presenting with TIA and stroke was noted in the emergency departments of all three countries. Although we have only preliminary data, overall these conditions may have affected stroke outcome. These indirect effects of COVID‐19 pandemic could vanish the last years' efforts of stroke neurologists to improve outcome and reduce mortality of stroke patients. Although SARS‐Cov‐2 infection rate is slowing down in Europe, the effects of the ending lockdown in the next months are unpredictable. It is important for the European and world stroke community to share the experience learned so far to prepare for the next future and upcoming challenging times in the care of stroke patients.","Bersano, Anna; Kraemer, Markus; Touzé, Emmanuel; Weber, Ralph; Alamowitch, Sonia; Sibon, Igor; Pantoni, Leonardo",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32492764/,166

The aim is to shed light on the implementation of pandemic measures based on post hoc (after-the-fact) reactions and actions instead of pre hoc ones (in advance). Study Design: This study is based on weekly updates of pandemic variables (i.e., cases, tests, percentage of positive tests, hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, deceased, and 7- and 14-day incidence) in Sweden from the start of the pandemic in March 2020 until March 2021. Method: This study reports the empirical findings based on Swedish pandemic variables during 52 consecutive weeks, related to the pandemic, all of which has been divided into three time periods to separate the 1st and 2nd waves of the pandemic, and considers them all together as one time period. Results: The findings illustrate the implementation of pandemic measures and the subsequent consequences of a laissez-faire strategy characterized by blinkers. People become diseased and then deceased. This reveals strong associations between the assessed pandemic variables and its subsequent consequences on morbidity and mortality, based on post hoc reactions and actions. Conclusions: The implementation of a pandemic strategy should react and act pre hoc, and to take the safe with the unsafe. Governments and public health agencies should take into account the inevitable associations between pandemic variables. Intertwined pre hoc measures of prevention, enforcement, and monitoring should be implemented in society to avoid the implementation of a laissez-faire strategy based on post hoc reactions and actions.","Svensson, Göran; Rodriguez, Rocio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574473/,166

Many researchers have investigated COVID-19 misinformation, but none of them was related to social media users’ diverse responses to different types of COVID-19 misinformation, which could be a timely exploration. To bridge this gap in scholarly literature, the present study based on 11,716 comments from 876 Facebook posts on five COVID-19 misinformation seeks to answer two relevant research questions: (a) How ignorant social media users are about misinformation? (b) How do they react to different types of misinformation? Following a quantitative content analysis method, this study produces a few novel findings. The results show that most of the users trust misinformation (60.88%), and fewer can deny (16.15%) or doubt (13.30%) the claims based on proper reasons. The acceptance of religious misinformation (94.72%) surpassed other types of misinformation. Most of the users react happily (34.50%) to misinformation: the users who accept misinformation are mostly happy (55.02%) because it may satisfy their expectations, and the users who distrust misinformation are mostly angry (44.05%) presuming it may cause harm to people.

647447,Antimicrobial Resistance Determinants and Future Control,2005-06-11,"Bruton's Tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a TEC kinase with a multifaceted role in B-cell biology and function, highlighted by its position as a critical component of the B-cell receptor signalling pathway. Due to its role as a therapeutic target in several haematological malignancies including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia, BTK has been gaining tremendous momentum in recent years. Within the immune system, BTK plays a part in numerous pathways and cells beyond B-cells (i.e., T-cells, macrophages). Not surprisingly, BTK has been elucidated to be a driving factor not only in lymphoproliferative disorders but also in autoimmune diseases and response to infection. To extort this role, BTK inhibitors such as Ibrutinib have been developed to target BTK in other diseases. However, due to rising levels of resistance, the urgency to develop new inhibitors with alternative modes of targeting BTK is high. To meet this demand, an expanding list of BTK inhibitors is currently being trialled. In this review, we synopsize recent discoveries regarding BTK and its role within different immune cells and pathways. Additionally, we discuss the broad significance and relevance of BTK for various diseases ranging from the haematology and rheumatology to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, BTK signalling and its targetable nature have emerged as immensely important for a wide range of clinical applications. The development of novel, more specific and less toxic BTK inhibitors could be revolutionary for a significant number of diseases with yet unmet treatment needs.","McDonald, Charlotte; Xanthopoulos, Charalambos; Kostareli, Efterpi",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534359/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13416,166
647586,Are we forgetting the “universal” in universal masking? Current challenges and future solutions,2020-07-16,"Personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. However, conventional PPEs lack virucidal capabilities and arbitrarily discarding used PPEs may cause a high risk for cross-contamination and environmental pollution. Recently reported photothermal or photodynamic-mediated self-sterilizing masks show bactericidal-virucidal abilities but have some inherent disadvantages, such as generating unbearable heat during the photothermal process or requiring additional ultraviolet light irradiation to inactivate pathogens, which limit their practical applications. Here, we report the fabrication of a series of fabrics (derived from various PPEs) with real-time self-antiviral capabilities, on the basis of a highly efficient aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (namely, ASCP-TPA). ASCP-TPA possesses facile synthesis, excellent biocompatibility, and extremely high reactive oxygen species generation capacity, which significantly outperforms the traditional photosensitizers. Meanwhile, the ASCP-TPA-attached fabrics (ATaFs) show tremendous photodynamic inactivation effects against MHV-A59, a surrogate coronavirus of SARS-CoV-2. Upon ultralow-power white light irradiation (3.0 mW cm-2), >99.999% virions (5 log) on the ATaFs are eliminated within 10 min. Such ultralow-power requirement and rapid virus-killing ability enable ATaFs-based PPEs to provide real-time protection for the wearers under indoor light irradiation. ATaFs' virucidal abilities are retained after 100 washings or continuous exposure to office light for 2 weeks, which offers the benefits of reusability and long-term usability. Furthermore, ATaFs show no toxicity to normal skin, even upon continuous high-power light illumination. This self-antiviral ATaFs-based strategy may also be applied to fight against other airborne pathogens and holds huge potential to alleviate global PPE supply shortages.","Li, Bin; Wang, Dong; Lee, Michelle M S; Wang, Wei; Tan, Qingqin; Zhao, Zhaoyan; Tang, Ben Zhong; Huang, Xi",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c06071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313425/,166

Under certain specific conditions, neutrophils can exhibit a double-edged activity. This event has been implicated in COVID-19 among other conditions. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by promoting a pro-inflammatory and a procoagulant state leading to multiorgan failure. This particular form of host defense promoted by neutrophils is closely related to the well-known cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 patients.

Serial quantitative antibody measurements in the neonate showed the level of IgM was elevated at the day of birth and gradually declined to negative within 28 days of life, the levels of IgG declined gradually but still positive at 50th day of life. The dynamic change trend of antibody levels in the neonate was consistent with that in his mother.

Current antiviral strategies provide only limited protection. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) X1 is unique among NLR proteins in its functions as a pro-viral or antiviral factor to different viral infections. To date, the impact of NLRX1 on PRRSV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection promoted the expression of NLRX1 gene. In turn, ectopic expression of NLRX1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, whereas knockdown of NLRX1 enhanced PRRSV propagation in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Mechanistically, NLRX1 was revealed to impair intracellular viral subgenomic RNAs accumulation. Finally, Mutagenic analyses indicated that the LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domain of NLRX1 interacted with PRRSV Nonstructural Protein 9 (Nsp9) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) domain and was necessary for antiviral activity. Thus, our study establishes the role of NLRX1 as a new host restriction factor in PRRSV infection.","Jing, Huiyuan; Song, Tao; Cao, Sufang; Sun, Yanting; Wang, Jinhe; Dong, Wang; Zhang, Yan; Ding, Zhen; Wang, Ting; Xing, Zhao; Bao, Wenqi",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132368/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219302485; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219302485,166
653801,Outcome and prognostic factors of SARS CoV-2 infection in cancer patients: A cross-sectional study (SAKK 80/20 CaSA),2020-09-30,"Monocytes are crucial regulators of inflammation, and are characterized by three distinct subsets in humans, of which classical and non-classical are the most abundant. Different subsets carry out different functions and have been previously associated with multiple inflammatory conditions. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and poor reproducibility. Publicly available transcriptome profiles provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real-world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in cell levels. Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures maintain their accuracy regardless of disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing and are specific to their respective subset when compared to other immune cells from both myeloid and lymphoid lineages profiled across 6160 transcriptome profiles. Consequently, we show that these signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets. Our results demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and utility of our computational approach and provide a framework for the discovery of new cellular markers.","Vallania, Francesco; Zisman, Liron; Macaubas, Claudia; Hung, Shu-Chen; Rajasekaran, Narendiran; Mason, Sonia; Graf, Jonathan; Nakamura, Mary; Mellins, Elizabeth D.; Khatri, Purvesh",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.659255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054824/,166

With the unexpected appearance and quickly spreading of the virus, it is urgently necessary to figure out the mechanism of electron beam irradiation on COVID-19. In this study, we establish a virus structure and molecule model based on the detected gene sequence of Wuhan patient, and calculate irradiated electron interaction with virus atoms via a Monte Carlo simulation that track each elastic and inelastic collision of all electrons. The characteristics of irradiation damage on COVID-19, atoms’ ionizations and electron energy losses are calculated and analyzed with regions. We simulate the different situations of incident electron energy for evaluating the influence of incident energy on virus damage. It is found that under the major protecting of an envelope protein layer, the inner RNA suffers the minimal damage.

Recent studies have reported interactions between statin treatment and COVID-19-related outcomes. The study reported here specifically assessed the association between routine statin use and COVID-19-related outcomes in inpatients with T2DM. METHODS: The Coronavirus–SARS-CoV-2 and Diabetes Outcomes (CORONADO) study was a nationwide observational study aiming to describe the phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of T2DM patients with COVID-19 admitted to 68 French hospitals between 10 March and 10 April 2020. The composite primary outcome comprised tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 and 28 days of admission. The association between statin use and outcomes was estimated by logistic regression analysis after applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using a propensity score-weighting approach. RESULTS: Of the 2449 patients with T2DM (881 women, 1568 men; aged 70.9 ± 12.5 years) suitable for analysis, 1192 (49%) were using statin treatment before admission. In unadjusted analyses, patients using statins had rates of the primary outcome similar to those of non-users within both 7 (29.8% vs 27.0%, respectively; P = 0.1338) and 28 days (36.2% vs 33.8%, respectively; P = 0.2191) of admission. However, mortality rates were significantly higher in statin users within 7 (12.8% vs 9.8%, respectively; P = 0.02) and 28 days (23.9% vs 18.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). After applying IPTW, significant associations were observed with statin use and the primary outcome within 7 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.38 [1.04–1.83]) and with death within both 7 (OR [95% CI]: 1.74 [1.13–2.65]) and 28 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.46 [1.08–1.95]).

659889,Zoonotic Disease Programs for Enhancing Global Health Security,2017-12-11,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 vaccine from AstraZeneca (AZD1222) is one of several vaccines introduced to provide immunity against SARS‐CoV‐2. Recently, more than 50 cases have been reported presenting a combination of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and remarkably high levels of anti‐platelet factor 4 (PF4)/polyanion antibodies post‐AZD1222 vaccination. Now linked to the vaccine, the condition is referred to as vaccine‐induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. The European Medicines Agency still recommends vaccination with AZD1222, but several European countries have temporally paused and/or restricted its use because of the perceived risk of this severe side effect. Because there is no description of PF4/polyanion antibody testing in the clinical trials, knowledge about the prevalence of such antibodies in a vaccinated cohort is needed. OBJECTIVES: To investigate prevalence of thrombocytopenia and anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies in a population recently vaccinated with AZD1222. PATIENTS/METHODS: Four hundred and ninety‐two health care workers recently vaccinated with the first dose of AZD1222 were recruited from two hospitals in Norway. Study individuals were screened for thrombocytopenia and the presence of anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies with a PF4/PVS immunoassay. Side effects after vaccination were registered. RESULTS: The majority of study participants had normal platelet counts and negative immunoassay. Anti‐PF4/polyanion antibodies without platelet activating properties were only detected in six individuals (optical density ≥0.4, range 0.58–1.16), all with normal platelet counts. No subjects had severe thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: We found low prevalence of both thrombocytopenia and antibodies to PF4/polyanion‐complexes among Norwegian health care workers after vaccination with AZD1222.","Sørvoll, Ingvild Hausberg; Horvei, Kjersti Daae; Ernstsen, Siw Leiknes; Lægreid, Ingvild Jenssen; Lund, Svetlana; Grønli, Renathe Henriksen; Olsen, Magnus Kringstad; Jacobsen, Hege Karine; Eriksson, Anna; Halstensen, Anne Marie; Tjønnfjord, Eirik; Ghanima, Waleed; Ahlen, Maria Therese",J Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909350/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15352,166

It is unknown if hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) and community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) convey a distinct prognosis. METHODS: The study aim was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors associated with both CA-AKI and HA-AKI. Consecutive patients hospitalized at a reference center for COVID-19 were included in this prospective cohort study. RESULTS: We registered 349 (30%) AKI episodes in 1,170 hospitalized patients, 224 (19%) corresponded to CA-AKI, and 125 (11%) to HA-AKI. Compared to patients with HA-AKI, subjects with CA-AKI were older (61 years [IQR 49–70] vs. 50 years [IQR 43–61]), had more comorbidities (hypertension [44 vs. 26%], CKD [10 vs. 3%]), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (2 points [IQR 1–4] vs. 1 point [IQR 0–2]), and presented to the emergency department with more severe disease. Mortality rates were not different between CA-AKI and HA-AKI (119 [53%] vs. 63 [50%], p = 0.66). In multivariate analysis, CA-AKI was strongly associated to a history of CKD (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.53–11.3), hypertension (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01–2.36), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.32), and SOFA score (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.87–2.57).

AIM: To evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual functioning of individuals who declared no medical history of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A total of 1,356 participants filled out an Internet-based survey between June 1 and June 20, 2020. The data from these participants were analyzed to determine sexual functioning in terms of sexual intercourse frequency and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroups analyses were also performed, wherein the subgroups were developed according to the population density of the cities in which the participants lived to examine whether population density has any effect on the sexual functions of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual functioning. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.16 ± 8.31 years. There was a statistically significant difference between the participants according to the decrease in the number of weekly sexual intercourses when they were compared in terms of smoking status, alcohol consumption, marital and parental status, being a health-care worker, having a regular sexual partner, and the working status during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each). In the subgroup analyses, it was observed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups for change in the number of sexual intercourses, the number of masturbations, and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each).

665275,"A Laboratory Evaluation of Medicinal Herbs Used in China for the Treatment of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease",2013-03-10,"Applying life course theory, this study examined the direct and indirect effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), mediated by early sexual activity (first sexual experience before age 15), number of lifetime sex partners, and mental health problems. The link between ACEs and mental health on college students’ sexual risk is still understudied. Using cross-sectional data from a sample of 327 college students in Sierra Leone, this study tested the hypothesized mediation model using structural equation modeling analysis. The results showed that ACEs significantly increased sexual risks. Specifically, ACEs increased the risk of early initiation of sexual activity and the number of lifetime sex partners, which in turn increased the risk of STDs. Furthermore, ACEs significantly predicted negative mental health and were significantly associated with an increased risk of STDs.

Extensive discourse about disruptions to the standardized examinations students take in their final year of secondary school is symbolic of their high-stakes status worldwide. The interruptions provide an opportune moment to question the efficacy of exams as a measurement of achievement. To explore these issues, this article shares some on-the-ground illustrations from Australian teachers about how high-stakes exams shape their enactment of senior secondary history curriculum. The presence of a discourse of exam alignment, which places a disproportionate emphasis on preparing students for exams, has implications for teachers’ curricular practices and wider equity issues. These issues resonate in other international settings, especially during the pandemic. The severity of the Covid-19 economic downturn means it is more important than ever to investigate the relationship between curricular practices and socio-economic structures, to ensure examinations do not compound educational disadvantage.","Cairns, Rebecca",Prospects (Paris),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110277/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09515-9,166

However, the lncRNA expression and potential functions in porcine endemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and host defense are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the lncRNA expression profiles during PEDV infection in intestinal porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell lines by next-generation sequencing and identified 6188 novel lncRNAs. The functional annotation analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be associated with many immunity-related genes. We next selected candidate lncRNAs related to immune response pathways and further identified their differential expression in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells and newborn piglets. Our results demonstrated that PEDV infection regulated lncRNA expression patterns in both the IPEC-J2 cell line and piglet ileum. These findings provide the first large-scale survey of lncRNAs associated with PEDV infection, specifically the lncRNAs responsible for the activation of the immune system within the ileum.","Chen, Jianing; Zhang, Chenyu; Zhang, Na; Liu, Guangliang",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218303489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30471453/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218303489; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.11.007,166

Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This article discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), enteric viruses related infections, hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires’ disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation.

We sought to evaluate associations between chronic kidney disease (CKD), AKI, and mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a large multicenter registry including 8574 patients with COVID‐19 from 88 US hospitals, data were collected on baseline characteristics and serial laboratory data during index hospitalization. Primary exposure variables were CKD (categorized as no CKD, CKD, and end‐stage kidney disease) and AKI (classified into no AKI or stages 1, 2, or 3 using a modification of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline definition). The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality. The key secondary outcome was major adverse cardiac events, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, new‐onset nonfatal heart failure, and nonfatal cardiogenic shock. CKD and end‐stage kidney disease were not associated with mortality or major adverse cardiac events after multivariate adjustment. In contrast, AKI was significantly associated with mortality (stage 1 hazard ratio [HR], 1.72 [95% CI, 1.46–2.03]; stage 2 HR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.52–2.20]; stage 3 HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.44–1.98]; versus no AKI) and major adverse cardiac events (stage 1 HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.74–2.71]; stage 2 HR, 2.70 [95% CI, 2.07–3.51]; stage 3 HR, 3.06 [95% CI, 2.52–3.72]; versus no AKI).

672681,Zika virus outbreak and the case for building effective and sustainable rapid diagnostics laboratory capacity globally,2016-03-04,"The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has raised several novel ethical issues for global outbreak preparedness. It has also illustrated that familiar ethical issues in infectious disease management endure despite considerable efforts to understand and mitigate such issues in the wake of past outbreaks. To improve future global outbreak preparedness and response, we must examine these shortcomings and reflect upon the current state of ethical preparedness. To this end, we focus our efforts in this article on the examination of one substantial area: ethical guidance in pandemic plans. We argue that, due in part to their focus on considerations arising specifically in relation to pandemics of influenza origin, pandemic plans and their existing ethical guidance are ill-equipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of unique ethical challenges that may arise in other infectious disease pandemics. We proceed by outlining three reasons why this is so, and situate our analysis in the context of the EVD outbreak and the threat posed by drug-resistant tuberculosis: (1) different infectious diseases have distinct characteristics that challenge anticipated or existing modes of pandemic prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, (2) clear, transparent, context-specific ethical reasoning and justification within current influenza pandemic plans are lacking, and (3) current plans neglect the context of how other significant pandemics may manifest. We conclude the article with several options for reflecting upon and ultimately addressing ethical issues that may emerge with different infectious disease pandemics.","Smith, Maxwell J.; Silva, Diego S.",Monash Bioeth Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40592-015-0038-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507138/,166
673407,Ultrasound and Doppler findings in pregnant women with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection,2021-07-01,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most demanding conditions in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Management of analgesia and sedation in ARDS is particularly challenging. An expert panel was convened to produce a “state-of-the-art” article to support clinicians in the optimal management of analgesia/sedation in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, including those with COVID-19. Current ICU analgesia/sedation guidelines promote analgesia first and minimization of sedation, wakefulness, delirium prevention and early rehabilitation to facilitate ventilator and ICU liberation. However, these strategies cannot always be applied to patients with ARDS who sometimes require deep sedation and/or paralysis. Patients with severe ARDS may be under-represented in analgesia/sedation studies and currently recommended strategies may not be feasible. With lightened sedation, distress-related symptoms (e.g., pain and discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea) and patient-ventilator asynchrony should be systematically assessed and managed through interprofessional collaboration, prioritizing analgesia and anxiolysis. Adaptation of ventilator settings (e.g., use of a pressure-set mode, spontaneous breathing, sensitive inspiratory trigger) should be systematically considered before additional medications are administered. Managing the mechanical ventilator is of paramount importance to avoid the unnecessary use of deep sedation and/or paralysis. Therefore, applying an “ABCDEF-R” bundle (R = Respiratory-drive-control) may be beneficial in ARDS patients. Further studies are needed, especially regarding the use and long-term effects of fast-offset drugs (e.g., remifentanil, volatile anesthetics) and the electrophysiological assessment of analgesia/sedation (e.g., electroencephalogram devices, heart-rate variability, and video pupillometry). This review is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic given drug shortages and limited ICU-bed capacity.","Chanques, Gerald; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Devlin, John W.; Ely, E.

However, congestion and inefficient use of infrastructures still remain an issue. To guarantee comfort and reduce close contacts between people, there are circumstances when crowd density may have to be reduced well below safety limits. Although research has given a lot of attention to extreme scenarios, methods to improve non-critical conditions have been little explored. In addition, crowd sensing technology is still mostly used for data collection and direct use on crowd management is rare. In this work, we present a system aimed at computing optimal egress time for groups of people leaving a complex facility. We show that, if egress starting time is accurately computed for each group based on actual crowd conditions, density can be greatly reduced without having a large effect on the total egress time of the whole crowd. To show the efficacy of such a system, a small-scale experiment is conducted where all components are tested in a simple scenario. As a result, an increase in total egress time by only 5% allowed to reduce maximum density by 35%.","Murakami, Hisashi; Feliciani, Claudio; Shimura, Kenichiro; Nishinari, Katsuhiro",R Soc Open Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489284/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201465,166
674684,Perinatal Transmission of COVID-19 Associated SARS-CoV-2: Should We Worry?,2020-03-17,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a downstream effector of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway implicated in type 2 diabetes risk through genome-wide association studies. Although its expression is critical for adipocyte development, the potential roles of changes in adipose tissue TCF7L2 levels in diabetes risk are poorly defined. Here, we investigated whether forced changes in Tcf7l2 expression in adipocytes affect whole body glucose or lipid metabolism and crosstalk between disease-relevant tissues. METHODS: Tcf7l2 was selectively ablated in mature adipocytes in C57BL/6J mice using Cre recombinase under Adipoq promoter control to recombine Tcf7l2 alleles floxed at exon 1 (referred to as aTCF7L2 mice). aTCF7L2 mice were fed normal chow or a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Glucose and insulin sensitivity, as well as beta cell function, were assessed in vivo and in vitro. Levels of circulating NEFA, selected hormones and adipokines were measured using standard assays. RESULTS: Reduced TCF7L2 expression in adipocytes altered glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in male but not in female mice. Thus, on a normal chow diet, male heterozygote knockout mice (aTCF7L2het) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance at 16 weeks (p = 0.03) and increased fat mass (1.4 ± 0.1-fold, p = 0.007) but no changes in insulin secretion. In contrast, male homozygote knockout (aTCF7L2hom) mice displayed normal body weight but impaired oral glucose tolerance at 16 weeks (p = 0.0001). These changes were mechanistically associated with impaired in vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (decreased 0.5 ± 0.1-fold vs control mice, p = 0.02) and decreased levels of the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (0.6 ± 0.1-fold and 0.4 ± 0.1-fold vs control mice, p = 0.04 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Circulating levels of plasma NEFA and fatty acid binding protein 4 were increased by 1.3 ± 0.1-fold and 1.8 ± 0.3-fold vs control mice (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Following exposure to a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, male aTCF7L2hom mice exhibited reduced in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (0.5 ± 0.1-fold vs control mice, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Loss of Tcf7l2 gene expression selectively in adipocytes leads to a sexually dimorphic phenotype, with impairments not only in adipocytes, but also in pancreatic islet and enteroendocrine cells in male mice only. Our findings suggest novel roles for adipokines and incretins in the effects of diabetes-associated variants in TCF7L2, and further illuminate the roles of TCF7L2 in glucose homeostasis and diabetes risk.

COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 2.1 million people worldwide (23), with a global mortality rate of 2.2% (23). Current COVID-19 treatment options include supportive respiratory care, parenteral corticosteroids, and Remdesivir. Although COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with comorbidities, the vulnerability, clinical course, optimal management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with organ transplants has not been well described in the literature (9, 13). The treatment of COVID-19 differs, based on the organ(s) transplanted (6). Preliminary data suggested that liver transplant patients with COVID-19 did not have higher mortality rates than untransplanted COVID-19 patients (2). Table 1 depicts a compiled list of current published data on COVID-19 liver transplant patients. Most of these studies included both recent and old liver transplant patients. No distinction was made for early liver transplant patients who contract COVID-19 within their post-transplant hospitalization course. This potential differentiation needs to be further explored (14). Here, we report two patients who underwent liver transplantation who acquired COVID-19 during their post-transplant recovery period in the hospital. Case Descriptions Two patients who underwent liver transplant and contracted COVID-19 in the early post-transplant period. Treated with hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab and convalescent plasma. Description of their hospital course, including treatment and recovery. Conclusions The management of post-liver transplant patients with COVID‐19 infection is complicated. Strict exposure precaution practice following organ transplantation is highly recommended. Widespread vaccination will help with prevention, but there will continue to be patients who contract COVID-19. Therefore, continued research into appropriate treatments is still relevant and critical. A temporary dose reduction of immunosuppression and continued administration of low-dose methylprednisolone, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma might be helpful in the management and recovery of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in post-liver transplant patients. Future studies and experiences from post-transplant patients are warranted to better delineate the clinical features and optimal management of COVID-19 infection in liver transplant recipients.","Dale, Miles; Sogawa, Hiroshi; Seyedsasdat, Arman; Wolf, David C; Bodin, Roxana; Partiula, Bernard; Nog, Rajat; Latifi, Rifat; John, Devon; Veillete, Gregory; Diflo, Thomas; Nishida, Seigo",Transplant Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888342/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.03.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134521001986; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134521001986?v=s5,166

The aim of this study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 infections in nephrologists in the first and second pandemic waves, describing risk factors and clinical features. METHODS: This national survey was sent to Spanish nephrologists. Epidemiological data, comorbidities and medications were collected and compared between infected and non-infected nephrologists. Symptoms, prescribed treatments and outcomes are described for infected nephrologists. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-seven nephrologists (66% female, age 46 ± 11 years) completed the survey. Of them, 62 (19%) were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Infection was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the 37 symptomatic patients (62%) and by serological tests in 25 (38%) asymptomatic individuals. Five (8%) of the infected nephrologists were hospitalized. Contrary to the general population, most infections occurred during the first pandemic wave and, specifically, during the first month, when personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages were more severe. Factors associated with infection in univariate analysis were younger age (P = 0.004), work in non-nephrology departments (P = 0.045), higher exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 patients (P < 0.001), lack of appropriate PPE (P < 0.001) and non-O ABO blood group. In an adjusted multivariate model, only lack of appropriate PPE remained predictive of infection [hazard ratio 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.9–6.8), P < 0.0001].

681184,"Use of Revised International Health Regulations during Influenza A (H1N1) Epidemic, 2009",2009-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Cancer treatment is increasingly dependent on biomarkers for prognostication and treatment selection. Potential biomarkers are frequently evaluated in prospective-retrospective studies in which biomarkers are measured retrospectively on archived specimens after completion of prospective clinical trials. In light of the high costs of some assays, random sampling designs have been proposed that measure biomarkers for a random sub-sample of subjects selected on the basis of observed outcome and possibly other variables. Compared with a standard design that measures biomarkers on all subjects, a random sampling design can be cost-efficient in the sense of reducing the cost of the study substantially while achieving a reasonable level of precision. METHODS: For a biomarker that indicates the presence of some molecular alteration (e.g., mutation in a gene), we explore the use of a group testing strategy, which involves physically pooling specimens across subjects and assaying pooled samples for the presence of the molecular alteration of interest, for further improvement in cost-efficiency beyond random sampling. We propose simple and general approaches to estimating the prognostic and predictive values of biomarkers with group testing, and conduct simulation studies to validate the proposed estimation procedures and to assess the cost-efficiency of the group testing design in comparison to the standard and random sampling designs. RESULTS: Simulation results show that the proposed estimation procedures perform well in realistic settings and that a group testing design can have considerably higher cost-efficiency than a random sampling design.

682205,How to keep patients and staff safe from accidental SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the emergency room: Lessons from South Korea’s explosive COVID-19 outbreak,2020-07-30,"Sphingolipids are potent bioactive agents involved in the pathogenesis of various respiratory bacterial infections. To date, several sphingolipid derivatives are known, but S1P (Sphingosine-1-phosphate) and Ceramide are the best-studied sphingolipid derivatives in the context of human diseases. These are membrane-bound lipids that influence host-pathogen interactions. Based on these features, we believe that sphingolipids might control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE-II receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor) on epithelial cells for its entry and replication. Activation of the ACE-II receptor is indirectly associated with the activation of S1P Receptor 1 signaling which is associated with IL-6 driven fibrosis. This is expected to promote pathological responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 cases. Given this, mitigating S1P signaling by application of either S1P Lyase (SPL) or S1P analog (Fingolimod / FTY720) seems to be potential approach for controlling these pathological outcomes. However, due to the immunosuppressive nature of FTY720, it can modulate hyper-inflammatory responses and only provide symptomatic relief, which may not be sufficient for controlling the novel COVID-19 infection. Since Th1 effector immune responses are essential for the clearance of infection, we believe that other sphingolipid derivatives like Cermaide-1 Phosphate with antiviral potential and adjuvant immune potential can potentially control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host by its ability in enhancing autophagy and antigen presentation by DC to promote T cell response which can be helpful in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in novel COVID-19 patients.","Prakash, Hridayesh; Upadhyay, Dilip; Bandapalli, Obul Reddy; Jain, Aklank; Kleuser, Burkhard",Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098882320300976; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098882320300976?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2020.106504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147503/,166
684405,Pregnant versus non-pregnant SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Hospital Admissions: The first 4 weeks in New York,2020-04-15,"Objective: Correct and timely identification of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is critical in the emergency department (ED) prior to admission to medical wards. Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are a rapid alternative to Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 but have lower sensitivity. Methods: We evaluated the performance in real-life conditions of a strategy combining Ag-RDT and chest computed tomography (CT) to rule out COVID-19 infection in 1015 patients presenting in the ED between 16 November 2020 and 18 January 2021 in order to allow non-COVID-19 patients to be hospitalized in dedicated units directly. The combined strategy performed in the ED for patients with COVID-19 symptoms was assessed and compared with RT-PCR. Results: Compared with RT-PCR, the negative predictive value was 96.7% for Ag-RDT alone, 98.5% for Ag-RDT/CT combined, and increased to 100% for patients with low viral load. Conclusion: A strategy combining Ag-RDT and chest CT is effective in ruling out COVID-19 in ED patients with high precision.","Kepka, Sabrina; Ohana, Mickaël; Séverac, François; Muller, Joris; Bayle, Eric; Ruch, Yvon; Laugel, Elodie; Oberlin, Mathieu; Solis, Morgane; Hansmann, Yves; Bilbault, Pascal; Fafi Kremer, Samira",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10163455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441750/,166

The scope of the Blueprint extends to severe emerging diseases for which there are insufficient or no presently existing medical countermeasures or pipelines to produce them. In February 2018, WHO held an informal expert consultation to review and update the list of priority diseases, employing a prioritization methodology which uses the Delphi technique, questionnaires, multi-criteria decision analysis, and expert review to identify relevant diseases. The committee determined that, given their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines, there is an urgent need for accelerated R&D for (in no order of priority) Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever and Zika virus disease. The experts also included “Disease X,” representing the awareness that a previously unknown pathogen could cause a major public health emergency.

689422,Brief report of the first cured 2019-nCoV pneumonia patient in West China Hospital,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND: The burden of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted widely on the healthcare providers physically and mentally. Many healthcare providers are exposed to psychological stressors due to their high risk of contracting the virus. AIMS: This study aimed to measure the level of anxiety among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. In addition, this study aimed to measure the level of anxiety based on demographic characteristics. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was employed to recruit a convenience sample of healthcare providers. A pencil and paper self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from demographic and generalized anxiety disorder GAD-7 data. However, this study received written informed consent from participants of the study. In addition, the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group (IRB Log No. RC20.06.88-03). RESULTS: A total of 650 participants were recruited, results of GAD-7 showed that 43.5%, 28.9% and 27.5% of healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia experienced mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated that age, health specialty, nationality, and sleeping disorders before COVID-19 were associated with anxiety levels. CONCLUSION: The generalized anxiety among healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia was mild. Older healthcare providers were found to have a higher level of anxiety compared to other participating healthcare providers. Several factors may contribute to a higher level of anxiety including age, socioeconomic status, marital status, having chronic conditions, and sleeping disorder before the COVID-19 pandemic. To further understand the level of anxiety among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, longitudinal and mixed-method research is needed.","Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Mutairi, Alya; Alabbasi, Yasmine; Shamsan, Abbas; Al-Mahmoud, Sana; Alhumaid, Saad; Arshad, Muhammad zeshan; Awad, Mansour; Rabaan, Ali",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557359/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12119,166
689542,Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on Patient Access to Palliative Radiation Therapy,2005-01-31,"BACKGROUND: Modern transportation plays a key role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and new variants. However, little is known about the exact transmission risk of the virus on airplanes. METHODS: Using the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts on domestic airplanes departing from Wuhan city in China before the lockdown on January 23, 2020, we estimated the upper and lower bounds of overall transmission risk of COVID-19 among travellers. RESULTS: 175 index cases were identified among 5797 passengers on 177 airplanes. The upper and lower attack rates (ARs) of a seat were 0.60% (34/5622, 95%CI 0.43%-0.84%) and 0.33% (18/5400, 95%CI 0.21%-0.53%), respectively. In the upper- and lower-bound risk estimates, each index case infected 0.19 (SD 0.45) and 0.10 (SD 0.32) cases respectively. The seats immediately adjacent to the index cases had an AR of 9.2% (95%CI 5.7%-14.4%), with a relative risk 27.8 (95%CI 14.4-53.7) compared to other seats in the upper limit estimation. The middle seat had the highest AR (0.7%, 95%CI 0.4%-1.2%). The upper-bound AR increased from 0.7% (95%CI 0.5%-1.0%) to 1.2% (95%CI 0.4%-3.3%) when the co-travel time increased from 2.0 hours to 3.3 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The ARs among travellers varied by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the variation was not significant between the types of aircraft. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during domestic travel on planes was relatively low. These findings can improve our understanding of COVID-19 spread during travel and inform response efforts in the pandemic.","Hu, Maogui; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui; Ruktanonchai, Corrine W; Xu, Chengdong; Meng, Bin; Zhang, Xin; Carioli, Alessandra; Feng, Yuqing; Yin, Qian; Floyd, Jessica R; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Li, Zhongjie; Yang, Weizhong; Tatem, Andrew J; Lai, Shengjie",Clin. infect. dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549275/,166

This study focuses on the disclosure of budgetary information and its tension with vaguely defined state secrecy requirements in the Chinese context. Through a survey of three government departments that potentially involve state secrets across 36 Chinese municipalities, we find that there exists no consensus on whether to make budgetary information public, even for the same department across different jurisdictions. In addition, departments that chose disclosure vary considerably in the scope and depth of their transparency. Without having the boundaries clarified by law, disclosure by request, as a supplemental behavior to proactive disclosure, can rarely be successful. Our findings suggest that future legislation ought to clarify the legitimate scope of restrictions on budget transparency on the grounds of state secrecy.","Chen, Longjin; Zhang, Junling",East Asia (Piscataway),https://doi.org/10.1007/s12140-020-09345-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837182/,166

In this descriptive study, it was aimed to determine the stress, depression and burnout levels of front‐line nurses. Data were obtained from 705 nurses who worked at hospitals during the COVID‐19 pandemic between May and July 2020, using a Personal Information Form, the Perceived Stress Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The data collection tools were sent online to nurse managers, requesting front‐line nurses to answer the forms and scales. The nurses were mostly women and had bachelor’s degrees, single and worked as nurses for between 1 and 10 years. They had high levels of stress and burnout and moderate depression. Those who were younger and had fewer years of work experience felt inadequate about nursing care and had higher levels of stress and burnout. More burnout was detected in nurses who had a positive COVID‐19 test and did not want to work voluntarily during the pandemic. The authors suggest that preventive and promotive interventions in mental health should be planned and implemented to improve the mental health and maintain the well‐being of front‐line nurses during the pandemic, and to prepare nurses who may work during pandemics in the future.","Murat, Merve; Köse, Selmin; Savaşer, Sevim",Int J Ment Health Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222350/,166

A French Multi-Centric Ancillary Retrospective Study,2021-04-14,"Flavonoids, which form a major component in Houttuynia cordata Thunb., display a wide range of pharmacological activities. The expression of plant flavonoids is partly regulated by fermentation. Therefore, we studied the effects of fermentation on H. cordata in order to identify the strains present during the fermentation process, and to determine whether fermented H. cordata could be used as a probiotic. Our results showed that all 6 of the bacterial strains isolated from fermented H. cordata (FHC) belonged to the genus Bacillus. As expected, fermenting H cordata also increased the flavonoid content as increases were observed in the levels of rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin. To test the effects of fermentation, we treated LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with non-fermented H. cordata extracts (HCE) or FHC extracts (FHCE). Compared to the HCE-treated cells, the FHCE-treated cells showed increased viability. No cytotoxic effects were detected in the FHCE-treated groups in the 2 cell lines used in the study, namely, RAW264.7 and RBL-2H3. FHCE-treated HepG2 cells showed decreased growth, compared to HCE-treated HepG2 cells. These results indicate that the fermented H. cordata predominantly contained Bacillus strains. Furthermore, FHCE are able to prevent LPS-induced inflammatory effects and inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells.","Kwon, Ryun Hee; Ha, Bae Jin",Toxicol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24278599/; https://doi.org/10.5487/tr.2012.28.2.117,166
