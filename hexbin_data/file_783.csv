34708,Learning Mixed Traffic Signatures in Shared Networks,2020-05-26,"Gaussian noise estimation is an important step in some of the more recently developed noise removal methods. This is a difficult task and although several estimation techniques have been proposed recently, they generally do not produce good results. In a previous comparative study, among several noise estimation techniques, a method proposed in 2017 by Turajlić was found to give the best results. Although acceptable, they are still far from ideal. Therefore, several changes to this method are introduced in this paper to improve the estimation. Tests on monochromatic images contaminated with different levels of Gaussian noise showed that the modified method produces a significant improvement in the estimation of Gaussian noise, over 35%, at a slightly higher computational cost.","Forero, Manuel G.; Miranda, Sergio L.; Jacanamejoy-Jamioy, Carlos",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297579/,783
34711,Utilizing GPU Performance Counters to Characterize GPU Kernels via Machine Learning,2020-05-26,"The automatic recognition of human activities from video data is being led by spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), in particular two-stream architectures such as I3D that reports the best accuracy so far. Despite the high performance in accuracy of this kind of architectures, very little is known about what they are really learning from data, resulting therefore in a lack of robustness and explainability. In this work we select the appearance channel from the I3D architecture and create a set of experiments aimed at explaining what this model is learning. Throughout the proposed experiments we provide evidence that this particular model is learning the texture of the largest area (which can be the activity or the background, depending on the distance from the camera to the action performed). In addition, we state several considerations to take into account when selecting the training data to achieve a better generalization of the model for human activity recognition.","Oves García, Reinier; Sucar, L.

In this article, we tested a structured pointcloud segmentation method for extracting individual mangrove trees. Structure parameters of individual trees were estimated from the segmented pointcloud and its 3d geometry was generated using revolution surfaces. Estimated parameters were then assessed at both plot and tree levels using field data. It was observed that the number of segments in each test plot agreed well with the number of trees observed in the field. Nonetheless, the estimated parameters exhibited mixed accuracy with top height being the most accurate.","Silván-Cárdenas, José L.; Gallardo-Cruz, José A.; Hernández-Huerta, Laura M.",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297589/,783

34758,On the Potential of the Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Pure Binary Classification,2020-05-25,"Short text clustering is a challenging task due to the lack of signal contained in short texts. In this work, we propose iterative classification as a method to boost the clustering quality of short texts. The idea is to repeatedly reassign (classify) outliers to clusters until the cluster assignment stabilizes. The classifier used in each iteration is trained using the current set of cluster labels of the non-outliers; the input of the first iteration is the output of an arbitrary clustering algorithm. Thus, our method does not require any human-annotated labels for training. Our experimental results show that the proposed clustering enhancement method not only improves the clustering quality of different baseline clustering methods (e.g., k-means, k-means--, and hierarchical clustering) but also outperforms the state-of-the-art short text clustering methods on several short text datasets by a statistically significant margin.","Rakib, Md Rashadul Hasan; Zeh, Norbert; Jankowska, Magdalena; Milios, Evangelos",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298194/,783
34765,Generating Random Floating-Point Numbers by Dividing Integers: A Case Study,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and outcomes of early surgical ligation in preterm neonates with hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA) and to investigate predictors for surgical treatment after unsuccessful medical management. METHODS: Medical records from the neonatal intensive care unit of Hanyang University Seoul Hospital from January 2010 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. 233 preterm neonates weighing less than 1500g with HSPDA were enrolled in our study. Of these preterm neonates, 134 underwent surgical ligation and were subdivided into the early ligation group (n = 49; within 10 days of age) and the late ligation group (n = 85; after 10 days of age). RESULTS: The mean gestational age and birth weight were significantly lower in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation group than in the Non-ligation group (p < 0.001). PDA ductal diameter > 2.0 mm (p < 0.001), low Apgar score at 5 min (p = 0.033), and chorioamnionitis (p = 0.037) were the predictors for receiving surgical treatment for PDA. Early ligation was significantly associated with a low incidence of culture-proven sepsis (p = 0.004), mechanical ventilator time > 4 weeks (p = 0.007), necrotizing enterocolitis stage (NEC) ≥ III (p = 0.022), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade ≥ III (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical ligation minimizes the adverse effects of HSPDA in predicted preterm neonates who subsequently require surgical treatment for PDA. This result suggests that in preterm neonates weighing less than 1500g with HSPDA that is unresponsive to medical treatment, delayed ductal closure should be avoided to reduce severe NEC, severe IVH, culture-proven sepsis, and facilitate earlier endotracheal extubation.","Lee, Jun Ho; Lee, Hyun Ju; Park, Hyun-Kyung; Ahn, Ja-Hye; Kim, Hee Sun; Jang, Hyo Jun; Ro, Sun Kyun; Kim, Hyuck",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298442/,783
34773,SciNER: Extracting Named Entities from Scientific Literature,2020-06-15,"The World Health Organization (WHO), concludes that child maltreatment is a global concern calling for a multi sectoral interdisciplinary approach. School professionals, such as social workers, teachers, and health care professionals are in positions to discover and report maltreatment enabling social workers to intervene. However, a variety of reports reveal an evident gap between incidences and frequency of number of cases reported. A review of relevant research indicates that the problem of “not reporting” suggests that moral conflicts are activated in the process of decision-making. The aim was to gain a deeper understanding of school professionals’ experiences of reporting suspected neglect and abuse to the Social Welfare Board. In a mixed method approach 32 school professionals, such as teachers, social workers, nurses and psychologists participated in interviews and responded to questionnaires. Findings from the qualitative content analysis were compared to the quantitative analysis in a meta-analysis. Moral conflicts occur when faced with making decisions about how to best deal with a child’s situation. Thoughts about the child’s best interest and relationship with his/her parents as well as the informants´ own safety, were central. The comparative meta- analysis of both data sets revealed these conflicts commence with a moral sensitivity of possible negative consequences for the child. Moral sensitivity can be viewed as a “good” personal attribute, it paradoxically might lead to moral stress despite an open ethical climate. Based on the results of this study, further research on the interpersonal aspects of dealing with moral conflicts involved in reporting suspected child abuse is indicated.","Forsner, M.; Elvhage, G.; Ewalds-Kvist, B.

34775,"A Combination of Moment Descriptors, Fourier Transform and Matching Measures for Action Recognition Based on Shape",2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Pools of overlapping synthetic peptides are routinely used for ex vivo monitoring of antigen-specific T-cell responses. However, it is rather unlikely that these peptides match those resulting from naturally processed antigens. T-activated proteins have been described as immunogenic and more natural stimulants, since they have to pass through antigen processing and comprise activation of all clinically relevant effector cell populations. METHODS: We performed comparative analysis of numbers and cytokine expression pattern of CD4 and CD8 T cells after stimulation with recombinant, urea-formulated T-activated EBV-BZLF1, -EBNA3A, and HCMV-IE1, and -pp65 proteins or corresponding overlapping peptide pools. Freshly isolated and cryopreserved PBMC of 30 EBV- and 19 HCMV-seropositive and seven EBV- and HCMV-seronegative subjects were stimulated ex vivo and analysed for IFN-γ, TNF and IL-2 production by flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining. RESULTS: T-activated proteins showed a high specificity of 100% (EBV-BZLF1, HCMV-IE1, and -pp65) and 86% (EBV-EBNA3A), and a high T-cell stimulatory capacity of 73–95% and 67–95% using freshly isolated and cryopreserved PBMC, respectively. The overall CD4 T-cell response rates in both cohorts were comparable after stimulation with either T-activated protein or peptide pools with the exception of lower numbers of CD8 T cells detected after stimulation with T-activated EBV-EBNA3A- (p = 0.038) and HCMV-pp65- (p = 0.0006). Overall, the number of detectable antigen-specific T cells varied strongly between individuals. Cytokine expression patterns in response to T-activated protein and peptide pool-based stimulation were similar for CD4, but significantly different for CD8 T-cell responses. CONCLUSION: EBV and HCMV-derived T-activated proteins represent innovative, highly specific recall antigens suitable for use in immunological endpoint assays to evaluate success or failure in immunotherapy clinical trials (e.g. to assess the risk of EBV and/or HCMV reactivation after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). T-activated proteins could be of particular importance, if an impaired antigen processing (e.g. in a post-transplant setting) must be taken into account.","Körber, Nina; Behrends, Uta; Protzer, Ulrike; Bauer, Tanja",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298696/,783
34803,Ant Colony Optimization Implementation for Reversible Synthesis in Walsh-Hadamard Domain,2020-05-25,"Licensed vaccines or therapeutics are rarely available for pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. Developing interventions for specific pathogens and defining generalizable approaches for related pathogens is a global priority and inherent to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Nipah virus (NiV) poses a significant epidemic threat, and zoonotic transmission from bats-to-humans with high fatality rates occurs almost annually. Human-to-human transmission of NiV has been documented in recent outbreaks leading public health officials and government agencies to declare an urgent need for effective vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we evaluate NiV vaccine antigen design options including the fusion glycoprotein (F) and the major attachment glycoprotein (G). A stabilized prefusion F (pre-F), multimeric G constructs, and chimeric proteins containing both pre-F and G were developed as protein subunit candidate vaccines. The proteins were evaluated for antigenicity and structural integrity using kinetic binding assays, electron microscopy, and other biophysical properties. Immunogenicity of the vaccine antigens was evaluated in mice. The stabilized pre-F trimer and hexameric G immunogens both induced serum neutralizing activity in mice, while the post-F trimer immunogen did not elicit neutralizing activity. The pre-F trimer covalently linked to three G monomers (pre-F/G) induced potent neutralizing antibody activity, elicited responses to the greatest diversity of antigenic sites, and is the lead candidate for clinical development. The specific stabilizing mutations and immunogen designs utilized for NiV were successfully applied to other henipaviruses, supporting the concept of identifying generalizable solutions for prototype pathogens as an approach to pandemic preparedness.","Loomis, Rebecca J.; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B.

34902,"Evaluation of the Costs of Delayed Campaigns for Limiting the Spread of Negative Content, Panic and Rumours in Complex Networks",2020-05-23,"Nowadays, checkpoints have gained some relevance, given the increasing complexity of scientific applications for the use of many resources over a long period of time. Thus, in fault tolerance strategies, in addition to taking into account the impact that the application itself has on HPC systems, we must add the impact of the checkpoint. The checkpoint saves information about the application and the system in order to be able to restore the application, if necessary, in stable storage. The checkpoint can be considered as an intensive I/O application, so its storage need can have a great impact on the application. Therefore, in this paper, the analysis of the checkpoint’s I/O behavior is presented. The number of checkpoints to be performed in an application is often related to the maximum overhead that you want to introduce in the application. If we know the maximum overload the user wants to pay for and the overhead that a checkpoint introduces, we can calculate the number of checkpoints to be performed. This overhead depends significantly on the I/O operations. The PIOM-PX tool was used to analyze the spatial and temporal I/O patterns of the checkpoint. Based on this analysis, a model was designed to predict their behavior. This information is used to calculate the number of checkpoints to be performed in an application given a maximum overhead predefined by the user. This will allow us to understand what happens when a checkpoint is created in an HPC system, in order to make decisions that adapt to the user’s requirements.","León, Betzabeth; Gomez-Sanchez, Pilar; Franco, Daniel; Rexachs, Dolores; Luque, Emilio",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302326/,783

In a smart home, controlling the lights is as simple as speaking to a conversational assistant since everything is now Internet-connected. But despite their pervasiveness, most of the existent IoT systems provide limited out-of-the-box customization capabilities. Several solutions try to attain this issue leveraging end-user programming features that allow users to define rules to their systems, at the cost of discarding the easiness of voice interaction. However, as the number of devices increases, along with the number of household members, the complexity of managing such systems becomes a problem, including finding out why something has happened.

Classification, segmentation, and denoising of images are some of the most demanded tasks. In this study, we aim at enhancing optic nerve head images obtained by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). However, instead of directly applying noise reduction techniques, we use multiple state-of-the-art image Super-Resolution (SR) methods. In SR, the low-resolution (LR) image is upsampled to match the size of the high-resolution (HR) image. With respect to image enhancement, the upsampled LR image can be considered as low quality, noisy image, and the HR image would be the desired enhanced version of it. We experimented with several image SR architectures, such as super-resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), very deep Convolutional Network (VDSR), deeply recursive Convolutional Network (DRCN), and enhanced super-resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN). Quantitatively, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), the SRCNN, VDSR, and DRCN significantly improved the test images.

35012,A Hybrid Solution Method for the Multi-Service Location Set Covering Problem,2020-05-25,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Liver transplantation is an important therapeutic option for patients with life-limiting liver disease, which may present in the form of acute liver failure, end-stage chronic liver disease, primary hepatic cancers, or inborn metabolic disorders. While significant strides have been made with respect to liver transplantation outcomes, the practice is constrained by an organ supply/demand mismatch. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to review the general indications and contraindication to liver transplantation, and to provide an overview of the transplant evaluation process. These considerations ultimately shape the specific criteria for patient selection, which will continue to evolve as means are developed to expand the donor pool, improve surgical techniques, broaden indications for safe transplant, and extend the lifetime of a graft. RECENT FINDINGS: Selected patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma may be candidates for liver transplantation. Patients over 65 years may be transplant candidates if they possess a favorable comorbidity profile. Patients at body mass index extremes (≥ 40 or < 18.5) have increased post-transplant mortality and require nutritional evaluation. SUMMARY: Liver transplantation may be life saving for patients with acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease. It is therefore critical for healthcare providers caring for patients with liver disease to be familiar with the general indications for transplantation and to know when it is appropriate or inappropriate to refer for transplant evaluation.","Mahmud, Nadim",Curr Hepatol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302921/,783

Specifically, it affects financial leverage negatively in the eastern and the central regions, promotes profitability in the eastern region, and the asset quality in the western region. Besides, the negative effect on financial leverage and positive effect on profitability in the competitive industry is much higher as compared to the monopoly industry. Furthermore, an increase in private ownership enhances asset quality in the monopoly industry more than the competitive industry. The study concludes the positive nexus between increased private ownership and corporate performance of SOEs which provides an insight for the Chinese government to further ownership reforms and for SOEs to improve financial performance.","Ma, Lina; Xu, Fengju; Najaf, Iqbal; Taslima, Akther",Chin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7472947/,783

Indeed, the process, which is very costly in terms of time and intellectual investment, not only is not remunerated by the journals but it is also not openly recognized by the academic community as a relevant scientific output for a researcher. Therefore, scientific dissemination is affected in timeliness, quality and fairness. Here, to solve this issue, we propose a blockchain-based incentive system that rewards scientists for peer reviewing other scientists’ work and that builds up trust and reputation. We designed a privacy-oriented protocol of smart contracts called Ants-Review that allows authors to issue a bounty for open anonymous peer reviews on Ethereum. If requirements are met, peer reviews will be accepted and paid by the approver proportionally to their assessed quality. To promote ethical behaviour and inclusiveness the system implements a gamified mechanism that allows the whole community to evaluate the peer reviews and vote for the best ones.","Trovò, Bianca; Massari, Nazzareno",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972731/,783

Mmio removes the need for costly lookups in the DRAM I/O cache for cache hits, as they are handled in hardware via the virtual memory mechanism. In this work we present HugeMap, a custom mmio path in the Linux kernel that uses huge pages for file-backed mappings to accelerate applications with sequential I/O access patterns or large I/O operations. HugeMap uses huge pages to reduce CPU processing in the kernel I/O path compared to regular mmap. We explore the benefits and trade-offs of huge pages in HugeMap using microbenchmarks, IOR, and an in-house persistent key-value store designed for mmio.

48000,Spatial Knowledge in Large-Scale Environments: A Preliminary Planning-Oriented Study,2020-08-26,"The consequences of poverty, current technological innovation (the change of the nature of work) for the labour market and overall societal transformation strengthened the interest of governments, intergovernmental policy-making bodies and international experts in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This Declaration states that “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control”. The article alludes to a universal basic income/unconditional basic income (UBI)—a kind of cash welfare programme in which all citizens (or permanent residents) of a country receive a regular, liveable and unconditional amount of money from the government. Governments recommitted themselves to ensuring decent work and social protection for all through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Article 25 has never been implemented globally through appropriate government interventions and redistributive measures. Such measures are and have been pursued on a trial basis as evidenced by country experiences contained in this chapter. This could eventually open the door to a global basic income elsewhere in the world, framed on the specific needs and conditions of countries. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) likewise could explore whether such an unconditional income yields returns in terms of Inclusive Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID) within the framework of possible income and employment effects of UBI triggered by technical assistance and business support services. Such an endeavour would take UBI beyond its monetary threshold and make it a potential source of sustainable livelihoods for social wellbeing and income creation. In these unprecedented times, citizens in almost every country will face an uphill battle to address their socio-economic basic needs. The insecurity and great uncertainties caused by COVID-19 in 2020 and beyond, especially among the poor and small-scale businesses and subsistence farmers, will compel governments and UN agencies to develop new strategies. UBI, with all its variations, should be accepted as a universal condition and safety net for everyone.","Wijngaarde, Inez; Vinanchiarachi, Jebamalai; Readman, Jeff",Crime Prevention and Justice in 2030,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972746/,783

However, the usage of the cloud is different than traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and both algorithms and codes have to be adjusted. This work is often time-consuming and performance is not guaranteed. To address this problem we have developed the PCJ library (Parallel Computing in Java), a novel tool for scalable high-performance computing and big data processing in Java. In this paper, we present a performance evaluation of parallel applications implemented in Java using the PCJ library. The performance evaluation is based on the examples of highly scalable applications that run on the traditional HPC system and Amazon AWS Cloud. For the cloud, we have used Intel x86 and ARM processors running Java codes without changing any line of the program code and without the need for time-consuming recompilation. Presented applications have been parallelized using the PGAS programming model and its realization in the PCJ library. Our results prove that the PCJ library, due to its performance and ability to create simple portable code, has great promise to be successful for the parallelization of various applications and run them on the cloud with a similar performance as for HPC systems.","Nowicki, Marek; Górski, Łukasz; Bała, Piotr",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972801/,783

In our Introduction, we argued that the common underlying features of the language crisis in Anglophone countries often share one or more of the following components (named ‘linguistic myopias’): (a) ignoring how the context of Global English exacerbates language learning for Anglophone learners, often in combination with tacit assumptions that ‘English is enough’; (b) essentialising English L1 learners as somehow inherently incapable of language learning; (c) conceptualising both the problem, and its solution, within the remit of individual schools or universities; and finally (d) ignoring existing plurilingual skills within their own communities. By the same token, we saw many positive examples illustrating answers to the crisis, tackling one or several of these myopias.","Lanvers, Ursula; Thompson, Amy S.; East, Martin",Language Learning in Anglophone Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972902/,783

However, its comparative ease and the emphasized benefits in the light of COVID-19 (e.g., weight loss and immunization improvement) have led to the increase of IF adoption. A vast number of intermittent fasters have not sought consultation from health professionals, which can bring adverse health effects. Most intermittent fasters use mobile apps to get assistance for IF. Types of assistance offered by the IF mobile applications may range from tracking (e.g., fasting periods, calorie intake) to obtaining knowledge about IF. However, it is unclear how much people are using the features for learning more about IF which is crucial to making healthier decisions in the IF adoption process. Thus, we organized our study into two stages for establishing design implications that further encourage a safety-conscious and user-friendly IF experience. We first investigated how IF app users who have chosen apps that provide extensive IF-specific knowledge acquire the said knowledge via (i) topic modeling of user app reviews, (ii) detecting modularity in co-word maps drawn from reviews specific to IF information acquisition, (iii) locating the position of keywords indicating information acquisition in the reviews. Then, we examined how users judge the effectiveness of knowledge provision interfaces in obtaining information. We investigated this aspect with an interface ranking user task for information tabs and organized user rationale using manual coding and co-word mapping.","Ryu, Hyeyoung; Hong, Seoyeon","Diversity, Divergence, Dialogue",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972921/,783

From these data it emerges that the population (worldwide and in Italy) dealing with disability represents an important share of the total. These disabilities are linked not only with disease, but also with other situation due to age, size, language, culture, job, etc. For this reason, this paper analyses how the way of seeing and dealing disability is changed over time, starting from the Italian Standard evolution. Then the action of the WHO is analyzed. The two WHO focus points are: i) disability is a health condition in an unfavorable environment; ii) disability is not a problem of a minority group within a community, but an experience that everyone, in their lifetime, can experience. All of these analyses underlined the importance of the environment influence on life of every person. Finally, the concept of Universal design UD is investigated, highlighting the importance of recognizing and understanding that human beings will have different steps in their abilities throughout their life. The originality of this research is the shifting of the attention also to people normally served by poor services, such as people of small stature, the elderly, pregnant women, parents with children in strollers, people who speak different languages and more.","Pinna, Francesco; Garau, Chiara; Maltinti, Francesca; Coni, Mauro",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974213/,783

To contrast such pressures, protected coastal and marine areas have been promoted and established. This adds a further layer of complexity in areas where multiple (often competing and conflicting) uses coexist, each planned and regulated on its own. Hence, integration between planning tools in coastal areas represents a key issue, in particular in the Mediterranean basin, where (in principle) it has been addressed by both legally binding acts and voluntary agreements and charters concerning coastal zone management as well as marine spatial planning. This short contribution aims at proposing a framework that brings together principles from the current legal framework and can be applied to assess the level of integration in relation to planning and management of areas characterized by the coexistence of various nature protection regimes. In other words, this framework, which can easily applied in marine protected areas, allows for evaluating their performance in addressing a key aspect of sustainability.","Lai, Sabrina; Leone, Federica",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974216/,783

However, it is not clear whether virtual reality can also enhance situations involving concepts that are not inherently related to a three-dimensional space, such as the execution of a computer algorithm. This paper presents an immersive and interactive virtual reality simulator that can aid in the teaching of the memory management functionality of operating systems, including single, fixed and dynamic contiguous techniques, and the non-contiguous technique of paging. Learners are immersed inside a computer motherboard to learn memory management functionality of operating systems. They use a head-mounted display such as 3D virtual reality headsets and can interact with the environment using eye-gaze tracking and a joystick. We also present a case study in which 80 students were divided into two groups to evaluate the simulator. Our results indicate that using our simulator is a more effective approach for teaching memory management concepts than expositive classes. The functionality and usability tests results highlighted the positive aspects of the simulator and improvements that could be made.","Freitas, Luiz Felipe Santos; Ancioto, Alex Sandro Rodrigues; de Fátima Rodrigues Guimarães, Rita; Martins, Valéria Farinazzo; Dias, Diego Roberto Colombo; de Paiva Guimarães, Marcelo",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974223/,783

Here we present the preliminary results of a recent application of remote sensing micro-geophysical techniques to typical architectural targets such as vaults. A modified commercial Digital Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera was used to acquire multispectral datasets on portions of a painted vault. Multispectral datasets were used raw or after the application of a pre-processing step with a Multi Images Stacking (MIS) algorithm. Multispectral images were then processed with spatial wavelet decomposition, histogram enhancing, thresholds application, image fusion, false colors compositing and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. Software used have been GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and Mathworks MATLAB (which can be substituted for the processing steps proposed by the built-in functions of GNU OCTAVE open-source software). Processed images were able to highlight features on vault paintings revealing details of the surface or its very shallow layers which were impossible or very difficult to distinguish in raw data. In fact, they emphasized low-visible details, differences in apparently similar finishes or pigments, cracks and probably details of surface preparation.","Piroddi, Luca; Calcina, Sergio Vincenzo; Trogu, Antonio; Vignoli, Giulio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974264/,783

Land cover data, drawn from Copernicus, and LST, retrieved from Landsat 8 satellite images, are analyzed through a methodology that couples GIS and regression analysis. By looking at the Italian island of Sardinia as a case study, this research shows that urbanization and the spatial dynamics of heating phenomena are closely connected, and that intensively farmed areas behave quite similarly to urban areas, whereas forests are the most effective land covers in mitigating LST, followed by areas covered with Mediterranean shrubs. This leads to key policy recommendations that decision-makers could implement to mitigate LST at the regional scale and that can, in principle, be exported to regions with similar climate and land covers. The significance of this study can be summed up in its novel approach to analyzing the relationship between LST and land covers that uses freely available spatial data and, therefore, can easily be replicated in other regional contexts to derive appropriate policy recommendations.","Lai, Sabrina; Leone, Federica; Zoppi, Corrado",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974356/,783

48305,Virtual Testbed: Concept and Applications,2020-08-24,"In IoT software development, a method to implement software by focusing on data flow has been proposed, which is called dataflow programming. On the other hand, sensor devices are generally implemented in microcontrollers with limited resources for compactness, power savings and costs, so sensor devices are not suitable for executing data flow programs. In this paper, an environment running the scripting language mruby is described to execute a dataflow program on a small microcontroller. The execution of the data flow program is performed asynchronously by multiple nodes, which handle the sensor data. The execution environment of a dataflow program must support this style of execution. Since mruby can execute multiple programs concurrently, it is well suited to implement dataflow programs. By generating mruby code from a program developed in Node-RED, one of the popular dataflow programming environments, the mruby program is executed on a single-chip microcontroller, which includes mruby virtual machine.","Tanaka, Kazuaki; Tsujino, Chihiro; Maeda, Hiroyuki",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974680/,783
48310,Detection of Obstacle Features Using Neural Networks with Attention in the Task of Autonomous Navigation of Mobile Robots,2020-08-24,"The proposed research activity is based on the study and development of advanced monitoring techniques for the inspection and mapping of road infrastructures. Data detection (initial and periodic) is one of the most important phases of the process to be followed for the knowledge of the current state of road infrastructure and this is fundamental for the design and intervention choices. This operation can be done both through traditional (such as GNSS receivers, total motorized station and 3D laser scanner) and innovative tools (such as remote sensing, mobile mapping systems vehicles or road drones and APAs). Recently, technological development has offered the possibility to use tools that allow continuous detection of the object to be investigated, and there is the possibility to have multiple sensors at the same time that allow to make high-performance surveys. The aim of the research will be the design and implementation of an innovative measurement and component sensor system to be equipped on technological systems for data acquisition. The research also consists on the implementation of dedicated algorithms for the management of the amount of georeferenced data obtained and their representation on GIS (Geographic Information System) platforms as “open and updatable” thematic cartography. In this context, the establishment and update of the Road Cadastre is also included, intended (in our application) as a computer tool for storing, querying, managing and visualizating of all the data that the owner/manager acquired on its road network. In it will be possible to represent the elements inherent geometric characteristics elements of the roads and their relevance, as well as the permanent installations and services related to the needs of the circulation; in this way we can obtain a continuos updated database that allow rapid selective searches for topics.","Barrile, Vincenzo; Fotia, Antonino; Bernardo, Ernesto; Bilotta, Giuliana",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974685/,783

48335,Factors Affecting the Cost to Accuracy Balance for Real-Time Video-Based Action Recognition,2020-08-24,"Software security has become a primary concern for both the industry and academia in recent years. As dependency on critical services provided by software systems grows globally, a potential security threat in such systems poses higher and higher risks (e.g. economical damage, a threat to human life, criminal activity). Finding potential security vulnerabilities at the code level automatically is a very popular approach to aid security testing. However, most of the methods based on machine learning and statistical models stop at listing potentially vulnerable code parts and leave their validation and mitigation to the developers. Automatic program repair could fill this gap by automatically generating vulnerability mitigation code patches. Nonetheless, it is still immature, especially in targeting security-relevant fixes. In this work, we try to establish a path towards automatic vulnerability fix generation techniques in the context of JavaScript programs. We inspect 361 actual vulnerability mitigation patches collected from vulnerability databases and GitHub. We found that vulnerability mitigation patches are not short on average and in many cases affect not just program code but test code as well. These results point towards that a general automatic repair approach targeting all the different types of vulnerabilities is not feasible. The analysis of the code properties and fix patterns for different vulnerability types might help in setting up a more realistic goal in the area of automatic JavaScript vulnerability repair.","Hegedűs, Péter",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974712/,783
48340,Migration of Artificial Neural Networks to Smartphones,2020-08-24,"Community detection and centrality analysis in social networks are identified as pertinent research topics in the field of social network analysis. Community detection focuses on identifying the sub-graphs (communities) which have dense connections within it as compared to outside of it, whereas centrality analysis focuses on identifying significant nodes in a social network based on different aspects of importance. A number of research works have focused on identifying community structure in large-scale network. However, very less effort has been emphasized on quantifying the influence of the communities. In this paper, group of nodes that are likely to form communities are first uncovered and then they are quantified based on the influencing ability in the network. Identifying exact boundaries of communities are quite challenging in large scale network. The major contribution in this paper is to develop a model termed as FRC-FGSN (Fuzzy Rough Communities in Fuzzy Granular Social Network), to identify the communities with the help of fuzzy and rough set theory. The proposed model is based on a idea that, the degree of belongingness a node in a community may not be binary but can be models through fuzzy membership. The second contribution is to quantifying the influence of the community using eigenvector centrality. In order to improve the scalability, several steps in the proposed model have been implemented using map-reduce programming paradigm in a cluster-computing framework like Hadoop. Comparative analysis of FRC-FGSN with other parallel algorithms as available in the literature has been presented to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the algorithm.","Kumari, Anisha; Behera, Ranjan Kumar; Shukla, Abhishek Sai; Sahoo, Satya Prakash; Misra, Sanjay; Rath, Sanatanu Kumar",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974825/,783

The idea is to borrow from the As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) principle the concepts of the acceptability threshold and tolerability threshold of risk. Following this principle, generally used to assess the risk of human life loss, a risk is ALARP: when the costs for its mitigation appear to be disproportionate to the achievable benefits; that is when it lies between the unacceptable and the broadly acceptable region. To estimate the thresholds of acceptability and tolerability, the theoretical reference is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which enables to compare the investment risk not only to the return of the production sector in which the project under consideration falls, but also to the return of the market as a whole. The combined use of CAPM and statistical survey methods makes it possible to attribute the two risk thresholds to investments in a specific sector. In this paper, the focus is on risk assessment for building construction projects. For this production sector, the proposed analysis model is implemented with reference to official data concerning the Italian economy.","Maselli, Gabriella; Nesticò, Antonio; De Mare, Gianluigi; Merino Gómez, Elena; Macchiaroli, Maria; Dolores, Luigi",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974854/,783

Team effectiveness was considered as the result of the role played by thirteen variables: team trust (two dimensions), team psychological capital (four dimensions), collective behavior, transformational leadership, intragroup conflict (two dimensions), team psychological safety, and team cohesion (two dimensions). Results revealed that the biplot approach proposed was able to capture the most critical variables for the model and correctly assigned the signals and the strength of the regression coefficients. Regarding the response variable team performance, the most significant variables to the model were team efficacy, team optimism, and team psychological safety.

One of the reasons for that is a poor local economic development, which is caused also by the lack of efficient urban land management system in Serbia. Thus, in order to encourage sustainable urban development, local self-governments in Serbia need a new model of sustainable urban planning and urban land management that should include market-based instruments, like, investments, required for the urban renewal process triggering. Aiming to underpin this strategic ambitious, Serbian Ministry of construction, transport and infrastructure, Republic geodetic authority and Swedish partners are implementing a Project “Improvement of Investment Environment in Serbia” in order to establish a National Register of Investment Locations (NRIL) and related monitoring system, which would improve efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making process for the investment locations and urban land use management in general within 11 pilot local self-governments. Building of this register and its monitoring system would include development of an investment location data model, centralized database and 3 Web-based applications for the investment-related data collection and their interactive visualization using the Serbian National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework and advantages of its geoportal Geosrbija. Also, to increase the role of Serbian cities and strengthen corrective function of the urban plans and urban planning in general, one of the Project objectives is to provide a direct communication channel between the potential investors and local self-governments. Finally, it is expected that the Project results would be implemented in the other local self-governments in Serbia as well, and that they would contribute to the goals achievement of a recently adopted national Sustainable Urban Development Strategy 2030, as well as to some other strategic projects and initiatives launching in Serbia.","Živković, Ljiljana",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974862/,783

Many existing dwellings should thus be retrofitted in order to fulfil the ambitious EU carbon emission mitigation goals by 2050. To investigate how future climate resilience can be implemented in the design process of retrofitting measures, this study concentrates on real case studies that have been retrofitted during the past decade. The performance of retrofitting measures for four case studies in Denmark and Germany were investigated under future climate projections and compared between the non-retrofitted initial stage of the buildings and the retrofitted stage. Building performance simulations were employed to investigate how severe the effects of climate change until the end of the 21(st) century on the material choice and system design is. Results show that summertime thermal comfort will be a major challenge in the future. Energy use for space heating was seen to decrease for periods in the future, also the severity of cold events decreased, resulting in a decline of heating peak loads. Additionally, not considering extreme events was proven to lead to miss-dimensioning thermal systems. Overall, the study shows that adaptation of informed decisions, accounting for the uncertainties of future climate, can bring a significant benefit for energy-efficient retrofits, potentially promoting adequate passive measures as well as free cooling to prevent overheating and enhance heat removal.","Gremmelspacher, Jonas Manuel; Sivolova, Julija; Naboni, Emanuele; Nik, Vahid M.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974927/,783

As consequence, subtle differences in the scene are evidenced, benefiting precision applications, but values in neighboring locations and wavelengths are highly correlated. Nondiagonal covariance matrices and wide autocorrelation functions can be observed this way, implying increased intraclass and decreased interclass variation, in both spectral and spatial domains. This leads to lower interpretation accuracies and makes it reasonable to investigate if hyperspectral imagery suffer from Curse of Dimensionality. Moreover, as this Curse can compromise linear method’s Euclidean behavior assumption, it is relevant to compare linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction performance. So, in this work we verify these two aspects empirically using multiple nonparametric statistical comparisons of Gaussian Mixture Model clustering performances in the cases of: absence, linear and nonlinear unsupervised feature extraction.

In this sense, we address a new research perspective in the POI Recommendation field, proposing a re-ordering method to be applied after any RS and improve the POIs located nearby from the users’ geolocation. Our assumption is that POIs located on the sub-areas with more activity of a user are more interesting than POIs from new sub-areas.

The nanomaterials, termed ACE2-NPs, contained 265.1 ng mg-1 ACE2 on the surface and acted as baits to trap S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to HK-2 human renal tubular epithelial cells. Aside from affecting receptor recongnition, S1 translocated to the cytoplasm and induced apoptosis by reducing optic atrophy 1 expression and increasing cytochrome c release, which was also inhibited by ACE2-NPs. Further investigations revealed that ACE2-NPs efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into host cells and blocked viral infection in vitro and in vivo. This study characterizes easy-to-produce memrbane nanoantagonists of SARS-CoV-2 that enrich the existing antiviral arsenal and provide possibilities for COVID-19 treatment.","Wang, Cheng; Wang, Shaobo; Chen, Yin; Zhao, Jianqi; Han, Songling; Zhao, Gaomei; Kang, Jing; Liu, Yong; Wang, Liting; Wang, Xiaoyang; Xu, Yang; Wang, Song; Huang, Yi; Wang, Junping; Zhao, Jinghong",ACS Nano,,783
306823,An analysis of students’ learning pattern: a study on the new learning paradigm by using virtual technology in covid-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically affected global healthcare systems We aimed to determine the response of our paediatric surgical fraternity to a disease that overwhelmingly affects adults MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study over 6 weeks during a federally mandated lockdown Using snowball sampling, we recruited paediatric surgeons, trainees and medical officers from paediatric surgical units in Malaysia The anonymous online questionnaire covered sociodemographic information, changes in patient care, redeployment, concerns regarding family members, and impact on training Mental well-being was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis was used, with significance level 0 05 RESULTS: Of the 129 eligible participants, 100(77%) responded Junior doctors had clinically higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress Age &lt;30 years was significantly associated with anxiety Junior doctors believed that redeployment led to loss of surgical skills (p&lt;0 001) and trainees felt that clinical application of knowledge had reduced (p&lt;0 020) CONCLUSION: Specific to our paediatric surgical community, this study highlights areas of concern, particularly among junior doctors It is likely that recurrent cycles of the pandemic will occur soon These issues must be addressed to preserve the mental and emotional well-being of all health care workers","Mahat, N.; Zubaidi, S.
