Annual rates and costs of spinal deformity surgery have both increased over the past two decades. However, the impact of non-elective status on total cost of hospitalization and patient outcomes has not been quantified. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of admission status on patient outcomes and healthcare costs in spinal deformity surgery. METHODS: All patients who underwent spinal deformity surgery at a single institution between 2008 and 2016 were grouped by admission status: elective, emergency (ED), or transferred. Demographics were compared by univariate analysis. Cost of care and length of stay (LOS) were compared between admission statuses using multivariable linear regression with elective admissions as reference. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to assess in-hospital complications, discharge destination, and readmission rates. RESULTS: There were 427 spinal deformity surgeries included in this study. Compared to elective patients, ED patients had higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores (p < 0.0001), longer LOS (+ 10.9 days, 97.5% CI 6.1-15.6 days, p < 0.0001), and higher costs (+ $20,076, 97.5% CI $9,073-$31,080, p = 0.0008). Transferred patients had significantly higher Elixhauser scores (p = 0.0002), longer LOS (+ 8.8 days, 97.5% CI 3.0-14.7 days, p < 0.0001), and higher rates of non-home discharge (OR = 15.8, 97.5% CI 2.3-110.0, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients admitted from the ED undergoing spinal deformity surgery had significantly higher cost of care and longer LOS compared to elective patients. Transferred patients had significantly longer LOS and a higher rate of non-home discharge compared to elective patients.","Shuman, William H; Chapman, Emily K; Gal, Jonathan S; Neifert, Sean N; Martini, Michael L; Schupper, Alexander J; Lamb, Colin D; McNeill, Ian T; Gilligan, Jeffrey; Caridi, John M",Spine Deform,962,20

Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data for 46 countries with 10,000+ cases by 16 May 2020, five continents and the entire world. Hence, the model has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. The damping rate ranged from -0.0228 to 0.1669 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread) and can greatly affect the duration of the outbreak and the eventual number of infections. Our model suggests that it is possible to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic by the end of 2020 through achieving a high damping rate (0.0615 d-1). However, the global damping rate is rather low (0.0504 d-1 before 26 April) and has dropped even further since late April (0.0168 d-1). Easing currently implemented control measures in countries with weak or no damping in transmission could lead to an exponential rebound of COVID-19 spread.","Zhang, Feng; Zhang, Jinmei; Cao, Menglan; Zhang, Yong; Hui, Cang",Front Public Health,962,11

Among other, SARS-CoV-2 targets renal tubular cells and can cause acute renal damage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of urinary parameters in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality and development of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Retrospective observational study, in a tertiary care hospital, between March 1st and April 19th, 2020. We recruited adult patients admitted consecutively and positive for SARS-CoV-2. Urinary and serum biomarkers were correlated with clinical outcomes (AKI, ICU admission, hospital discharge and in-hospital mortality) and evaluated using a logistic regression model and ROC curves. A total of 199 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were included. In AKI, the logistic regression model with a highest area under the curve (AUC) was reached by the combination of urine blood and previous chronic kidney disease, with an AUC of 0.676 (95%CI 0.512-0.840; p = 0.023); urine specific weight, sodium and albumin in serum, with an AUC of 0.837 (95% CI 0.766-0.909; p < 0.001) for ICU admission; and age, urine blood and lactate dehydrogenase levels in serum, with an AUC of 0.923 (95%CI 0.866-0.979; p < 0.001) for mortality prediction. For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, renal involvement and early alterations of urinary and serum parameters are useful as prognostic factors of AKI, the need for ICU admission and death.","Morell-Garcia, Daniel; Ramos-Chavarino, David; Bauça, Josep M; Argente Del Castillo, Paula; Ballesteros-Vizoso, Maria Antonieta; García de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis; Gómez-Cobo, Cristina; Pou, J Albert; Amezaga-Menéndez, Rocío; Alonso-Fernández, Alberto; Llompart, Isabel; García-Raja, Ana",Sci Rep,962,16

Prone positioning (PP) is an intervention with proven survival benefits in moderate-to-severe and severe ARDS. It is advocated in international guidelines as an intervention in mechanically ventilated Covid-19 patients, despite very few published trials investigating its efficacy in Covid-19. There is an ongoing debate regarding the prevalence of reported mismatches between the severity of hypoxaemia and the preservation of pulmonary compliance in some patients, in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has led some to question its utility within this context. 129 proning sessions were identified in 34 consecutively prone patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a single center in the United Kingdom. Baseline characteristics of patients were consistent with previously published national and international reports and patients were ventilated in general concordance with the ARDSnet ventilation protocol. Paired analysis of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen(PaO2): fraction of inspired oxygen(FiO2) ratio (PF ratio) (n = 89) and FiO2 (n = 129) was recorded within 3 hours of both the initiation and termination of PP and differences were assessed with the paired Student's t-test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Proning improved the PF ratio by 43.5 ± 54.9 from 99.8 ± 37.5 to 151.9 ± 58.9 (43.6% increase) [p < 0.0001] and reduced FiO2 by 0.17 ± 0.2 from 0.68 ± 0.2 to 0.51 ± 0.2 (25% decrease) [p < 0.0001]. 82% of proning maneouveres resulted in an improvement in the PF ratio.

We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, GHL, OpenGrey, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases through April 2020. We obtained 2699 studies from the initial literature search. Of them, we included 28 eligible studies that met our eligibility criteria. The sample size of the included studies is 2079 individuals. We extracted and pooled the available data and conducted a quality assessment for the eligible studies. From the 28 studies, only 13 studies provide strong evidence. Our results showed that Favipiravir and Hydroxycholoroquine shorten viral clearance and clinical recovery time and promote pneumonia absorption. On the other hand, Lopinavir-ritonavir either alone or combined with arbidol or interferons has no significant difference superior to the standard care. Corticosteroids, Convalescent plasma transfusion, and anticoagulant therapies provide a better prognosis. Remedsivir, Tocilizumab, Immunoglobulin, Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation showed effective treatment results, but further confirmatory studies are needed.

In these regions, the realities of large overcrowded informal settlements, a high burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, as well as malnutrition and precarity of livelihoods, have raised added concerns about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in these contexts. COVID-19 infection control measures have been shown to have some effects in slowing down the progress of the pandemic, effectively buying time to prepare the healthcare system. However, there has been less of a focus on the indirect impacts of these measures on health behaviours and the consequent health risks, particularly in the most vulnerable. In this current debate piece, focusing on two of the four risk factors that contribute to >80% of the NCD burden, we consider the possible ways that the restrictions put in place to control the pandemic, have the potential to impact on dietary and physical activity behaviours and their determinants. By considering mitigation responses implemented by governments in several LMIC cities, we identify key lessons that highlight the potential of economic, political, food and built environment sectors, mobilised during the pandemic, to retain health as a priority beyond the context of pandemic response. Such whole-of society approaches are feasible and necessary to support equitable healthy eating and active living required to address other epidemics and to lower the baseline need for healthcare in the long term.","Oni, Tolu; Micklesfield, Lisa K; Wadende, Pamela; Obonyo, Charles O; Woodcock, James; Mogo, Ebele R I; Odunitan-Wayas, Feyisayo A; Assah, Felix; Tatah, Lambed; Foley, Louise; Mapa-Tassou, Clarisse; Bhagtani, Divya; Weimann, Amy; Mba, Camille; Unwin, Nigel; Brugulat-Panés, Anna; Hofman, Karen J; Smith, Joanne; Tulloch-Reid, Marshall; Erzse, Agnes; Shung-King, Maylene; Lambert, Estelle V; Wareham, Nicholas J",Glob Health Action,962,26

It is particularly difficult to adapt courses that depend on physical equipment to be now carried out remotely. This is the case for bioinformatics, which typically requires dedicated computer classrooms, as the logistics of granting remote access to a workstation or relying on the computational resources of each student is not trivial. A possible workaround is using cloud server-based computing resources, such as Google Colaboratory, a free web browser application that allows the writing and execution of Python programming through Jupyter notebooks, integrating text, images, and code cells. Following a cloud-based approach, we migrated the practical activities of a course on molecular modeling and simulation into the Google Colaboratory environment resulting in 12 tutorials that introduce students to topics such as phylogenetic analysis, molecular modeling, molecular docking, several flavors of molecular dynamics, and coevolutionary analysis. Each of these notebooks includes a brief introduction to the topic, software installation, execution of the required tools, and analysis of results, with each step properly described.

It is incumbent on occupational health staff to recognize potential symptoms of Covid-19 among HCWs. AIMS: The aims of the study were to describe the presenting symptoms of HCWs who developed Covid-19 in Ireland, and to estimate the odds of specific symptoms being associated with a positive Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all symptomatic HCWs who self-presented for Covid-19 testing in Cork from March to May 2020 was conducted. A sex-matched case-control study was carried out to compare presenting features among those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative. Univariate and multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression models were run using Stata 15.0 to identify the symptoms associated with positive Covid-19 swab results. RESULTS: Three hundred and six HCWs were included in the study; 102 cases and 204 controls. Common presenting features among cases were fever/chills (55%), cough (44%) and headache (35%). The symptoms which were significantly associated with a positive Covid-19 swab result were loss of taste/smell (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 12.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-108.79), myalgia (aOR 2.36, 95% 1.27-4.38), fatigue (aOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.12-4.74), headache (aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.19-3.74) and fever/chills (aOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.12-3.15). CONCLUSIONS: Fever, fatigue, myalgia, loss of taste/smell and headache were associated with increased odds of a Covid-19 diagnosis among symptomatic self-referred HCWs compared with those had negative swab results.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane database for studies from January 2019 till June 6, 2021 with inclusion criteria of RCT, Cohort study, studies reporting mortality, and comparison studies on aspirin versus non-aspirin. Statistical analysis was done with Review Manager 5.4 statistical software using the inverse variance method. We assessed the pooled hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval using the random effect model and I-squared test was used to determine statistical heterogeneity. ResultsWe included five retrospective cohort studies which met our inclusion criteria with total of 14065 participants in both groups. There were 6797 participants in the aspirin group and 7268 participants in the non-aspirin group. Our results show that the use of aspirin was associated with 53% decrease in mortality compared to non-aspirin in patients with COVID-19 (adjusted HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35-0.63, P< 0.001, I2= 47%).

Immunologically, in tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) detected enhanced H1N2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccinates, and in commercial vaccinates detected CTLs with mainly IL-17A(+) and early effector phenotypes specific to both H1N2 and H1N1 SwAIV. In commercial vaccinates, activated H1N2- and H1N1-specific IFNγ(+)&TNFα(+), IL-17A(+) and central memory T-helper/Memory cells, and in Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccinates H1N2-specific central memory, IFNγ(+) and IFNγ(+)&TNFα(+), and H1N1-specific IL-17A(+) T-helper/Memory cells were observed. Systemically, Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccine augmented H1N2-specific IFNγ(+) CTLs and H1N1-specific IFNγ(+) T-helper/Memory cells, and commercial vaccine boosted H1N2- specific early effector CTLs and H1N1-specific IFNγ(+)&TNFα(+) CTLs, as well as H1N2- and H1N1-specific T-helper/Memory cells with central memory, IFNγ(+)&TNFα(+), and IL-17A(+) phenotypes. Remarkably, commercial vaccine induced an increase in H1N1-specific T-helper cells in TBLN and naive T-helper cells in both TBLN and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), while H1N1- and H1N2-specific only T-helper cells were augmented in Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccinates in both TBLN and PBMCs. Furthermore, the Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccine stimulated robust cross-reactive IgG and secretory IgA (SIgA) responses in lungs, while the commercial vaccine elicited high levels of serum and lung IgG and serum hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers. In conclusion, despite vast genetic difference (77% in HA gene identity) between the vaccine H1N2 and H1N1 challenge viruses in Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccinates, compared to over 95% identity between H1N1 of commercial vaccine and challenge viruses, the virus load and macroscopic lesions in the lungs of both types of vaccinates were comparable, but the Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccine cleared the virus from the nasal passage better. These data suggested the important role played by Nano-11 and Poly(I:C) in the induction of polyfunctional, cross-protective cell-mediated immunity against SwIAV in MDA-positive pigs.","Patil, Veerupaxagouda; Renu, Sankar; Feliciano-Ruiz, Ninoshkaly; Han, Yi; Ramesh, Anikethana; Schrock, Jennifer; Dhakal, Santosh; HogenEsch, Harm; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.",Front Immunol,962,5

Such collaboration is especially important in the context of the global pandemic caused by the novel Coronavirus disease of 2019, known as COVID-19. The child protection system must have the capacity and resources to respond to increased demands during this time, and early childhood educators serve as an essential link for child protective services in identifying and reporting a child in need. As an effective system to accomplish these two aims requires a working collaboration among its participants, Bronstein’s interdisciplinary collaboration model was used as a framework to interpret this practice. A small-scale qualitative study was conducted that included principals of nursery schools and child protection workers from one region in Estonia. Findings indicate that effective collaboration was believed to require communication and ongoing systematic relationship building. Collaboration in practice varied, as principals reported a high turnover rate for the child protection workers, which hindered the development of a working relationship and support for the process of noticing and thereby identifying a child in need. In contrast, child protection workers assessed collaboration more positively, recognizing the need to have a supportive system in place for nursery schools. Both groups of collaborators acknowledged the need to train teachers, particularly to conduct joint training exercises to foster a common understanding of the child in need and of the intervention process itself.","Toros, Karmen; Tart, Keidy; Falch-Eriksen, Asgeir",Early Child Educ J,962,1

Because epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) expresses ACE2, we wanted to identify the main factors associated with ACE2 levels and its cleavage enzyme, ADAM17, in epicardial fat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epicardial and subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from 43 patients who underwent open‐heart surgery. From 36 patients, biopsies were used for RNA expression analysis by real‐time PCR of ACE1, ACE2 and ADAM17. From 8 patients, stromal vascular cells were submitted to adipogenesis or used for studying the treatment effects on gene expression levels. Soluble ACE2 was determined in supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Epicardial fat biopsies expressed higher levels of ACE2 (1.53 [1.49‐1.61] vs 1.51 [1.47‐1.56] a.u., P < .05) and lower ADAM17 than subcutaneous fat (1.67 [1.65‐1.70] vs 1.70 [1.66‐1.74] a.u., P < .001). Both genes were increased in epicardial fat from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (1.62 [1.50‐2.28] vs 1.52 [1.49‐1.55] a.u., P = .05 for ACE2 and 1.68 [1.66‐1.78] vs 1.66 [1.63‐1.69] a.u., P < .05 for ADAM17). Logistic regression analysis determined that T2DM was the main associated factor with epicardial ACE2 levels (P < .01). The highest ACE2 levels were found on patients with diabetes and obesity. ACE1 and ACE2 levels were not upregulated by antidiabetic treatment (metformin, insulin or thiazolidinedione). Its cellular levels, which were higher in epicardial than in subcutaneous stromal cells (1.61 [1.55‐1.63] vs 1 [1‐1.34]), were not correlated with the soluble ACE2. CONCLUSION: Epicardial fat cells expressed higher levels of ACE2 in comparison with subcutaneous fat cells, which is enhanced by diabetes and obesity presence in patients with cardiovascular disease. Both might be risk factors for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Couselo‐Seijas, Marinela; Almengló, Cristina; M Agra‐Bermejo, Rosa; Luis Fernandez, Ángel; Alvarez, Ezequiel; R González‐Juanatey, Jose; Eiras, Sonia",Eur J Clin Invest,962,32

Therefore, this study researches the hitherto understudied concept of vaccination concern and its theoretical scope in the international travel space. It attempts a conceptualization of the concept by delimiting its theoretical scope and proposes a measure for it. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was used to conduct four interlocking studies using data from a netnography, field interviews, and surveys among varied international travelers. A scale with six dimensions, comprising safety, efficacy, cost, time, access, and autonomy concerns were revealed. The scale significantly explained mainstream and segments-based tourists' uptake attitudes and behavior for their eligible vaccines. The findings suggest that anti-travel vax sentiments and public vax sentiments despite conceptually similar are considerably distinct. The broad nature of the scale and its prediction of travelers' vaccine uptake make it clinically relevant for tracking and resolving concerns for increased vaccine uptake.","Adongo, Charles Atanga; Amenumey, Edem Kwesi; Kumi-Kyereme, Akwasi; Dubé, Eve",Tour Manag,962,5

These conflicts begin with disputes over territorial ownership. They affect local livelihoods, access to and use of space and natural resources, and create power asymmetries. In response to these conflicts, the Federal Conservation Agency has put forward norms that guarantee inclusive arenas for local people to take part in negotiations with park managers. In this study, environmental conflicts caused by the implementation of parks overlapping local population territories are analyzed aiming to understand their role as mechanisms promoting institutional changes. We collected data from two communities that overlap the Serra da Bocaina National Park through interviews, workshops, and direct observations. For each community, we characterized conflicts involving the community and Park officers. We identified consequences to the community’s livelihoods and analyzed their influence on institutional change. The results suggest that one community responded to conservation conflicts through actions towards negotiation and collaboration with the national park. The other community promoted changes in agricultural production methods and sought new markets as a strategy for staying in the territory. Conflicts are effective as a mechanism for institutional changes, as local actors articulate with autonomous organizations at different levels. We highlight the importance of a continuous documentation on conflicts and their consequences to rural livelihoods in both communities and conflict management actions taken by the Park in the long term.","de Freitas, Rodrigo Rodrigues; de Araujo, Luciana Gomes",Environ Manage,962,16
