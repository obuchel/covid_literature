3879,3879,3879,A shared protocol for porcine surfactant use in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: a feasibility study,16.493217,12.521091,2019-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric ARDS still represents a difficult challenge in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU). Among different treatments proposed, exogenous surfactant showed conflicting results. Aim of this multicenter retrospective observational study was to evaluate whether poractant alfa use in pediatric ARDS might improve gas exchange in children less than 2 years old, according to a shared protocol. METHODS: The study was carried out in fourteen Italian PICUs after dissemination of a standardized protocol for surfactant administration within the Italian PICU network. The protocol provides the administration of surfactant (50 mg/kg) divided in two doses: the first dose is used as a bronchoalveolar lavage while the second as supplementation. Blood gas exchange variations before and after surfactant use were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children, age 0–24 months, affected by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome treated with exogenous porcine surfactant were enrolled. Data collection consisted of patient demographics, respiratory variables and arterial blood gas analysis. The most frequent reasons for PICU admission were acute respiratory failure, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and septic shock. Fifty-four children (78.3%) had severe ARDS (define by oxygen arterial pressure and inspired oxygen fraction ratio (P/F) < 100), 15 (21.7%) had moderate ARDS (100 < P/F < 200). PO(2), P/F, Oxygenation Index (OI) and pH showed a significant improvement after surfactant use with respect to baseline (p < 0.001 at each included time-point for each parameter). No significant difference in blood gas variations were observed among four different subgroups of diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, septic shock and others). Overall, 11 children died (15.9%) and among these, 10 (90.9%) had complex chronic conditions. Two children (18.2%) died while being treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality for severe pARDS was 20.4%. CONCLUSION: The use of porcine Surfactant improves oxygenation, P/F ratio, OI and pH in a population of children with moderate or severe pARDS caused by multiple diseases. A shared protocol seems to be a good option to obtain the same criteria of enrollment among different PICUs and define a unique way of use and administration of the drug for future studies.","Wolfler, Andrea; Piastra, Marco; Amigoni, Angela; Santuz, Pierantonio; Gitto, Eloisa; Rossetti, Emanuele; Tinelli, Carmine; Montani, Cinzia; Savron, Fabio; Pizzi, Simone; D’amato, Luigia; Mondardini, Maria Cristina; Conti, Giorgio; De Silvestri, Annalisa",BMC Pediatr,591,9

Contemporary surveillance systems have to adapt to these changes. We describe temporal trends and geographic origins of vector-borne diseases in Germany with regard to strengths of existing disease surveillance and to areas marked for improvement. We focused on hantavirus infection (endemic in Germany), chikungunya fever (recently emerging in Europe) and dengue fever (imported from tropical regions), representing important subgroups of vector-borne infections. Routine surveillance data on demographics, origin of infection and the date of reporting were analysed. From 2001 through 2007, 3,005 symptomatic hantavirus infections, and 85 cases of chikungunya fever were reported, similarly 1,048 cases of dengue fever in 2002 through 2007. The geographic origin of hantavirus infection was reported for 95.5% of all cases (dengue virus, 98.4%; chikungunya virus, 100%). Hantavirus infections were acquired in Germany in 97.6% of cases (n = 2800). In 2007, there was a marked increase of hantavirus cases, mainly in areas known to be endemic for hantavirus. In 2006, imported cases of chikungunya fever primarily returned from several islands of the Indian Ocean, while the majority of imported cases in 2007 came from India. The reported number of dengue fever cases have increased since 2004. Thailand contributed the largest proportion of cases (17–43% in individual years), followed by India, Brazil and Indonesia. Surveillance of notifiable vector-borne diseases in Germany is able to timely detect spatial and temporal changes of autochthonous an imported infections. Geographic and temporal data obtained by routine surveillance served as a basis for public health recommendations. In addition to surveillance of vector-borne infections in humans, nationwide monitoring programs and inventory techniques for emerging and reemerging vectors and for wildlife disease are warranted.","Jansen, Andreas; Frank, Christina; Koch, Judith; Stark, Klaus",Parasitol Res,591,12

Despite the large impact of these arboviruses on health systems, there are no approved vaccines or treatments to fight these infections. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to discover new antiviral drugs. Natural products are a rich source of compounds with distinct biological activities, including antiviral properties. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential antiviral activity of Ginkgolic acid against the arboviruses CHIKV, MAYV, UNAV, and ZIKV. Viral progeny production in supernatants from cells treated or not treated with Ginkgolic acid was quantified by plaque-forming assay. Ginkgolic acid’s direct virucidal activity against these arboviruses was also determined. Additionally, viral protein expression was assessed using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Our results reveal that Ginkgolic acid promotes a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers in all tested viruses. Moreover, the compound demonstrated strong virucidal activity. Finally, we found that viral protein expression was affected by treatment with this drug. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ginkgolic acid could have broader antiviral activity.","Campos, Dalkiria; Navarro, Susana; Llamas-González, Yessica Yadira; Sugasti, Madelaine; González-Santamaría, José",Viruses,591,1

A multidisciplinary panel at our institution recently developed procedure-specific guidelines for discharge opioid prescriptions for common orthopaedic surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative opioid prescription quantities, variability, and 30-day refill rates before and after implementation of the guidelines. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single academic institution from December 2016 to March 2018. Guidelines were implemented on August 1, 2017, with a recommended maximum opioid prescription quantity for 14 common orthopaedic procedures. Patients who underwent these 14 procedures during the period of December 2016 to May 2017 made up the pre-guideline cohort (n = 2,223), and patients who underwent these procedures from October 2017 to March 2018 made up the post-guideline cohort (n = 2,300). Opioid prescription quantities were reported as oral morphine equivalents (OME), with medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Four levels were established for recommended prescription maximums, ranging from 100 to 400 OME. RESULTS: In the pre-guideline cohort, the median amount of prescribed opioids across all procedures was 600 OME (IQR, 390 to 863 OME), which decreased by 38% in the post-guideline period, to a median of 375 OME (IQR, 239 to 400 OME) in the post-guideline cohort (p < 0.001). The 30-day refill rate did not change significantly, from a rate of 24% in the pre-guideline cohort to 25% in the post-guideline cohort (p = 0.43). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that guideline implementation was the factor most strongly associated with prescriptions exceeding guideline maximums (odds ratio [OR] = 9.9; p < 0.001). Age groups of <80 years (OR = 2.0 to 2.4; p < 0.001) and males (OR = 1.2; p = 0.025) were also shown to have higher odds of exceeding guideline maximums. CONCLUSIONS: Procedure-specific guidelines are capable of substantially decreasing opioid prescription amounts and variability. Furthermore, the absence of change in refill rates suggests that pain control remains similar to pre-guideline prescribing practices. Evidence-based guidelines are a readily employable solution that can drive rapid change in practice and enhance the ability of orthopaedic surgeons to provide responsible pain management.","Wyles, Cody C.; Hevesi, Mario; Ubl, Daniel S.; Habermann, Elizabeth B.; Gazelka, Halena M.; Trousdale, Robert T.; Turner, Norman S.; Pagnano, Mark W.; Mabry, Tad M.",JB JS Open Access,591,13

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Community-based health examination database from Taipei city. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 35 434 older people were included from February 2005 to December 2012. To assess changes in renal function, we selected participants who attended health examinations at least twice and responded to the AD8 questionnaire in 2012. We excluded those with dementia at baseline. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Early dementia was assessed using the AD8 questionnaire in 2012. Explanatory variables included demographic factors, health behaviours, biochemical markers and renal function. We used a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the HR for early dementia onset. RESULTS: Individuals with mild albuminuria (HR 1.228; 95% CI 1.066 to 1.414), lower eGFR (HR 1.549; 95% CI 1.319 to 1.820) and higher age (HR 1.022; 95% CI 1.015 to 1.028) were associated with a high risk of early dementia. Older people with no alcohol intake (HR 0.872; 95% CI 0.794 to 0.958), and higher education levels (HR 0.647; 95% CI 0.589 to 0.710) were at a low risk of early dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated mild albuminuria and low eGFR were associated with a high risk of early dementia in this community-based cohort. Routine health examinations for older people can help screen out the high-risk population, and clinical management might reduce or delay the risk of early dementia.","Tseng, Tzu-Jung; Yen, Yun-Ting; Yang, Yuan-Han; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Chan, Ta-Chien",BMJ Open,591,17

Problematic social media use and associations with mental distress and addictive disorders,16.769554,1.6041696,2021-04-08,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVES: To compare individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) submitted to transcutaneous electrical diaphragmatic stimulation (TEDS) or a standard weaning protocol (SWP) according to the following variables: invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) time, ventilator weaning time, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and overall hospital length of stay. SETTINGS: Tertiary university hospital. Clinical Hospital of Campinas State University—UNICAMP—Campinas (SP), Brazil. METHODS: Retrospective case study investigating ICU patients submitted to tracheostomy due to cervical SCI at a tertiary university hospital (Clinical Hospital of Campinas State University, Brazil). Data were extracted from medical records of patients seen between January 2007 and December 2016. According to medical records, four patients were submitted to TEDS and six to a SWP. Provision of training to patients in the TEDS group was based on consensus medical decision, preference of the physical therapy team and availability of electrostimulation equipment in the ICU. RESULTS: Total IMV time in the TEDS and the SWP group was 33 ± 15 and 60 ± 22 days, respectively. Length of stay in ICU in the TEDS and the SWP group was 31 ± 18 and 63 ± 45 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: TEDS appears to influence the duration of IMV as well as the length of stay in ICU. This physiotherapeutic intervention may be a potentially promising tool for treatment of patients with SCI. However, randomized clinical trials are warranted to support this assumption.","Duarte, Gregory Lui; Bethiol, Aldrin Lucas; Ratti, Ligia dos Santos Roceto; Franco, Gabriel; Moreno, Rui; Tonella, Rodrigo Marques; Falcão, Antonio Luis Eiras",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,591,1

However, limited evidence from randomized clinical trials exists regarding the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions among Asian adults with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a culturally contextualized smartphone-based intervention with usual care on weight and metabolic outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial conducted at multiple primary care centers in Singapore included 305 adults with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) of 23 or greater who had literacy in English and smartphone access. Participants were recruited between October 3, 2017, and September 9, 2019, and were randomly assigned (1:1; stratified by gender, age, and BMI) to intervention (99 participants) or control (105 participants) groups. Participants’ data were analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Both control and intervention participants received diet and physical activity advice from a dietitian at a baseline face-to-face visit. Intervention participants additionally used a smartphone app to track weight, diet, physical activity, and blood glucose and then communicated with dietitians for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in body weight, while secondary outcomes were changes in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and diet. Post hoc analyses included glycemic changes in the subgroup with HbA(1c) levels of 8% or greater and diabetes medication changes. RESULTS: Among the 204 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 51.2 [9.7] years; 132 [64.7%] men), baseline mean (SD) BMI was 30.6 (4.3). Compared with the control group, intervention participants achieved significantly greater reductions in weight (mean [SD] change, −3.6 [4.7] kg vs −1.2 [3.6] kg) and HbA(1c) levels (mean [SD] change, −0.7% [1.2] vs −0.3% [1.0]), with a greater proportion having a reduction in diabetes medications (17 participants [23.3%] vs 4 participants [5.4%]) at 6 months. The intervention led to a greater HbA(1c) reduction among participants with HbA(1c) levels of 8% or higher (mean [SD] change, −1.8% [1.4] vs −1.0% [1.4]; P = .001). Intergroup differences favoring the intervention were also noted for fasting blood glucose, diastolic blood pressure, and dietary changes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, a smartphone-based lifestyle intervention was more effective in achieving weight and glycemic reductions among Asian adults with type 2 diabetes compared with usual care, supporting the use of apps in lifestyle intervention delivery.

Nevertheless, the literature has described persistent problems with this acceptance ever since brain death was described. Many of these problems are not widely known or properly understood by much of the medical community. Here we aim to clarify these issues, based on the two intractable problems in the brain death debates. First, the metaphysical problem: there is no reason that withstands critical scrutiny to believe that BD is the state of biological death of the human organism. Second, the epistemic problem: there is no way currently to diagnose the state of BD, the irreversible loss of all brain functions, using clinical tests and ancillary tests, given potential confounders to testing. We discuss these problems and their main objections and conclude that these problems are intractable in that there has been no acceptable solution offered other than bare assertions of an ‘operational definition’ of death. We present possible ways to move forward that accept both the metaphysical problem - that BD is not biological death of the human organism - and the epistemic problem - that as currently diagnosed, BD is a devastating neurological state where recovery of sentience is very unlikely, but not a confirmed state of irreversible loss of all [critical] brain functions. We argue that the best solution is to abandon the dead donor rule, thus allowing vital organ donation from patients currently diagnosed as BD, assuming appropriate changes are made to the consent process and to laws about killing.","Joffe, Ari R.; Khaira, Gurpreet; de Caen, Allan R.",Philos Ethics Humanit Med,591,1

Mature nsPs are generated by precise processing of these polyproteins. Both the precursors and mature nsPs are essential for CHIKV replication. Similar to other alphaviruses, CHIKV nsPs not only perform virus RNA replication but are also crucial for other activities essential for virus infection and pathogenesis. Thus far the best-studied CHIKV ns-protein is nsP2, for which protease, NTPase, RNA triphosphatase, and RNA helicase activities have been demonstrated. In addition, nsP2 is crucial for shut-off of host cell transcription and translation and it counteracts cellular antiviral responses. Compared to their homologues from the well-studied Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses, CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and nsP4 have been subjected to only few studies. Nevertheless, there are strong indirect pieces of evidence indicating that these CHIKV proteins have the same enzymatic activities as their counterparts in the other alphaviruses. Information concerning the specific interaction of CHIKV nsPs with host components is beginning to emerge. All the nsPs are involved in the functioning of membrane-bound replication complexes also called spherules, but the finer details of the structure and assembly of these complexes are currently poorly understood.","Ahola, Tero; Merits, Andres",Chikungunya Virus,591,5

It is for this reason that so-called (specific pathogen free) SPF animals are used for animal experiments. Certain requirements are necessary to maintain the desired SPF organism. Physical barriers together with appropriate operating methods aim at preventing contamination with pathogens and penetration by wild rodents. As a consequence, barrier units are not easily accessible for personnel, which is sometimes considered a disadvantage by experimenters. Finally, monitoring programs help to detect and control potential sources of contamination and may therefore be of crucial importance for the management of a facility housing animals of a good microbiological quality. The main purpose of health monitoring is to detect or prevent infections, which might influence physiological characteristics of animals or their health. Appropriate health monitoring helps to avoid imprecise results and allows all the experiments necessary to be carried out with a minimum number of animal. It is found that sufficient number of animals have to be monitored to obtain relevant information on a given population.

To solve above problem, a new insight is presented to introduce implicit association labels as the prior knowledge enhancement and jointly embed the user and label semantic information. In this paper, a graph convolutional network with implicit associations (GCN-IA) method is proposed to obtain user profile. Specifically, a probability matrix is first designed to capture the implicit associations among labels for user representation. Then, we learn user embedding and label embedding jointly based on user-generated texts, relationships and label information. On four real-world datasets in Weibo, experimental results demonstrate that GCN-IA produces a significant improvement compared with some state-of-the-art methods.","Wen, Jie; Wei, Lingwei; Zhou, Wei; Han, Jizhong; Guo, Tao",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,591,1

Following the destruction of major sections of Britain’s transition regime in the 1970s and 1980s, the paper explains how the regime has subsequently been reconstructed following the 1988 Education Reform Act, replacing the vocational education and training schemes of the 1980s with government-supported apprenticeships, almost uninterrupted employment growth since 1992, and the financialization of the corporate economy alongside uncapped expansion of higher education. England’s current transition regime keeps rates of youth unemployment and NEET below the European Union averages and delivers the fastest transitions in Europe. However, the reconstructed regime also locks-in features that may well become long-term problems, namely an expensive higher education system which leaves graduates with debts that many do not expect to repay in full, and substantial low wage, low skill, low productivity sectors in the economy and workforce.","Roberts, Ken",JAYS,591,1

With xor operations being at the core of many cryptographic problems, recent research in this area has focused on handling xor clauses efficiently. In this paper, we investigate solving the point decomposition step of the index calculus method for prime-degree extension fields [Formula: see text], using sat solving methods. We experimented with different sat solvers and decided on using WDSat, a solver dedicated to this specific problem. We extend this solver by adding a novel symmetry breaking technique and optimizing the time complexity of the point decomposition step by a factor of m! for the [Formula: see text](th) summation polynomial. While asymptotically solving the point decomposition problem with this method has exponential worst time complexity in the dimension l of the vector space defining the factor base, experimental running times show that the presented sat solving technique is significantly faster than current algebraic methods based on Gröbner basis computation. For the values l and n considered in the experiments, the WDSat solver coupled with our symmetry breaking technique is up to 300 times faster than Magma’s F4 implementation, and this factor grows with l and n.","Trimoska, Monika; Ionica, Sorina; Dequen, Gilles",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,591,16

The outbreak has been so rapid and widespread that the only option to treat the patients was administering drugs already available in the market like chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (an antimalarial drug) and remedesivir. A large number of patients have been cured but the attribution to survival by these drugs has been controversial. Till date, we do not have any specific drug or vaccine available for COVID-19 and the pandemic seems to be far from over. To handle the current challenges posed by the outbreak effectively, we need to employ innovative interdisciplinary approaches. Organ-on-chip (OOC), particularly lung-on-chip, is one such approach which combines the potential of microfluidics, cell culture and molecular biology into a single miniaturised platform. The device is realized to be capable of simulating in-vivo physiological responses of an organ. In the current study, an OOC, which is a multichannel 3D cell culture microfluidic device, is made via soft lithography technique, using polydimethylsiloxane-polymer and diverse polymeric porous/semipermeable membranes. Several polymer membranes i.e. PDMS, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nitrocellulose, polyester etc., integrated into the microdevices, were efficiently explored to realize their better cell-adhesion and viability property. We also propose for the application of a simple, smart and cost-effective lung-on-chip platform to study the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in humans, drug toxicity testing and provide insights into antigen–antibody interactions. This platform will enable us to study multiple phenomena at a micro-level generating more reliable data and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.","Roy, Nimisha; Kashyap, Jyoti; Verma, Deepti; Tyagi, Rakesh K.; Prabhakar, Amit",Trans Indian Natl,591,1

I show that this is mostly explained by the higher unemployment rate during a recession, together with the fact that at all times, unemployed persons have a relatively high propensity to become self-employed out of necessity. I use econometric decomposition techniques to quantify these effects based on the monthly matched US Current Population Survey before, during, and after the Great Recession. I also document that the entry rate into self-employment with unincorporated businesses strongly increased during the recession, but not into self-employment with incorporated businesses. This highlights the association of unincorporated and incorporated self-employment with necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship, respectively. The results are useful for policymakers and practitioners to understand, forecast and act on the different types of self-employment that can be expected over the business cycle. There are also important implications for theories of the cyclicality of unemployment and entrepreneurship. Plain English Summary Self-employment will increase during recessions when unemployment is high, but it may not boost innovation. During recessions, increased unemployment underlies the higher entry rate into self-employment. Our evidence is from representative survey data from the USA covering the Great Recession. The upside is that self-employment enables workers who lose their jobs to continue to work, which can speed up the subsequent economic recovery. Thus, public policy should enable people to start businesses. However, as during recessions the unemployed mostly start unincorporated businesses, one cannot expect them to boost innovation as much as start-ups during better economic times. These insights also speak to the 2020 recession triggered by COVID-19. If unemployment remains high after the relaxation of the lockdowns, a rise can be expected especially in non-innovative self-employment. Thus, the principal policy implication of this study is that policymakers should ensure that their expectations for new businesses started during deep recessions are realistic for the circumstances.

In contrast, there is a decrease in the prevalence of helminthic infections and other neglected diseases.

Acute helminthic infection and allergic reaction stimulate Type 2 helper cells (Th2) immune response with up-regulation of cytokines IL-4-, IL-5-, and IL-13-mediated IgE and mast cell production, as well as eosinophilia. However, people who chronically suffer from helminthic infections are demarcated through polarized Th2 resulting in alternative macrophage activation and T regulatory response. This regulatory system reduces allergy incidence in individuals that are chronically diseased through helminth. As a result, the excretory-secretory (ES) substance derived from parasites and extracellular vesicular components can be used as a novel therapeutic modality of allergy. Therefore, the aim of this review meticulously explored the link between helminth infection and allergy, and utilization of the helminth secretome for therapeutic immunomodulation.","Ayelign, Birhanu; Akalu, Yonas; Teferi, Banchamlak; Molla, Meseret Derbew; Shibabaw, Tewodros",J Asthma Allergy,591,1

In one large case series, 5.0% of patients required an intensive care unit (ICU) and 1.4% died. Several models have been developed to assess decompensating patients. However, research examining their applicability to COVID-19 patients is limited. An accurate predictive model for patients at risk of decompensation is critical for health systems to optimally triage emergencies, care for patients, and allocate resources. METHODS: An early warning score (EWS) algorithm created within a large academic medical center, with methodology previously described, was applied to COVID-19 patients admitted to this institution. 122 COVID-19 patients were included. A decompensation event was defined as inpatient mortality or an unanticipated transfer to an ICU from an intermediate medical ward. The EWS was calculated at 12-hour and 24-hour intervals. RESULTS: Of 122 patients admitted with COVID-19, 28 had a decompensation event, yielding an event rate of 23.0%. 8 patients died, 13 transferred to the ICU, and 6 both transferred to the ICU and died. Decompensation within 12 and 24 hours were predicted with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.850 and 0.817, respectively. Using a three-tiered risk model, use of the customized EWS score for patients identified as high risk of decompensation had a positive predictive value of 44.4% and 11.1% and specificity of 99.3% and 99.6% and 12- and 24-hour intervals. Amongst medium-risk patients, the score had a specificity of 85.0% and 85.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This EWS allows for prediction of decompensation, defined as transfer to an ICU or death, in COVID-19 patients with excellent specificity and a high positive predictive value. Clinically, implementation of this score can help to identify patients before they decompensate in order to triage at time of presentation and allocate step-down beds, ICU beds, and treatments such as remdesivir.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates how individuals have changed their activity-travel patterns and internet usage during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemicperiod, and which of these changes may be kept. METHODS: An empirical data collection was deployed through online forms. 781 responses from different countries (Italy, Sweden, India and others) have beencollected, and a series of multivariate analyses was carried out. Two linear regression models are presented, related to the change of travel activities andinternet usage, before and during the pandemic period. Furthermore, a binary regression model is used to examine the likelihood of the respondents to adoptand keep their behaviours beyond the pandemic period. RESULTS: The results show that the possibility to change the behaviour matter. External restrictions and personal characteristics are the driving factors of the reductionin ones' daily trips. However, the estimation results do not show a strong correlation between the countries' restriction policy and the respondents' likelihoodto adopt the new and online-based behaviours for any of the activities after the restriction period.

Melatonin (MLT) is a hormone with multifunctional antioxidant activity. The protective effects of MLT on the heart and pancreas during the early development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and pancreatic injury were investigated in male Wistar rats with T2DM. MLT (10 mg/kg) was administered daily by gavage for 15 days after diabetic induction. Treatment of diabetic rats with MLT significantly normalized the levels of serum glucose, HbA1-c, and the lipid profile and improved the insulin levels and insulin resistance compared with diabetic rats, affirming its antidiabetic effect. MLT significantly prevented the development of oxidative stress and sustained the levels of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity in the heart and pancreas of diabetic animals, indicating its antioxidant capacity. Additionally, MLT prevented the increase in proinflammatory cytokines and expression of Bax, caspase-3 and P53. Furthermore, MLT enhanced the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. MLT controlled the levels of troponin T and creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase activity, indicating its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. Histological examinations confirmed the protective effects of MLT on T2DM-induced injury in the myocardium, pancreas and islets of Langerhans. In conclusion, the protective effects of melatonin on the heart and pancreas during the early development of T2DM are attributed to its antihyperglycemic, antilipidemic and antioxidant influences as well as its remarkable anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties.","Abdulwahab, Doaa A.; El-Missiry, Mohamed A.; Shabana, Sameh; Othman, Azza I.; Amer, Maggie E.",Heliyon,591,13

The final results showed that the reduction of the amount of air to be inflated did not compromise the thermal comfort of the occupants. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology allowed the creation of comfort maps, albeit for a single zone due to computational limitations.

Late-life depression may be especially impairing due to its relationship with poor physical and mental health. Repeated or prolonged exposures to stressful events deserve a particular interest among late-life depression risk factors. One factor that may help to cope with these stressful situations is the resilience. The objective of the study was to examine the moderating effect of resilience on the relationship between perceived stress (PS) and depression. A total of 1020 community-dwelling older adults aged from 60 to 101 years (M = 68.5, SD = 6.99) completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Brief Resilience Scale. A moderation effect has been tested using PROCESS for SPSS. Depressive symptomatology was positively related to PS (r = .598; p < .001) and inversely related to resilience (r = − .444; p < .001). Moreover, the negative impact of PS on depressive symptoms was buffered for individuals with higher resilience (β = − .014; p < .001). The resilience could be an adaptive strategy to cope with stress and reduce depression in community-dwelling older adults.","da Silva-Sauer, Leandro; Lima, Thiago Regis Gouveia; da Fonsêca, Égina Karoline Gonçalves; de la Torre-Luque, Alejandro; Yu, Xiaoquian; Fernández-Calvo, Bernardino",Trends in Psychol.,591,7

Lignans glucosides, which are converted from aglycones catalyzed by uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs), have abundant bioactivities. In the present study, two UGTs from Isatis indigotica Fort., namely IiUGT71B5a and IiUGT71B5b, were characterized to catalyze the glycosylation of lignans with promiscuities toward various sugar acceptors and sugar donors, and pinoresinol was the preferred substrate. IiUGT71B5a was capable of efficiently producing both pinoresinol monoglycoside and diglycoside. However, IiUGT71B5b only produced monoglycoside, and exhibited considerably lower activity than IiUGT71B5a. Substrate screening indicated that ditetrahydrofuran is the essential structural characteristic for sugar acceptors. The transcription of IiUGT71B5s was highly consistent with the spatial distribution of pinoresinol glucosides, suggesting that IiUGT71B5s may play biological roles in the modification of pinoresinol in I. indigotica roots. This study not only provides insights into lignan biosynthesis, but also elucidates the functional diversity of the UGT family.","Chen, Xiao; Chen, Junfeng; Feng, Jingxian; Wang, Yun; Li, Shunuo; Xiao, Ying; Diao, Yong; Zhang, Lei; Chen, Wansheng",Front Plant Sci,591,1

Diabetes management is well suited for telehealth utilization if patients employ technology that efficiently generates, captures, and shares data with providers. Traditionally, training for automated insulin delivery devices is provided in-person to allow for a thorough understanding of the device and its use. However, during COVID-related quarantine regulations, most of these trainings needed to be conducted virtually. We performed a retrospective analysis of patient reported outcomes in people with diabetes who completed their training for the t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ technology between April and September, 2020 and had uploaded 30 days of pump usage data to Tandem’s t:connect® web application. Most participants were adults (90%), female (54%), and had type 1 diabetes (89.9%). Mean age of the sample was 46 years (SD=18.7). Of all 1,686 participants, 1,256 had received virtual pump training while the remaining were trained in-person (n=430). Most participants reported completing their training in 1 to 2 hours (61.5%). After concluding training, participants completed an online questionnaire evaluating their training experience (8 items). Item response options included a 5-point Likert scale with higher values reflecting greater satisfaction and better experience with training. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of training method (virtual vs. in-person) on training-related experience (p=.020). Specifically, participants receiving virtual pump training reported greater overall satisfaction with their training (4.78 vs. 4.65, p=.012) and with the time when their training was conducted (convenient scheduling) (4.74 vs. 4.56, p=.008) compared to their counterparts who underwent in-person training. There were no significant differences between virtually trained and in-person participants on pace of training (4.71 vs. 4.57), trainer’s pump knowledge (4.82 vs. 4.74), trainer’s ability to answer their questions (4.77 vs. 4.70), and participants’ confidence to use the pump after training (4.62 vs. 4.53). In conclusion, all participants irrespective of their training method (virtual or in-person) reported a positive experience with their training for using the t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ technology. Participants’ high scores on items evaluating their training method also reflects that their expectations of their training session were either met or exceeded. State-of-the-art technologies supporting diabetes management may benefit from patient-centric training methods to enable widespread optimal use. For future studies, it will be interesting to evaluate adherence to therapy by training method and relationship with glycemic outcomes.","Singh, Harsimran; Manning, Michelle; McElwee-Malloy, Molly; Habif, Steph",J Endocr Soc,591,1

Materials and methods: We examined 49 patients, which were hospitalized for inpatient treatment of COVID-19 infection from May to June 2020. Study group included 24 men (49%) and 25 women (51%), median age 58 years [48; 70], BMI 26.4 kg/m2 [24.3; 30.5]. All patients were diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 with median percent of lung involvement equal to 29% [14; 37], 22 patients (45%) required oxygen support upon admission. Median SpO2 was equal to 95% (92; 97), median NEWS score was equal to 3 [2; 6]. Participants were tested for vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and D3) by UPLC-MS/MS, free 25(OH)D and vitamin D-binding protein by ELISA, as well as PTH by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and routine biochemical parameters of blood serum (calcium, phosphorus, albumin) at the time of admission. Results: patients had in general very low 25()D3 levels - median 10.9 ng/mL [6.9; 15.6], corresponding to a pronounced vitamin D deficiency in half of the patients. Levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 were also low – 0.5 ng/mL [0.2; 0.9], and resulting vitamin D metabolite ratios (25(OH)D3/24,25(OH)2D3) were high-normal or elevated in most patients – 24.1 [19.0; 39.2], indicating decreased activity of 24-hydroxylase. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D3, on the contrary, were high-normal or elevated - 57 pg/mL [46; 79], which, in accordance with 25(OH)D3/1,25(OH)2D3 ratio (219 [134; 266]) suggests an increase in 1α-hydroxylase activity. Median level of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was 0.7 ng/mL [0.4; 1.0] and D3 metabolite was detectable only in 6 patients. Median DBP level was 432 mg/L [382; 498], median free 25(OH)D was 5.6 pg/mL [3.3; 6.7], median calculated free 25(OH)D was 2.0 pg/mL [1.4; 3.3]. Most patients had albumin-adjusted serum calcium level in the lower half of reference range (median 2.24 mmol/L [2.14; 2.34]). Seven patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism and one patient had primary hyperparathyroidism, the rest of the patients had PTH levels within the normal range.25(OH)D3 levels showed significant negative correlation with percent of lung involvement (r = -0.36, p<0.05) and positive correlation with SpO2 (r = 0.4, p<0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels correlated positively with 25(OH)D3 levels (r = 0.38, p<0.05) and did not correlate significantly with PTH levels (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggests that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection have significant impairment of vitamin D metabolism, in particular, an increase in 1α-hydroxylase activity, which cannot be fully explained by pre-existing conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The observed profound vitamin D deficiency and association of vitamin D levels with markers of disease severity indicate the importance of vitamin D supplementation in these patients.","Povaliaeva, Alexandra; Rozhinskaya, Liudmila Ya; Pigarova, Ekaterina A; Dzeranova, Larisa K; Katamadze, Nino N; Malysheva, Natalya; Nikankina, Larisa; Bogdanov, Viktor; Ioutsi, Vitaliy; Mokrysheva, Natalia G",J Endocr Soc,591,16

The data collection (n = 237) is based on a special writing assignment to the pupils, in which they are asked to describe how they tell their grandchildren about the time of the Corona crisis in the fictional future in the role of the grandparents—60 years later. The task requires an anticipatory effort from the present point of view, which stimulates them to reflect on their current situation from a certain “distance” (stimulating them to adopt a perspective and to construct a “vision”). The perspective of children is explicitly placed in the center of interest in order to draw conclusions about the issues that concern this age group in times of crisis. The aim is to find out how pupils from different European countries (Switzerland, Austria and Greece) deal with the Corona crisis and its consequences for their life-world, how they experience it and how they process it cognitively/emotionally. Theoretically, the study ties in with the concept of futures literacy.

Acute appendicitis accounts for a significant proportion surgical admissions in the UK. Intercollegiate general surgery guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic advised appendicitis should be managed conservatively, or with an open appendicectomy if indicated. Our aim was to determine the efficacy and safety of our ambulation service in the conservative management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. METHOD: Data was collected prospectively from 30(th) March 2020 – 16(th) August 2020 on all patients presenting with suspected appendicitis. Stable patients with clinically suspected or CT-proven appendicitis were discharged with oral antibiotics as per trust guidance. Readmissions for ambulated patients were recorded. RESULTS: 190 patients presented with suspected appendicitis (range 5-71years). 49.4% patients were deemed suitable for ambulation on initial assessment, 22% of which had a CT confirmed diagnosis on discharge. 65% of the ambulated patients underwent a telephone review within a 72-hour window. 13.8% of patients represented within a 30-day period, 7.4% of which proceeded to appendicectomy.

I present evidence suggesting that the same is true in Canada. In particular, since the beginning of the information and communications technology revolution, all of the decline in routine job employment occurred during the subsequent three recessions. A similar dynamic is likely to operate during the COVID crisis, and in fact is likely to be more pronounced due to the scale of the recession and the health-related incentives to automate. By constructing industry-level measures of worker exposure to COVID and the fraction of routine employment, I show that the retail, construction, manufacturing, wholesale, and transportation industries are likely to experience the biggest transformations. In these industries, government attempts to maintain the status quo will only delay the process of restructuring.

Therapeutic options remain limited, and vaccines may exhibit narrow efficacy, due to short supplies, delays in distribution and the emergence of new resistant strains. It is mandatory to study new therapeutic approaches that modulate the strong inflammatory response observed in the lung, prevent respiratory failure and improve outcomes. The study of SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenicity in vivo is challenging due to the necessary biosafety laboratory regulations. Thus, we developed an acute lung injury model by intratracheally instilling the S1 subunit of SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike S protein (400 µg/kg, 2 ml/kg body weight) in K18‐hACE2 transgenic mice that overexpress the human receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein S, ACE2, and investigated outcomes 72 hours later. Mice exhibited an acute decline in body weight during the first 48 hours following instillation, compared to saline‐instilled controls. At 72 hours, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated a dramatic increase in white blood cell content, particularly neutrophils, and marked proteinosis compared to controls. Histologic examination of lung tissue revealed hyaline membranes, alveolar septal thickening, and a large number of neutrophils in the interstitial and alveolar spaces of Spike protein S exposed mice. We propose that a single exposure of K18‐hACE2 mice to SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike Protein S subunit S1 may represent a valid model of COVID‐19, allow the study of the molecular mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2 induced lung injury and be useful in the investigation of potential new therapeutic approaches to the management of COVID‐19 as well as future coronavirus‐dependent respiratory diseases.","Solopov, Pavel; Colunga Biancatelli, Ruben; Sharlow, Elizabeth; Lazo, John; Catravas, John",FASEB J,591,24

It mainly depends on the heat flux brought by the arc and on the dimensions and residence time of the arc attachment to a given location on the anode wall. The latter depend, to a great extent, on the attachment mode of the arc on the anode wall. This paper compares the anode arc attachment modes predicted by an LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) and 2-T (two-temperature) arc models that include the electrodes in the computational domain. It deals with a commercial cascaded-anode plasma torch operated at high current (500 A) and low gas flow rate (60 NLPM of argon). It shows that the LTE model predicted a constricted anode arc attachment that moves on the anode ring, while the 2-T model predicted a diffuse and steady arc attachment. The comparison between the predicted and measured arc voltage showed that the 2-T prediction is closer to the actual voltage. Also, the post-mortem observation of a new anode ring of the actual plasma torch operated under the same conditions for a short time confirmed a diffuse arc attachment on a new anode.","Zhukovskii, Rodion; Chazelas, Christophe; Rat, Vincent; Vardelle, Armelle; Molz, Ron",J Therm Spray Tech,591,17

We deployed both Pooled OLS and Panel VAR as estimation methods. Generally, the results from POLS show the stock market returns of the Nigerian firms reacted negatively more to the global COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths than the domestic COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths and lockdown policy. The results of the impulse response functions revealed that the effects of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths and lockdown policy shocks on stock returns oscillate between negative and positive before the stock market returns converge to the equilibrium in the long run. The FEVD results showed that growth in the COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths and lockdown policy shocks explained little variations in stock market returns. Given our finding, we advocate for the relaxation of policy of lockdown and the combine use of monetary and fiscal policies to mitigate the negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on stock market returns in Nigeria.","Raifu, Isiaka Akande; Kumeka, Terver Theophilus; Aminu, Alarudeen",Futur Bus J,591,9

Moreover, health effects of specific UFP sources have not been explored. We assessed the impact of UFP sources on daily mortality in Barcelona, Helsinki, London, and Zurich. METHODS UFP sources were previously identified and quantified for the four cities: daily contributions of photonucleation, two traffic sources (fresh traffic and urban, with size mode around 30 nm and 70 nm, respectively), and secondary aerosols were obtained from data from an urban background station. Different periods were investigated in each city: Barcelona 2013-2016, Helsinki 2009-2016, London 2010-2016, and Zurich 2011-2014. The associations between total particle number concentrations (PNC) and UFP sources and daily (natural, cardiovascular [CVD], and respiratory) mortality were investigated using city-specific generalized linear models (GLM) with quasi-Poisson regression. RESULTS We found inconsistent results across cities, sources, and lags for associations with natural, CVD, and respiratory mortality. Increased risk was observed for total PNC and natural mortality in Helsinki (lag 2; 1.3% [0.07%, 2.5%]), CVD mortality in Barcelona (lag 1; 3.7% [0.17%, 7.4%]) and Zurich (lag 0; 3.8% [0.31%, 7.4%]), and respiratory mortality in London (lag 3; 2.6% [0.84%, 4.45%]) and Zurich (lag 1; 9.4% [1.0%, 17.9%]). A similar pattern of associations between health outcomes and total PNC was followed by the fresh traffic source, for which we also found the same associations and lags as for total PNC. The urban source (mostly aged traffic) was associated with respiratory mortality in Zurich (lag 1; 12.5% [1.7%, 24.2%]) and London (lag 3; 2.4% [0.90%, 4.0%]) while the secondary source was associated with respiratory mortality in Zurich (lag 1: 12.0% [0.63%, 24.5%]) and Helsinki (4.7% [0.11%, 9.5%]). Reduced risk for the photonucleation source was observed for respiratory mortality in Barcelona (lag 2, -8.6% [-14.5%, -2.4%]) and for CVD mortality in Helsinki, as this source is present only in clean atmospheres (lag 1, -1.48 [-2.75, -0.21]).

OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore what is known about patient portal evaluations and to provide recommendations for future endeavors. The focus is on mapping the measures used to assess the impact of patient portals on the dimensions of the Quadruple Aim (QA) framework and the Canada Health Infoway's Benefits Evaluation (BE) framework. METHODS A scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Reporting was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted using the Ovid platform, and the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (R) ALL (including epub ahead of print, in-process, and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, and PsycINFO. CINAHL on the EBSCO platform and Web of Science were searched for studies published between March 2015 and June 2020. A systematic gray literature search was conducted using the Google search engine. Extracted data were tabulated based on a coding template developed to categorize the literature into themes and areas of interest. RESULTS A total of 96 studies were included for data extraction. The studies were categorized based on the QA dimensions, with strict adherence to the definitions for each dimension. From the patients' perspective, it was determined that most evaluations focused on benefits and barriers to access, access to test results, medication adherence, condition management, medical notes, and secure messaging. From the population perspective, the evaluations focused on the increase in population outreach, decrease in disparities related to access to care services, and improvement in quality of care. From the health care workforce perspective, the evaluations focused on the impact of patients accessing medical records, impact on workflow, impact of bidirectional secure messaging, and virtual care. From the health system perspective, the evaluations focused on decreases in no-show appointments, impact on office visits and telephone calls, impact on admission and readmission rates and emergency department visits, and impact on health care use. Overall, 77 peer-reviewed studies were mapped on the expanded version of the BE framework. The mapping was performed using subdimensions to create a more precise representation of the areas that are currently explored when studying patient portals. Most of the studies evaluated more than one subdimension. CONCLUSIONS The QA and BE frameworks provide guidance in identifying gaps in the current literature by providing a way to show how an impact was assessed. This study highlights the need to appropriately plan how the impact will be assessed and how the findings will be translated into effective adaptations.","Avdagovska, Melita; Menon, Devidas; Stafinski, Tania",Journal of medical Internet research,591,26

METHODS The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched for trials comparing ESI to epidural or non-epidural placebo. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model for 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were described qualitatively. Quality of evidence was graded using GRADE classification. RESULTS Seventeen out of 732 articles were included. ESI was superior compared to epidural placebo at 6 weeks (- 8.6 [- 13.4; - 3.9]) and 3 months (- 5.2 [- 10.1; - 0.2]) for leg pain and at 6 weeks for functional status (- 4.1 [- 6.5; - 1.6]), though the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) was not met. There was no difference in ESI and placebo for back pain, except for non-epidural placebo at 3 months (6.9 [1.3; 12.5]). Proportions of treatment success were not different. ESI reduced analgesic intake in some studies and complication rates are low. CONCLUSION The literature indicates that ESI induces larger improvements in pain and disability on the short term compared to epidural placebo, though evidence is of low to moderate quality and MCID is not met. Strong conclusions for longer follow-up or for comparisons with non-epidural placebo cannot be drawn due to general low quality of evidence and limited number of studies. Epidural injections can be considered a safe therapy.","Verheijen, E J A; Bonke, C A; Amorij, E M J; Vleggeert-Lankamp, C L A","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",591,1

Its incidence has risen over time in Canada and the USA. While the majority of AKI-D will recover to dialysis independence at the time of hospital discharge, 10-30% will transition to outpatient dialysis. The risk factors that determine dialysis independence after AKI-D and its optimal outpatient management remain unclear. Eliciting prognostic predictors of kidney recovery in patients who remain on dialysis after hospital discharge will guide subsequent clinical decision making. The objective of this study is to assess the association between patient- and treatment-related factors with short- and long-term outcomes in patients who remained dialysis-dependent after hospitalization with AKI-D. METHODS A literature search in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed will be performed based on pre-specified criteria. There are no restrictions on language and publication dates. The supplemental search will include manual scan of bibliographies of eligible studies and grey literature assessment. Pre-specified criteria will be used to select eligible studies. Relevant data will be extracted and quality assessments performed per validated tools. Qualitative data synthesis will be performed to reflect directions of associations. Meta-analysis will be formed if two or more studies with similar prognostic factors, outcomes, and adequate quality are identified. Strength of association will be quantified as odds ratios. Reporting of this review will be guided by recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. DISCUSSION This systematic review aims to synthesize association between modifiable and non-modifiable prognostic factors with renal outcomes in AKI-D patients who remain dialysis-dependent after hospital discharge. Our findings will help inform the development of evidence-based management and guide long-term treatment planning for AKI-D patients.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine safety and effectiveness of venous stent placement in patients with iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction. METHODS AND RESULTS We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies evaluating safety or effectiveness of stent placement in patients with iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction. Data were extracted by disease pathogenesis: nonthrombotic, acute thrombotic, or chronic post-thrombotic. Main outcomes included technical success, periprocedural complications, symptom relief at final follow-up, and primary/secondary patency through 5 years. A total of 37 studies reporting 45 treatment effects (nonthrombotic, 8; acute thrombotic, 19; and chronic post-thrombotic, 18) from 2869 patients (nonthrombotic, 1122; acute thrombotic, 629; and chronic post-thrombotic, 1118) were included. Technical success rates were comparable among groups, ranging from 94% to 96%. Complication rates ranged from 0.3% to 1.1% among groups for major bleeding, from 0.2% to 0.9% for pulmonary embolism, from 0.1% to 0.7% for periprocedural mortality, and from 1.0% to 6.8% for early thrombosis. Patient symptom relief data were reported inconsistently. At 1 year, primary and secondary patency were 96% and 99% for nonthrombotic, 87% and 89% for acute thrombotic, and 79% and 94% for chronic post-thrombotic.

However, there are only limited data on the accuracy of radiotherapy target volume delineation by FDG PET. The purpose of this study was to validate FDG PET segmentation tools for volume assessment of lymph node metastases from head and neck cancer against the pathological method as the standard. METHODS Twelve patients with head and neck cancer and 28 metastatic lymph nodes eligible for therapeutic neck dissection underwent preoperative FDG PET/CT. The metastatic lymph nodes were delineated on CT (NodeCT) and ten PET segmentation tools were used to assess FDG PET-based nodal volumes: interpreting FDG PET visually (PETVIS), applying an isocontour at a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 (PETSUV), two segmentation tools with a fixed threshold of 40% and 50%, and two adaptive threshold based methods. The latter four tools were applied with the primary tumour as reference and also with the lymph node itself as reference. Nodal volumes were compared with the true volume as determined by pathological examination. RESULTS Both NodeCT and PETVIS showed good correlations with the pathological volume. PET segmentation tools using the metastatic node as reference all performed well but not better than PETVIS. The tools using the primary tumour as reference correlated poorly with pathology. PETSUV was unsatisfactory in 35% of the patients due to merging of the contours of adjacent nodes. CONCLUSION FDG PET accurately estimates metastatic lymph node volume, but beyond the detection of lymph node metastases (staging), it has no added value over CT alone for the delineation of routine radiotherapy target volumes. If FDG PET is used in radiotherapy planning, treatment adaptation or response assessment, we recommend an automated segmentation method for purposes of reproducibility and interinstitutional comparison.","Schinagl, Dominic A X; Span, Paul N; van den Hoogen, Frank J A; Merkx, Matthias A W; Slootweg, Piet J; Oyen, Wim J G; Kaanders, Johannes H A M",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,591,1

Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, was evaluated and characterized for its anti-NS5B activity in vitro and in HCV replicon cells. METHODS Recombinant NS5B, HCV replicase and Huh-7 cells harbouring the subgenomic HCV replicon of genotype 1b were employed for biochemical and mechanistic investigations. RESULTS Analysis of ATA activity in vitro yielded equipotent inhibition of recombinant NS5B and HCV replicase in the submicromolar range (50% inhibition concentration [IC(50)] approximately 150 nM). Biochemical and mechanistic studies revealed a bimodal mechanism of ATA inhibition with characteristics of pyrophosphate mimics and non-nucleoside inhibitors. Molecular modelling and competition displacement studies were consistent with these parameters, suggesting that ATA might bind to the benzothiadiazine allosteric pocket 3 of NS5B or at its catalytic centre. Kinetic studies revealed a mixed mode of ATA inhibition with respect to both RNA and UTP substrates. Under single-cycle assay conditions, ATA inhibited HCV NS5B initiation and elongation from pre-bound RNA, but with > or =fivefold decreased potency compared with continuous polymerization conditions. The IC(50) value of ATA for the native replicase complex was 145 nM. In HCV replicon cells, ATA treatment ablated HCV RNA replication (50% effective concentration =75 nM) with concomitant decrease in NS5B expression and no apparent cytotoxic effects. CONCLUSIONS This study identified ATA as a potent anti-NS5B inhibitor and suggests that its unique mode of action might be exploited for structural refinement and development of novel anti-NS5B agents.","Chen, Ye; Bopda-Waffo, Alain; Basu, Amartya; Krishnan, Ramalingam; Silberstein, Erica; Taylor, Deborah R; Talele, Tanaji T; Arora, Payal; Kaushik-Basu, Neerja",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,591,6

They can cause hematuria, anemization and flank pain. Endovascular treatment is recommended due to its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE To assess the potential difference between the embolization of iatrogenic renal PSA and iatrogenic renal PSA + AVF, in terms of technical and clinical success rate, procedure complexity and impact on the renal function. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 30 embolization procedures of iatrogenic renal PSA and renal PSA + AVF in 27 patients in two centers between December 2006 and February 2017, comparing technical and clinical success rate, total procedural time, creatinine before and after the procedure and parenchymal ischemic area after the procedure. All patients underwent CT before embolization procedure and different embolization materials were used. RESULTS We identified 15 iatrogenic renal PSA and 15 iatrogenic renal PSA + AVF (causes: 23 nephron-sparing surgery, 2 nephrostomies, 1 lithotripsy, 1 ureteroscopic pyelolithotomy, 1 renal biopsy). Microcoils were used in 21 cases, microcoils and Spongostan in 3 cases, microcoils and controlled-release microcoils in 4 cases and controlled-release microcoils in 1 case.

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, paired prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Client-owned dogs (n = 22) presented for elective Lap OVE. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two protocols: protocol 1 required the left ovary resected using SCUD and the right ovary using LVSD; protocol 2 required the left ovary resected using LVSD and the right ovary using SCUD. Duration of ovary excision, complications, surgical smoke production, and collateral thermal damage were compared between SCUD and LVSD. Total surgery duration, postoperative convalescence, obesity, mesovarial fat score, and technique-associated costs were also recorded. RESULTS Ovary excision was significantly faster with LVSD than SCUD. Surgical smoke production was significantly greater for SCUD than LVSD. Minor pedicle hemorrhage occurred 3 times with SCUD and one time with LVSD (not significantly different) and was easily corrected intraoperative. Presence of hemorrhage significantly increased ovary excision time. Technique-associated costs were lower for SCUD than LVSD. No significant differences were found in collateral thermal damage between SCUD and LVSD. Total surgery duration and convalescence time were similar to previous reports of Lap OVE in dogs at the authors' institution.

Significant improvements from pre- to posttraining were seen in cecal intubation time (229 ± 97 vs. 150 ± 57 s; p < 0.001), total time (454 ± 147 vs. 320 ± 115 s; p < 0.001), screening efficiency (85% ± 12% vs. 91% ± 5%; p < 0.002), GAGES scores (15 vs. 19; p < 0.001), subjects' endoscopy self-rating scores (1.5 ± 1.0 vs. 2.7 ± 0.6; range, 0-4; p < 0.001), and comfort level with flexible endoscopy skills (3.4 ± 3.0 vs. 7.2 ± 1.2; range, 0-8; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of sharing educational and training resources among institutions was demonstrated. Likewise, the concept of ""mobile simulation"" appears to be useful and effective, with three of the four institutions involved successfully in implementing the training curriculum during a fixed period. Additionally, subjects who completed the training demonstrated both subjective and objective improvements in flexible endoscopy skills.","Van Sickle, Kent R; Buck, Lauren; Willis, Ross; Mangram, Alicia; Truitt, Michael S; Shabahang, Mohsen; Thomas, Scott; Trombetta, Lee; Dunkin, Brian; Scott, Daniel",Surgical endoscopy,591,1

No network meta-analyses have examined the effects of psychotherapy compared with pharmacotherapy, combined treatment, care as usual, and other control conditions among patients in primary care. METHODS We conducted systematic searches of bibliographic databases to identify randomized trials comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy, combined treatment, care as usual, waitlist, and pill placebo. The main outcome was treatment response (50% improvement of depressive symptoms from baseline to end point). RESULTS A total of 58 studies with 9,301 patients were included. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy were significantly more effective than care as usual (relative risk [RR] for response = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.40-1.83 and RR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.35-2.03, respectively) and waitlist (RR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.57-3.51 and RR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.57-3.74, respectively) control groups. We found no significant differences between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22). The effects were significantly greater for combined treatment compared with psychotherapy alone (RR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00-1.81). The difference between combined treatment and pharmacotherapy became significant when limited to studies with low risk of bias and studies limited to cognitive behavior therapy. CONCLUSIONS Psychotherapy is likely effective for the treatment of depression when compared with care as usual or waitlist, with effects comparable to those of pharmacotherapy. Combined treatment might be better than either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone.","Cuijpers, Pim; Oud, Matthijs; Karyotaki, Eirini; Noma, Hisashi; Quero, Soledad; Cipriani, Andrea; Arroll, Bruce; Furukawa, Toshi A",Annals of family medicine,591,16

Rheumatologists were among the pre-World War II pioneers developing and documenting arthroscopy. The post-War father of modern arthroscopy, Watanabe, found rheumatologists among his early students, who took back the technique to their home countries, teaching orthopedists and rheumatologists alike. Rheumatologists described and analyzed the intra-articular features of their common diseases in the '60s and '70s. A groundswell of interest from academic rheumatologists in adapting arthroscopy grew considerably in the '90s with development of ""needle scopes"" that could be used in an office setting. Rheumatologists helped conduct the very trials the findings of which reduced demand for their arthroscopic services by questioning the efficacy of arthroscopic debridement in osteoarthritis (OA) and also developing biological compounds that greatly reduced the call for any resective intervention in inflammatory arthropathies. The arthroscope has proven an excellent tool for viewing and sampling synovium and continues to serve this purpose at several international research centers. While cartilage is now imaged mainly by magnetic resonance imaging, some OA features - such as a high prevalence of visible calcinosis - beg further arthroscopy-directed investigation. A new generation of ""needle scopes"" with far superior optics awaits future investigators, should they develop interest.","Ike, Robert W; Kalunian, Kenneth C",International journal of rheumatic diseases,591,29

The purpose of this study was to determine the precision and accuracy of intraoperative LLD and CO measurement with express workflow robotic THA. METHODS Between February 2018 and December 2019, 30 patients underwent an express workflow robot-assisted primary THA for intraoperative LLD and CO measurements. Postoperative radiographs were used for LLD and CO measurement. In order to examine the accuracy of the robotic system assessment, the absolute difference between the robotic assessments and radiographic evaluations was calculated. RESULTS Intraoperative robotic measurements reported a mean error of 0.2-0.6 mm for each registration, with no significant difference between them (p = 0.311). The average absolute discrepancies between the robotic and radiographic assessments in the LLD and CO measurements were 1.3 ± 1.5 mm (p = 0.17) and 1.1 ± 0.9 mm (p = 0.11), respectively, while the Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0.69 and 0.71. CONCLUSIONS An external marker without a femoral array inserted into a screw positioned in the greater trochanter would be an easier and faster method to measure LLD and CO.

We aimed to compare the feasibility of laparoscopic splenectomy versus open splenectomy for massive splenomegaly from different surgical aspects in children. METHODS The data of children aged <12 years with massive splenomegaly who underwent splenectomy for hematologic disorders were retrospectively reviewed in 2 pediatric surgery centers from June 2004 until July 2012. RESULTS The study included 32 patients, 12 who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy versus 20 who underwent open splenectomy. The mean ages were 8.5 years and 8 years in the laparoscopic splenectomy group and open splenectomy group, respectively. The mean operative time was 180 minutes for laparoscopic splenectomy and 120 minutes for open splenectomy. The conversion rate was 8%. The mean amount of intraoperative blood loss was 60 mL in the laparoscopic splenectomy group versus 110 mL in the open splenectomy group. Postoperative atelectasis developed in 2 cases in the open splenectomy group (10%) and 1 case in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (8%). Oral feeding postoperatively resumed at a mean of 7.5 hours in the laparoscopic splenectomy group versus 30 hours in the open splenectomy group. The mean hospital stay was 36 hours in the laparoscopic splenectomy group versus 96 hours in the open splenectomy group. Postoperative pain was less in the laparoscopic splenectomy group. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic splenectomy for massive splenomegaly in children is safe and feasible. Although the operative time was significantly greater in the laparoscopic splenectomy group, laparoscopic splenectomy was associated with statistically significantly less pain, less blood loss, better recovery, and shorter hospital stay. Laparoscopic splenectomy for pediatric hematologic disorders should be the gold-standard approach regardless of the size of the spleen.","Hassan, Mohamed E; Al Ali, Khalid",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,591,1

Following acute infection with hepatotropic viruses, iDCs are essential for re-stimulating virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and therefore contribute to virus control. Here we used the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model system to identify novel signals, which influence the recruitment and activation of iDCs in the liver. We observed that intrinsic expression of Toso (Faim3, FcμR) influenced the differentiation and activation of iDCs in vivo and DCs in vitro. Lack of iDCs in Toso-deficient (Toso(-/-)) mice reduced CD8(+) T-cell function in the liver and resulted in virus persistence. Furthermore, Toso(-/-) DCs failed to induce autoimmune diabetes in the rat insulin promoter-glycoprotein (RIP-GP) autoimmune diabetes model. In conclusion, we found that Toso has an essential role in the differentiation and maturation of iDCs, a process that is required for the control of persistence-prone virus infection.","Lang, P A; Meryk, A; Pandyra, A A; Brenner, D; Brüstle, A; Xu, H C; Merches, K; Lang, F; Khairnar, V; Sharma, P; Funkner, P; Recher, M; Shaabani, N; Duncan, G S; Duhan, V; Homey, B; Ohashi, P S; Häussinger, D; Knolle, P A; Honke, N; Mak, T W; Lang, K S",Cell death and differentiation,591,1

Conversely, the AR agonist inhibits ISC differentiation but augments proliferation in ovariectomized mice.

We aimed to prospectively assess the insulinoma detection rate of single-photon emission CT in combination with CT (SPECT/CT) with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor avid radiotracer, and compare detection rates with conventional CT/MRI techniques. METHODS In our prospective imaging study, we enrolled adults aged 25-81 years at centres in Germany, Switzerland, and the UK. Eligible patients had proven clinical and biochemical endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and no evidence for metastatic disease on conventional imaging. CT/MRI imaging was done at referring centres according to standard protocols. At three tertiary nuclear medicine centres, we used whole body planar images and SPECT/CT of the abdomen up to 168 h after injection of (111)In-[Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-(111)In)NH2]-exendin-4 ((111)In-DTPA-exendin-4) to identify insulinomas. Consenting patients underwent surgery and imaging findings were confirmed histologically. FINDINGS Between Oct 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2011, we recruited 30 patients. All patients underwent (111)In-DTPA-exendin-4 imaging, 25 patients underwent surgery (with histological analysis), and 27 patients were assessed with CT/MRI. (111)In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT correctly detected 19 insulinomas and four additional positive lesions (two islet-cell hyperplasia and two uncharacterised lesions) resulting in a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 62-94). One true negative (islet-cell hyperplasia) and one false negative (malignant insulinoma) result was identified in separate patients by (111)In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT. Seven patients (23%) were referred to surgery on the basis of (111)In-DTPA-exendin-4 imaging alone. For 23 assessable patients, (111)In-DTPA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT had a higher sensitivity (95% [95% CI 74-100]) than did CT/MRI (47% [27-68]; p=0.011).

Here, the role of sensory nerve fibers in this abnormal cell fate decision is investigated using a severe extremity injury model in mice. Soft tissue trauma results in NGF (Nerve growth factor) expression, particularly within perivascular cell types. Consequently, NGF-responsive axonal invasion occurs which precedes osteocartilaginous differentiation. Surgical denervation impedes axonal ingrowth, with significant delays in cartilage and bone formation. Likewise, either deletion of Ngf or two complementary methods to inhibit its receptor TrkA (Tropomyosin receptor kinase A) lead to similar delays in axonal invasion and osteochondral differentiation. Mechanistically, single-cell sequencing suggests a shift from TGFβ to FGF signaling activation among pre-chondrogenic cells after denervation. Finally, analysis of human pathologic specimens and databases confirms the relevance of NGF-TrkA signaling in human disease. In sum, NGF-mediated TrkA-expressing axonal ingrowth drives abnormal osteochondral differentiation after soft tissue trauma. NGF-TrkA signaling inhibition may have dual therapeutic use in soft tissue trauma, both as an analgesic and negative regulator of aberrant stem cell differentiation.","Lee, Seungyong; Hwang, Charles; Marini, Simone; Tower, Robert J; Qin, Qizhi; Negri, Stefano; Pagani, Chase A; Sun, Yuxiao; Stepien, David M; Sorkin, Michael; Kubiak, Carrie A; Visser, Noelle D; Meyers, Carolyn A; Wang, Yiyun; Rasheed, Husain A; Xu, Jiajia; Miller, Sarah; Huber, Amanda K; Minichiello, Liliana; Cederna, Paul S; Kemp, Stephen W P; Clemens, Thomas L; James, Aaron W; Levi, Benjamin",Nature communications,591,15

The remarkable features for the occurrence time of Fa, that the positive Fa (CO2 emission from soil) and negative Fa (CO2 absorption by soil) generally occurred in the daytime and nighttime, respectively, suggested that the generation of Fa is related to temperature. Previous studies have focused on the sole effect of soil temperature (Ts) or air temperature (Ta) on Fa, but very little is regarding to the overall response of Fa to both Ta and Ts in the air-soil system. In the Mu Us Desert, China, we continuously measured the hourly Fa, Ts, Ta and the difference between Ta and Ts (Ta-Ts) at 4-day intervals from June to October 2016. During this period, soil abiotically absorbed atmospheric CO2 at a rate of 0.32 ± 0.19 g m-2 d-1. Fa was not correlated with Ts and was weakly correlated with Ta, however, it was strongly and positively correlated with Ta-Ts. A quadratic model adequately fitted the relationship between Fa and Ta-Ts, and similar relationships were also observed between positive Fa and Ta-Ts and between negative Fa and Ta-Ts. The results of Fa measurement highlight that desert soils can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through abiotic processes. The relationships of Fa with Ts, Ta and Ta-Ts indicate that, abiotic CO2 exchange between soil and atmosphere depends on air-soil temperature gradient in desert. Furthermore, the thermal convection driven by Ta-Ts may play a major role in the generation of nocturnal negative Fa. Our findings provide a new possible perspective for revealing the reasons of Fa generation in drylands.","Gao, Yang; Zhao, Zhong; Zhang, Yuqing; Liu, Jiabin",The Science of the total environment,591,19

As part of the response, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to detect PEDV were developed by several veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Our study evaluated RT-PCR PEDV assays that detect the N gene (gN) and S gene (gS) for their ability to detect PEDV infection and the transmission potential of pigs experimentally exposed to PEDV. Detection limits and quantification cycle (Cq) values of real-time RT-PCR were assayed for PEDV samples and positive controls for both gN and gS.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to determine BV of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in healthy dogs and dogs with 3 stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). METHODS Healthy dogs and dogs with 3 stages of MMVD were prospectively assigned to groups based on comprehensive clinical evaluation using current guidelines. Concentrations of cTnI were measured hourly, daily, and weekly using standard and high-sensitivity immunoassays. Within- (CVI ) and between-subject (CVG ) coefficients of variability, percent reference change value (RCV), and index of individuality (IoI) were calculated. RESULTS All 10 healthy dogs and 76/112 (68%) of samples from 28 MMVD dogs had cTnI concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) using a standard sensitivity immunoassay. Only 49/160 (31%) of healthy dog samples and no MMVD samples had cTnI below the high-sensitivity immunoassay LOD. Data analysis for the high-sensitivity immunoassay revealed CVI of 48.1%, CVG of 60.1%, RCV of 134.0%, and IoI of 0.804 in healthy dogs. In MMVD dogs, CVI was 39.6%, CVG was 80.7%, RCV was 110%, and IoI was 0.494. Of all MMVD dogs, those with Stage B2 had the lowest RCV of 91%. CONCLUSIONS Biologic variability affects cTnI concentrations in healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. Consideration of BV may be clinically relevant when monitoring individual changes in cTnI values, using high-sensitivity immunoassays.","Winter, Randolph L; Saunders, Ashley B; Gordon, Sonya G; Miller, Matthew W; Fosgate, Geoffrey T; Suchodolski, Jan S; Steiner, Jörg M",Veterinary clinical pathology,591,1

Risk of COVID-19 does not seem to increase in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) considering based on current reports. Current medications for IBD do not increase this risk; on the contrary, some of these might be used as therapeutics against COVID-19 and are under clinical trial. Unless the patients have confirmed COVID-19 and severe pneumonia or a high oxygen demand, medical treatment should be continued during the pandemic, except for the use of high-dose corticosteroids. Adherence to general recommendations such as social distancing, wearing facial masks, and vaccination, especially for pneumococcal infections and influenza, is also required. Patients with COVID-19 need to be withhold immunomodulators or biologics for at least 2 weeks and treated based on both IBD and COVID-19 severity. Prevention of IBD relapse caused by sudden medication interruption is important because negative outcomes associated with disease flare up, such as corticosteroid use or hospitalization, are much riskier than medications. The outpatient clinic and infusion center for biologics need to be reserved safe spaces, and endoscopy or surgery should be considered in urgent cases only.","Kim, Kyeong Ok; Jang, Byung Ik",Intestinal research,591,1

METHODOLOGY An online survey divided into nine categories was sent using SurveyMonkey software to 37 dental schools, before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study included 50 questions to evaluate preclinical endodontic education, such as faculty-to-student ratios, topics taught and materials used, in preclinical phantom head courses. Seven and 14 days after the first e-mail contact, dental schools received a reminder e-mail. After four and six weeks the dental schools were contacted by telephone and asked to participate in the online survey. The processing time was eight weeks in total. RESULTS The response rate was 89%. Preclinical endodontic education at the participating dental schools differs considerably. Theory classes ranged from 1 to 70 hours (15 h mean), practical classes from 3 to 78 hours (39 h mean). The faculty-to-student ratio varied between 1:4 and 1:38 (1:15 mean). Forty-five per cent of the dental schools had a specialist in endodontics teaching theory. Several dental microscopes were available for preclinical teaching purposes at 82% of the dental schools. The majority (82%) taught root canal preparation with rotary or reciprocating NiTi instruments. Overall, 85% of the dental schools taught lateral compaction, among other methods, for canal filling. CONCLUSION A substantial divergence amongst the dental schools regarding the time dedicated to theory and practical instruction in Endodontology was reported. However, convergence in the use of root canal treatment techniques and materials was reported.","Sacha, S; Sonntag, D; Burmeister, U; Rüttermann, S; Gerhardt-Szép, S",International endodontic journal,591,20

Spironolactone has shown promising kidney protective effects in renal IRI in rats. We investigated the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of spironolactone (100 mg/kg) administered immediately after 40 min unilateral kidney ischemia in rats. Hyperpolarized MRI using co-polarized [1-13 C]pyruvate and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea as well as 1 H dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI was performed 24 h after induction of ischemia. We found a significant decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) in the ischemic kidney compared with the contralateral one measured using DCE and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea. The RBF measured using [1-13 C]pyruvate and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea was significantly altered by spironolactone. The RBFs in the ischemic kidney compared with the contralateral kidney were decreased similarly as measured using both [13 C,15 N2 ]urea and [1-13 C]pyruvate in the spironolactone-treated group. Spironolactone treatment increased the perfusion-corrected pyruvate metabolism by 54% in both the ischemic and contralateral kidney. Furthermore, we showed a correlation between vascular permeability using a histological Evans blue analysis and the ratio of the volumes of distribution (VoDs), ie VoD-[13 C,15 N2 ]urea/VoD-[1-13 C]pyruvate. This suggests that [13 C,15 N2 ]urea/[1-13 C]pyruvate VoD ratio may be a novel indicator of renal vascular permeability associated with renal damage in rodents.","Lindhardt, Jakob Lykke; Nielsen, Per Mose; Hansen, Esben Søvsø Szocska; Qi, Haiyun; Tougaard, Rasmus Stilling; Mariager, Christian Østergaard; Bertelsen, Lotte Bonde; Kim, Won Yong; Laustsen, Christoffer",NMR in biomedicine,591,1

We report the results of implementing common data elements (CDEs) to document epilepsy history data in the electronic medical record (EMR) after 12 months of clinical use in outpatient encounters. METHODS Data regarding seizure frequency were collected during routine clinical encounters using a CDE-based form within our EMR. We extracted CDE data from the EMR and developed measurements for seizure severity and seizure improvement scores. Seizure burden and improvement was evaluated by patient demographic and encounter variables for in-person and telemedicine encounters. RESULTS We assessed a total of 1696 encounters in 1038 individuals with childhood epilepsies between September 6, 2019 and September 11, 2020 contributed by 32 distinct providers. Childhood absence epilepsy (n = 121), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 86), and Dravet syndrome (n = 42) were the most common epilepsy syndromes. Overall, 43% (737/1696) of individuals had at least monthly seizures, 17% (296/1696) had a least daily seizures, and 18% (311/1696) were seizure-free for >12 months. Quantification of absolute seizure burden and changes in seizure burden over time differed between epilepsy syndromes, including high and persistent seizure burden in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Individuals seen via telemedicine or in-person encounters had comparable seizure frequencies. Individuals identifying as Hispanic/Latino, particularly from postal codes with lower median household incomes, were more likely to have ongoing seizures that worsened over time. SIGNIFICANCE Standardized documentation of clinical data in childhood epilepsies through CDE can be implemented in routine clinical care at scale and enables assessment of disease burden, including characterization of seizure burden over time. Our data provide insights into heterogeneous patterns of seizure control in common pediatric epilepsy syndromes and will inform future initiatives focusing on patient-centered outcomes in childhood epilepsies, including the impact of telemedicine and health care disparities.","Fitzgerald, Mark P; Kaufman, Michael C; Massey, Shavonne L; Fridinger, Sara; Prelack, Marisa; Ellis, Colin; Ortiz-Gonzalez, Xilma; Fried, Lawrence E; DiGiovine, Marissa P; Melamed, Susan; Malcolm, Marissa; Banwell, Brenda; Stephenson, Donna; Witzman, Stephanie M; Gonzalez, Alexander; Dlugos, Dennis; Kessler, Sudha Kilaru; Goldberg, Ethan M; Abend, Nicholas S; Helbig, Ingo",Epilepsia,591,1

The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Eighteen trials examining the effect of aerobic, resistance, balance or combined exercise programs met the eligibility criteria. All types of exercise were associated with improvements in glycemic control, blood pressure, waist circumference, blood lipids, muscle strength, functional mobility, quality of life or neuropathy progression. The majority of included studies were of poor methodological quality. Few studies compared different types or dose of exercise. In conclusion, this review supports the benefits of exercise for south Asians with T2DM, although it was not possible to identify the most effective exercise prescription.

Although GAGs represent a number of computational challenges, molecular docking is a powerful tool for analysis of their interactions. Despite the recent development of GAG-specific docking approaches, there is plenty of room for improvement. Here, replica exchange molecular dynamics with repulsive scaling (REMD-RS) recently proved to be a successful approach for protein-protein complexes, was applied to dock GAGs. In this method, effective pairwise radii are increased in different Hamiltonian replicas. REMD-RS is shown to be an attractive alternative to classical docking approaches for GAGs. This work contributes to setting up of GAG-specific computational protocols and provides new insights into the nature of these biological systems.","Maszota-Zieleniak, Martyna; Marcisz, Mateusz; Kogut, Małgorzata M; Siebenmorgen, Till; Zacharias, Martin; Samsonov, Sergey A",Journal of computational chemistry,591,1

We conducted a subgroup analysis of a multicenter, multinational, prospective, observational web-based database (EUPHAS2 registry). We included 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasal/oral swab, admitted to the ICU between February and May 2020, who were affected by septic shock and received PMX-HP as per clinical indication of the attending physician.

METHODS We retrospectively studied the surgical outcomes of 83 eyes of 83 patients after modified DS for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension. In 39 eyes, combination of DS, incision of the trabeculo-Descemet's membrane, and iridectomy were performed (DSF-); in 44 eyes, a scleral fenestration between the supraciliary space and lake was added to the DSF- (DSF+). Forty-eight eyes of 48 patients with POAG who underwent trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C (lect MMC) served as controls. RESULTS The probability of bleb survival was more common in the following order: lect MMC>DSF->DSF+ (P=0.0029). A significantly greater intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction occurred in the lect MMC group compared with the DSF+ (P=0.0015) and DSF- (P=0.0006) groups. So far as the eyes that underwent DS were concerned, bleb formation (P=0.0130) and a scleral bed fenestration (P=0.0315) significantly lowered the IOP by the Cox proportional hazard model. In eyes treated with DSF+, the positive IOP-lowering effect of the fenestration was counterbalanced by inhibited bleb formation and resulted in equivalent IOP reductions in the DSF+ and DSF- groups (P=0.9881). IOP reduction by DSF+ without a bleb was 25.0% at 1 year (P=0.00015) and this reduction increased to 43.2% (P=0.0001) when eyes accompany a bleb and scleral fenestration. CONCLUSIONS Both the scleral fenestration and bleb formation lower IOP, whereas the scleral fenestration suppresses bleb formation in patients treated with DS.","Chihara, Etsuo; Hayashi, Ken",Journal of glaucoma,591,1

We sought to evaluate the association of admission BP with early outcomes in patients with ELVO treated with EVT. METHODS Consecutive patients with AIS presenting with ELVO in a tertiary stroke center during a 4-year period were prospectively evaluated. Admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured using automated cuff recordings. A blinded neuroradiologist calculated the final infarct volume (FIV) using standardized ABC/2 methodology. A favorable functional outcome (FFO) at 3 months was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. RESULTS Our study population consisted of 116 patients with AIS (mean age 63±13 years, median NIH Stroke Scale score 17 points (IQR 14-21), median FIV 30 cm3 (IQR 8-94)). Higher admission SBP correlated with higher FIV (r +0.225; p=0.020). Patients with FFO had lower admission SBP (151±24 mm Hg vs 165±28 mm Hg; p=0.010), while admission SBP levels were higher in patients who died during hospitalization (169±34 mm Hg vs 156±24 mm Hg; p=0.043). A 10 mm Hg increment in admission SBP was independently (p=0.010) associated with an increase of 12 cm3 in FIV (95% CI 3 to 21) in multiple linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders. A 10 mm Hg increment in admission SBP was independently (p=0.012) associated with a lower likelihood of FFO at 3 months (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91) in multiple logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders.

Moreover, the extent of leukocyte count decline remains to be studied. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of leukopenia in patients with SLE of Han ethnicity in China. METHODS A single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in Chinese Han patients with SLE from June 2013 to August 2020. RESULTS A total of 125 patients with SLE were included in the study, and 104 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. The prevalence of leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia was 40.0, 20.8, and 55.2%, respectively. The median leukocyte count in the leukopenia group was 2.80 × 109/l, the median neutrophil count in the neutropenia group was 1.40 × 109/l, and the median lymphocyte count in the lymphopenia group was 0.60 × 109/l, which was 47.06, 40.58, and 30.00% of the median of the healthy control group, respectively. The lymphocyte count of SLE patients without lymphopenia was also lower than that of healthy controls, and the lymphocyte count was negatively correlated with the SLE disease activity index 2000 score in all patients with SLE. Independent risk factors for neutropenia include decreased platelet count and lymphocyte count, as well as the presentation of cylindruria. For lymphopenia, the independent risk factors were positivity for anti-dsDNA antibody and Coombs' test, decreased platelet count, and cylindruria. CONCLUSIONS In Han Chinese patients with SLE, leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia are common clinical manifestations, and the degree of reduction in blood cell count was also remarkable. Lymphopenia is associated with disease severity in patients with SLE. The correlation between Coombs' test results and lymphopenia deserves further study.","Lu, Wentian; Zhong, Ying; Zhang, Yi; Liu, Zhichun; Xue, Leixi",Rheumatology and therapy,591,4

Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) has been highlighted in the recent literature as a means of performing a range of common, minimal access, paediatric surgical procedures. The primary attraction is the absence of visible scarring. Aim. This study aims to describe a cosmetically advantageous means of SILS port placement in children, which preserves the umbilical profile. Methods. We describe a paediatric case series utilising a semicircular incision in the superior umbilical fold for SILS procedures. The linea alba is exposed over 2 cm just superior to the umbilical ring and stay sutures are applied. A vertical incision is made over this distance without entering the umbilical ring. Data were recorded prospectively in a Microsoft Excel database. Results. Twenty-one cases were performed in a 1-year period. Ten appendicectomies, 5 ovarian/paraovarian cystectomies, 2 Palomo procedures, 3 nephrectomy/heminephrectomies, and 1 Meckel's diverticulectomy were performed. There was 1 wound infection. No incisional hernias occurred. Discussion. We believe that our technique, which maintains the integrity of the umbilical ring and allows preservation of the umbilical profile, offers a distinct cosmetic advantage over other incisions for SILS which distort it. Conclusion. We have demonstrated the aesthetic benefits of utilising a superior umbilical-fold incision for SILS in children.","Blackburn, S C; Adams, S D; Mahomed, A A",Minimally invasive surgery,591,9

The neural mechanisms that support this novel cognitive faculty are still unknown. On the other hand, reading and calculation abilities represent slightly less recent human activities, in which neural correlates are relatively well understood. We hypothesize that calculus and reading brain networks provide joint underpinnings with distinctly weighted contributions which concern programming tasks, in particular concerning error identification. Based on a meta-analysis of the core regions involved in both reading and math and recent experimental evidence on the neural basis of programming tasks, we provide a theoretical account that integrates the role of these networks in program understanding. In this connectivity-based framework, error-monitoring processing regions in the frontal cortex influence the insula, which is a pivotal hub within the salience network, leading into efficient causal modulation of parietal networks involved in reading and mathematical operations. The core role of the anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex is illuminated by their relation to performance in error processing and novelty. The larger similarity that we observed between the networks underlying calculus and programming skills does not exclude a more limited but clear overlap with the reading network, albeit with differences in hemispheric lateralization when compared with prose reading. Future work should further elucidate whether other features of computer program understanding also use distinct weights of phylogenetically ""older systems"" for this recent human activity, based on the adjusting influence of fronto-insular networks. By unraveling the neural correlates of program understanding and bug detection, this work provides a framework to understand error monitoring in this novel complex faculty.","Castelhano, Joao; Duarte, Isabel C; Duraes, Joao; Madeira, Henrique; Castelo-Branco, Miguel",Neural plasticity,591,24

Here, we assessed whether parents with toddlers (n = 206) more often used harsh discipline during the lockdown in the Netherlands compared to a matched parent sample collected prior to the pandemic (n = 1,030). Parents were matched on background characteristics using propensity score matching. We found that harsh parenting levels were significantly elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Harsh parenting behaviors with a low prevalence before COVID-19 increased most strongly: shaking, calling names, and calling the child stupid. These results suggest that parental tolerance for children's disobedience is lower under the adverse circumstances of COVID-19 and, as a result, abusive parenting responses are more difficult to inhibit. Thus, a lockdown seems to increase risks for child maltreatment, underscoring the need for effective support strategies for at-risk families.","Sari, Novika Purnama; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H; Jansen, Pauline; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian; Riem, Madelon M E",Child maltreatment,591,1

Conventional N95 and P100 FFRs and two antimicrobial (AM)-treated FFRs (an N95 and a P95, both with iodine-based AM treatments) were tested for both physical penetration (PEN(P)) and viable penetration (PEN(V)) with three different bioaerosols, including MS2 bacteriophage virus, and the spores and vegetative cells of Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria, in addition to inert sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol. For each FFR model, the PEN(P) measured with NaCl was predictive of its MS2 PEN(P), and it was observed that spores and bacteria aerosols were also filtered similarly to the inert aerosol. For both conventional FFRs, up to a 1-log reduction in PEN(V) in comparison with PEN(P) was observed and attributed to the experimental variability of the test system. For both models of AM-FFRs, no statistically significant differences between PEN(V) and PEN(P) for any of the three different bioaerosol challenges were observed. Thus, no bioaerosol filtration enhancement over the conventional FFRs was detected for either iodine-based AM-FFR. In the absence of any standardized test methods, we recommend that future studies evaluating the filtration performance of AM-treated FFRs incorporate the experimental best practices described herein.","Lore, Michael B; Sebastian, John M; Brown, TeAnne L; Viner, Andrew S; McCullough, Nicole V; Hinrichs, Steven H",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,591,16

The aim of the current study was to investigate psychosocial and behavioural factors that may explain the rise and fall of distress during the initial months of the COVID-19 crisis. DESIGN This study examined six waves of longitudinal nationally representative data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March and June 2020 (N = 7,138, observations = 34,125). METHODS Mediation analysis was used to identify whether changes in distress (PHQ-4) during the COVID-19 pandemic were explained by the following factors: perceived infection risk and risk of death, perceived financial risks, lifestyle changes resulting from the virus, perceived discrimination related to the virus, and changes in substance use and employment status. RESULTS All mediating factors played a role in explaining changes in distress and together accounted for 70% of the increase in distress between 10-18 March and 1-14 April and 46.4% of the decline in distress between 1-14 April and early June 2020. Changes in perceived health risks were most important in explaining changes in distress followed by changes in lifestyle and the perceived financial risks associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This study provides longitudinal population-based evidence detailing the mediating factors explaining changes in distress during the COVID-19 crisis. Perceived health risks associated with the virus may play a key role in explaining rising and falling levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Robinson, Eric; Daly, Michael",British journal of health psychology,591,17

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the area and position of Uphold Lite™ mesh 6 weeks and 12 months after anterior and/or apical prolapse repair. METHODS This observational prospective multicenter study included patients who had undergone transvaginal surgery for symptomatic POP-Q stage ≥ II anterior and/or apical compartment prolapse with placement of Uphold Lite mesh. The dimensions and position of the mesh were evaluated at 6 weeks and 12 months by ultrasonography. Correlations between ultrasonographic mesh characteristics and POP recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty evaluable women with an average age of 66.8 years were included. No statistically significant difference in mesh area was found between week 6 and month 12 postoperatively, either at rest (1746.92 vs. 1574.48 mm2; p = 0.15) or on Valsalva (1568.81 vs. 1542.98 mm2; p = 0.65). The ROC-AUC of the distance between the mesh and the bladder neck (M-BN) at 6 weeks for predicting cystocele recurrence at 12 months was 0.764 (95% CI 0.573-0.955) at rest and 0.724 (95% CI 0.533-0.916) on Valsalva. An M-BN distance > 12.5 mm could predict cystocele recurrence at month 12 with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 69%. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasonographic measurements of the Uphold Lite™ mesh appear to remain stable between 6 weeks and 12 months postoperatively. M-BN distance correlates with cystocele recurrence. These results appear to confirm the value of ultrasound in mesh evaluation.","Allègre, Lucie; Callewaert, Geertje; Coudray, Charles; Demattei, Christophe; Panel, Laure; Carlier-Guerin, Caroline; Letouzey, Vincent; de Tayrac, Renaud; Fatton, Brigitte",International urogynecology journal,591,31

The CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein contains two structurally independent RNA binding domains, designated the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the dimeric C-terminal domain (CTD), joined by a charged linker region rich in serine and arginine residues (SR-rich linker). An important goal in unraveling N function is to molecularly characterize N-protein interactions. Recent genetic evidence suggests that N interacts with nsp3a, a component of the viral replicase. Here we present the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp3a and show, using isothermal titration calorimetry, that MHV N219, an N construct that extends into the SR-rich linker (residues 60 to 219), binds cognate nsp3a with high affinity (equilibrium association constant [K(a)], [1.4 ± 0.3] × 10(6) M(-1)). In contrast, neither N197, an N construct containing only the folded NTD (residues 60 to 197), nor the CTD dimer (residues 260 to 380) binds nsp3a with detectable affinity. This indicates that the key nsp3a binding determinants localize to the SR-rich linker, a finding consistent with those of reverse genetics studies. NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis reveals that the N-terminal region of an MHV N SR-rich linker peptide (residues 198 to 230) binds to the acidic face of MHV nsp3a containing the acidic α2 helix with an affinity (expressed as K(a)) of 8.1 × 10(3) M(-1). These studies reveal that the SR-rich linker of MHV N is necessary but not sufficient to maintain this high-affinity binding to N.","Keane, Sarah C; Giedroc, David P",Journal of virology,591,31

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model was not able to stratify countries based on COVID-19 mortality data.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Castillo-Cara, Manuel",Wellcome open research,591,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 129 patients with an average age of 49.8±8.9 years who had undergone COVID-19 using a continuous sample method. Patients for the study were selected at the clinical bases of outpatient clinics in Samara (Russia) in July-August 2020. All patients signed an informed consent form prior to enrollment. Patients were randomized into two groups: in the main group (n=64), ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate (Neurox) was prescribed 1 tablet (125 mg) 3 times a day for 4 weeks; in the comparison group (n=65), medical drugs (MD) did not contain substances from the pharmacological group related to antihypoxants/antioxidants/nootropics. Three visits (V) were conducted: the first (V1) - the period of inclusion, the second (V2) - after 14 days, the third (V3) - on the 28th day from the start of therapy. The dynamics of the general state (weakness, fatigue, concentration, dizziness, headache, sleep disorders) were evaluated on a visual-analog scale (VAS), the assessment of the subjective feeling of severity of asthenia (fatigue, physical and mental fatigue, decreased motivation and activity) - on Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), cognitive functions - on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), vegetative tone - according to the Kerdo index. RESULTS At the end of the study (V3), statistically significant changes in indicators (VAS, MFI-20) were obtained only in the main group patients; no statistically significant differences were obtained for the Kerdo index. Analysis of the MMSE data revealed a decrease in cognitive functions in both groups, which may be associated with pseudocognitive deficits due to asthenia. CONCLUSIONS We have obtained evidence of a high incidence of asthenic syndrome after COVID-19. Against the background of taking Neurox, there was a decrease in the severity and expression of asthenia symptoms.","Zolotovskaia, I A; Shatskaia, P R; Davydkin, I L; Shavlovskaya, O A",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

They serve as mediators of intercellular communication and have been implicated in the regulation of several physiological and pathological processes. Vitiligo is a depigmentation skin disease caused by progressive destruction of autologous epidermal melanocytes. Autoimmune intolerance is one of the leading theories proposed for melanocyte destruction in vitiligo via CD8+, regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cell imbalance in adaptive immunity. In this review, we investigate the association of exosomes with vitiligo and emphasize the role of exosomes in immune regulation, melanocyte-keratinocyte interactions, and melanogenesis. The exosomal pathway is necessary for the regulation of CD8+, Treg and Th17 cells in both pathological and physiological conditions. Exosomes derived under pathological conditions can influence CD8+, Treg and Th17 cell balance in the disease microenvironment, which may contribute to disruption of autoimmune tolerance in vitiligo. In addition, exosomes serve as mediators of communication between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the melanogenesis pathway and may also be involved in melanosome transport. They also regulate melanocyte survival and the protein expression of enzymes such as tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TYRP2) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in melanogenesis, which suggests that melanin production is associated with exosomes. An improved understanding of the role of exosomes in immune regulation and melanogenesis may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of vitiligo and lead to the development of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic options.","Wong, Pui Mun; Yang, Lili; Yang, Lingli; Wu, Huali; Li, Wen; Ma, Xin; Katayama, Ichiro; Zhang, Huimin",Autoimmunity reviews,591,6

As a public health response to control the pandemic, wearing homemade face coverings has been proven as a resort to protect both the wearer and others from droplets and aerosols transmission. Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through these non-medical materials with a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, many factors, such as the fabric properties and the method of usage, also affect filtration performance. In this study, the size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for face coverings were evaluated comprehensively. The flow resistance across these filter materials, an indicator of breathability, was also examined. The effect of materials properties, washing and drying cycles, and triboelectric effect on particle filtration was also studied. Results showed that the filtration efficiency varied considerably from 5-50% among fabrics materials due to the material properties, such as density and microscopic structure of the materials. Microfiber cloth demonstrated the highest efficiency among the tested materials. In general, fabric materials with higher grams per square meter (GSM) show higher particle filtration efficiency. The results on washing and drying fabric materials indicated decent reusability for fabric materials. The triboelectric charge could increase the filtration performance of the tested fabric materials, but this effect diminishes soon due to the dissipation of charges, meaning that triboelectric charging may not be effective in manufacturing homemade face coverings.","Hao, Weixing; Xu, Guang; Wang, Yang",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,591,1

METHODS An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in Australia, and the Netherlands. Infants were stratified by gestational age (24-25/26-29 weeks) and center. Immediately before birth infants were randomly assigned to receive PPV and/or continuous positive airway pressure with either a nasal tube or a size 00 soft, round silicone mask. Resuscitation protocols were standardized; respiratory support was provided using a T-piece device commencing in room air. Criteria for intubation included need for cardiac compressions, apnea, continuous positive airway pressure >7 cm H2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen >0.4.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Decision-analysis for elective colonic resection after acute diverticulitis is predicated on future risk estimates of disease recurrence and complication rates. Quality of life alone is rarely countenanced as sufficient to warrant the supposed risk of intervention. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for prior diverticulitis over 18 months were studied at baseline (preoperative) and again subsequently (3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively) regarding quality of life and bowel symptomatology [gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI)]. All patients also had enquiry made into urinary and sexual function at the same time points (men underwent international prostate symptom severity and international index of erectile function, respectively, whereas for women the urinary dysfunction index and a modified questionnaire for the evaluation of sexual function were used). RESULTS Forty-six patients (mean age 58.3, 26 men) were studied, 45 of whom had their surgery completed laparoscopically. Quality of life significantly improved in the group overall, with 36 patients having an increase in their GIQLI >10 points (23 patients >20 points). This improvement was evident by 3 months and maintained thereafter. The improvement was due to increments in gastrointestinal symptomatology subdomain and was most significant in those with lowest preoperative scoring. Five patients' GIQLI score deteriorated without obvious predictive event. Not one of the patients presented evident alteration in urinary and sexual functioning postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Significant improvement in quality of life and social functioning accrues from elective sigmoid resection in the majority of patients. Avoidance of subsequent episodic attacks therefore should not represent the sole reason for operating but instead patient-centered issues should be prioritized.","Forgione, Antonello; Leroy, Joel; Cahill, Ronan A; Bailey, Charles; Simone, Michele; Mutter, Didier; Marescaux, Jacques",Annals of surgery,591,27

Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate auditory function using BAER and bone conduction (BC). Twenty-four alpacas: 15 females, 9 intact males (2-16 years of age) were included in a randomized clinical trial. BAER and BC were recorded using two derivations (vertex to mastoid and vertex to cranial aspect of second cervical vertebra). All alpacas underwent complete physical examinations and were sedated with xylazine hydrochloride at 0.6 mg/kg IM. Peaks, when present, were identified and latencies, amplitudes, and amplitude ratios were determined. Eleven alpacas had normal responses and 13 had auditory loss based on BAER. The latter consisted of complete absence of peaks bilaterally (n = 3), absence of peaks unilaterally (n = 1), delayed latencies bilaterally (n = 4), and delayed latencies unilaterally (n = 5). Distinct peaks on BC supported conductive auditory loss in 6 alpacas, difficult to interpret due to stimulus artifact and additional undefined peaks in 4, and absent peaks in 3 alpacas. The cause of auditory loss was presumed to be due to otitis in 6, aging in 4 (10-16 years old), and congenital sensorineural (absent peaks on BAER and BC) in 3 alpacas with unpigmented fiber and irises.

Although the human-to-human transmission route for this disease has been well established, its transmission mechanism is not fully understood. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for COVID-19 which incorporates multiple transmission pathways and which employs time-dependent transmission rates reflecting the impact of disease prevalence and outbreak control. Applying this model to a retrospective study based on publicly reported data in China, we argue that the environmental reservoirs play an important role in the transmission and spread of the coronavirus.

Thirty five patients with uterine leiomyoma confirmed by operation and pathology at Shaoxing People's Hospital from October 2015 to September 2017 were analyzed retrospectively，including 15 cases of ordinary type，8 cases of cellular type and 12 cases of degenerative type. All patients were examined by pelvic DCE-MRI before operation，and the histogram parameters （median，mean，skewness，kurtosis，energy，entropy） of various quantitative perfusion parameters，including volume transport constant （K），rate constant （K），extravascular extracellular space distribute volume per unit tissue volume （V），blood plasma volume per unit volume of tissue （V） were calculated，and the efficacy of different parameters in pathological classification of uterine leiomyoma was evaluated by ROC curve. The expression of Ki-67 protein in uterine leiomyoma was detected by immunohistochemical method，and the correlation between histogram parameters and Ki-67 protein expression was analyzed by Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis. The median and mean values of K，K，V and V in the cellular group were higher than those in the degenerative group and the ordinary group（<0.05 or <0.01），while the skewness of V，the skewness and kurtosis of K in the cellular group were lower than those in the ordinary group （all <0.05）. The entropy of K in the cellular group was higher than that in the degenerative group and the ordinary group （all < 0.05）. The entropy of V in the cellular group was higher than that in the ordinary group （<0.01）. The median，mean，skewness of K，median and mean of K，median and mean of V，median，mean，energy and entropy of V were correlated with Ki-67 expression（all <0.05）. The results of ROC curve analysis showed that the median threshold of K was 0.994/min，the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of cellular uterine leiomyoma were 100.0% and 77.8% respectively，and the area under the ROC curve was 0.949. When the mean threshold of K was 1.170/min，the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cellular uterine leiomyoma were 100.0% and 77.8% respectively，and the area under the ROC curve was 0.958. The area under the ROC curve of K （entropy），K （median，mean），V （median，mean，entropy） in the diagnosis of cellular uterine leiomyoma were 0.755-0.907. :DCE-MRI quantitative perfusion histogram parameters have high diagnostic value in differentiating pathological types of uterine leiomyoma，especially for cellular uterine leiomyoma.,"Huang, Yanan; Zhao, Zhenhua; Wang, Subo; Yang, Liming; Wang, Cheng; Zhang, Yu; Ruan, Yawen",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

The quality scores of literature are different, and the incidence of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests results vary greatly. Therefore, a systematic retrospective meta-analysis is needed to determine the incidence of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from databases, such as PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Johns Hopkins University, and Chinese databases were analysed from January 31, 2020 to October 20, 2020. High-quality articles were selected for analysis based on a quality standard score. A meta-analysis of random effects was used to determine the prevalence of comorbidities and subgroup meta-analysis to examine the changes in the estimated prevalence in different subgroups. RESULTS Seventy-one articles involving 11,671 children were included in the study. The incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, asymptomatic patients, nervous system symptoms, and chest tightness was 55.8%, 56.8%, 14.4%, 21.1%, 6.7%, and 6.1%, respectively. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome was 6.2%. Laboratory examination results showed that lymphocytes decreased in 12% and leukocytes decreased in 8.8% of patients, whereas white blood cells increased in 7.8% of patients. Imaging showed abnormalities in 66.5%, and ground-glass opacities were observed in 36.9% patients. Epidemiological history was present in 85.2% cases; severe disease rate was 3.33%. The mortality rate was 0.28%. CONCLUSIONS The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in children are mild, and laboratory indicators and imaging manifestations are atypical. While screening children for COVID-19, in addition to assessing patients for symptoms as the first step of screening, the epidemiological history of patients should be obtained.","Wang, J-G; Zhong, Z-J; Mo, Y-F; Wang, L-C; Chen, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,591,26

This paper presents a rapid realist review protocol that will systematically review the literature that examines QC-M in practice; what worked, or did not work for whom, in what contexts, to what extent, how and why? Methods : The review will explore if there are benefits of using the QC-Ms and what are the contexts in which these mechanisms are triggered. The essence of this rapid realist review is to ascertain how a change in context generates a particular mechanism that produces specific outcomes. A number of steps will occur including locating existing theories on implementation of quality care metrics, searching the evidence, selecting relevant documents, data extraction, validation of findings, synthesising and refining programme theory. This strategy may help to describe potential consequences resulting from changes in context and their interactions with mechanisms. Initial theories will be refined throughout the process by the local reference panel, comprised of eight key intervention stakeholders, knowledge users such as healthcare professionals and an expert panel. Ethical approval is not required for this rapid realist review. Conclusion: It is anticipated that the final programme theory will help to explain how QC-Ms work in practice; for whom, why and in what circumstances. Findings of this review could help to give insights into realism as a framework and how nursing and midwifery QC-Ms have been implemented previously.","O'Connor, Laserina; Coffey, Alice; Lambert, Veronica; Casey, Mary; McNamara, Martin; Teeling, Sean Paul; O'Doherty, Jane; Barnard, Marlize; Corcoran, Yvonne; Davies, Carmel; Doody, Owen; Frawley, Timothy; O'Brien, Denise; Redmond, Catherine; Smith, Rita; Somanadhan, Suja; Noonan, Maria; Bradshaw, Carmel; Tuohy, Dympna; Gallen, Anne",HRB open research,591,19

This study addressed the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19. METHODS Sixty-nine COVID-19 patients were classified into as severe and non-severe groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics. A panel of blood cytokines was quantified over time. Biopsy specimens from two deceased cases were obtained for immunopathological, ultrastructural, and in situ hybridization examinations. RESULTS Circulating cytokines, including IL8, IL6, TNFα, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients. Dynamic IL6 and IL8 were associated with disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II, type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis. In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions. Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both SARS-CoV-2 caused cytopathy and immunopathologic damage. Strategies that encourage pulmonary recruitment and overactivation of inflammatory cells by suppressing cytokine storm might improve the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients.","Li, Shaohua; Jiang, Lina; Li, Xi; Lin, Fang; Wang, Yijin; Li, Boan; Jiang, Tianjun; An, Weimin; Liu, Shuhong; Liu, Hongyang; Xu, Pengfei; Zhao, Lihua; Zhang, Lixin; Mu, Jinsong; Wang, Hongwei; Kang, Jiarui; Li, Yan; Huang, Lei; Zhu, Caizhong; Zhao, Shousong; Lu, Jiangyang; Ji, Junsheng; Zhao, Jingmin",JCI insight,591,1

Global air travel offers an easy and fast opportunity not only for people but also for infectious diseases to spread around the world within a few days. Also, large public events facilitate increasing infection numbers. Therefore, rapid on-site screening for infected people is urgently needed. Due to the small size and easy handling, ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is a very promising, sensitive method for the on-site identification of infectious pathogens based on scents, representing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether identification of Influenza-A-infection based on VOCs by MCC-IMS is possible in breath. Nasal breath was investigated in 24 consecutive persons with and without Influenza-A-infection by MCC-IMS. In 14 Influenza-A-infected patients, infection was proven by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Four healthy staff members and six patients with negative PCR result served as controls. For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from those not infected with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This present proof-of-concept-study yields encouraging results showing a rapid diagnosis of viral infections in nasal breath within 5 min by MCC-IMS. The next step is to validate the results with a greater number of patients with Influenza-A-infection as well as other viral diseases, especially COVID-19.

Results indicated that pure reline almost froze the lipase backbone, while hydrated reline that showed a less ordered nanostructure than the pure form introduced some fluctuations to lipase structures, particularly to the lid domain. Although none of the solvents led to unfolding, solvation by 8 M urea or water when accompanied with elevated temperature caused the most significant loss of secondary structure. Experimental results indicated that lipase incubation in slightly hydrated reline (5% (v/v)) led to the highest level of residual activity, implying interfacial activation. Overall we report that slightly hydrated reline activates thermoalkalophilic lipases consistent with the particular MD observation showing enhanced mobility of the lid domain. These insights provided by this study contributes to designing efficient lipase applications in DES-based reaction media, giving cues for customizing water-in-DES for optimal enzyme stability and activity.","Shehata, Mohamed; Unlu, Aise; Sezerman, Ugur; Timucin, Emel",The journal of physical chemistry.

The main challenge is to identify the patient's motor intention based on large training datasets with noise contamination in the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. NEW METHOD To address this problem, this paper proposed a self-adaptively denoised Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD)-based motor intention recognition algorithm (DeERD) in order to enable BMI training with a small sample of calibration data. This study recruited 8 stroke patients. Each patient was required to execute paralyzed upper-limb motor attempt for 20 trials and remain in resting state for 20 trials randomly. ERD-based motor intention recognition algorithm, Common spatial filter algorithm (CSP) and Directed Transfer Function analysis (DTF) were used to extract features for classification respectively and compared with the proposed DeERD analysis. RESULTS DeERD can filter the noise and extract the average lines as the principal trends. With denoising processing, Accuracy (ACC) was up to 70% for all 8 patients and they could be included in this BMI system effectively. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS The proposed DeERD model generated statistically significant increase in True Positive Rate (TPR) and in ACC than the DTF model. TPR and ACC standard deviation of DeERD was smaller than that of CSP. CONCLUSIONS The proposed DeERD model can eliminate the principal noise and extract the principal trend of the time-frequency analysis. It provides a practical method to recruit more stroke patients into BMI training with fewer calibration trainings.","Jia, Tianyu; Liu, Ke; Qian, Chao; Li, Chong; Ji, Linhong",Journal of neuroscience methods,591,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2012 and March 2014, 86 patients (mean age, 60.3 years) harboring 89 aneurysms were treated with Enterprise (n = 57) or Solitaire (n = 32) SAC. The patients' demographics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS There were no cases of stent navigation, deployment failure, arterial dissection, or intraoperative aneurysmal rupture. Angiographic follow-up imaging was available for 86 (96.6%) aneurysms (Enterprise group, n = 55; Solitaire group, n = 31). Immediate postoperative and follow-up angiographic results showed no flow or only minimal flow into the neck in 83% (Enterprise group, 77.2%; Solitaire group, 93.8%) and 95.3% (Enterprise group, 92.7%; Solitaire group, 100%) of SAC-treated aneurysms, respectively. Both stent groups showed good immediate postoperative and follow-up clinical outcomes. Excepting 2 cases, all patients achieved modified Rankin Scale scores of 0. Coil loop or tail protrusion into the parent artery was observed in 17 (29.8%) and 7 (21.9%) cases in the Enterprise and Solitaire groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference in terms of angiographic results or clinical outcomes was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION Excellent and comparable clinical and angiographic outcomes for wide-neck intracranial aneurysms were achieved using both stents. Because of its higher radial strength and better vessel wall apposition, we cautiously propose that the Solitaire stent may be more effective for SAC of aneurysms harboring a large or severe tortuous parent artery.","Kim, Sung-Won; Sung, Seng-Oun; Chae, Kil-Sung; Park, Hwa-Seung; Lee, Sang-Hoon",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,591,23

The role of a patient navigator (PN) is to coordinate care between the care team, the patient, and their family while also providing social support. In the last 30 years, patient navigation in oncological care has expanded internationally and has been shown to significantly improve patient care experience, especially in the United States cancer care system. Like oncology care, patients who require epilepsy care face socioeconomic and healthcare system barriers and are at significant risk of morbidity and mortality if their care needs are not met. Although shortcomings in epilepsy care are longstanding, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues as both patients and providers have reported significant delays in care secondary to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, preliminary studies had shown the potential efficacy of patient navigation in improving epilepsy care. Considering the evidence that such programs are helpful for severely disadvantaged cancer patients and in enhancing epilepsy care, we believe that professional societies should support and encourage PN programs for coordinated and comprehensive care for patients with epilepsy.","Anand, Sharath Kumar; Macki, Mohamed; Culver, Lauren G; Wasade, Vibhangini S; Hendren, Samantha; Schwalb, Jason M",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,591,16

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) identified 127 cases within five hospital Trusts 2013-2018 using ICD-10 codes D76.1, D76.2 and D76.3. Hospital records were reviewed to validate diagnoses. Out of 74 patients, 73 were coded D76.1 or D76.2 (positive predictive value 89·0% [95% Confidence Interval {CI} 80·2-94·9%]) with confirmed/probable HLH. For cases considered not HLH, 44/53 were coded D76.3 (negative predictive value 97·8% [95% CI 88·2-99·9%]). D76.1 or D76.2 had 68% sensitivity in detecting HLH compared to an established active case-finding HLH register in Sheffield. Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data (2003-2018) identified 698 patients coded D76.1, D76.2 and D76.3 on death certificates.

The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of overall 28-day mortality at the peak of the Italian outbreak. METHODS Retrospective observational study of all Covid-19 patients admitted to the main hospital of Bergamo, from February 23 to March, 14, 2020. RESULTS 508 patients were hospitalized , predominantly male (72.4%), mean age of 66±15 years; 49.2% were older than 70 years. Most of patients presented with severe respiratory failure (median value [IQR] of PaO2/FiO2 233 [149-281]). Mortality rate at 28 days resulted of 33.7% (N=171). 39.0% of patients were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), 9.5% with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and 13.6% with endotracheal intubation. 9.5% were admitted to semi-intensive respiratory care unit, and 18.9% to ICU. Risk factors independently associated with 28-day mortality were advanced age (≥78 years: odds ratio, OR, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.91 [10.67-141.93], p<0.001; 70-77 years: 17.30 [5.40-55.38], p<0.001; 60-69 years: 3.20 [1.00-10.20], p=0.049), PaO2/FiO2 <200 at presentation (3.50 [1.70-7.20], p=0.001), need for CPAP/NIV in the first 24 hours (8.38 [3.63-19.35], p <0.001), and blood urea value at admission (1.01 [1.00-1.02], p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS At the peak of the outbreak, with a probable high infectious dose and viral load, older age, the severity of respiratory failure and renal impairment at presentation, but not comorbidities, are predictors of 28-day mortality in Covid-19.","Novelli, Luca; Raimondi, Federico; Ghirardi, Arianna; Pellegrini, Dario; Capodanno, Davide; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Guagliumi, Giulio; Senni, Michele; Russo, Filippo M; Lorini, Ferdinando L; Rizzi, Marco; Barbui, Tiziano; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Cosentini, Roberto; Grazioli, Lorenzo S; Marchesi, Gianmariano; Sferrazza Papa, Giuseppe F; Cesa, Simonetta; Colledan, Michele; Civiletti, Roberta; Conti, Caterina; Casati, Monica; Ferri, Francesco; Camagni, Stefania; Sessa, Maria; Masciulli, Arianna; Gavazzi, Antonello; Falanga, Anna; Da Pozzo, Luigi F; Buoro, Sabrina; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Ruggenenti, Piero; Callegaro, Annapaola; D'''''Antiga, Lorenzo; Pasulo, Luisa; Pezzoli, Fabio; Gianatti, Andrea; Parigi, Piercarlo; Farina, Claudio; Bellasi, Antonio; Solidoro, Paolo; Sironi, Sandro; Di Marco, Fabiano; Fagiuoli, Stefano",Panminerva medica,591,24

Its main objective is to improve the body contour by means of excising redundant skin and fat tissue. Although abdominoplasty is considered a safe procedure with high satisfaction rates, intraoperative and postoperative complications can become a challenge for the surgical team. The aim of this article is to offer a synopsis of the most common complications arising after abdominoplasty, along with evidence-based guidelines about how to prevent and treat them. METHODS A systematic MEDLINE search strategy was designed using appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and references were scanned for further relevant articles. RESULTS According to the published case series, local complications are considerably more common than complications with systemic repercussions. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients suffer a local complication following abdominoplasty, while fewer than 1% suffer a systemic complication. Prevention and management strategies are critically discussed for complications including seroma, haematoma, infection, skin necrosis, suture extrusions, hypertrophic scars, neurological symptoms, umbilical anomalies, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism, respiratory distress, and death. CONCLUSIONS The complications of abdominoplasty vary in severity and in the impact they have on the aesthetic outcomes. Recommendations for prevention and management are based on various levels of evidence, with a risk of observer bias. However, most complications can be treated appropriately following the current standards, with satisfactory results.","Vidal, Pedro; Berner, Juan Enrique; Will, Patrick A",Archives of plastic surgery,591,1

Because HuNoVs are unculturable, surrogates are needed to investigate transmission routes and evaluate disinfection methods. However, the current surrogates, feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine NoV (MNV), are less tolerant than HuNoVs to acid and chlorine, respectively. Porcine sapovirus (SaV) is the only culturable enteropathogenic calicivirus. In this study, the resistance of SaV to physicochemical treatments was compared to that of HuNoVs (by reverse transcription-PCR), FCV, and MNV (by infectivity assays). Sapovirus and HuNoV (viral RNA) showed similar resistances to heat (56°C) and to different concentrations of chlorine. However, SaV was more resistant than HuNoVs to ethanol treatment (60% and 70%). Like HuNoVs, SaV was stable at pH 3.0 to 8.0, with a <1.0 log(10) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)) reduction at pH 3.0 compared to the value for pH 4.0 to 8.0. SaV and MNV showed similar resistances, and both were more resistant than FCV to heat inactivation (56°C). FCV was more resistant than MNV and SaV to ethanol, and all three viruses showed similar resistances to treatment with low concentrations of chlorine for 1 min. Those results indicate that SaV is a promising surrogate for HuNoVs. Next, we used SaV as a surrogate to examine virus attachment to lettuce at different pHs. Sapovirus attached to lettuce leaves significantly at its capsid isoelectric point (pH 5.0), and the attached viral particles remained infectious on lettuce after 1 week of storage at 4°C. The culturable SaV is a good surrogate for studying HuNoV contamination and transmission in leafy greens and potential disinfectants.","Wang, Qiuhong; Zhang, Zhenwen; Saif, Linda J",Applied and environmental microbiology,591,26

There are two XBP-1 isoforms in cells, spliced XBP-1S and unspliced XBP-1U. XBP-1U has been shown to bind to the 21-bp Tax-responsive element of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) in vitro and transactivate HTLV-1 transcription. Here we identify XBP-1S as a transcription activator of HTLV-1. Compared to XBP-1U, XBP-1S demonstrates stronger activating effects on both basal and Tax-activated HTLV-1 transcription in cells. Our results show that both XBP-1S and XBP-1U interact with Tax and bind to the HTLV-1 LTR in vivo. In addition, elevated mRNA levels of the gene for XBP-1 and several UPR genes were detected in the HTLV-1-infected C10/MJ and MT2 T-cell lines, suggesting that HTLV-1 infection may trigger the UPR in host cells. We also identify Tax as a positive regulator of the expression of the gene for XBP-1. Activation of the UPR by tunicamycin showed no effect on the HTLV-1 LTR, suggesting that HTLV-1 transcription is specifically regulated by XBP-1.

Thus, rapid detection of A/H1N1/2009 is crucial for efficient treatment and infection control measures. In contrast to seasonal influenza, where point-of-care (POC) rapid antigen tests and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining ensure rapid detection, diagnosis of A/H1N1/2009 has so far been based on RT-PCR. This study retrospectively compared the performance of the Quidel QuickVue POC test, DFA staining and virus isolation with that of RT-PCR for A/H1N1/2009 detection in 526 respiratory specimens collected during the first wave of the outbreak from May to September 2009. A/H1N1/2009 was detected in 9.1% (48/526) of samples. One hundred and thirty-seven of the A/H1N1/2009 PCR-negative samples were additionally tested using a RealAccurate Respiratory RT-PCR panel, revealing other respiratory viruses (mainly entero/rhino- and adenoviruses) in 42.3% (58/137). All methods analysed detected A/H1N1/2009 with excellent specificity but different sensitivities (POC test: 18.2%; DFA staining: 38.7%; virus isolation: 45.7%). Therefore, the POC test was not suitable for diagnosis, detecting A/H1N1/2009 only if present in high concentrations (corresponding median Ct value=19.0; range=16.5-21.4). DFA staining was also able to detect A/H1N1/2009 in specimens with a lower virus concentration (median Ct value=24.0; range=16.5-29.8). Virus isolation, which was positive after a median time of 7.5 days, was too time-consuming. In summary, DFA staining is superior to POC testing and may be appropriate for patients expected to have a rather high level of virus replication. Nevertheless, in DFA-negative specimens, A/H1N1/2009 should be excluded by RT-PCR.","Ganzenmueller, Tina; Kluba, Jeanette; Hilfrich, Birgit; Puppe, Wolfram; Verhagen, Willem; Heim, Albert; Schulz, Thomas; Henke-Gendo, Cornelia",Journal of medical microbiology,591,1

In this study, we investigated the demographic, clinical, electrophysiological, and genetic characteristics of hereditary polyneuropathy patients diagnosed and followed up in our tertiary center clinic in Izmir, Turkey. METHODS Patients who were diagnosed with hereditary polyneuropathies during nerve conduction studies in our center were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS In a total of 1484 nerve conduction studies, 207 patients were diagnosed with polyneuropathy. Ninety-nine of those patients were determined to have hereditary polyneuropathy, 52 of which were male and 47 were female. Sixty-nine patients with hereditary polyneuropathy were compatible with axonal and 30 were compatible with demyelinating polyneuropathy. Genetic analysis was performed in 69 patients, and 49 of those patients were genetically diagnosed, leading to a diagnosis rate of 71%. CONCLUSIONS Advances in genetics have led to an increase in the heterogeneity of hereditary polyneuropathies, causing difficulties in the use of existing classifications. Although typical mutations expected in childhood-onset polyneuropathies are seen less frequently, polyneuropathies are frequently encountered as findings of complex, multisystemic diseases.","Paketci, C; Karakaya, M; Edem, P; Bayram, E; Keller, N; Daimagüler, H-S; Cirak, S; Jordanova, A; Hiz, S; Wirth, B; Yiş, U",Revue neurologique,591,19

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS Women (N=56) 19 to 35 years of age, including 36 with patellofemoral pain and 20 controls. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants sustained an isometric knee extension contraction at 10% of their maximal voluntary effort for 70 seconds. Motor units (N=414) were identified using high-density surface electromyography. Average firing rate was calculated between 5 and 35 seconds after recruitment for each motor unit. Initial firing rate was the inverse of the first 3 motor unit interspike intervals. RESULTS In control participants, vastus medialis motor units discharged at higher rates than vastus lateralis motor units (P=.001). This was not observed in women with patellofemoral pain (P=.78) because of a higher discharge rate of vastus lateralis compared with control participants (P=.002). No between-group differences were observed for vastus medialis (P=.93). Similar results were obtained for the initial motor unit firing rate. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that women with patellofemoral pain have a higher neural drive to vastus lateralis but not vastus medialis, which may be a contributor of the altered patellar kinematics observed in some studies. The different neural drive may be an adaptation to patellofemoral pain, possibly to compensate for decreased quadriceps force production, or a precursor of patellofemoral pain.","Gallina, Alessio; Hunt, Michael A; Hodges, Paul W; Garland, S Jayne",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,591,26

However, the problem of computational prediction for large pseudoknotted folds remains. Here we develop a domain-based method for predicting complex and large pseudoknotted structures from RNA sequences. The model is based on the observation that large RNAs can be separated into different structural domains. The basic idea is to first identify the domains and then predict the structures for each domain. Assembly of the domain structures gives the full structure. The use of the domain-based approach leads to a reduction of computational time by a factor of about ~N ( 2) for an N-nt sequence. As applications of the model, we predict structures for a variety of RNA systems, such as regions in human telomerase RNA (hTR), internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and HIV genome. The lengths of these sequences range from 200-nt to 400-nt. The results show good agreements with the experiments.","Cao, Song; Chen, Shi-Jie",RNA biology,591,16

In addition to providing a physical barrier, the epithelium possesses a multitude of active mechanisms to fight invading pathogens and regulate the composition and spatial distribution of commensals. The different epithelial cell types have unique functions in this context, and crosstalk with the immune system further modulates their intricate antimicrobial responses. The epithelium is organized into clonal crypt units with a high cellular turnover that is driven by stem cells located at the base. There is increasing evidence that this anatomical organization, the stem cell turnover, and the lineage determination processes are essential for barrier maintenance. These processes can be modulated by microbes directly or by the immune responses to enteric pathogens, resulting in a rapid and efficient adaptation of the epithelium to environmental perturbations, injuries, and infections. Here we discuss the complex host-microbial interactions that shape the mucosa and how the epithelium maintains and re-establishes homeostasis after infection.","Iftekhar, Amina; Sigal, Michael",International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,591,1

Despite this, data in literature is still scarce. The present study aimed to reveal our recent experience and provide a comprehensive overview of the feasibility and complications related to various surgical approaches. Methods Data of patients who underwent PS, between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Literature was searched for studies reporting all types of PS in adult or adolescent patients. Results Five PS were performed in our department: two (40%) by laparoscopy and three (60%) by laparotomy. Two (40%) postoperative complications were detected, and in one of them, total splenectomy (TS) by laparotomy was finally required. There were no deaths or complications at last follow-up. Twenty studies including 213 patients were identified in the literature search. The rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery was 3% (range, 5-50%) and in 3% of cases (range, 7-10%) PS was converted into total TS and the overall morbidity rate was 8% (range, 5-25%). In comparison to laparotomy, the conversion rate of laparoscopic approach to TS was 3.5% (vs. 1.4%) and a morbidity rate of 9.8% (vs. 4.3%). Conclusions The present review shows that PS is a viable procedure in selected cases. The mini-invasive approach seemed to be feasible despite the presence of higher rate of complications than the open technique. In future, further studies on this topic are needed by involving more patients. Furthermore, it is proposed that the development of robotic surgery could make this approach the new gold-standard technique for spleen-preserving surgery.","Esposito, Francesco; Noviello, Adele; Moles, Nicola; Cantore, Nicola; Baiamonte, Mario; Coppola Bottazzi, Enrico; Miro, Antonio; Crafa, Francesco",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,591,31

ANIMALS 261 adult cats. PROCEDURES Cats were fed a diet containing 1.7% (basal diet; control cats) or 5.7% (supplemented diet; treated cats) lysine for 4 weeks. Plasma concentrations of lysine and arginine were assessed at the beginning (baseline) and end of the study. Three times a week, cats were assigned a clinical score based on evidence of nasal and ocular disease. Conjunctival and oropharyngeal swab specimens were tested for FHV-1, FCV, and C felis nucleic acids once a week. RESULTS Data were collected from 123, 74, 59, and 47 cats during study weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. By study end, plasma lysine concentration in treated cats was greater than that in control cats and had increased from baseline. There was no difference between dietary groups in the proportion of cats developing mild disease. However, more treated cats than control cats developed moderate to severe disease during week 4. During week 2, FHV-1 DNA was detected more commonly in swab specimens from treated versus control cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dietary lysine supplementation in the amount used in our study was not a successful means of controlling infectious upper respiratory disease within a cat shelter. Rather, it led to increases in disease severity and the incidence of detection of FHV-1 DNA in oropharyngeal or conjunctival mucosal swab specimens at certain time points.","Drazenovich, Tracy L; Fascetti, Andrea J; Westermeyer, Hans D; Sykes, Jane E; Bannasch, Mike J; Kass, Philip H; Hurley, Kate F; Maggs, David J",American journal of veterinary research,591,8

Importantly, the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary terrestrial mass extinction was coincident with a major climatic warming that ended the intense final glacial cycle of the latest Devonian ice age.

Here we investigated anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy as an intervention to improve performance on a spatial memory task in aged rats after stroke, and whether cognitive recovery was correlated with structural plasticity. Aged rats underwent a unilateral distal permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and one week later were treated with an anti-Nogo-A or control antibody. Nine weeks post-stroke, treated rats and normal aged rats were tested on the Morris water maze task. Following testing rats were sacrificed and brains processed for the Golgi-Cox method.

METHODS We enrolled 92 patients older than 18 years undergoing elective OPCAB-surgery. Serum-levels of S100 were determined at baseline (BL), end of surgery (EOS) and on the first postoperative day (PD1). Postoperatively, all-patients were evaluated daily until PD5 for the presence of POD using the confusion assessment method (CAM) or the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS The overall incidence of POD was 21%. S100-values on PD1 significantly predicted the occurrence of POD during the later hospital stay [area under the curve (AUC)=0.724 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.619-0.814); p=0.0001] with an optimal cut-off level of 123 pg mL-1 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 44%). Below this value, the absence of POD was predicted correctly in 43.66% of patients without POD [negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95%CI: 88.8%-100.0%) - positive predictive value of 29.8% (95%CI: 18.4%-43.4%) and likelihood ratio (LR) of the negative result of 0.0]. CONCLUSIONS S100-levels <123 pg mL-1 measured on PD1 reliably rule out the development of POD after elective OPCAB-surgery. This finding warrants testing whether S100-levels could be used for a risk stratification of cardiac surgical patients and for the initiation of preventive measures against POD in patients with high postoperative S100-levels.","Al Tmimi, Layth; Van de Velde, Marc; Meyns, Bart; Meuris, Bart; Sergeant, Paul; Milisen, Koen; Pottel, Hans; Poesen, Koen; Rex, Steffen",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,591,1

Even modest weight gain over a short period of time can increase the risk for long-term consequences such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been little data on the incidence or severity of new-onset type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population. We conducted a retrospective chart review of admissions for new onset type 2 diabetes from March to December 2019 and for the same period in 2020 at a tertiary care children's hospital. Eligible patients were identified using ICD-10 codes for type 2 diabetes (E11.*);hyperglycemia (E72.51, E11.65, R73.9, R73.09);and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (E13.*, E11.01). Each admission was carefully reviewed, and those with type 1 diabetes or hyperglycemia unrelated to diabetes were excluded. In 2019 the hospitalization rate for new onset type 2 diabetes was 0.27% (8 cases out of 2964 hospitalizations) compared to 0.62% (17 out of 2729) in 2020, p<0.048. In total 23 of 25 children were African American and 19 children were male. Three children in 2019 versus 8 children in 2020 met criteria for DKA while 2 children met criteria for HHS in 2020. The mean admission HbA1c was 12.4% in 2019 vs. 13.1% in 2020;while the mean admission glucose was 441 mg/dL in 2019 vs. 669 mg/dL in 2020. Furthermore, the admission serum osmolality was 314 mmol/kg in 2019 compared to 335 mmol/kg in 2020. Our study found that the incidence of hospitalization for new onset type 2 diabetes was higher in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period in 2019. While the labs presented were not statistically different due to the limited number of participants, further studies are warranted to better understand the clinical implications of these findings.","Hsia, Daniel S.; Lim, Maria Beyl Robbie A.; Hasan, Hira A.; Gardner, James",Diabetes,591,1

In this chapter, we focus on the mining sector as a case study on how a data-driven analysis of extreme events related to water can be applied across industries. We examine the impact of climate variability and change on a decadal time scale across geographies at the individual asset level using daily rainfall data. Our approach identifies the stakeholders most exposed to extreme rainfall events based on both incidence and likely damage. We build on an index we have previously developed for financial exposure of climatic extremes aggregated across company assets using recent data on production stoppages, care, and maintenance costs and permanent impairment for mining companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw inferences around the likely impact to broader financial and commodity markets in simulated scenarios depending on how widespread the ramifications of any such event are likely to be. We highlight the externalities that influence water-related decision-making processes and discuss how companies can incorporate environmental, climate change, legal, social, political, and reputational factors into their existing valuation models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Siegel, J.; Concha Larrauri, P.; Bonnafous, L.; Lall, U.",Palgrave Studies in Sustainable Business in Association with Future Earth,591,1

Biologic use was not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes for yet but the case of rituximab (RTX) remains an issue, given its immunological long term effect, the role of humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and its indirect effect on T-cell response. A potential association between rituximab and worse COVID-19 outcomes was raised by case reports and retrospective, declarative studies (with few data on the total number of patients exposed). Objectives: To address differently the issue of the risk of COVID-19 related to RTX and limit biases, we examined the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in all patients receiving intravenous biologic agents at day-hospitals during the pandemic in France. Methods: From 1st September 2019 to 1st January 2021, we analyzed patients with IA prospectively treated with intravenous biologic agents (RTX, abatacept, infliximab or tocilizumab) in 7 clinical centers in France. We obtained the list of patients receiving intravenous biologic agents in each center from the pharmacist of the hospitals. Therefore, all consecutive patients receiving 1 of the 4 drugs at the time of the study were included in each center. Patients with no follow-up after September 2020 were systematically contacted by phone. The occurrence of a severe COVID -19 (i.e. resulting in death, hospitalization or increase in length of hospitalization related to COVID-19) was the primary outcome criteria. Results: In total, 1116 patients receiving intravenous biologic agents were included: 449 with infliximab, 392 RTX, 170 tocilizumab and 105 abatacept. From 1st September 2019, the median follow-up time was 15 months (interquartile range 14-16). In total, 10 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred, 9 treated with RTX and 1 with infliximab (supplementary Table 1). Four deaths occurred in our cohort during follow-up but none was related to COVID-19 (1 patient treated by tocilizumab, 1 by RTX and 2 by infliximab). In univariate analysis, the proportion of severe COVID-19 was significantly higher for patients receiving RTX than other biologic agents (9/392 vs 1/724, p=0.0003, OR [95%CI] 17.0 [2.1-134.6]). To take into account potential confounders, we performed multivariate analysis accounting for baseline parameters that differed between RTX and other biologic groups. RTX remained significantly associated with risk of severe COVID-19 (p=0.019) (Table 1). Conclusion: The present results highly indicate increased risk of severe COVID-19 with RTX. Among patients with inflammatory arthritides, those receiving RTX should be prioritized for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, sufficiently long before infusion/reinfusion and the immunization checked, or an alternative targeted therapy proposed.","Felten, R.; Duret, P.

In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that fish prefer to use the entire water column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, fish show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to move away from the sides of the cage. Even when strong currents and waves decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage. This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high biomass caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that keeping the cone portion of the cage available in strong currents would be beneficial to salmon welfare.","Johannesen, Ása; Patursson, Øystein; Kristmundsson, Jóhannus; Dam, Signar Pætursonur; Mulelid, Mats; Klebert, Pascal",bioRxiv,591,1

The case fatality rates (CFR) reported in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic substantially differ between countries. For SARS-CoV-2 infection with its broad clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to severe disease courses, the infection fatality rate (IFR) is the more reliable parameter to predict the consequences of the pandemic. Here we combined virus RT-PCR testing and assessment for SARS-CoV2 antibodies to determine the total number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in a given population. Methods: A sero-epidemiological GCP- and GEP-compliant study was performed in a small German town which was exposed to a super-spreading event (carnival festivities) followed by strict social distancing measures causing a transient wave of infections. Questionnaire-based information and biomaterials were collected from a random, household-based study population within a seven-day period, six weeks after the outbreak. The number of present and past infections was determined by integrating results from anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG analyses in blood, PCR testing for viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs and reported previous positive PCR tests. Results: Of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status (out of 1,007; 405 households) 15.5% (95% CI: [12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is 5-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for this community (3.1%). Infection was associated with characteristic symptoms such as loss of smell and taste. 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. With the seven SARS-CoV-2-associated reported deaths the estimated IFR was 0.36% [0.29%; 0.45%]. Age and sex were not found to be associated with the infection rate. Participation in carnival festivities increased both the infection rate (21.3% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001) and the number of symptoms in the infected (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p=0.007). The risk of a person being infected was not found to be associated with the number of study participants in the household this person lived in. The secondary infection risk for study participants living in the same household increased from 15.5% to 43.6%, to 35.5% and to 18.3% for households with two, three or four people respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions: While the number of infections in this high prevalence community is not representative for other parts of the world, the IFR calculated on the basis of the infection rate in this community can be utilized to estimate the percentage of infected based on the number of reported fatalities in other places with similar population characteristics. Whether the specific circumstances of a super-spreading event not only have an impact on the infection rate and number of symptoms but also on the IFR requires further investigation. The unexpectedly low secondary infection risk among persons living in the same household has important implications for measures installed to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic.","Streeck, Hendrik; Schulte, Bianca; Kuemmerer, Beate; Richter, Enrico; Hoeller, Tobias; Fuhrmann, Christine; Bartok, Eva; Dolscheid, Ramona; Berger, Moritz; Wessendorf, Lukas; Eschbach-Bludau, Monika; Kellings, Angelika; Schwaiger, Astrid; Coenen, Martin; Hoffmann, Per; Noethen, Markus; Eis-Huebinger, Anna-Maria; Exner, Martin; Schmithausen, Ricarda; Schmid, Matthias; Hartmann, Gunther",,591,20

During this time junior doctors were reallocated to other departments, many of whom began working as part medical teams. As a result, many doctors needed to relearn the protocols and the conventions of their new role. This quality improvement project aims to review how prepared junior doctors reallocated to medicine felt at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and whether this was improved through the development of an on-call handbook.ResultsAn initial survey of junior doctors (n=19) asked where they had gained information about their job roles and whether they would find a handbook of information useful;82% felt a handbook would be of use. The majority of doctors (95%) were receiving information about shifts through unofficial channels such as word of mouth and messaging groups. The ‘Medical SHO On-call Handbook’ was developed by the authors. Junior doctors (n=9) were then asked in a repeat questionnaire about their shift confidence following the release of the handbook and whether they found it a useful resource. For all available job roles, shift confidence increased (mean +24%) and overall lack of confidence reduced (mean -8%). 78% of doctors found the handbook useful.Key Features of the on-call handbook:Information for all the on-call shifts with the specific role and top tips.IT information is specific to the local electronic patient records system.Hospital maps and information about rest areas.Official information from medical on-call administrators regarding annual leave.Recommendations and actionsRelease the on-call handbook to all medical SHOs via an email and intranet access.Organisation of a handbook committee to review the handbook in next year and develop a second volume.","Hogan, J.

The non-linear regression model is implemented in an expert system that automatically allows the user to fit and forecast through a graphical interface. This system is equipped with a control procedure to detect trend changes and define the end of one wave and the beginning of another. Moreover, it depends on only four parameters per series that are easy to interpret and monitor along time for each variable.

We aim at comparing the performance of antigenic detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples via an immunochromatographic method to molecular detection via qRT-PCR. Materials and Methods: 47 nasopharyngeal exudates were collected from suspicious COVID-19 cases. The samples were performed both via the qualitative immuno-chromatographic method for S protein detection in the SARS-CoV-2 structure, using fluorescent labelled anti-protein S antibodies and via qRT-PCR test for the qualitative detection of the screening gene E and the specific ORF1ab region of the RNA-SARS-CoV-2. Results: There was a fair correlation between the positive antigen tests and the positive PCR assays measured through threshold cycle ORF1ab region (Ct orf). A better correlation was obtained between the antigen test results and the Ct orf when including patients with Ct orf below 25. Conclusions: Using antigen tests as screening tests is useful on symptomatic persons during the viral replication period, therefore during the contagious period. A positive test shows a high predictive value for infection, while a negative antigen test result via immuno-chromatography must be confirmed by a qRT-PCR test.","Lunca, C.; Cojocaru, C.; Gurzu, I.

COVID-19 and HLH share pathways involved in cytokine and chemokine signaling as well as neutrophil-mediated immune responses that associate with COVID-19 severity. These genes are dysregulated at protein level across several COVID-19 studies and form an interconnected network with differentially expressed plasma proteins which converge to neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. scRNAseq analysis indicated that these genes are specifically upregulated across different leukocyte populations, including lymphocyte subsets and immature neutrophils. Artificial intelligence modeling confirmed the strong association of these genes with COVID-19 severity.

Psychologists worldwide have contributed to cushion the distress that is laid on many societies and enforce adaptive coping strategies. However, psychological support in the past has often been broadly applied, has not been particularly parsimonious and has often been focused on severe psychological stressors. In this brief report we describe the development and application of a low-threshold tool that generates personality-specific recommendations on how to functionally cope with the psychological challenges of the corona crisis. The tool gained widespread attention in Germany and many other countries and was well received by users. It demonstrates how psychological knowledge from personality and health psychology can be combined to be of very concrete use for many people in a threatening situation. We also show that personality is related to health behavior in a crisis in a meaningful way, providing further evidence that personality-specific advice can be a useful approach for supporting persons to cope with the crisis.","Michels, Moritz; Glöckner, Andreas; Giersch, Daniel",,591,9

But this overlook would have devastating consequences for years to come.ObjectivesThe objective of this research is to compare children’s physical and mental development before, during and after the situation of social isolation caused by the pandemic of COVID-19.MethodsThe parents/guardians of 100 children aged between 0 and 5 years and 11 months old were asked to answer questions based on the ASQ-3 (Ages and Stages Questionnaire III), containing questions related to Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving, and Personal-Social and ASQ- SE (Ages and Stages Questionnaires Social-Emotional) addressing issues of self-regulation, compliance, social-communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, and affect. In addition, behavioral issues related to children’s mental health will be included, such as: aggressiveness, insomnia, lack of appetite, apathy, sadness, tiredness, lack of interest, hyperactivity, manias, tantrum, morning among others. Child development data will be collected before and during quarantine / isolation and later, in a second stage, after the end of social isolation.ResultsThe data will be analyzed in order to characterize child behavior before, during and after the period of social isolation, correlating the different areas of child development, especially mental health.ConclusionsAs argued, socially isolated children are at increased risk of health problems in adulthood.

CANA reduced the risk of HF in patients with T2D and CKD in CREDENCE. We explored potential mediators of CANA's effects on the composite of hospitalized HF (HHF) and CV death. Mediation analyses are hypothesis-generating observational analyses that calculate the effect of selected biomarkers on the overall treatment effect using time-varying Cox regression. We compared hazard ratios for the effect of randomized treatment from an unadjusted model versus a model adjusted for the average post-randomization level of the biomarker of interest. 62 routine clinical biomarkers and vital sign indicators were collected on all participants and tested as potential mediators. When multiple potential mediators represented a single pathway, those with the strongest univariable mediation were tested in multivariable models. 12 biomarkers, including 3 markers of volume/erythropoiesis (hematocrit [24%], hemoglobin [32%], erythrocytes [27%]), 2 markers of kidney function (UACR [28%], eGFR from wk 3 [7.4%]), and serum albumin (39%), serum protein (24%), lactate dehydrogenase (13%), systolic BP (10%), urine pH (8%), serum urate (7%) and gamma glutamyltransferase (4%), mediated the effect of CANA on HHF/CV death in univariable models. In the multivariable model, hemoglobin, UACR, serum urate and systolic BP maximized cumulative mediation (74%). A diverse set of potential mediators of CANA's effect on HHF/CV death were identified with serum albumin, hemoglobin (or its analogues) and UACR being the most important. The extent to which these mediators reflect underlying inflammatory, nutritional, volume-related or cardiorenal pathways is unclear and underscores the need for further research into the mechanisms of benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors.

However, the number of EMS amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Khon Kaen, Thailand, has not been well studied. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the relationship between the use of EMS and the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done in Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, with a single EMS centered. Data were collected between March 27, 2021, and April 9, 2021, and designated as day-7 to day 7 of pandemic services as well as normal services which collected data between March 27, 2019, and April 9, 2019 (day-7 to day 7 of normal services). RESULTS: Three hundred and eight EMS operations were examined. A total of 77.9% (n = 95) of pandemic services were for males and the mean age of the patients was 32.1 ± 5.4 years. During the normal services in 2019, the average number of EMS operations was 13.3 ± 2.4 times/day over the 2 weeks of the study. In 2021, before the outbreak (day-7 to day 1), the average number of EMS operations was 13.2 ± 1.8 times/day. After day 1, there was a drop in the number of EMS operations which was associated with an increase in COVID-19 infections (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The number of EMS users during the COVID-19 outbreak decreased considerably compared to the pre-epidemic levels and normal service intervals, including the severity of the users, was more severe than normal.","Apiratwarakul, K.; Suzuki, T.; Celebi, I.; Tiamkao, S.; Bhudhisawasdi, V.; Gaysonsiri, D.; Ienghong, K.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,591,20

This unprecedented situation has called for radical and previously untried solutions including restrictions or a complete ban on visiting inpatients, reductions in the number of staff, and measures to improve the sanitary regime. These far-reaching actions have had a direct impact on all actors involved in the system of social welfare facilities: employees, patients, and their families. Aim of the study: The analysis of the key needs of patients and their families and the potential differences in their hierarchy in the new situation. Material and methods: A qualitative pilot study was conducted in a Polish inpatient hospice to identify the consequences of the changes outlined above and to help with the development of solutions adjusted to the current situation. The study, based on questionnaires containing open-ended questions, was conducted among patients and their families. The questionnaires were analysed using a medical-anthropological approach. Results: The analysis provides a basis for identifying the key needs of both groups under study and highlighting the differences between them. The basic need of the patients were shown to be physical closeness. For families, it was a need to care for their relatives. Conclusions: The differences in needs influenced the preferred forms of communication. Based on the results of the questionnaires, COVID-19 was also observed to play different roles and vary in importance among patients and their families. The findings of the pilot study are not exhaustive, and further in-depth research is required to explore this area of interest.","Wysocka, M.; Frydrych, J.; Klimkiewicz, A.; Jarosz, J.; Pasierski, T.",Medycyna Paliatywna-Palliative Medicine,591,28

Marked by a context of instability and uncertainty, where different manifestations of technological, economic and social transformation enhance new practices and conventions, as well as raising new and renewed deontological challenges, journalism is no exception. Based on the responses of a survey answered by 890 Portuguese journalists, this article seeks to map the effects of the March–April 2020 state of emergency on practices and routines, and on the ethical-professional precepts of an activity that calls for a revived relevance in an environment of disinformation and “infodemic”. More than revealing new problems, the results obtained suggest the intensification of the pre-existing challenges and dilemmas. In terms of practices, it is indicated that the activity is relatively domiciled. This phenomenon is accompanied by marks of depersonalization of contact with sources and events, and by signs of social isolation from journalists. In the ethical-deontological field, the emergence of particular deontological issues in the context of the pandemic, where aspects related to rigour — rejection of sensationalism, a clear distinction between facts and opinion or repudiation of any form of censorship — as well as to subsequent elements underlying contact with the sources, take on a special dimension. © 2021.

The fellow and attending were connected using the Proximie platform, a cloud-based solution that enables users to capture and stream up to four live video feeds from a clinical environment to a remote user. In this setting, two video streams were obtained directly from the AP and lateral cameras on the biplane. Videos were streamed live to the remote attending surgeon providing them situational awareness. The attending could provide immediate vocal feedback to the fellow over an intercom. The attending could also deploy Proximie’s augmented reality tools which were visible to the fellow in real-time on a laptop in the angiography suite.ResultsA total of ten cases were performed on eight patients during the study period. 30% of participants were female and the median patient age was 63±18.6 yrs.

The sorting of the study data resulted in six main categories. Out of six categories, two are the most important, which reveal that customers don?t want to compromise with their choice of products/brands even in this adverse situation and they ask their preferred products/brands in code word very often to their nearby shopkeepers. Actually, these code words are the impact of silent branding of a product in their mind.

Identifying patients at risk of diQTP can enhance monitoring and treatment plans. Objective: To develop a machine learning architecture for prediction of extreme diQTP (QTc >500ms OR {Delta}QTc >60ms) at the onset of treatment with a QTc prolonging drug. Methods: We included 4,628 adult patients who received a baseline ECG within 6 months prior to treatment onset with a QTc prolonging drug and a follow-up ECG after the fifth dose. We collected known clinical QTc prolongation risk factors (CF). We developed a novel neural network architecture (QTNet) to predict diQTP from both the CF and baseline ECG data (ECGD), composed of both the ECG waveform and measurements (i.e. QTc),by fusing a state-of-the-art convolution neural network to process raw ECG waveforms with the CF using amulti-layer perceptron. We fit a logistic regression model using the CF, replicating RISQ-PATH as Baseline. We further compared the performance of QTNet (CF+ECGD) to neural network models trained using three variable subsets: a) baseline QTc (QTC-NN), b) CF-NN, and c) ECGD-NN. Results: diQTP was present in 1030 patients (22.3%), of which baseline QTc was normal (QTc<450ms:Male/<470ms:Female) in 405 patients (39.3%). QTNet achieved the best performance (Figure 1)(AUROC, 0.802 [95% CI, 0.782-0.820]), outperforming predictions based on the Baseline (AUROC, 0.738 [95%CI, 0.716-0.757]), QTC-NN (AUROC, 0.735 [95% CI, 0.710-0.757]), CF-NN (AUROC, 0.778 [95% CI, 0.757-0.799]), and ECGD-NN (AUROC, 0.774 [95% CI, 0.750-0.794]).

Two pre-trained deep learning architectures (VGG16, and MobileNetV2) and the Histogram of Gradients (HOG) technique were used to extract the relevant features from face images of celebrities. A SoftMax layer and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used for classification. Five scenarios were devised to assess the different models and approaches. With an accuracy of 96.8%, the best model was obtained with MobileNetV2 with a SoftMax layer on the dataset consisting of a mixture of masked and unmasked images. Three different types of masks were also used in this study. The mean accuracy was 91.35% when the same type of mask is used for training and testing.

Why a Basic Income is Not the Right Tool for this Moment,16.789133,1.8030617,2020,"Synaptic plasticity is vital for brain function and memory formation. One of the key proteins in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory is the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Mammalian Arc forms virus-like capsid-like structures in a process requiring the N-terminal domain and contains two C-terminal lobes that are structural homologues to retroviral capsids. Drosophila has two isoforms of Arc, dArc1 and dArc2, with low sequence similarity to mammalian Arc, but lacking the mammalian Arc N-terminal domain. Both dArc isoforms have a capsid homology domain consisting of N- and C-terminal lobes. We carried out structural characterization of the four individual dArc lobe domains. As opposed to the corresponding mammalian Arc lobe domains, which are monomeric, the dArc lobes were all oligomeric in solution, indicating a strong propensity for homophilic interactions. The N-lobe from dArc2 formed a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal structure, resulting in a novel dimer interaction that could be relevant for capsid assembly or other dArc functions. This domain-swapped structure resembles the dimeric protein C of flavivirus capsids, as well as the structure of histones dimers, domain-swapped transcription factors, and membrane-interacting BAK domains. The strong oligomerization properties of the isolated dArc lobe domains explain the ability of dArc to form capsids in the absence of any large N-terminal domain, in contrast to the mammalian protein.","Hallin, Erik I.; Markússon, Sigurbjörn; Böttger, Lev; Torda, Andrew E.; Bramham, Clive R.; Kursula, Petri",bioRxiv,591,1

Chronic immune-mediated neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) are associated with immune mediated peripheral nerve damage and neurological deficits. Randomized, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for these conditions. IVIG is considered a treatment of choice for both disorders. German and EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend individualization of IVIG therapy during treatment for CIDP and MMN. However, there is a lack of documentation of individualized dosing in real-world practice. Objective. This study is designed to determine the patterns of use of 10% IVIG in real-world clinical practice and identify the factors driving treatment decisions for patients with CIDP or MMN. Methods. The study is non-interventional, longitudinal, multicenter design. Primary data collected will be physicians“ practice patterns, demographics, treatment regimens and tolerability of 10% IVIG. Adult patients (n=150) diagnosed with CIDP or MMN and with current or prospective therapy with 10% IVIG will be eligible for the study. Approximately 40 sites in Germany will participate in the study. The planned recruitment period for the study is 18 months starting in first half of 2021. Results. According to the study protocol, patient demographics, medical and disease history and concomitant medication are to be assessed at baseline. Data will be collected at the baseline visit and at each infusion visit (approximately every 3 weeks as scheduled for routine care) for up to 18 months. In addition, the study will include an initial, cross-sectional, quantitative survey for participating physicians on their current practice patterns for CIDP and MMN. The survey will include assessment of initial therapy choices, IVIG dosing, outcome measures, dosing reductions and treatment schemes for relapses. The criteria used for decisions about initiation, continuation and individualization of IVIG treatment (dosing, intervals, co-medication) will be recorded at each visit. Physicians are also requested to provide the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Score at baseline and other study visits, if these scores are routinely determined. The physician-assessed Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) is to be performed at all visits. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an individual subject“s treatment algorithm will also be captured in the electronic data capture system. To assess safety, serious adverse events and adverse drug reactions will be evaluated at each visit. Conclusions. Results from this clinical trial will allow identification of the factors driving treatment decisions by physicians utilizing 10% IVIG to treat patients with CIDP or MMN as part of their clinical routine and allow assessment of the influence of patient-reported outcomes and objective clinical measures.","Pingel, S.; Natoli, A.; Stettner, M.",Clinical Neurophysiology,591,1

Those with previous COVID-19 infection may have not been prioritized due to existing humoral immunity. Objective: We aim to study the association between previous COVID-19 infection and antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A serological analysis to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies was performed on individuals who received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Kuwait. Generalized linear regression models adjusted for individual characteristics and comorbidities were fitted to study the average levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals based who had previous COVID-19 infection compared to those who had not. Results: A total of 1025 individuals were recruited. The mean levels of IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies were higher in vaccinated subjects with previous COVID-19 infection when compared with those vaccinated without previous COVID-19 infection. Regression analysis showed a steeper slope of decline for IgG in vaccinated individuals without previous COVID-19 infection in comparison with vaccinated individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Previous COVID-19 infection appears to elicit robust and sustained levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in vaccinated individuals. Given the inconsistent supply of COVID-19 vaccines in many countries due to the global inequity, our results point towards wider vaccination plans to especially cover individuals without previous COVID-19 infection.","Ali, H.; Alahmad, B.; Al-Shammari, A.

Design Survey that included a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). The survey design was informed using policy documents, social media analysis and with input from remote think aloud interviews with members of the public (n=23). Setting Nation-wide survey across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Representative sample in terms of age and sex for each of the nations recruited using an online panel between 29th October and 12th December 2020. Participants Individuals who are over 18 years old. A total of 4120 adults completed the survey (1112 in England, 848 in Northern Ireland, 1143 in Scotland and 1098 in Wales). Primary outcome measure Adult preferences for, and trade-offs between, type of lockdown restrictions, length of lockdown, postponement of routine healthcare, excess deaths, impact on ability to buy things and unemployment. Results In all four countries, one out of five respondents were willing to reduce excess deaths at all costs. The majority of adults are willing to accept higher excess deaths if this means lockdowns that are less strict, shorter and do not postpone routine healthcare. On average, respondents in England were willing to accept a higher increase in excess deaths to have less strict lockdown restrictions introduced compared to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, respectively. Conclusions The majority of the UK population is willing to accept the increase in excess deaths associated with introducing less strict lockdown restrictions. The acceptability of different restriction scenarios varies according to the features of the lockdown and across countries. Authorities can use information about trade-off preferences to inform the introduction of different lockdown restriction levels, and design compensation policies that maximise societal welfare.","Loria-Rebolledo, L.

Remote sexual health care, including home HIV/STI testing and remote consultation is increasingly appreciated as a necessary extension to regular care, to be able to reach out to MSM. While care providers recognize this need, evidence regarding attitudes among MSM towards using remote care is limited. Here, we present STI/HIV testing behaviors, attitudes and preferences, towards home-sampling during the Covid-19 pandemic, in MSM who (pre-pandemic) attended location-based STI clinic care.MethodsStarting in November 2020, 417 MSM who attended one of several Dutch STI clinics before the Covid-19 pandemic were invited to participate in an online survey, Data collection is on-going. Descriptive statistics regarding testing for HIV/STI testing, of the first 148 participants (35.5%) are presented. Attitude towards home-sampling testing is shown on a scale from negative (0) to positive (100).ResultsOf participants (mean age 48) in the past 6 months, 66.4% (97/146) tested for STI and 61.6% (90/146) tested for HIV. A home-sampling test for STI was used by 2.1% and 1.1% performed a home-sampling test for HIV. Participants reported that 1.5% of their male sex partners used home-sampling testing for HIV. Participants were positive towards home-sampling testing (mean=72.0, SD=33.6). When testing for HIV in the future 48.4% (60/124) would consider home-sampling testing. Most of the participants (56.8%) prefer remote consultations combined with a consultation at the STI clinic.ConclusionsAlthough home-sampling STI/HIV testing is rarely used by STI clinic visiting MSM, results show that MSM can be positive towards home-sampling testing for STI and HIV. Home-sampling testing and remote consultations might be solutions to extend sexual healthcare to continue reaching MSM.","Goense, H.; Evers, Y.; Hoebe, C.; Dukers-Muijrers, N.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,591,13

Several studies are evaluating the importance of analyzing viral load in different types of samples, clinical outcomes and viral transmission pathways. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake. In this study, we compared tracheal aspirate with nasopharyngeal samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients and demonstrate how the raw Ct could lead to misinterpretation of results. Further, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs positive samples and propose a method to reduce evaluation error that could occur from using raw Ct.

The aim of this study was to compare stillbirth and preterm birth rates in women who were exposed or unexposed to lockdown restrictions during pregnancy. Design: Retrospective multi-centre cohort study of perinatal outcomes before and during COVID-19 lockdown Setting: Birth outcomes from all 12 public maternity hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne Inclusion criteria: Singleton births without congenital anomalies from 24 weeks gestation. The lockdown-exposed cohort were those women for whom weeks 20- 40 of gestation would have occurred during the lockdown period of 23 March 2020 to 14 March 2021. The control cohort comprised all pregnancies in the corresponding periods one and two years prior to the exposed cohort. Main outcome measures. Odds of stillbirth, preterm birth (PTB), birth weight less than 3rd centile, and iatrogenic PTB for fetal compromise, adjusting for multiple covariates. Results: There were 24,017 births in the exposed and 50,017 births in the control group. There was a significantly higher risk of preterm, but not term, stillbirth in the exposed group compared with the control group (0.26% vs 0.18%, aOR 1.49, 95%CI 1.08 to 2.05, P = 0.015). There was also a significant reduction in preterm birth < 37 weeks (5.93% vs 6.23%, aOR 0.93, 95%CI 0.87 to 0.99, P=0.03), largely mediated by a reduction in iatrogenic PTB for live births (3.01% vs 3.27%, aOR 0.89, 95%CI 0.81 to 0.98, P = 0.015), including iatrogenic PTB for suspected fetal compromise (1.25% vs 1.51%, aOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.69 to 0.91, P= 0.001).

Background: The COVID-19 (coronavirus-19 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has impacted on many aspects of patient care both for those with the virus and those with other illnesses. Of particular concern has been the risk to staff and patients from the spread of the virus in health care settings. This has led to changes in guidelines and practice in community and hospital settings that has implications on patient diagnostic pathways in lung cancer, with a specific emphasis on aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). Methods: A literature search was carried out and 44 abstracts were initially found. Given the novel status of COVID-19, we included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in our search. Five papers were selected for further analysis. An additional paper was highlighted during our research and therefore included in our review. Conclusions: The papers selected assessed the risk of transmission during AGPs. The six articles selected assessed the risk of aerosol transmission during various AGPs (bronchoscopy, pleural procedures and pulmonary function tests) and each found that the risk of viral transmission via aerosol was low. As mentioned above, at the time the paper was written, there was a paucity of evidence regarding AGPs in the era of COVID-19. There is emerging evidence that our understanding of these procedures may be outdated and the risk of transmission maybe lower than previously anticipated.

The conversion to electric vehicles (EVs) represents a major path to decarbonize the transport sector, with potentially significant co-benefits for human health. However, the scale of such co-benefits largely remains an empirical question and lacks observational evidence. The full lockdown in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic provides an unprecedented real-world experiment to evaluate emission reduction potentials of a large-scale transition to EVs. Here, we utilize ground and satellite observations of air quality during the full lockdown to constrain predictions of a comprehensive chemical transport model and find that the substantial traffic reductions are near-linearly linked to reductions of PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) and NO2. A further extrapolation of a full conversion to EVs shows a significant reduction of PM2.5 (30%–70%) and NO2 (30%–80%) in most of China.

BC and BCff show very strong diurnal cycles, which also show some weekday–weekend differences, with maxima during the night and just before noon, and minima in the afternoon. These patterns indicate strong influences on concentrations from both traffic emissions and boundary layer depth. BC was strongly correlated with NO2 (R = 0.71), another marker of traffic emission, but less strongly with PM2.5 (R = 0.52). The BC absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) ranged between 1.1 and 1.6. We observed pronounced diurnal cycles of lower AAE in daytime, corresponding to BCff contributions from traffic. Average AAE also showed a pronounced increase during the MCO. Our data provides a new reference for BC in suburban Malaysia for the public and policy-makers, and a baseline for future measurements.

Drawn from research and clinical and pastoral experience, this book examines the feelings associated with the end of life, highlighting the demands that people are faced with and their consequences. It moves into the difficult area of people who feel defeated by their illness and can or want to live no longer, as well as the family, caregivers and professionals who surround them. These perspectives have been built upon around a hundred narratives of lived experience, combined with the wider clinical and practical range of voices. A topical post-script Lessons from Covid-19 captures the choices and challenges on a personal, professional and systemic level which the pandemic acutely revealed with a multiplicity of examples. This will be essential reading for students and professionals in palliative and end-of-life care. Families and friends will also benefit from the book as they try to come to terms with the delicate but universal issues of death and dying. The book is written for volunteers and multidisciplinary professionals training in palliative medicine and end-of-life care, and includes some questions after each chapter to trigger their thinking and refection. The book contributes to a better understanding of and respect for the motivations and attitudes behind patients' wishes and focus towards the end of life-be it to end their life deliberately or choose not to do so-and thus to improve the capacity to offer appropriate holistic care and psychosocial and spiritual support in the twilight of life.

Epidemiological models provide insight into the spread of these types of diseases and predict the effects of possible intervention policies. However, to date, even the most data-driven intervention policies rely on heuristics. In this paper, we study how reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian inference can be used to optimize mitigation policies that minimize economic impact without overwhelming hospital capacity. Our main contributions are (1) a novel agent-based pandemic simulator which, unlike traditional models, is able to model fine-grained interactions among people at specific locations in a community;(2) an RLbased methodology for optimizing fine-grained mitigation policies within this simulator;and (3) a Hidden Markov Model for predicting infected individuals based on partial observations regarding test results, presence of symptoms, and past physical contacts.

The pandemic disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2, which is the main cause of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Risk assessment is a vital action toward disease risk reduction as it increases the understanding of the risk factors associated with the disease and allows existing data to decide on adequate preventive and mitigation measures. Machine learning techniques have gained strength since 2000, as it has crucial role in data analysis and is really helpful to develop standard mortality models. This study aims to find the best model for data analysis using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other risk factors, which contribute to the high mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 in Iran, to predict the risk of death for the people with different situation. A systematic review and meta-analysis were examined by using patient risk factor data from studies done by researchers to estimate COVID-19 death risk. Risk factors for the disease were extracted from an existing study. Using ANN, the best risk prediction for the disease is calculated. Assessment of a different number of hidden neurons with a different training function using the Bayesian Regularization algorithm, the best training function for the ANN model with 5 hidden neurons is found to have the most satisfying results.

Cities, just like people, need to protect themselves from pandemics. Therefore, the existing urban and spatial practices should be reconsidered. The aim of the study is to explore, by observation and literature review, the cities' readiness for possible pandemics or emergencies within the framework of the concept of urban immunity. Based on the elements necessary for the provision of immunity in humans, the requirements for urban immunity, the health of the infrastructure and superstructure of the soil, the resources and sustainability of a city, its resilience and growth control are discussed within the framework of urban management. In addition, the study identifies three indispensable actors for urban immunity: i) central governments, ii) local governments, and iii) citizens. Immunized cities can be defined as cities with healthy infrastructure and superstructure factors of urban soil aiming at economic and ecological sustainability that have achieved a planned and controlled growth momentum, governed by public policies created with the understanding of local welfare and democracy in cooperation with local governments, citizens, and the central government. The study is purely theoretical and focuses on universal urban immunity rather than on any country example, which constitutes the strength of the study.","Negiz, Nilüfer Savaş-Yavuzçehre Pınar",Central European Public Administration Review,591,1

In non-transplant eligible patients daratumumab has been added in randomized studies to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) and bortezomib, melphalan and prednisolone (VMP) backbones, but not to the VCD regimen. Furthermore, the randomized studies excluded a significant proportion of patients with comorbidities so the benefit of daratumumab in a frail, elderly myeloma population remains untested. Methods Inclusion criteria included untreated patients with symptomatic myeloma who were considered ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation due to either age >65years or the presence of comorbidities. Any degree of renal impairment, including dialysis dependence, was allowed as were patients with a prior history of systemic malignancy that had been disease-free for 2 years. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive VCD or VCDD. VCD consisted of nine 5-week cycles of V 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22;C 300mg/m2 PO on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 and D 20 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22. VCDD consisted of nine 5-week cycles of VCD plus daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, Days 1 and 15 of cycles 3 to 6 and Day 1 of cycles 7 to 9, followed by daratumumab maintenance 16 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks until progression. The primary endpoint was PFS with secondary endpoints being response rates, MRD, overall survival, toxicity and quality of life. Results A total of 129 patients were randomized, but 7 did not commence intended therapy. The following modified ITT analysis is based on the 122 randomized patients, 58 in the VCD group and 64 in the VCDD group, who received therapy. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two arms. Median age was 76 years (range, 62-91yrs), with 19% being ≥80 years of age. 30% were female. ECOG performance status was 0 (34%),1 (26%), 2 (16%) and unknown (25%). ISS stage was I (16%), II (36%), III (23%) and unknown (24%). The estimated median potential follow-up is 12.6 months. At the time of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted collection of site data. As a result, the following outcome data is provisional with a full data set to be available for presentation of the formal pre-planned interim analysis by the time of the ASH meeting. Overall response rate was 86% for VCD and 93% for VCDD. There was no significant difference between response rates after 4 cycles of induction for the VCD and VCDD arms: CR 3% vs 2%, VGPR 31% vs 41%, PR 51% vs 50%, MR 11% vs 7%, PD 3% vs 0%. Median PFS for the entire cohort (Fig A) was 21.8 months (95%CI 17.1-31.6 months). Median PFS for those treated with VCD was 18.9 months (95%CI 15.3-NR) and was 26.3 months (95%CI 17.1-31.6 months) for those treated with VCDD. In both arms combined, median PFS was 26.3 vs 21.9 months for those aged <75 vs ≥75 yrs, and not reached, 21.8 months and 19.9 months for those with ISS stage I, II and III, respectively. 19% of patients in the VCD group and 16% of patients in the VCDD group ceased therapy early, predominantly due to adverse events or death. SAEs during the induction period occurred in 44% and 52% of patients in the VCD and VCDD arms, respectively. There were 13 patients with SAEs due to infection in the VCD group and 20 in the VCDD group. Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy was uncommon, with only one case in the VCD arm. Conclusions The VCD schedule as detailed in this study appears efficacious, well tolerated and deliverable to an elderly myeloma population. The addition of daratumumab does not compromise chemotherapy delivery and may improve PFS. Formal interim analysis of the trial data will be presented at the meeting.

The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a priori and emergent codes. Results: The transition to virtual school and work transformed daily activities. Physical education requirements varied, generally perceived as not contributing to overall physical activity. Parents perceived the amount of physical activity as the same or increased but reported an increase in screen time. The physical environment of the home, yard, and neighborhood emerged as a theme as did the social environment for physical activity. Conclusions: COVID-19 stay-at-home orders created challenges for children's physical activity. Results can be used to inform more generalizable studies and serve as a basis for creating better parent resources to support their children's physical activity outside of ordinary school, sport, and community activity opportunities.","Eyler, A.

The year of crises presented itself as a litmus test for the effectiveness of Rodrigo Duterte's populist leadership and for the resilience of Philippine democracy. It was a year of reckoning that unmasked the government's misplaced priorities and exposed systemic deficiencies in various areas of governance. Likewise, the year of crises also provided an effective rationale for greater executive aggrandizement, aggravating the continued trend of democratic backsliding since 2016.

They are selected during thymopoiesis, which releases a repertoire of about 108 unique TCRs2,3 per individual. How evolution shaped a process that produces TCRs that would effectively respond to infectious agents is a central question of immunology. The paradigm is that a diverse enough repertoire of TCRs should always provide a proper, though rare, specificity for any given need. Expansion of such rare T cells would provide enough fighters for an efficacious immune response and enough antigen-experienced cells for memory3,4. We show here that thymopoiesis releases a large population of CD8+ T cells harbouring diverse α/βTCRs with innate-like properties. These TCRs (i) have high generation probabilities and a preferential usage of some V and J genes, (ii) are shared between individuals, (iii) are highly enriched for viral antigen recognition and (iv) have a fuzzy rather than tight specificity. In vitro, T cells expressing these TCRs bind to and are activated by multiple unrelated viral peptides; in vivo, they respond to vaccination and infection, being notably found in bronchoalveolar lavages of COVID-19 infected patients. Our results support an evolutionary selection of pleiospecific α/βTCRs for broad antiviral responses and heterologous immunity.","Quiniou, Valentin; Barennes, Pierre; Martina, Federica; Mhanna, Vanessa; Vantomme, Helene; Pham, Hang Phuong; Shugay, Mikhail; Six, Adrien; Mariotti-Ferrandiz, Encarnita; Klatzmann, David",bioRxiv,591,1

Conclusion: Hospitalized DM patients with COVID-19 with a BNP>100 pg/ml were at higher risk of CA. Identifying subclinical HF using BNP may be helpful in predicting and implementing strategies to lower adverse cardiovascular outcomes in DM patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Screening DM patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using BNP may be beneficial.","Elabidin, Awfa Zain Pereira Leanne Namdarizandi Vahid Fatuyi Michael Kasan Shalemar Ann Sharma Vivek Tappuni Bassman Kaseer Belal Brandt Dominique M.; Shemisa, Kamal",Diabetes,591,1

A major problem for health authorities is that we do not know. In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative. Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity. As Bluetooth transmission is the most likely method used for such inter-device communication, and as our suggested ""virtual viruses"" do not harm individuals' software or intrude on privacy, we call these Safe Blues. In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals' locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages: - Data about the spread of Safe Blues is uploaded to a central server in real time, which can give authorities a more up-to-date picture in comparison to actual COVID-19 data, which is only available retrospectively. - Sampling of Safe Blues data is not biased by being applied only to people who have shown symptoms or who have come into contact with known positive cases. These features mean that there would be real statistical value in introducing Safe Blues. In the medium term and end game of COVID-19, information from Safe Blues could aid health authorities to make informed decisions with respect to social distancing and other measures. In this paper we outline the general principles of Safe Blues and we illustrate how Safe Blues data together with neural networks may be used to infer characteristics of the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in real time. Further information is on the Safe Blues website: https://safeblues.org/.","Dandekar, Raj Abhijit; Henderson, Shane G.; Jansen, Marijn; Moka, Sarat; Nazarathy, Yoni; Rackauckas, Christopher; Taylor, Peter G.; Vuorinen, Aapeli",,591,1

During the post-Hijra phase of Muslim community in Madinah, masjid has been established as the centre for the ummah which significantly contributed to the arisen of Muslim civilitation in the past. Nowadays, most masjid however seem to have narrowed down its function for merely worshipping purposes. Notably, this institution is facing challenges to engage the whole segment of the society particularly Muslim youth, the failure of which would jeopadize the effort to instil the necessary Muslim characters and values in them. Covid-19 pandemic which had started in the first quarter of the year 2020 has further worsen the situation. If this problem persists, the future of masjid as the basic foundation of the ummah is threatened, uncertain and will continue to be less relevant in a community. The primary objective of this study is to analyse the initiatives taken in engaging Muslim youth with masjid before and during Covid-19 pandemic. A online survey was distributed to Muslim youth nationwide and a total of 556 responses were received and analysed. This study found that the initiatives taken to engage Muslim youth with masjid before and during Covid-19 pandemic are barely sufficient and need further improvement. A possibility of serious communication gap between masjid and the Muslim youth was also highlighted. This is the first large scale study on Covid-19 and its implications on the engagement of Muslim youth with masjid. The findings are regarded as relevant and beneficial to all relevant parties particularly the State Religious Authorities in their effort to improve the engagement of Muslim youth with masjid as well as to revive masjid as a prominent institution in the Muslim community in Malaysia. © 2021 Author(s).","Mahat, M.

Therefore, this study proposes a bi-objective analytic hierarchy process (AHP)–mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)–genetic algorithm (GA) approach. First, AHP is applied to decompose the decision maker's judgment matrix into several sub-judgment matrices. Each sub-judgment matrix represents a single viewpoint and generates a priority set. To generate diversified priority sets, a bi-objective MINLP problem is solved using a GA, and multiple alternatives can be selected based on these priority sets. The proposed approach has been applied to the real case of choosing diversified alternative suppliers amid the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effectiveness. Several existing methods were also applied to this case for comparison. Experimental results showed that only the proposed approach was able to diversify the recommended alternative suppliers that were simultaneously optimal, thereby enhancing decision-making flexibility. In addition, the application of GA increased the solution efficiency by up to 75%.","Wang, Yu-Cheng Chen Toly",Soft Computing Letters,591,16

The situation seems to be uncontrollable both because of the widespread of the virus and contamination of surroundings due to it, as well as a longer period of lockdown has emerged new social and economic problems. So, it is advised by the experts that this situation has to be dealt with by taking care of many precautions in mind while carrying out our daily life routine. On the other hand, frontline workers, policemen, and doctors need to protect themselves even after being exposed to the affected patients. For their safety and others, personal protective equipment (PPE) is the safeguard in this situation. The prime aim of PPE is to break the chain and avoid human to human contact. To develop these PPEs, scientists and experts have been designing and manufacturing kits consisting of various types of masks, face visors, gloves, glasses, shoe covers, surgical suits, and caps. Keeping the dimensions of the novel coronavirus in mind, i.e., 80–220 nm, the PPE kits are made to allow ventilation to the body along with the sole purpose of protection. For this, various methods of manufacturing these types of equipment are adapted, especially 3D printing is widely used for making face visors. The potential applications of nanomaterials came into the picture due to their properties such as antibacterial, hydrophobicity, transparency, and flexibility. Here, the chapter discusses the development of such PPEs for the protection of frontline workers and doctors along with the consequences followed by their usage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bhattacharjee, S.; Singh, H.",Lecture Notes in Bioengineering,591,1

The most common recombinants generated by these viruses are either defective interfering (DI) RNAs or chimeric satellite RNAs, which are thought to be generated by template switching of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during the viral replication process. To test if RNA recombination is mediated by the viral RdRp, we used either a purified recombinant RdRp of Turnip crinkle carmovirus or a partially purified RdRp preparation of Cucumber necrosis tombusvirus. We demonstrated that these RdRp preparations generated RNA recombinants in vitro. The RdRp-driven template switching events occurred between either identical templates or two different RNA templates. The template containing a replication enhancer recombined more efficiently than templates containing artificial sequences. We also observed that AU-rich sequences promote recombination more efficiently than GC-rich sequences. Cloning and sequencing of the generated recombinants revealed that the junction sites were located frequently at the ends of the templates (end-to-end template switching). We also found several recombinants that were generated by template switching involving internal positions in the RNA templates. In contrast, RNA ligation-based RNA recombination was not detected in vitro. Demonstration of the ability of carmo- and tombusvirus RdRps to switch RNA templates in vitro supports the copy-choice models of RNA recombination and DI RNA formation for these viruses.","Cheng, Chi-Ping; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,591,4

It is well-known that excess oxidative stress is one of the major factors causing cell damage in the liver. This study investigated the cytoprotective effects and molecular mechanism of tryptanthrin against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative stress in human hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells. Tryptanthrin pre-treatment blocked the reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death induced by tBHP. Moreover, tryptanthrin reversed tBHP-induced GSH reduction. This study also confirmed the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by tryptanthrin as a plausible molecular mechanism for its cytoprotective effects. Specifically, tryptanthrin treatment induced nuclear translocation and transactivation of Nrf2 as well as phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a potential upstream kinase of Nrf2. Tryptanthrin also up-regulated the expression of the heme oxygenase 1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunits, which are representative target genes of Nrf2. Moreover, inhibitor of ERK was used to verify the important role of the ERK-Nrf2 pathway in the hepatoprotective effects of tryptanthrin. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that tryptanthrin protects hepatocytes against oxidative stress through the activation of the ERK/Nrf2 pathway in HepG2 cells.","Moon, Soo Young; Lee, Ju-Hee; Choi, Hee Yoon; Cho, Il Je; Kim, Sang Chan; Kim, Young Woo",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,591,1

A high level committee was formed to assess the status of dental infection control and safety (IC&S) in Russia. This article is one of the outcomes to assess the status of IC&S and is the research of a doctoral student (PhD) in public health. PURPOSE To assess needs in Dental Infection Control and Occupational Safety in the Moscow Metropolitan Region of the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A survey with variables assessing knowledge, attitude and practice of IC&S was administered to dentists practicing and or teaching in Moscow city and suburban areas on a convenience sample of dental practitioners. RESULTS The total number of completed questionnaires were 303. Over 67% had up to three significant exposures to blood and potentially infectious materials (OPIM), but less than 30% got tested for HIV in the previous 3 months. Use of personal protective equipment was not based on anticipated exposure. Less than 10% had an understanding of Spaulding's classification with respect to sanitization, disinfection and sterilization. Only about 34% stated that there was a potential for infectious disease transmission through a percutaneous route and about 61% double gloved while treating patients with infectious diseases. Only about 61% disinfected impressions and most (83%) used alcohol for disinfection purposes. While 34% still used glass-bead sterilizers, about 13% did not sterilize handpieces between patients. CONCLUSION Results from this study indicated a disparity in the practice of infection control and safety procedures requiring formulation of nationwide dental safety standards. Further, there is a need in implementation of a standardized dental safety curriculum for dental schools and continuing dental education requirements in dental safety for practicing dentists in the Russian Federation.","Budnyak, Marina A; Gurevich, Konstantin G; Fabrikant, Kate G; Miller, Kierste; Puttaiah, Raghunath",The journal of contemporary dental practice,591,16

Vaccines developed for emerging infections in animals can protect animal health and prevent transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans. Examples in this paper illustrate how industry and public health can collaborate to develop a vaccine to prevent an emerging disease in horses (West Nile virus vaccine), how poultry vaccination can protect animals and prevent transmission to people (avian influenza vaccine), how regulatory changes can pave the way for vaccines that will control the carrier state in animals and thus prevent infection in humans (Bartonella henselae vaccine in cats) and how novel technologies could be applied to vaccinate wildlife reservoir species for rabies. Stemming from the realisation that zoonotic diseases are the predominant source of human emerging infectious diseases, it behoves academic, public health, and animal health agencies to consider creative constructive approaches to combat serious public health challenges. Vaccination of vector/reservoir species, when efficacious vaccines are available, offers significant advantages to combating zoonotic human disease.","Marano, N; Rupprecht, C; Regnery, R",Revue scientifique et technique,591,21

Susceptibility to infection, which can occur in O-2A cells before terminal differentiation may be influenced by cytokines. During the normal, age-related or rapidly induced maturation/differentiation of rat oligodendrocytes, suppression of JHMV replication is correlated with upregulation of the subunit R1 of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Virus inhibition occurs at a stage between penetration and initiation of genome expression. Regulation over coronavirus infection of oligodendroglia is strictly controlled by the host cell. There is evidence that induction of R1 subunit of protein kinase A influences uncoating, illustrated in Figure 9, by suppression of dephosphorylation during penetration. Our former working hypothesis, now borne out by recent data predicts that the infection in mature oligodendrocytes is blocked because specific dephosphorylation of the capsid protein N, required for uncoating, etc., is suppressed.","Dales, S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,591,22

The task was complicated by the fact that resurfacing arthroplasty is commonly offered only to a subset of patients who are candidates for total hip replacement, often prohibiting direct comparisons. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to address four key questions addressing revision rates, patient characteristics, effectiveness of treatment, and whether improved technique, surgeon experience, and/or patient selection lead to improved outcomes. Despite data limitations, it is apparent that revision rates are higher after resurfacing than after total hip arthroplasty. Potential prognostic indicators did not yield a consistent predictor of patient-oriented outcomes (eg, pain relief) for either resurfacing arthroplasty or total hip replacement. Because of differences between patients who received hip resurfacing and those who received total hip arthroplasty, the results of studies comparing these techniques cannot be interpreted. Finally, changes in technique and increased experience result in a decrease in revision rates and femoral neck fractures and improved pain and hip scores in resurfacing.","McGrory, Brian; Barrack, Robert; Lachiewicz, Paul F; Schmalzried, Thomas P; Yates, Adolph J; Watters, William C; Turkelson, Charles M; Wies, Janet L; St Andre, Justin",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,591,24

We introduce a single new parameter corresponding to a power-law exponent of the susceptibility distribution at small susceptibilities. We find that for this class of distributions the gamma distribution is the attractor of the dynamics. This allows us to identify generic effects of population heterogeneity in a model as simple as the original SIR model which is contained as a limiting case. Because of this simplicity, numerical solutions can be generated easily and key properties of the epidemic wave can still be obtained exactly. In particular, we present exact expressions for the herd immunity level, the final size of the epidemic, as well as for the shape of the wave and for observables that can be quantified during an epidemic. In strongly heterogeneous populations, the herd immunity level can be much lower than in models with homogeneous populations as commonly used for example to discuss effects of mitigation. Using our model to analyze data for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany shows that the reported time course is consistent with several scenarios characterized by different levels of immunity. These scenarios differ in population heterogeneity and in the time course of the infection rate, for example due to mitigation efforts or seasonality. Our analysis reveals that quantifying the effects of mitigation requires knowledge on the degree of heterogeneity in the population. Our work shows that key effects of population heterogeneity can be captured without increasing the complexity of the model. We show that information about population heterogeneity will be key to understand how far an epidemic has progressed and what can be expected for its future course.","Neipel, Jonas; Bauermann, Jonathan; Bo, Stefano; Harmon, Tyler; Jülicher, Frank",PLoS One,591,16

The actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by a ubiquitous intracellular receptor protein, the glucocorticoid receptor. So far, data on coronavirus disease 2019 and glucocorticoid receptor alpha expression are lacking. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: One academic multidisciplinary ICU. SUBJECTS: Twenty-six adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 33 adult noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients, matched for age, sex, and disease severity, constituted the control group. All patients were steroid-free. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Glucocorticoid receptor alpha, glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper expression, and serum cortisol were measured on ICU admission. In coronavirus disease 2019 patients, glucocorticoid receptor alpha and glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper messenger RNA expression were upregulated (4.7-fold, p < 0.01 and 14-fold, p < 0.0001, respectively), and cortisol was higher (20.3 vs 14.3 µg/dL, p < 0.01) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: ICU coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed upregulated glucocorticoid receptor alpha and glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper expression, along with cortisol levels, compared with ICU noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients. Thus, on ICU admission, critical coronavirus disease 2019 appears to be associated with hypercortisolemia, and increased synthesis of glucocorticoid receptor alpha and induced proteins.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Jahaj, Edison; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Zacharis, Alexandros; Botoula, Efthimia; Diamantopoulos, Aristidis; Ilias, Ioannis; Vassiliadi, Dimitra A; Tsagarakis, Stylianos; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",Crit. care med,591,24

Rapid adoption of telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject ~50% of the sub-par quality images, while retaining ~80% of good quality images patients send in, despite heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of teledermatology care.","Vodrahalli, Kailas; Daneshjou, Roxana; Novoa, Roberto A; Chiou, Albert; Ko, Justin M; Zou, James",Pac Symp Biocomput,591,24

Due to these changes proving to be crucial for the mortality and morbidity rates in this subset of infected people, several studies focusing on the pathophysiology, mainly hematological, of the disease appear every day.

Outbreak strategies often involve combinations of NPIs that may change according to disease prevalence and population response. Little is known with regard to how costly each NPI is to implement. This information is essential to inform policy decisions for outbreak response. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap in existing literature, we conducted a systematic review on outbreak costings and simulation studies related to a number of NPI strategies, including isolating infected individuals, contact tracing and quarantine, and school closures. METHODS: Our search covered the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, studies published between 1990 and 24 March 2020 were included. We included studies containing cost data for our NPIs of interest in pandemic, epidemic, and outbreak response scenarios. RESULTS: We identified 61 relevant studies. There was substantial heterogeneity in the cost components recorded for NPIs in outbreak costing studies. The direct costs of NPIs for which costing studies existed also ranged widely: isolating infected individuals per case: US$141.18 to US$1042.68 (2020 values), tracing and quarantine of contacts per contact: US$40.73 to US$93.59, social distancing: US$33.76 to US$167.92, personal protection and hygiene: US$0.15 to US$895.60. CONCLUSION: While there are gaps and heterogeneity in available cost data, the findings of this review and the collated cost database serve as an important resource for evidence-based decision-making for estimating costs pertaining to NPI implementation in future outbreak response policies.","Skarp, Janetta E; Downey, Laura E; Ohrnberger, Julius W E; Cilloni, Lucia; Hogan, Alexandra B; Sykes, Abagael L; Wang, Susannah S; Shah, Hiral Anil; Xiao, Mimi; Hauck, Katharina",Appl. health econ. health policy,591,16

AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19. The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well established.1 This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties.

METHODS: Information was gathered prospectively on flexible nasoendoscopy procedures performed between March and June 2020. Patients and healthcare workers were followed up to assess for coronavirus disease 2019 development. One-sided 97.5 per cent Poisson confidence intervals were calculated for upper limits of risk where zero events were observed. RESULTS: A total of 286 patients were recruited. The most common indication for flexible nasoendoscopy was investigation of 'red flag' symptoms (67 per cent). Forty-seven patients (16 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 13-21 per cent) had suspicious findings on flexible nasoendoscopy requiring further investigation. Twenty patients (7.1 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 4.4-11 per cent) had new cancer diagnoses. Zero coronavirus disease 2019 infections were recorded in the 273 patients. No. 27 endoscopists (the doctors and nurses who carried out the procedures) were followed up.The risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 after flexible nasoendoscopy was determined to be 0-1.3 per cent. CONCLUSION: The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 transmission associated with performing flexible nasoendoscopy in asymptomatic patients, while using appropriate personal protective equipment, is very low. Additional data are required to confirm these findings in the setting of further disease surges.","Kavanagh, F G; Connolly, C; Farrell, E; Callanan, D; Brinkman, D; Affendi, A; Lang, E; Sheahan, P",J Laryngol Otol,591,21

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched for trials comparing ESI to epidural or non-epidural placebo. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model for 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were described qualitatively. Quality of evidence was graded using GRADE classification. RESULTS: Seventeen out of 732 articles were included. ESI was superior compared to epidural placebo at 6 weeks (- 8.6 [- 13.4; - 3.9]) and 3 months (- 5.2 [- 10.1; - 0.2]) for leg pain and at 6 weeks for functional status (- 4.1 [- 6.5; - 1.6]), though the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) was not met. There was no difference in ESI and placebo for back pain, except for non-epidural placebo at 3 months (6.9 [1.3; 12.5]). Proportions of treatment success were not different. ESI reduced analgesic intake in some studies and complication rates are low. CONCLUSION: The literature indicates that ESI induces larger improvements in pain and disability on the short term compared to epidural placebo, though evidence is of low to moderate quality and MCID is not met. Strong conclusions for longer follow-up or for comparisons with non-epidural placebo cannot be drawn due to general low quality of evidence and limited number of studies. Epidural injections can be considered a safe therapy.","Verheijen, E J A; Bonke, C A; Amorij, E M J; Vleggeert-Lankamp, C L A",Eur. spine j,591,5

Herein, we describe these associations with mortality in a largely minority underserved population. METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study included all adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 treated in our ICU between March 15 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: 128 critically ill adult subjects were included in the study (median age 68 y [interquartile range 61-76], 45% female, and 64% Black); 124 (97%) required intubation. Eighty (63%) subjects died during their in-patient stay, which did not differ by race/ethnicity. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Blacks had a greater proportion of women (52% vs 30%, P = .02) and subjects with hypertension (91% vs 78%, P = .035). Asthma (P = .03) was associated with lower in-patient death, primarily among Black subjects (P = .02). Among Black subjects, increased age (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.05-1.22] per year), positive fluid balance (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11] per 100 mL), and treatment with tocilizumab (odds ratio 25.0 [95% CI 3.5-180]) were independently associated with in-patient death, while higher platelets (odds ratio 0.65 [95% CI 0.47-0.89] per 50 × 103/mL) and treatment with intermediate dose anticoagulants (odds ratio 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.43]) were protective. Among other race/ethnic groups, higher total bilirubin (odds ratio 1.75 [95% CI 0.94-3.25] per 0.2 mg/dL) and higher maximum lactate (odds ratio 1.43 [95% CI 0.96-2.13] per mmol/L) were marginally associated with increased death, while tocilizumab treatment was marginally protective (odds ratio 0.24 [95% CI 0.05-1.25]). During first 72 h of ventilation, those who died had less increase in [Formula: see text] (P = .046) and less reduction in PEEP (P = .01) and [Formula: see text] requirement (P = .002); these patterns did not differ by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Black and other race/ethnicity subjects had similar mortality rates due to COVID-19 but differed in factors that were associated with increased risk of death.

For that reason, the need for adaptation during COVID-19 pandemic may have brought major problems to families with children with this pathology. AIM: To explore how children with ASD and their parents experienced the social isolation during COVID-19 outbreak period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional and analytical study. We applied an anonymous questionnaire that included children's demographic and clinical characteristics, along with the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in different aspects of family's daily life. RESULTS: Out of 99 questionnaires obtained, 43 were related to children with ASD and 56 to control group. Children with ASD predominantly had changes in behavior, while children from control group mostly found no changes. The majority of parents of ASD children reported a negative impact in emotion management against those in control group reporting mostly positive or no impact. Caregivers reported higher mean scores of anxiety levels in themselves than in their children. ASD children and their parents had higher levels of anxiety than healthy ones. In the group with ASD, children that did not maintain routines had higher mean levels of anxiety than children that maintained routines. CONCLUSION: Our results show a potential important psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only in children with neurodevelopmental disorders but in their caregivers as well. Physicians must be prepared for the post-pandemic surveillance of mental disorders among families.","Amorim, R; Catarino, S; Miragaia, P; Ferreras, C; Viana, V; Guardiano, M",Rev Neurol,591,1

Ventilation and social distancing are two major control strategies to reduce the indoor airborne infection risk. However, there is a present lack of science-based information on how the human exposure to viral aerosols vary with ventilation condition and social distance. The objective of this study is to explore the transport patterns of respiratory aerosols in occupied spaces and assess the occupant exposure risk under different ventilation strategies, social distances and aerosol emission modes. The study results show that buoyancy-driven flow regime (can be found in many residential settings) can lead to a longer transmission distance and elevated exposure to viral aerosols than the mixing airflow, thereby causing higher cross-infection risk in indoor environments. The results also suggest that a 2 m (6 ft) social distance alone may not ensure control of indoor airborne infections.","Pei, Gen Taylor Mary Rim Donghyun",Sustainable Cities and Society,591,16

Cyperus rotundus Linn, which belongs to the Cyperaceae family, is a traditional herbal medicine that has been widely studied for its antiviral properties. In this study, a computational approach was used to screen natural compounds from C. rotundus Linn using BIOVIA Discovery Suite and novel potential molecules against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted. Molecular docking was performed using LibDock protocol and selected ligands were further subjected to docking analysis by CDOCKER. The docking scores of the selected ligands were compared with standard antiretroviral drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir to assess their binding potentials. Interaction pharmacophore analysis was then performed for the compounds exhibiting good binding scores to evaluate their protein-ligand interactions. The selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation for 50 ns. Results of binding free energy analysis revealed that two compounds-ß-amyrin and stigmasta-5,22-dien-3-ol-exhibited the best binding interactions and stability. Finally, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies were performed to understand the pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of the compounds. The overall results indicate that the phytochemicals from Cyperus rotundus Linn, namely ß-amyrin and stigmasta-5,22-dien-3-ol, can be screened as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Kumar, S Birendra; Krishna, Swati; Pradeep, Sneha; Mathews, Divya Elsa; Pattabiraman, Ramya; Murahari, Manikanta; Murthy, T P Krishna",Comput Biol Med,591,16

The concomitant presence of co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, chronic heart disease etc. makes the task of patient management difficult. AIMS AND OBJECTIVESTo assess the patterns of liver test abnormalities in patients of COVID-19 infection with and without CKD and evaluate the probable outcomes. MATERIALs and METHODSA cross-sectional retrospective observational study done on 600 patient samples (Group 1 COVID-19 without CKD, Group 2 COVID-19 with CKD and Group 3 non COVID-19 with CKD) which were processed for Liver function test (AST, ALT and ALP) and Renal function test (Urea and Creatinine) in the Department of Biochemistry, Dr. RML Hospital New Delhi. RESULTSAST and ALT levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in all COVID-19 positive patients - group 1 mean {+/-} 2 SD, (63.63 {+/-} 42.89 U/L & 50.25 {+/-} 46.53 U/L respectively) and group 2 (90.59 {+/-} 62.51 U/L & 72.09 {+/-} 67.24 U/L respectively) as compared to Group 3 (25.24 {+/-} 7.47 U/L & 24.93 {+/-} 11.44 U/L respectively) and also a statistically significant elevation is seen in these two parameters (AST & ALT) in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (P < 0.05). There was a negative significant correlation between eGFR and AST/ALT levels in Group 1 (p < 0.05). In Group 2, a weak positive correlation was seen with ALT (p < 0.01). No significant correlation existed between eGFR and ALP in groups 1 and 2. In Group 3, eGFRs showed strong correlations with AST and ALT levels (p < 0.01) and reduction in kidney function correlated well with increase in serum ALP levels, (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONSThis study most comprehensively describes that SARS-CoV-2 positive CKD patients show more elevations in serum aminotransferase levels as compared to their non-CKD counterparts, in contrast to non-COVID-19 CKD cases. Serum ALT values in SARS-CoV-2 patients show significant correlation with calculated eGFR values. Elevated ALP values in CKD patients may be used as an indicator of declining kidney function. However, more studies in this direction are needed.","Kumar, Rajeev; Jana, Pratip; Priyadarshini, Indu; ROY, SMITA; Dutta, Pritha; Das, Saswati",,591,16

An early systematic analysis of autonomic dysfunction following COVID-19 is lacking and may provide initial insights into the spectrum of this condition. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with confirmed history of COVID-19 infection referred for autonomic testing for symptoms concerning for para-/postinfectious autonomic dysfunction at Mayo Clinic Rochester or Jacksonville between March 2020 and January 2021. RESULTS: We identified 27 patients fulfilling the search criteria. Symptoms developed between 0 and 122 days following the acute infection and included lightheadedness (93%), orthostatic headache (22%), syncope (11%), hyperhidrosis (11%), and burning pain (11%). Sudomotor function was abnormal in 36%, cardiovagal function in 27%, and cardiovascular adrenergic function in 7%. The most common clinical scenario was orthostatic symptoms without tachycardia or hypotension (41%); 22% of patients fulfilled the criteria for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and 11% had borderline findings to support orthostatic intolerance. One patient each was diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, vasodepressor syncope, cough/vasovagal syncope, exacerbation of preexisting orthostatic hypotension, exacerbation of sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and exacerbation of small fiber neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities on autonomic testing were seen in the majority of patients but were mild in most cases. The most common finding was orthostatic intolerance, often without objective hemodynamic abnormalities on testing. Unmasking/exacerbation of preexisting conditions was seen. The temporal association between infection and autonomic symptoms implies a causal relationship, which however cannot be proven by this study.","Shouman, Kamal; Vanichkachorn, Greg; Cheshire, William P; Suarez, Mariana D; Shelly, Shahar; Lamotte, Guillaume J; Sandroni, Paola; Benarroch, Eduardo E; Berini, Sarah E; Cutsforth-Gregory, Jeremy K; Coon, Elizabeth A; Mauermann, Michelle L; Low, Phillip A; Singer, Wolfgang",Clin. auton. res,591,24

The objective of this study was to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients with severe COVID-19 and to evaluate the effect of a telerehabilitation program in the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Patients hospitalized for severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited. The functional exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand test (STST)) was prospectively quantified at discharge. A telerehabilitation program was then proposed. A control group was composed with the patients refusing the program. RESULTS: At discharge, none of the 48 recruited patients had a STST higher than the 50th percentile and 77% of them were below the 2.5th percentile. SpO2 was 92.6 ± 3.0% after STST and 15 patients had oxygen desaturation. After 3-months of follow-up, the number of repetitions during STST significantly increased either in telerehabilitation (n = 14) (p < 0.001) or in control groups (n = 13) (p = 0.002) but only one patient had a result higher than the 50th percentile (in Telerehabilitation group) and 37% of them were still under the 2.5th percentile for this result. The improvement was significantly and clinically greater after the telerehabilitation program (p = 0.005). No adverse events were reported by the patients during the program. CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have a low functional exercise capacity at discharge and the recovery after three months is poor. The feasibility and the effect of a simple telerehabilitation program were verified, this program being able to substantially improve the functional recovery after three months.","Martin, Ines; Braem, Fred; Baudet, Lia; Poncin, William; Fizaine, Stéphane; Aboubakar, Frank; Froidure, Antoine; Pilette, Charles; Liistro, Giuseppe; De Greef, Julien; Yildiz, Halil; Pothen, Lucie; Yombi, Jean-Cyr; Belkhir, Leïla; Reychler, Gregory",Respir Med,591,13

We used this procedure to test the body temperature of staff members in a hospital in Tyrol (Austria), where the Covid-19 disease occurred in March 2020. The hospital is located in a mountain area at 995â¯m above sea level with low outdoor temperatures during early spring season. Under these conditions, we analyzed whether forehead temperature control offers a sufficient screening tool for infectious diseases. METHODS: Forehead temperature of 101 healthy male and female employees was measured with an infrared thermometer directly after entering the hospital (0â¯min), followed by further controls after 1â¯min, 3â¯min, 5â¯min and 60â¯min. We also tracked the outside temperature and the temperature at the entrance hall of the hospital. RESULTS: Complete data of body temperature were available for 46 female and 46 male study participants. The average forehead temperature measured directly after entrance to the hospital was the lowest (0â¯min) 33.17â¯± 1.45â¯°C, and increased constantly to 34.90â¯± 1.49â¯°C after 1â¯min, 35.77â¯± 1.10â¯°C after 3â¯min, 36.08â¯± 0.79â¯°C after 5â¯min, and 36.6â¯± 0.24â¯°C after 60â¯min. The outside temperature ranged between -5.5â¯°C and 0â¯°C, the indoor temperature had a constant value of 20.5â¯°C. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that forehead infrared temperature control is not an appropriate tool to screen for infectious disease directly at the entrance of a building, at least during early spring season with cold outdoor temperatures.","Dzien, Cornelius; Halder, Wolfgang; Winner, Hannes; Lechleitner, Monika",Wien. klin.

As one of the generators of area preserving transformations, the IHO Hamiltonian can be studied as a dilatation generator, squeeze generator, a Lorentz boost generator, or a scattering potential. In establishing these different forms, we demonstrate the physics of the IHO that underlies phenomena as disparate as the Hawking-Unruh effect and scattering in the lowest Landau level(LLL) in quantum Hall systems. We derive the emergence of the IHO Hamiltonian in the LLL in a gauge invariant way and show its exact parallels with the Rindler Hamiltonian that describes quantum mechanics near event horizons. This approach of studying distinct physical systems with symmetries described by isomorphic Lie algebras through the emergent IHO Hamiltonian enables us to reinterpret geometric response in the lowest Landau level in terms of relativistic effects such as Wigner rotation. Further, the analytic scattering matrix of the IHO points to the existence of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the spectrum, which have quantized time-decay rates. We present a way to access these QNMs through wave packet scattering, thus proposing a novel effect in quantum Hall point contact geometries that parallels those found in black holes.","Subramanyan, Varsha; Hegde, Suraj S.; Vishveshwara, Smitha; Bradlyn, Barry",,591,21

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS: A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS: The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","Sachser, Cedric; Olaru, Gabriel; Pfeiffer, Elisa; Brähler, Elmar; Clemens, Vera; Rassenhofer, Miriam; Witt, Andreas; Fegert, Jörg M",Soc Sci Med,591,16

The interaction of rfhSP-D with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE-2 receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was studied by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using qPCR. In-silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the RBD of spike of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (asymptomatic, n=7 and symptomatic, n=8 and negative controls n=15) demonstrated that treatment with 1.67 µM rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by ~5.5 fold and was more efficient than Remdesivir (100 µM). Approximately, a 2-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 1.67 µM rfhSP-D. These results conclusively demonstrate that the calcium independent rfhSP-D mediated inhibition of binding between the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE-2, its host cell receptor, and a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in-vitro.

This renders the goal of active immunization of the population through vaccination a worldwide public health priority. In fact, only when efficient vaccination programs will be successfully implemented, a return to pre-pandemic normality can be considered. The scientific community has made a tremendous effort to blow the lid off the pathogenesis of the disease, and unprecedented efforts are ongoing with governments, private organizations, and academics working together to expeditiously develop safe and efficacious vaccines. Previous research efforts in the development of vaccines for other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) as well other emerging viruses have opened the door for exploiting several strategies to design a new vaccine against the pandemic virus. Indeed, in a few months, a stunning number of vaccines have been proposed, and almost 50 putative vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials. The different vaccine candidates use different vaccine development platforms, from inactivated whole virus vaccine to subunit vaccine, nucleic acid, and vectored vaccines.

By describing the life cycle of the newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in light of emerging data on the therapeutic efficacy of various repurposed antimicrobials undergoing testing against the virus, we highlight in this review a possible mechanistic convergence between some of these tested compounds. Specifically, we propose that the lysosomotropic effects of hydroxychloroquine and several other drugs undergoing testing may be responsible for their demonstrated in vitro antiviral activities against COVID-19. Moreover, we propose that Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a lysosomal storage disorder, may provide new insights into potential future therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, by highlighting key established features of the disorder that together result in an ""unfavorable"" host cellular environment that may interfere with viral propagation. Our reasoning evolves from previous biochemical and cell biology findings related to NPC, coupled with the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19. Our overall aim is to suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting lysosomal function in general, and those particularly capable of reversibly inducing transient NPC-like cellular and biochemical phenotypes, constitute plausible mechanisms that could be used to therapeutically target COVID-19.","Ballout, Rami A; Sviridov, Dmitri; Bukrinsky, Michael I; Remaley, Alan T",FASEB J,591,24

Classically, wavefront sensing has been conducted at optical wavelengths, which made high-contrast imaging of red targets such as M-type stars or extincted T Tauri stars challenging. Keck/NIRC2 has combined near-infrared (NIR) detector technology with the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). With this new module we observed SR~21, a young star that is brighter at NIR wavelengths than at optical wavelengths. Compared with the archival data of SR~21 taken with the optical wavefront sensing we achieved $\sim$20\% better Strehl ratio in similar natural seeing conditions. Further post-processing utilizing angular differential imaging and reference-star differential imaging confirmed the spiral feature reported by the VLT/SPHERE polarimetric observation, which is the first detection of the SR~21 spiral in total intensity at $L^\prime$ band. We also compared the contrast limit of our result ($10^{-4}$ at $0\farcs4$ and $2\times10^{-5}$ at $1\farcs0$) with the archival data that were taken with optical wavefront sensing and confirmed the improvement, particularly at $\leq0\farcs5$.

Restrictions impacted individuals' psychological health, especially in those with eating disorders (ED). Healthcare providers (HCPs) treating ED provided assistance by telemedicine and/or in walk-in clinics. We hypothesize that social restrictions represented a great stressor for ED patients and HCPs, negatively impacted their therapeutic alliance, and affected the frequency of dysfunctional behaviors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study consisted of an online survey investigating the experience of HCPs involved in ED treatment, with a specific focus on difficulties concerning the therapeutic efficacy. Questionnaire (n. 18 questions) was formulated ad hoc by our research team and sent by e-mail to Italian HCPs registered on online platforms. HCPs included ED experts specialized in psychology, nutrition or medicine. Data were collected during lockdown phase I and referred to patients with Anorexia Nervosa-(AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN)-and Binge-Eating Disorder-(BED). RESULTS: One-hundred questionnaires were collected; 84 and 76 were included in our qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. Thirty-six% of HCPs felt their therapeutic intervention was unsuccessful, 37% complained compromised therapeutic alliance. Changes in frequency of compensatory behaviors (increased in 41% AN and 49,5% BN; reduced in 14,6% AN and 21,8% BN) and binge-eating episodes (increased in 53,3% BN and 30,5% BED; reduced in 30,7% BN and 24,7% BED) were experienced and ascribed to augmented patient's anxiety. Disorders switches and variation in dysfunctional conducts frequency were both significantly related to ED category (p < 0.05 for all). Concentration techniques were recognized as useful to offset such negative outcomes. CONCLUSION: According to HCPs, social restrictions affected the frequency of dysfunctional behaviors in ED patients and the efficacy of their therapeutic intervention. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm our data in a larger sample size.

Here, we report the pleiotropic effects of the epigenetic regulator HdaA (histone deacetylase) on secondary metabolite production and the associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) expression in the plant endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Fes1701. Deletion of the hdaA gene in strain Fes1701 induced a significant change of the secondary metabolite profile with the emergence of the bioactive indole alkaloid meleagrin. Simultaneously, more meleagrin/roquefortine-related compounds and less chrysogine were synthesized in the &#916;hdaA strain. Transcriptional analysis of relevant gene clusters in &#916;hdaA and wild strains indicated that disruption of hdaA had different effects on the expression levels of two BGCs: the meleagrin/roquefortine BGC was upregulated, while the chrysogine BGC was downregulated. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis demonstrated that different functional genes in the same BGC had different responses to the disruption of hdaA. Thereinto, the roqO gene, which encodes a key catalyzing enzyme in meleagrin biosynthesis, showed the highest upregulation in the &#916;hdaA strain (84.8-fold). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the upregulation of HdaA inactivation on meleagrin/roquefortine alkaloid production in the endophytic fungus P. chrysogenum. Our results suggest that genetic manipulation based on the epigenetic regulator HdaA is an important strategy for regulating the productions of secondary metabolites and expanding bioactive natural product resources in endophytic fungi.","Ding, Zhuang; Zhou, Haibo; Wang, Xiao; Huang, Huiming; Wang, Haotian; Zhang, Ruiyan; Wang, Zhengping; Han, Jun",Molecules (Basel),591,16

Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) characterized with elevated inflammation and multi-organs failure is closely correlated with the bad outcome of COVID-19. Hence, inhibit the process of CSS by controlling excessive inflammation is considered one of the most promising ways for COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: Here, we developed a biomimetic nanocarrier based drug delivery system against COVID-19 via anti-inflammation and antiviral treatment simultaneously. Firstly, lopinavir (LPV) as model antiviral drug was loaded in the polymeric nanoparticles (PLGA-LPV NPs). Afterwards, macrophage membranes were coated on the PLGA-LPV NPs to constitute drugs loaded macrophage biomimetic nanocarriers (PLGA-LPV@M). In the study, PLGA-LPV@M could neutralize multiple proinflammatory cytokines and effectively suppress the activation of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, the formation of NETs induced by COVID-19 patients serum could be reduced by PLGA-LPV@M as well. In a mouse model of coronavirus infection, PLGA-LPV@M exhibited significant targeted ability to inflammation sites, and superior therapeutic efficacy in inflammation alleviation and tissues viral loads reduction. CONCLUSION: Collectively, such macrophage biomimetic nanocarriers based drug delivery system showed favorable anti-inflammation and targeted antiviral effects, which may possess a comprehensive therapeutic value in COVID-19 treatment.","Tan, Qingqin; He, Lingjie; Meng, Xiaojun; Wang, Wei; Pan, Hudan; Yin, Weiguo; Zhu, Tianchuan; Huang, Xi; Shan, Hong",J Nanobiotechnology,591,1

During the past decade of the opioid epidemic, methadone was the primary treatment for opioid addiction until buprenorphine was approved. Buprenorphine's high-affinity partial agonist properties make it a good alternative to methadone due to lower abuse potential and safer adverse effect profile while maintaining significant efficacy. Expanded out-patient prescribing options have allowed physician and physician extenders such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners to treat these patients that otherwise would have been required to utilize methadone.

One of the proposed strategies for mitigating the massive demand for N95 FFRs is their reuse after a process of decontamination that allows the inactivation of any potentially infectious material on their surfaces. This article aims to summarize all of the available evidence on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, with emphasis on decontamination from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to identify studies reporting outcomes of at least 1 decontamination method for inactivating or removing any potentially infectious material from the surface of N95 FFRs, specifically addressing issues related to reduction of the microbial threat (including SARS-CoV-2 when available), maintaining the function of N95 FFRs and a lack of residual toxicity. RESULTS: We identified a total of 15 studies reporting on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, including small-scale energetic methods and disinfecting solutions/spray/wipes. Among these decontamination methods, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the most promising decontamination methods for N95 FFRs, based on their biocidal efficacy, filtration performance, fitting characteristics, and residual chemical toxicity, as well as other practical aspects such as the equipment required for their implementation and the maximum number of decontamination cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Although all the methods for the decontamination and reuse of N95 FFRs have advantages and disadvantages, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the most promising methods.","Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E; Sossa-Briceño, Monica P; Cortés, Jorge A",Am J Infect Control,591,1

Here, we present a temporal analysis of key immune mediators, cytokines, and chemokines in blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from serial sampling and follow-up over 4 weeks. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing You'an Hospital in China with either mild (53 patients) or severe (18 patients) disease were enrolled with 18 healthy volunteers. We measured 34 immune mediators, cytokines, and chemokines in peripheral blood every 4-7 days over 1 month per patient using a bioplex multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS: We found that the chemokine RANTES (CCL5) was significantly elevated, from an early stage of the infection, in patients with mild but not severe disease. We also found that early production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly associated with disease severity, and a combination of CCL5, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), and IL-10 at week 1 may predict patient outcomes. The majority of cytokines that are known to be associated with the cytokine storm in virus infections such as IL-6 and IFN-Î³ were only significantly elevated in the late stage of severe COVID-19 illness. TNF-&#945; and GM-CSF showed no significant differences between severe and mild cases. CONCLUSION: Together, our data suggest that early intervention to increase expression of CCL5 may prevent patients from developing severe illness. Our data also suggest that measurement of levels of CCL5, as well as IL-1RA and IL-10 in blood individually and in combination, might be useful prognostic biomarkers to guide treatment strategies.","Zhao, Yan; Qin, Ling; Zhang, Ping; Li, Kang; Liang, Lianchun; Sun, Jianping; Xu, Bin; Dai, Yanchao; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Chi; Peng, Yanchun; Feng, Yingmei; Li, Ang; Hu, Zhongjie; Xiang, Haiping; Ogg, Graham; Ho, Ling-Pei; McMichael, Andrew; Jin, Ronghua; Knight, Julian C; Dong, Tao; Zhang, Yonghong",JCI insight,591,26

Although information on drug interactions was available for other pathologies, there was little evidence in the treatment of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to analyse the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) derived from the medication used in COVID-19 patients in the first pandemic wave and to evaluate the real consequences of such interactions in clinical practice. METHODS: Cohort, retrospective and single-centre study carried out in a third-level hospital. Adult patients, admitted with suspected COVID-19, that received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta 1-b or tocilizumab and with any pDDIs according to ""Liverpool Drug Interaction Group"" between March and May 2020 were included. The possible consequences of pDDIs at the QTc interval level or any other adverse event according to the patient's medical record were analysed. A descriptive analysis was carried out to assess possible factors that may affect the QTc interval prolongation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two hundred and eighteen (62.3%) patients of a total of 350 patients admitted with COVID-19 had at least one pDDI. There were 598 pDDIs. Thirty-eight pDDIs (6.3%) were categorized as not recommended or contraindicated. The mean value difference between baseline and pDDI posterior ECG was 412.3 ms ± 25.8 ms vs. 426.3 ms ± 26.7 ms; p < 0.001. Seven patients (5.7%) had a clinically significant alteration of QTc. A total of 44 non-cardiological events (7.3%) with a possible connection to a pDDI were detected. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The number of pDDIs in patients admitted for COVID-19 in the first pandemic wave was remarkably high. However, clinical consequences occurred in a low percentage of patients. Interactions involving medications that would be contraindicated for concomitant administration are rare. Knowledge of these pDDIs and their consequences could help to establish appropriate therapeutic strategies in patients with COVID-19 or other diseases with these treatments.","Martínez-López-de-Castro, Noemí; Samartín-Ucha, Marisol; Paradela-Carreiro, Adolfo; Pérez-Landeiro, Antonio; Inaraja-Bobo, María Teresa; Álvarez-Payero, Miriam; Castro-Núñez, Inés; García-Beloso, Nerea; Robles-Torres, David; López-López, Aida; González-Costas, Sonia; Leboreiro-Enríquez, Belén; Otero-Millán, Luis; Yaiza Romero-Ventosa, Elena; Casanova-Martínez, Cristina; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Regueira-Arcay, Ana María; Vázquez-López, Cristina; Martínez-Reglero, Cristina; Piñeiro-Corrales, Guadalupe",J. clin. pharm. ther,591,2

Several researchers have given the evidence of impacts of COVID-19 on the respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system. Studies still have debated on kidney injury of COVID-19 patients. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of kidney impairment with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and MedRxiv databases were searched until May 1, 2020. We extracted data from eligible studies to summarize the clinical manifestations and laboratory indexes of kidney injury on COVID-19 infection patients and further compared the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mean differences of three biomarkers between in ICU/severe and non-ICU/non-severe cases. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method. RESULTS: In the sum of 24 studies with 10180 patients were included in this analysis. The pooled prevalence of AKI, increased serum creatinine (Scr), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased D-dimer, proteinuria and hematuria in patients with COVID-19 were 16.2%, 8.3%, 6.2%, 49.8%, 50.1% and 30.3% respectively. Moreover, the means of Scr, BUN and D-dimer were shown 6.4-folds, 1.8-folds and 0.67-folds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in corresponding non-ICU/non-severe patients. The prevalence of AKI was about 30 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/non-severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we assessed the incidences of the clinic and laboratory features of kidney injury in COVID-19 patients. And kidney dysfunction may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients developing into the severe condition.

METHODS: The present cross-sectional study included 60 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19. We recorded data on demographic characteristics, anthropometric information, and medical history. Serum levels of inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6), vitamins (A, B9, B12, C, D, E), and minerals (magnesium, zinc, iron) were measured. A radiologist assessed the severity of lung involvement according to patient computed tomography scans. The severity of illness was evaluated with the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Independent associations among the serum levels of micronutrients with the severity of COVID-19 were measured. RESULTS: Median patient age was 53.50 years (interquartile range, 12.75 years). Except for vitamin A and zinc, serum levels of other micronutrients were lower than the minimum normal.

En quelques semaines, la prise en charge des patients en onco-hématologie a été bouleversée pour limiter le risque de contamination par la COVID-19, entraînant possiblement une peur, une anxiété ou des troubles psychologiques tels qu’un stress post-traumatique. Dans ce contexte de pandémie, l’étude COVIPACT (NCT04366154) vise à décrire les adaptations de traitements oncologiques ou de prise en charge, et l’état psychologique des patients à différents temps de la pandémie. Nous présentons ici les résultats portant sur la prise en charge oncologique. Méthodes Les patients traités pour un cancer solide ou hématologique et reçus en hôpital de jour des deux centres de lutte contre le cancer de Normandie pendant la période du premier confinement (mars-mai 2020) ont été inclus. Les modifications thérapeutiques décidées lors de réunions de concertation pluridisciplinaires ont été recueillies dans les dossiers médicaux. Les facteurs cliniques associés à une adaptation de prise en charge ont été recherchés par des modèles de régression logistique. Résultats Au total, 734 patients ont été analysés, d’âge médian 64 ans [24-89] et comptant 69 % de femmes ;724 (99 %) présentaient un cancer solide, dont 60 % au stade métastatique, et 49 % bénéficiaient d’un traitement de première ligne. Les patients étaient principalement traités par chimiothérapie seule (49 %), chimiothérapie associée à une thérapie ciblée (17 %), thérapie ciblée seule (19 %), ou immunothérapie seule (8 %), les autres recevant une combinaison de traitements ;272 patients (37 %) ont commencé ce traitement pendant la période de confinement. Au total, 195 patients (27 %) ont eu une adaptation de traitement ou de prise en charge d’un ou plusieurs types, dont 29 % de décalages de cures, 27 % de modifications de suivi (principalement télé ou visio-consultation), 16 % d’interruptions de traitement et 27 % de modifications du rythme d’administration. Ces adaptations étaient significativement associées au type de traitement (p&lt;0,001, régression logistique multivariable), plus souvent observées chez les patients traités par immunothérapie seule (43 %) ou thérapie ciblée seule (46 %), et moins souvent chez ceux traités par chimiothérapie seule (16 %). Par ailleurs, les patients traités pour une première ligne ou ayant un traitement initié pendant le confinement étaient moins sujets à voir leur prise en charge ou traitement adapté (respectivement 21 %, p=0,018 et 14 %, p&lt;0,001). Les soins de support ont plus souvent été interrompus chez les patients dont la prise en charge a été adaptée (65 % versus 51 %, p&lt;0,001, n=89). Par ailleurs, la crainte d’être infecté par la COVID-19 lors d’une consultation en centre de soins n’a pas été majorée chez les patients sans modifications de leur prise en charge classique ou de traitement tel qu’initialement prévu. Conclusion Le premier confinement national instauré pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 a induit une adaptation de traitement ou de prise en charge chez plus d’un quart des patients, décidée collégialement sur la base des traitements instaurés et le statut de la maladie, dans le respect des recommandations. L’impact à moyen terme de cette adaptation sur l’évolution de la maladie reste à étudier.","Lequesne, J.; Joly, F.; Clarisse, B.; Lefèvre-Arbogast, S.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,591,1
248532,248532,248532,Is there a pattern in how COVID-19 has affected Australia’s stock returns?,16.439634,1.8987995,2021,"ABSTRACT Young people transitioning from out-of-home care, commonly called care leavers, are known to be a vulnerable group. Many experience poor outcomes leading them to become homeless or involved in the criminal justice system. Yet compared to most other Anglophone democracies, Australia lacks mandatory assistance for care leavers beyond 18 years of age. There are also major legislative, policy, and program differences between care leaver entitlements in the individual states and territories. This paper argues that the Commonwealth Government should introduce a nationally consistent extended care system that would require all jurisdictions to provide a minimum standard of support until at least 21 years of age. A uniform set of extended care standards is even more vital in the context of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS Many Australian care leavers have poor life chances despite recent advances in the support programs provided by the states and territories. A nationally consistent extended care program is likely to progress improved opportunities and outcomes for care leavers.

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound. It was tested along with 20 other vanadium-containing complexes from the literature in a virtual screening test by docking against the inhibition of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","Scior, Thomas; Abdallah, Hassan H; Fatimah Zaharah Mustafa, Siti; Antonio Guevara-García, José; Rehder, Dieter",Inorganica Chim Acta,591,30

METHODS: We did a multicenter randomized open-labeled clinical trial on moderate to severe cases infections of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with typical ground glass appearance on chest computerized tomography scan (CT scan) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 93% were enrolled. They were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (1.6 gr loading, 1.8 gr daily) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (800/200 mg daily) treatment regimens in addition to standard care. In-hospital mortality, ICU admission, intubation, time to clinical recovery, changes in daily SpO2 after 5 min discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were quantified and compared in the two groups. RESULTS: 380 patients were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (193) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (187) groups in 13 centers. The number of deaths, intubations, and ICU admissions were not significantly different (26, 27, 31 and 21, 17, 25 respectively). Mean hospital stay was also not different (7.9 days [SD = 6] in the Favipiravir and 8.1 [SD = 6.5] days in Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups) (p = 0.61). Time to clinical recovery in the Favipiravir group was similar to Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.17) and likewise the changes in the daily SpO2 after discontinuation of supplemental oxygen (p = 0.46) CONCLUSION: Adding Favipiravir to the treatment protocol did not reduce the number of ICU admissions or intubations or In-hospital mortality compared to Lopinavir/Ritonavir regimen. It also did not shorten time to clinical recovery and length of hospital stay.","Solaymani-Dodaran, Masoud; Ghanei, Mostafa; Bagheri, Mehdi; Qazvini, Ali; Vahedi, Ensieh; Hassan Saadat, Seyed; Amin Setarehdan, Seyed; Ansarifar, Akram; Biganeh, Hossein; Mohazzab, Arash; Khalili, Davood; Hosein Ghazale, Amir; Reza Heidari, Mohammad; Taheri, Ali; Khoramdad, Maliheh; Mahdi Asadi, Mohammad; Nazemieh, Masoud; Varshochi, Mojtaba; Abbasian, Samaneh; Bakhtiari, Ali; Mosaed, Reza; Hosseini-Shokouh, Seyyed-Javad; Shahrokhi, Masoume; Yassin, Zeynab; Ali Zohal, Mohammad; Qaraati, Maryam; Rastgoo, Nafiseh; Sami, Ramin; Javad Eslami, Mohammad; Asghari, Akram; Namazi, Mansoor; Ziaie, Shadi; Jafari-Moghaddam, Raana; Kalantari, Saeid; Memarian, Mohammad; Khodadadi, Javad; Hossein Afshari, Mohammad; Momen-Heravi, Mansooreh; Behzadseresht, Niusha; Reza Mobayen, Ahmad; Mozafari, Abolfazl; Movasaghi, Fatemeh; Haddadzadeh Shoushtari, Maryam; Moazen, Javad",Int Immunopharmacol,591,17

Military veterans represent another unique population affected by COVID-19. This report summarizes the demographics and baseline clinical comorbidities in veterans testing positive for COVID-19 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. METHODS: Patient evaluations were conducted at the Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin between March 11, 2020 and June 1, 2020. Patient demographics, baseline comorbidities, home medications, presenting symptoms, and outcomes were obtained via electronic medical record. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (88 men, 7 women) tested positive for COVID-19 and were evaluated. Fourteen required mechanical ventilation; 50 and 31 patients were treated in the hospital without ventilation or were discharged to home isolation, respectively. Discharged patients were younger than patients hospitalized. Most patients with COVID-19 were African American (63.2%). Patients whose disease progressed to mechanical ventilation had, on admission, more dyspnea, higher heart and respiratory rates, and lower oxygen saturation than other patients. COVID-19 patients who required mechanical ventilation had a longer length of stay and higher mortality than other groups and were more likely to have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia than patients who were discharged to home quarantine (85.7% and 78.6% vs 48.4% and 45.2%, respectively; P < 0.05 for each). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-positive veterans are predominantly African American men with hypertension and hyperlipidemia receiving beta blockers or ACEi/ARB. COVID-19-positive veterans who presented with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia were more likely to require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, had longer hospital length-of-stay, and experienced greater mortality than comparison groups.","Ebert, Thomas J; Dugan, Shannon; Barta, Lauren; Gordon, Brian; Nguyen-Ho, Calvin; Pagel, Paul S",WMJ,591,16

Methodology/Approach – Using the analytical categories of known, emerging, and novel risks the authors discuss media analyses of anti-vaccination, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and Covid-19. Findings – Known risks are framed within a biomedical discourse in which scientific evidence underpins public health guidelines, and following these directives prevent risk exposure while non-compliance is characterized as immoral and risky. News coverage of emerging risks highlights public health guidelines but fails to convey their importance as the risks seem too distant or abstract. Media coverage of novel risks is characterized by the ubiquity of uncertainty, which emerges as a “master frame” under which all incidents and events are subsumed. Stories about novel risks highlight the fluid and changing nature of scientific knowledge, which has the unintended effect of fueling uncertainty as studies and experts contradict each other. Originality/Value – This chapter introduces a new analytical framework for examining how media stories represent public health risks, along with previously unpublished analysis of media coverage about AMR and Covid-19.

The patient was given a presumptive diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and was managed conservatively with successful resolution of AHRF and stabilisation of haemoglobin level. Seven days after admission, she passed away due to subsequent complications; hence, follow-up G6PD level could not be obtained. Haemolytic anaemia and methemoglobinemia in the setting of recent rasburicase administration should raise clinical suspicion for G6PD deficiency. In non-emergent cases, patients should be screened prior to receiving rasburicase regardless of risk factors. Because rasburicase is often needed emergently, patients at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome should be screened early for G6PD deficiency.","Madanat, Luai; Schoenherr, Daniel; Wey, Elizabeth; Gupta, Ruby",BMJ case reports,591,28

While waiting for the vaccine, as for other public buildings, policy-makers' measures to limit virus outbreaks combine individual's strategies (facial masks), occupants' capacity and access control. But, up to now, no easy-to-apply tools are available for assessing the punctual effectiveness of such measures. To fill this gap, this work proposes a quick and probabilistic simulation model based on consolidated proximity and exposure-time-based rules for virus transmission confirmed by international health organizations. The building occupancy is defined according to university scheduling, identifying the main ""attraction areas"" in the building (classrooms, break-areas). Scenarios are defined in terms of occupants' densities and the above-mentioned mitigation strategies. The model is calibrated on experimental data and applied to a relevant university building. Results demonstrate the model capabilities. In particular, it underlines that if such strategies are not combined, the virus spreading can be limited by only using high protection respiratory devices (i.e. FFP3) by almost every occupant. On the contrary, the combination between access control and building capacity limitation can lead to the adoption of lighter protective devices (i.e. surgical masks), thus improving the feasibility, users' comfort and favorable reception. Simplified rules to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density are thus provided to help stakeholders in organizing users' presences in the building during the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant overloads in the work of health systems in many countries, a shortage of beds and staff, which contributes to a decrease in adherence to measures to prevent and control nosocomial infections, which can significantly worsen the course of viral pneumonia. Aim. To assess the possibility of the formation of hospital strains of multidrug-resistant microorganisms in hospitals repurposed to provide medical care to patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods. The study included patients with severe and moderate forms of COVID-19 (ICD codes U07.1, U07.2), who were admitted to two large hospitals repurposed for the treatment of this infection. The data of microbiological studies of the biomaterial associated with the respiratory tract (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates) obtained from 1101 patients from May to January 2021 were analyzed using a combination of molecular genetic methods (RAPD-PCR, detection of integrons and the carbapenemase gene bla NDM.), and molecular typing of carbapenem-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii was carried out. Results. It was found that carbapenem resistant gram-negative bacteria predominate in the structure of the nosocomial microbiota of the respiratory tract of patients with COVID-19 in both hospitals. Based on molecular typing made the wide distribution of several genetic lines of integron-positive carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii was detected. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the spread and circulation of bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance in hospitals. This study has demonstrated the possibility of the formation of hospital strains of nosocomial infections in COVID-19 hospitals, which justifies the need to improve infection control measures in the context of a new coronavirus infection pandemic. © Goncharov AE et al.","Goncharov, A.

We compared COVID-19 worry, attitudes towards governmental responses, and self-reported mental health symptoms among adults aged &#8805;55 in the United States and Canada early in the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey administered between April 2nd and May 31st in the United States and between May 1st and June 30th, 2020 in Canada. SETTING: Nationally in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of older adults aged &#8805;55. MEASUREMENTS: Likert-type scales measured COVID-19 worry and attitudes towards government support. Three standardized scales assessed mental health symptoms: the eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item UCLA loneliness scale. RESULTS: There were 4453 U.S. respondents (71.7% women; mean age 67.5) and 1549 Canadian (67.6% women; mean age 69.3). More U.S. respondents (71%) were moderately or extremely worried about the pandemic, compared to 52% in Canada. Just 20% of U.S. respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the federal government cared about older adults in their COVID-19 pandemic response, compared to nearly two-thirds of Canadians (63%). U.S. respondents were more likely to report elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to Canadians; 34.2% (32.8-35.6) versus 25.6% (23.3-27.8) for depressive and 30.8% (29.5-32.2) versus 23.7% (21.6-25.9) for anxiety symptoms. The proportion of United States and Canadian respondents who reported loneliness was similar. A greater proportion of women compared to men reported symptoms of depression and anxiety across all age groups in both countries. CONCLUSION: U.S. older adults felt less supported by their federal government and had elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to older adults in Canada during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health messaging from governments should be clear, consistent, and incorporate support for mental health.","Reppas-Rindlisbacher, Christina; Finlay, Jessica M; Mahar, Alyson L; Siddhpuria, Shailee; Hallet, Julie; Rochon, Paula A; Kobayashi, Lindsay C",J Am Geriatr Soc,591,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis, devastating the social, economic and political aspects of life. Many clinicians, health professionals, scientists, organizations, and governments have actively defeated COVID-19 and shared their experiences of the SARS-CoV2. Diabetes is one of the major risk factors for fatal outcomes from COVID-19. Patients with diabetes are vulnerable to infection because of hyperglycemia; impaired immune function; vascular complications; and comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. Hence, the use of angiotensin-directed medications in patients with diabetes requires attention. The severity and mortality from COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients with diabetes than in those without. Thus, the patients with diabetes should take precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we review the current knowledge of COVID-19 including the global and regional epidemiology, virology, impact of diabetes on COVID-19, treatment of COVID-19, and standard of care in the management of diabetes during this critical period.","Jeong, In-Kyung; Yoon, Kun Ho; Lee, Moon Kyu",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,591,16

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, 372 hospitalized patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were followed for > 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and those who maintained a nonsevere state were assigned to the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. Based on baseline data of the 2 groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance. RESULTS: The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, and the 2 independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.4%) patients developed severe COVID-19. Older age; higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, and direct bilirubin; and lower albumin were associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.912 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .846-.978]; sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 87.6%) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.853 [95% CI, .790-.916]; sensitivity 77.5%, specificity 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analyses indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram could help clinicians with early identification of patients who will progress to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe disease.","Gong, Jiao; Ou, Jingyi; Qiu, Xueping; Jie, Yusheng; Chen, Yaqiong; Yuan, Lianxiong; Cao, Jing; Tan, Mingkai; Xu, Wenxiong; Zheng, Fang; Shi, Yaling; Hu, Bo",Clin Infect Dis,591,16

Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the crucial interventions to control virus spread and dissemination. Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals. However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results. As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments.

Severe and critical cases have been associated with higher mortality due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Based on the novelty and recent emergence of COVID-19, no effective treatment regimen has been identified, thus prompting clinicians to engage in drug repurposing to address the immediate therapeutic need. This study focused on the molecular target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2 and screened a group of ACE2 agonists by bioinformatics. Glucocorticoids are a type of ACE2 activator. We verified the efficacy of nine chemicals on regulating ACE2 expression in human GES-1, an upper digestive tract epithelial cell line, and THP-1, a human monocyte cell line, and found that several glucocorticoids imparted activating effects on ACE2 in both cell lines. The drugs triciribine and kinetin riboside activate ACE2 expression or inhibit IL-6 production in macrophages to some extent. In addition, we compared the efficacies of several glucocorticoids. Hydrocortisone showed the strongest effect on ACE2 activation, followed by prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone. We retrospectively analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of nine severe or critical patients from a cohort of 90 COVID-19 cases, who received medium to small doses of glucocorticoids from our integrated medical team in Wuhan. Seven out of nine patients revealed significant improvement in clinical parameters and chest CT images. This study provides experimental and clinical evidence that medium-to-low-dose glucocorticoids may play a protective role in the respiratory and digestive systems by activating ACE2 and suppressing cytokine storm.","Xiang, Zhen; Liu, Jialin; Shi, Dake; Chen, Wei; Li, Jun; Yan, Ranlin; Bi, Yufang; Hu, Weiguo; Zhu, Zhenggang; Yu, Yingyan; Yang, Zhitao",Int J Biol Sci,591,5

METHODS: All patients with LM disease (&#8805;50% stenosis) undergoing coronary revascularisation in England between January 1, 2017 and August 19, 2020 were included (n = 22,235), stratified by time-period (pre-COVID: 01/01/2017-29/2/2020; COVID: 1/3/2020-19/8/2020) and revascularisation strategy (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Logistic regression models were performed to examine odds ratio (OR) of 1) receipt of CABG (vs. PCI) and 2) in-hospital and 30-day postprocedural mortality, in the COVID-19 period (vs. pre-COVID). RESULTS: There was a decline of 1,354 LM revascularisation procedures between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 compared with previous years' (2017-2019) averages (-48.8%). An increased utilization of PCI over CABG was observed in the COVID period (receipt of CABG vs. PCI: OR 0.46 [0.39, 0.53] compared with 2017), consistent across all age groups. No difference in adjusted in-hospital or 30-day mortality was observed between pre-COVID and COVID periods for both PCI (odds ratio (OR): 0.72 [0.51. 1.02] and 0.83 [0.62, 1.11], respectively) and CABG (OR 0.98 [0.45, 2.14] and 1.51 [0.77, 2.98], respectively) groups. CONCLUSION: LM revascularisation activity has significantly declined during the COVID period, with a shift towards PCI as the preferred strategy. Postprocedural mortality within each revascularisation group was similar in the pre-COVID and COVID periods, reflecting maintenance in quality of outcomes during the pandemic. Future measures are required to safely restore LM revascularisation activity to pre-COVID levels.","Mohamed, Mohamed O; Curzen, Nick; de Belder, Mark; Goodwin, Andrew T; Spratt, James C; Balacumaraswami, Lognathen; Deanfield, John; Martin, Glen P; Rashid, Muhammad; Shoaib, Ahmad; Gale, Chris P; Kinnaird, Tim; Mamas, Mamas A",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,591,6

OBJECTIVES: To study the risk of COVID-19 infection in the presence of preexisting CV diseases and to describe new CV manifestations during COVID-19. METHODS: A ""scoping review"" was carried out via PubMed, to synthesize the results of research currently published on this subject. RESULTS: Patients with cardiovascular disease were at greater risk of developing COVID-19, especially in its severe form. These patients were five to ten times more at risk of death. Cardiac manifestations, de novo, were dominated by acute myocardial damage, defined by a significant elevation of cardiac troponins. These occurred in 7 to 17% of hospitalized patients. The presence of a new heart lesion in patients with COVID-19 was consistently associated with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Given the enormous cardiovascular challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prognostic impact of heart damage, additional research at a high level of evidence will be necessary.","Yahia, Faten; Zakhama, Lilia; Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed",Tunis Med,591,29

In 2016 epidemics of Zika virus emerged, and in 2020, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections to analyse the evolution of the evidence. METHODS: We annotated publications on Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 that we collected using living evidence databases according to study design. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time. RESULTS: We found 2286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294 (24%). For both infections, there were more epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities in the overall pattern of publications might be generalizable, whereas differences are compatible with differences in the characteristics of a disease. Understanding how evidence accumulates during disease outbreaks helps us understand which types of public health questions we can answer and when.","Ipekci, Aziz Mert; Buitrago-Garcia, Diana; Meili, Kaspar Walter; Krauer, Fabienne; Prajapati, Nirmala; Thapa, Shabnam; Wildisen, Lea; Araujo-Chaveron, Lucia; Baumann, Lukas; Shah, Sanam; Whiteley, Tessa; Solís-García, Gonzalo; Tsotra, Foteini; Zhelyazkov, Ivan; Imeri, Hira; Low, Nicola; Counotte, Michel Jacques",BMC Med Res Methodol,591,20

These variations in preparedness and policy may lead to different death tolls from Covid-19 as well as from other diseases. We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data to estimate the impacts of the pandemic on weekly all-cause mortality for 40 industrialised countries from mid-February 2020 through mid-February 2021, before a large segment of the population was vaccinated in any of these countries. Taken over the entire year, an estimated 1,401,900 (95% credible interval 1,259,700-1,572,500) more people died in these 40 countries than would have been expected had the pandemic not taken place. This is equivalent to 140 (126-157) additional deaths per 100,000 people and a 15% (13-17) increase in deaths over this period in all of these countries combined. In Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, mortality was lower over this period than what would be expected if the pandemic had not occurred, while South Korea and Norway experienced no detectable change in mortality. In contrast, the populations of the USA, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland experienced at least 20% higher mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity across countries in the dynamics of excess mortality. The first wave of the pandemic, from mid-February to the end of May 2020, accounted for over half of excess deaths in Scotland, Spain, England and Wales, Canada, Sweden, Belgium and Netherlands. At the other extreme, the period between mid-September 2020 and mid-February 2021 accounted for over 90% of excess deaths in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Until the great majority of national and global populations have vaccine-acquired immunity, minimising the death toll of the pandemic from Covid-19 and other diseases will remain dependent on actions to delay and contain infections and continue routine health and social care.","Kontis, Vasilis; Bennett, James E; Parks, Robbie M; Rashid, Theo; Pearson-Stuttard, Jonathan; Asaria, Perviz; Zhou, Bin; Guillot, Michel; Mathers, Colin D; Khang, Young-Ho; McKee, Martin; Ezzati, Majid",,591,26

It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. METHODS: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. LIMITATIONS: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports.

METHODS: We conducted telephone interviews with 40 patients to examine how the pandemic affected prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing decisions during the initial months of the pandemic in the United States. An interview guide queried experiences with the ability to access information about prenatal genetic testing options and to utilize the tests when desired. Audio recordings were transcribed and coded using NVivo 12. Analysis was conducted using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: The pandemic did not alter most participants' decisions to undergo prenatal genetic testing. Yet, it did impact how participants viewed the risks and benefits of testing and timing of testing. There was heightened anxiety among those who underwent testing, stemming from the risk of viral exposure and the fear of being alone if pregnancy loss or fetal abnormality was identified at the time of an ultrasound-based procedure. CONCLUSION: The pandemic may impact patients' access and utilization of prenatal genetic tests. More research is needed to determine how best to meet pregnant patients' decision-making needs during this time.","Farrell, Ruth M; Pierce, Madelyn; Collart, Christina; Craighead, Caitlin; Coleridge, Marissa; Chien, Edward K; Perni, Uma; Frankel, Richard; Ranzini, Angela; Edmonds, Brownsyne Tucker; Rose, Susannah S",Prenat. diagn,591,16

However, adsorption of polar functionalities can be induced rapidly by annealing in a polar environment such as glycerol prior to quenching to a glassy state. Blended films of carboxy end-functionalised deuteriopolystyrene (dPS-COOH) with hydrogenous polystyrene (hPS) were annealed at 150 °C under glycerol. Nuclear reaction analysis was used to quantify the surface excess of dPS-COOH retained at the surface after quenching the films to below the glass transition temperature. Incorporation of multiple COOH groups onto a single chain end greatly increases the affinity of these chains to the interface with glycerol. Here we have shown that even a difunctional material, dPS-2COOH, is much more surface active than either the singly functionalised dPS-COOH or the difunctional ester from which it was prepared. Self-consistent mean field theory yielded thermodynamic 'sticking energy' values per functionality at the polystyrene-glycerol surface of 1.3-1.7 for carboxy groups and 0.3 for ester groups.","Narrainen, Amilcar Pillay; Clarke, Nigel; Eggleston, Stuart M; Hutchings, Lian R; Thompson, Richard L",Soft Matter,591,1

Our aim is to determine if the graph filter generating the graph signals is first-order lowpass without knowing the graph topology. Notice that lowpass graph filter is a common prerequisite for applying graph signal processing tools for sampling, denoising, and graph learning. Our method is inspired by the Perron Frobenius theorem, which observes that for first-order lowpass graph filter, the top eigenvector of output covariance would be the only eigenvector with elements of the same sign. Utilizing this observation, we develop a simple detector that answers if a given data set is produced by a first-order lowpass graph filter. We analyze the effects of finite-sample, graph size, observation noise, strength of lowpass filter, on the detector's performance. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data support our findings.","He, Yiran; Wai, Hoi-To",,591,22

We explore the various risk factors associated with this occupational risk, especially focusing on India. This may elucidate lessons to protect these frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'pandemics', 'physicians' 'mortality' and 'health personnel' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and ResearchGate in the month of July 2020 during the current COVID-19 pandemic and assessed mortality data. RESULTS: Mortality in health care professionals has been on the rise. The countries which faced the pandemic in the early months of 2020 have had a huge surge in mortality amongst doctors due to COVID-19. India continues to show a rising trend in COVID-19 cases, however although compared to the western world India has seen a comparatively favourable statistic. Male gender, elderly doctors and those belonging to Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community seem to be predisposing factors in the western world. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has been associated with an increased mortality in doctors and health care workers. Until an effective cure/vaccine is developed, risk assessments at work, mitigating confounding factors, adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and enhanced protection against infection are necessary to protect health care professionals on the coronavirus frontline. Otherwise this occupational risk can lead to further untimely mortality and become another unintended consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Iyengar, Karthikeyan P; Ish, Pranav; Upadhyaya, Gaurav Kumar; Malhotra, Nipun; Vaishya, Raju; Jain, Vijay Kumar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,591,10

Study subjects report an average of 2.70 (SD = 1.77), 3.88 (SD = 2.23), 3.58 (SD = 2.30), and 3.42 (SD = 2.49) hours of television, computer, and smartphone for digital learning use at home, respectively. Researchers analyzed the association between digital screen use and myopic symptoms using statistical tools, and find that every 1 h increase in daily digital screen use is associated with 1.26 OR [Odds Ratio] (95% CI [Confidence Interval: 1.21-1.31, p &lt; 0.001]) higher risks of myopic progression. Using computers (OR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.05-3.12, p = 0.032) and using smartphones (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.19-3.43, p = 0.009) are shown to be associated with higher risks of myopic progression than television use. Results from additional sensitivity tests that included inverse probability weights which accounted for heterogeneous user profile across different device type categories confirm that these findings are robust. In conclusion, this study finds that daily digital screen use is positively associated with prevalence of myopic progression and holds serious vision health implications for adolescents.","Liu, J.; Li, B.

To that end, on a sample of Italian citizens, we implemented a path model to test the impact of health engagement on the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2, and whether this relationship is direct or mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines and the risk perception. Moreover, we tested the configural and weak invariance of the model across gender and three age groups. Results show that health engagement is positively related to the intention to vaccinate and that this relationship is partially mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines.

We report a colorimetric viral detection method based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 endonuclease dead (dCas9) system. In this method, RNA in the viral lysate was directly recognized by the CRISPR/dCas9 system with biotin-protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-presenting oligonucleotide (PAMmer). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase then bound to biotin-PAMmer, inducing a color change through the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. Using the developed method, we successfully identified SARS-CoV-2, pH1N1, and pH1N1/H275Y viruses by the naked eye.

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir reduces hospitalization among high-risk patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Brazil. Recently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 685 patients. Statistical analysis was performed in December 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily for 9 days), lopinavir-ritonavir (loading dose of 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, every 12 hours followed by 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 hours for the next 9 days), or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death assessed at 90 days after randomization. COVID-19-associated hospitalization was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: all-cause hospitalization, viral clearance, symptom resolution, and adverse events. Results: Of 685 participants, 632 (92.3%) self-identified as mixed-race, 377 (55.0%) were women, and the median (range) age was 53 (18-94) years. A total of 214 participants were randomized to hydroxychloroquine; 244, lopinavir-ritonavir; and 227, placebo. At first interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment of both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir groups because of futility. The proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 3.7% (8 participants) in the hydroxychloroquine group, 5.7% (14 participants) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 4.8% (11 participants) in the placebo group. We found no significant differences between interventions for COVID-19-associated hospitalization (hydroxychloroquine: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.30-1.88]; lopinavir-ritonavir: HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.53-2.56] as well as for the secondary outcome of viral clearance through day 14 (hydroxychloroquine: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]; lopinavir-ritonavir: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94-1.16]). At the end of the trial, there were 3 fatalities recorded, 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the lopinavir-ritonavir intervention group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir-ritonavir showed any significant benefit for decreasing COVID-19-associated hospitalization or other secondary clinical outcomes. This trial suggests that expedient clinical trials can be implemented in low-income settings even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The originality of our approach is given by its objective as well as the strategy employed for verifying research hypotheses. The objective is twofold: detecting the indicators that may constitute signals for the vulnerability of countries in times of health crisis and highlighting the underlying factors of the resilience capacity. Many indicators have been considered: six indicators concerning Covid-19 pandemic and 27 socio-economic indicators. Three main hypotheses have been formulated and tested using various statistical methods. Our findings provide deep insights for understanding how Covid-19 crisis is correlated to specific economic (urbanization, sectorial employment, health system) and demographic factors (aging, mortality). The study has succeeded in identifying the pattern of a country with greater resilience and better ability to cope with a health crisis.

Overall, ten SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene sequences retrieved from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) and the GISAID EpiCoV database (Germany) were compared. We analyzed nucleotide variants and amino acid changes using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X and analyzed gene similarity using the LALIGN web server. Interestingly, we revealed several specific mutation sites, however, there were no significant changes in the genetic composition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein genes, when compared to the Wuhan- Hu-1 isolate from China.

We reject the presence of a single pattern of behavior in the evolution of the CI14 across territories. Four statistically different convergence clubs and an additional province (Madrid) with divergent behavior are observed. Provinces with developed agricultural and industrial economic sectors, high mobility, and a high proportion of Central and South American immigrants had the highest level of CI14.

The aerosols and saliva droplets are the main contamination source. Thus, it is crucial to point out that dental practitioners become a high-risk group of contagion by SARS-CoV-2. Based on this, protocols have been recommended to avoid cross-contamination during dental care; however, appropriate evidence has not yet been established. Objective Our study sought to make a screening, by in silico analysis, of the potential of mouth rinses used in dental practices to prevent the dental workers' contamination by SARS-CoV-2. Methodology Multiple sequence comparisons and construction of the phylogenetic tree were conducted using the FASTA code. Therefore, molecular docking investigation between SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Main Protease, Spike Glycoprotein, Non-structure Protein, and Papain-like Protease) and molecules used in dental practices (chlorhexidine digluconate, hydrogen peroxide, cetylpyridinium chloride, povidone-iodine, gallic acid, &#946;-cyclodextrin, catechin, and quercetin) was performed using AutoDock Vina. Moreover, 2D interactions of the complex protein-ligand structure were analyzed by Ligplot+. Results The obtained results showed a remarkable affinity between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and all tested compounds. The chlorhexidine digluconate, catechin, and quercetin presented a higher affinity with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The overall results allowed us to suggest that chlorhexidine is the most suitable active compound in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 salivary load due to its better binding energy.

We propose a definition of essential oral health care that includes urgent and basic oral health care to initiate a broader debate and stakeholder alignment. We argue that oral health care must be part of essential health care provided by any health system. Essential oral health care covers the most prevalent oral health problems through an agreed-on set of safe, quality, and cost-effective interventions at the individual and community level to promote and protect oral health, as well as prevent and treat common oral diseases, including appropriate rehabilitative services, thereby maintaining health, productivity, and quality of life. By default, essential oral health care does not include the full spectrum of possible interventions that contemporary dentistry can provide. On the basis of this definition, we conceptualize a layered model of essential oral health care that integrates urgent and basic oral health care, as well as advanced/specialist oral health care. Finally, we present 3 key reflections on the essentiality of oral health care. First, oral health care must be an integral component of a health care system's essential services, and by implication, oral health care personnel are part of the essential health care workforce. Second, not all dental care is essential oral health care, and not all essential care is also urgent, particularly under the specific risk conditions of the pandemic. Third, there is a need for criteria, evidence, and consensus-building processes to define which dental interventions are to be included in which category of essential oral health care. All stakeholders, including the research, academic, and clinical communities, as well as professional organizations and civil society, need to tackle this aspect in a concerted effort. Such consensus will be crucial for dentistry in view of the Sustainable Development Goal's push for universal health coverage, which must cover essential oral health care.","Benzian, H; Beltrán-Aguilar, E; Mathur, M R; Niederman, R",J Dent Res,591,0

Elective surgeries, visits with general practitioners, and diagnoses of medical emergencies were consequently delayed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of patients admitted to a northern Israeli hospital with common surgical complaints during three periods: the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and a regular period. METHODS: Demographic, medical, laboratory, imaging, intraoperative, and pathological data were collected from electronic medical files of patients who received emergency treatment at the surgery department of a single hospital in northern Israel. We retrospectively compared the characteristics of patients who were admitted with various conditions during three periods. RESULTS: Patients' mean age and most of the clinical parameters assessed were similar between the periods. However, pain was reportedly higher during the COVID-19 than the control period (8.7 vs. 6.4 on a 10-point visual analog scale, P < 0.0001). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War, and the regular period, the mean numbers of patients admitted daily were 1.4, 4.4, and 3.0, respectively. The respective mean times from the onset of symptoms until admission were 3, 1, and 1.5 days, P < 0.001. The respective proportions of surgical interventions for appendiceal disease were 95%, 96%, and 69%; P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a routine period, patients during the COVID-19 outbreak waited longer before turning to hospitalization, and reported more pain at arrival. Patients during both emergency periods were more often treated surgically than non-operatively.","Abu Shakra, Ibrahim; Bez, Maxim; Ganam, Samer; Francis, Rola; Muati, Amir; Bickel, Amitai; Merei, Fahed; Talmi, Ziv; Kamal, Khatib; Kakiashvili, Eli",BMC Surg,591,13

Methods: This study was retrospectively performed at five university teaching hospitals between 1st January 2018 and 31th March 2020. Routine molecular testing using for multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods was conducted on the respiratory viruses. We assessed the demographics, laboratory findings, and treatment of patients infected with coronavirus. Results: There were 807 coronavirus-infected patients from 24,311 patients with respiratory virus PCR test admitted to five hospitals over 27 months. All-cause mortality rates of patients admitted for seasonal HCoV disease were 3.1% in all patients and 10.8% in patients aged ≥18 years. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed in patients aged ≥18 years. After adjusting for other clinical variables, general weakness symptoms [hazard ratio (HR), 2.651;95% confidence interval (CI), 1.147–6.125, P=0.023], National Early Warning Score (NEWS) ≥2 (HR, 5.485;95% CI, 1.261–23.858, P=0.023), and coronavirus subtype OC43 (HR, 2.500;95% CI, 1.060–5.897, P=0.036) were significantly associated with death from coronavirus. Conclusions: Coronavirus infection can reveal a higher mortality rate in patients of ≥18 than those of &lt;18 years, thus, adult patients require more careful treatment. Furthermore, in adult patients, the factors associated with death from coronavirus include general weakness symptoms, NEWS higher than 2, and OC43 subtype.","Kim, T.; Choi, H.; Shin, T.

Because obesity and insulin resistance predispose to thrombotic diseases, we investigated the relationship between hemostatic alterations and body fat distribution in participants at risk for type 2 diabetes. SUBJECTS: Body fat distribution (visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue) and liver fat content of 150 participants - with impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose - were determined using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Participants underwent precise metabolic characterization and major hemostasis parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Procoagulant factors (FII, FVII, FVIII, and FIX) and anticoagulant proteins (antithrombin, protein C, and protein S) were significantly associated with body fat distribution. In patients with fatty liver, fibrinogen (298 mg/dl vs. 264 mg/dl, p = 0.0182), FVII (99% vs. 90%, p = 0.0049), FVIII (114% vs. 90%, p = 0.0098), protein C (124% vs. 111%, p = 0.0006), and protein S (109% vs. 89%, p < 0.0001) were higher than in controls. In contrast, antithrombin (97% vs. 102%, p = 0.0025) was higher in control patients. In multivariate analyses controlling for insulin sensitivity, body fat compartments, and genotype variants (PNPLA3I148MM/MI/TM6SF2E167kK/kE), only protein C and protein S remained significantly increased in fatty liver. CONCLUSIONS: Body fat distribution is significantly associated with alterations of procoagulant and anticoagulant parameters. Liver fat plays a key role in the regulation of protein C and protein S, suggesting a potential counteracting mechanism to the prothrombotic state in subjects with prediabetes and fatty liver.","Hörber, Sebastian; Lehmann, Rainer; Stefan, Norbert; Machann, Jürgen; Birkenfeld, Andreas L; Wagner, Robert; Heni, Martin; Häring, Hans-Ulrich; Fritsche, Andreas; Peter, Andreas",Mol Metab,591,24

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human feces and its passage to sewage system is an emerging concern for public health. Pieces of evidence of the occurrence of viral RNA in feces and municipal wastewater (sewage) systems have not only warned reinforcing the treatment facilities but also suggest that these systems can be monitored to get epidemiological data for checking trend of COVID-19 infection in the community. This review summarizes the occurrence and persistence of novel coronavirus in sewage with an emphasis on the possible water environment contamination. Monitoring of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) via sewage-based epidemiology could deliver promising information regarding rate of infection providing a valid and complementary tool for tracking and diagnosing COVID-19 across communities. Tracking the sewage systems could act as an early warning tool for alerting the public health authorities for necessary actions. Given the impracticality of testing every citizen with limited diagnostic resources, it is imperative that sewage-based epidemiology can be tested as an early warning system.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 raised an extremely serious concern, because its most frequent clinical presentation was pneumonia. Features such as sex play an active role in the incidence and outcomes of pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate differences between sexes concerning COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicentre study that enrolled 340 consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia. Of these patients, 219 were males (64.4%) and 121, females (35.6%). Primary endpoints were differences between both sexes as per clinical features, laboratory and radiologic results, and inhospital and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included differences between both sexes and factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: Males admitted to the COVID-19 Unit were older than females (74.5 ± 15.7 vs. 64.5 ± 11.9). Cardiovascular disorders were more frequent in males (19.17% vs 13.25%), whereas obesity was more common in females (54.5% vs 37.45%). In-hospital and 30-day mortality were higher in males than in females (23.3% vs 15.7%; 24.6% vs 19.8%, respectively). No differences were observed in hospital stay; however, males had a longer ICU stay when compared with females (11.04±5.4 vs 7.05±3.4). Variables associated with a higher mortality rate included older age, a lower number of lymphocytes upon admission and higher levels of ferritin and troponin upon admission. CONCLUSIONS: Males had significantly higher mortality and longer ICU stay than females. More comorbidities in males than in females could explain the difference in mortality rates. The protective role of genetic factors can partially explain the better outcomes observed in female patients with COVID-19.","Banfi, Paolo; Garuti, Giancarlo; Diaz de Teran, Teresa; Ruiz, Juan; Ferraioli, Gianluca; Russo, Giuseppe; Casu, Francesco; Gandolfo, Corinna; Cinque, Enrico; Gallo, Fabrizio; Cilloniz, Catia; Torres, Antoni; Nicolini, Antonello",Panminerva med,591,26

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively analyze the impact of HRQoL between obese patients who underwent surgery and those who were wait-listed. METHODS: Between April 2017 and March 2018, 70 surgical and 69 wait-listed patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12v2 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL-Lite) questionnaires. Sociodemographic-, clinical-, and surgical-related variables were collected. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed, showing similar baseline characteristics but differences in HRQoL. Performing more qualified work improved scores on some aspects of the SF-12 survey. In contrast, women scored worse on the self-esteem domain, and men scored worse on the mental health domain. By group, at the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were found among all aspects of the questionnaires between both groups (P < 0.001) and between baseline and postoperative 12-month follow-up in the surgical group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, scores were lower in all domains in the evolution of wait-listed patients, with statistically significant differences among the Bodily Pain, Emotional Role, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary Domains (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HRQoL is a multimodal concept that allows the identification of factors impacting obese patients' quality of life. It promotes the benefit of surgery against waiting list delays, which can take up to 4 years in our hospital. Therefore, HRQoL is an important pillar to justify more resources for reducing unacceptable surgical delays.","Moreno Gijón, María; Díaz Vico, Tamara; Rodicio Miravalles, José Luis; López-Negrete Cueto, Emilio; Suárez Sánchez, Aida; Amoza Pais, Sonia; Sanz Navarro, Sandra; Valdés Arias, Covadonga; Turienzo Santos, Estrella O; Sanz Álvarez, Lourdes M",Obes. surg,591,16

In this context, a ""One Health"" approach with an integrated multidisciplinary effort involving humans, animals and their surrounding environment is needed to tackle the spread of AMR. One of the most common ways for bacteria to live is to adhere to surfaces and form biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can form biofilm on most surfaces and in a wide heterogeneity of environmental conditions. The biofilm guarantees the survival of the S. aureus in harsh environmental conditions and represents an issue for the food industry and animal production. The identification and characterization of biofilm-related proteins may provide interesting insights into biofilm formation mechanisms in S. aureus. In this regard, the aims of this study were: (i) to use proteomics to compare proteomes of S. aureus growing in planktonic and biofilm forms in order to investigate the common features of biofilm formation properties of different strains; (ii) to identify specific biofilm mechanisms that may be involved in AMR. The proteomic analysis showed 14 differentially expressed proteins among biofilm and planktonic forms of S. aureus. Moreover, three proteins, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, were only differentially expressed in strains classified as high biofilm producers.

This study aimed to illustrate the epidemic COVID-19 growth pattern in Italy by considering the regional differences in disease diffusion during the first 3 mo of the epidemic. METHODS: Official COVID-19 data were obtained from the Italian Civil Protection Department of the Council of Ministers Presidency. The mortality and ICU admission rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated at the regional level and summarized by means of a Bayesian multilevel meta-analysis. Data were retrieved until April 21, 2020. RESULTS: The highest cumulative mortality rates per 100 000 inhabitants were observed in northern Italy, particularly in Lombardia (85.3; 95% credibility intervals [CI], 75.7-94.7). The difference in the mortality rates between northern and southern Italy increased over time, reaching a difference of 67.72 (95% CI, 66-67) cases on April 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Northern Italy showed higher and increasing mortality rates during the first 3 mo of the epidemic. The uncontrolled virus circulation preceding the infection spreading in southern Italy had a considerable impact on system burnout. This experience demonstrates that preparedness against the pandemic is of crucial importance to contain its disruptive effects.","Azzolina, Danila; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Silvestri, Luciano; Prosepe, Ilaria; Berchialla, Paola; Gregori, Dario",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,591,20

Young people living with chronic health conditions face additional challenges including reduced or no face-to-face contact with medical teams, shielding and the increased stressors of being in 'at-risk' groups and social isolation. In a climate of social isolation and disconnectedness, online groups could provide a method of delivering healthcare and support that strengthens social connectedness and reduces isolation. Despite the technology being available, uptake and evidence for online groups is limited. This article shares learnings from a paediatric and adolescent psychology service delivering online groups for young people with chronic health conditions and their healthcare teams. Ideas for how to transfer group process to online platforms are considered, with examples and tips. With sufficient staffing, preparation, thought, creativity and innovation, it is possible for face-to-face groups to successfully be offered online. Caution should be exercised trying to run online groups without these provisions in place, as the safety, comfort and experience of young people could be jeopardised. Further research is needed to better understand group processes online and to consider what is lost and what is gained when comparing online to face-to-face groups.","Flannery, Halina; Portnoy, Sara; Daniildi, Xeni; Kambakara Gedara, Chandrika; Korchak, Gina; Lambert, Danielle; McParland, James; Payne, Lara; Salvo, Tania; Valentino, Charlotte; Christie, Deborah",Arch. dis. child,591,1

Most of these patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to excessive inflammatory response and the ensuing cytokine storm. Anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids can be used to effectively reduce the effect of this cytokine storm and lung damage. However, corticosteroids can have side effects, so simultaneous administration of immunoglobulin (IV-IG) and interferon-beta can help manage treatment using corticosteroids. Therefore, we designed a trial to test our hypothesis that early administration of dexamethasone in combination with IV-IG and interferon-beta can reduce the effect of the cytokine storm in critically ill patients COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase two multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel arms (1:1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: They will be hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who have positive RT-PCR test and have blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) less than 90% and respiratory rate higher than 24 per minute or have involvement of more than 50% of their lung when viewed using computed tomography (CT)-scan. The age range of patients will be 18-70 years old. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: the need for intubation; allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study drug including dexamethasone, IV-IG, and interferon-beta; pregnancy or lactation; known HIV positive or active hepatitis B or C. The study will be conducted in several hospitals of the Golestan province, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The study subjects will be randomly allocated to three treatment arms: two experimental groups (two arms: Intervention 1 and Intervention 2) and one Control Group, which will be matched for age and sex using frequency matching method. Each eligible patient in the control arm will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 based on WHO guidelines and the Ministry of the Health and Medical Education (MOHME) of Iran. Each patient in the Intervention Group 1 will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 and dexamethasone, at the first 24 hours' time of admission. The intervention begins with the administration of dexamethasone based on the SpO2 levels. If the level of SpO2 does not improve after 24 hours, IV-IG (400 mg/kg once daily for 5 days) and interferon-beta (7 doses every other day) will be prescribed along with dexamethasone administration. In Intervention Group 2, the administration of dexamethasone will be started within the first 24 hours' time of admission and will be continued for 48-72 hours and then the SpO2 level will be checked. Then, if the level of SpO2 has not improved after that time, IV-IG and interferon-beta will be prescribed as the same dosage as Group 1. If the percentages of the SpO2 level are between 85 and 90/ 80 and 85/ 75 and 80/ less than 75, the dosages will be 4 mg every 12 hours/ 4 mg every 8 hours/ 8 mg every 12 hours/ 8 mg every 8 hours, respectively. According to the WHO recommendation, all participants will have the best available supportive care with full monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: An increase in the SpO2 level to reach more than 90% in each case, which will be assessed by the oximeter. Secondary: The duration of hospital stays; intubation status and the percentage of patients who are free of mechanical ventilation; the mortality rates during hospitalization and one month after the admission time. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be allocated into either control or intervention groups with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using a computer random number generator to generate a table of random numbers for simple randomization. BLINDING (MASKING): The project's principal investigator (PI) is unblinded. However, the PI will not analyse the data and interpret the results. An unblinded researcher (a pharmacist) will cover the drug's bottles with aluminium foil and prepare them interventions and control drugs in a syringe with a code so that patients are blinded. This person will have no patients contact. The staff and nurses, caring for the patients, will be unblinded for each study group due to the nature of this study. The staff that take outcome measurements will be blinded. The laboratory technicians will also be blinded as well as the statistical team. These study statisticians will have access to coded data and will analyse the data labelled as group X, group Y, and group Z. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size will be 105 critically ill COVID-19 patients, who will be allocated randomly to the three trial arms with 35 patients in each group.

We developed and validated such a model to predict colorectal cancer death within 90, 180 and 365 days after diagnosis. METHODS: Cohort study using linked national cancer and death records. The development population included 27,480 patients diagnosed in England in 2015. The test populations were diagnosed in England in 2016 (n = 26,411) and Wales in 2015-2016 (n = 3814). Predictors were age, gender, socioeconomic status, referral source, performance status, tumour site, TNM stage and treatment intent. Cox regression models were assessed using Brier scores, c-indices and calibration plots. RESULTS: In the development population, 7.4, 11.7 and 17.9% of patients died from colorectal cancer within 90, 180 and 365 days after diagnosis. T4 versus T1 tumour stage had the largest adjusted association with the outcome (HR 4.67; 95% CI: 3.59-6.09). C-indices were 0.873-0.890 (England) and 0.856-0.873 (Wales) in the test populations, indicating excellent separation of predicted risks by outcome status. Models were generally well calibrated. CONCLUSIONS: The model was valid for predicting short-term colorectal cancer mortality.

From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and respond with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARS-CoV2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host. The review also addresses the stages of developments of various vaccines against these viral diseases and the challenges encountered by the researchers during vaccine development.","Dixon, Dalia Cicily Kattiparambil; Ratan, Chameli; Nair, Bhagyalakshmi; Mangalath, Sabitha; Abraham, Rachy; Nath, Lekshmi R",Current protein and peptide science,591,1

The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae. From those, at least 7 coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans. Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms. Those that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of these viral jumps include SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 virus. They are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently discovered coronavirus disease during 2019 (COVID-19).

LoS can vary depending on the patient's ""bed pathway"" - the sequence of transfers of individual patients between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy. METHODS: We obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020. RESULTS: In both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: ""Ward, CC, Ward"", ""Ward, CC"", ""CC"" and ""CC, Ward"". Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days. For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability and feasibility of telemedicine in rhinology cases with a study of outcomes to guide rhinologists on indications of in-office visits. Assessment of patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the rhinology clinic was also investigated. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic charts of all adult patients (>18 years) who were scheduled in the rhinology clinics of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and received a phone call as a part of telemedicine care from April through June 2020. Demographics (including age and gender), diagnosis, plan of treatment, and status of the visit (either new or follow-up) were collected. In addition, we used a special questionnaire to measure the satisfaction rate among patients who received telemedicine services. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were included.

The most common diagnosis among the follow-up cases was chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (n = 130, 38.3%). The satisfaction telephone survey had a total of 41 respondents out of 80 cases selected randomly. Most respondents (83.3%) were satisfied with telemedicine services. CONCLUSION: We conclude that telemedicine proved its effectiveness in the efficient management and screening of rhinology cases during public health emergencies while providing sufficient protection for patients and medical practitioners. Telemedicine as a modality of care during the pandemic faced minor or no opposition given patients' understanding of the importance of social distancing.","Alshareef, Mohammad; Alsaleh, Saad; Albaharna, Hussain; Alghulikah, Abdulrahman; Aloulah, Mohammad; Alroqi, Ahmad; Alromaih, Saud; Alanazy, Fatma H; Al-Dousary, Surayie",Am J Otolaryngol,591,20

In addition to diffusion-weighted imaging, MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted images, high-resolution vascular black blood sequences (in 34 cases) were used to investigate the vasculature of the brain. RESULTS: In 29 out of 34 patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy (85%) with high-resolution vessel wall imaging, we found a circular enhancement and thickening of the basilar and vertebral arteries, without any correlation with ischemia or microbleeds (reported in 21% and 59%, respectively). CONCLUSION: We report a high prevalence of vascular changes suggestive of endotheliitis as reported in other organs. This could suggest an inflammatory mechanism underlying this encephalopathy.","Uginet, Marjolaine; Breville, Gautier; Hofmeister, Jérémy; Machi, Paolo; Lalive, Patrice H; Rosi, Andrea; Fitsiori, Aikaterini; Vargas, Maria Isabel; Assal, Frederic; Allali, Gilles; Lovblad, Karl-Olof","Clin. neuroradiol.

Few existing targeted medications are available. Lianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule, a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product, has been proven effective for influenza. PURPOSE: To determine the safety and efficacy of LH capsule in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19. Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery. RESULTS: We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set. The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.022). The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001). Time to recovery of fever (2 vs. 3 days), fatigue (3 vs. 6 days) and coughing (7 vs. 10 days) was also significantly shorter in treatment group (all p < 0.001). The rate of improvement in chest computed tomographic manifestations (83.8% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.001) and clinical cure (78.9% vs. 66.2%, p = 0.017) was also higher in treatment group. However, both groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings (both p > 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported.

An Analysis of the European Court of Human Rights' Practice in Light of the Ukrainian Experience,16.907038,1.8699809,2020,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with an evolving understanding of its clinical manifestations, complications, and therapeutic implications. Thromboembolic disease and coagulopathy are common and have been seen in COVID-19 patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens had been reported in previous cases associated with malignancy which is a known cause of a procoagulable state. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may also induce a procoagulable state and be associated with PCD. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man presented with a painful, swollen limb and gangrene, findings consistent with a diagnosis of PCD due to venous thrombosis. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection after a nasopharyngeal swab sample using the XPRSARS-COV2-10 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kit. He had bilateral leg swelling with a gangrenous left fourth digit in the presence of a palpable peripheral pulse. His venous duplex showed bilateral acute deep venous thrombosis, whereas his arterial Doppler scan was normal and his skin biopsy was negative for vasculitis. One of our screening blood tests was suggestive of an antiphospholipid-like syndrome. These clinical and radiologic findings were consistent with PCD. This patient was promptly anticoagulated; other supportive treatments were also initiated. He had a significant resolution of his pedal swelling with the associated revitalization of his previously gangrenous toe. CONCLUSIONS This case report shows the importance of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who present with unusual thrombotic symptoms and signs and highlights the potential severity of these thrombotic complications.","Bamgboje, Abayomi; Hong, Jungrak; Mushiyev, Savi; Pekler, Gerald",Am J Case Rep,591,10

We evaluated the association between RAAS inhibitor use and outcomes of Covid-19. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational cohort study that used data based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19 tested cases and the history of medical service use in these patients for the past five years. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the rate of ventilator care was compared between the groups. RESULTS: From a total of 7,590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on RAAS inhibitors prescribed within 6 months before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 1,111 patients was prescribed RAAS inhibitors, and 794 patients were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, excluding RAAS inhibitors. In propensity-score matched analysis, 666 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the RAAS inhibitor group showed no significant difference compared with the non-RAAS inhibitor group (14.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.15; p = 0.22). The rate of ventilator care was not significantly different between the two groups (4.4% vs. 4.1%; HR, 1.04; 95%CI, 0.60-1.79; p = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: RAAS inhibitor treatment did not appear to increase the mortality of Covid-19 patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs, suggesting that they may be safely continued in Covid-19 patients.","Park, Jungchan; Lee, Seung-Hwa; You, Seng Chan; Kim, Jinseob; Yang, Kwangmo",PLoS One,591,22

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all patients 15 years or younger who were admitted to the trauma centre at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from January 2000 to May 2014. Injury severity was calculated using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine significant differences between sexes. RESULTS: A total of 880 children (499 boys and 391 girls) were included. No significant sex-related differences were observed in the numbers admitted during the study period, age at admission or severity of injuries. Overall, 30% of the paediatric patients were admitted in the afternoon (3-6 p.m.). The crude death rate was 2.7% of all admissions. Traffic accidents accounted for 48% of all admissions and two-thirds of all deaths. All non-survivors received ISSs of 16 or higher, and 20% of deaths in this group and 42% of overall deaths occurred within the first 24 hours.

This ban, which includes family members, has been criticized for being unfair, unhealthy, and unsafe. Against this backdrop, I examine the roles family play in residents' daily lives and care routines. I argue that classifying family as ""visitors"" rather than essential care partners overlooks their critical contributions and stems from taken-for-granted assumption about gender, families, and care work, and I demonstrate why families are more than visitors. Policies that ban family visits also reflect a narrow understanding of health that focuses on mitigating infection risk, but neglects overall health and well-being. This policy further stems from a limited comprehension of care relations. Research shows that banning family visits has negative consequences for residents, but also families themselves, and direct care workers. I argue that identifying ways to better understand and support family involvement is essential and demonstrate the utility of the Convoys of Care model for guiding the reconceptualization of family in long-term care research, policy, and practice during and beyond the pandemic.","Kemp, Candace L",GerontologistGerontologist,591,24

This process is usually performed through active chemicals substances with high toxicity, and new decontamination technologies that do not leave residues have been currently used, such as UV-C light. Thus, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a portable UV-C light device on the viability of standard pathogenic strains and other microorganisms isolated from different surfaces of a public health hospital. METHODS: In vitro decontamination was performed by applying Biosept Home© UV-C to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica and Candida albicans. In real conditions, the application was made on different surfaces of a hospital. The device used in the experiment haa a 254 nm UV-C light and a radiation intensity of 45.6 mW/cm2 over a distance of 1 cm from the surfaces. The light dose was 0.912 J/cm2 for 20 s of application in both conditions (in vitro and hospital). RESULTS: After in vitro decontamination with UV-C light no bacterial growth was observed, demonstrating 100 % of bacterial inactivation under the conditions tested. Additionally, there was a reduction of approximately 4 logs for the yeast C. albicans. In all hospital surfaces, the number of colonies of microorganisms was significantly reduced after the procedure. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Biosept Home© UV-C is efficient and constitutes a promosing intervention for disinfection protocols in hospitals and clinics.","Santos, Tamires Dos; de Castro, Lívia Furquim",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,591,28

Despite this, dietary exposures to glyphosate are considered low in comparison to application-related exposures. Although previous studies have evaluated exposure to horticultural and agricultural workers, to date only one study, which we recently conducted, has characterized exposure to glyphosate in consumers following heavy residential application of a glyphosate-containing herbicide in a residential yard and garden setting. In this previous study, we demonstrated that urinary glyphosate concentrations in these applicators were similar to or in some circumstances greater than those in occupational applicators, likely due to the nature of the simulation study, which ensured a heavy application protocol. However, it is unknown whether these urinary glyphosate concentrations in consumer applicators correspond to internal doses that may be of concern. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive risk assessment of glyphosate exposure in consumer applicators using a margin of safety approach. Here, we incorporated data collected from multiple spot urine samples across time from our previous study that assessed consumer exposure to glyphosate from Roundup® application. Estimated internal doses, even with the use of conservative assumptions across unique approaches, were below internal doses estimated from established health-based guidance values. Overall, this study demonstrates that glyphosate exposure from even heavy consumer application of a commercially available glyphosate-containing herbicide does not appear to be a health concern.","Kougias, Daniel G; Miller, Eric; McEwen, Abigail; Reamer, Heidi; Kovochich, Michael; Pierce, Jennifer",Risk anal,591,1

We used baseline data from Engage, a cohort of GBM recruited by respondent-driven sampling, to examine patterns of combination HIV prevention use among Montreal GBM since PrEP became available. Latent class analysis, stratified by HIV status, was used to categorize GBM by self-reported use of biomedical and behavioural prevention strategies. Correlates of resulting classes were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Among HIV-negative/unknown GBM (n = 968), we identified four classes: low use of prevention (32%), condoms (40%), seroadaptive behaviour (21%), and biomedical (including PrEP; 7%). Those using prevention (condoms, seroadaptive behaviour, and biomedical) had a higher number of anal sex partners and were more likely to report a recent sexually transmitted infection diagnosis. GBM using biomedical prevention also had a higher level of formal education. Among GBM living with HIV (n = 200), we identified three classes: mainly antiretroviral treatment (ART) with viral suppression (53%), ART with viral suppression and condoms (19%), and ART with viral suppression and seroadaptive behaviour (18%). Again, the number of anal sex partners was higher among those using condoms and seroadaptive behaviours. Our findings show antiretroviral-based prevention, either alone or in combination with other strategies, is clearly a component of the HIV prevention landscape for GBM in Montreal. Nevertheless, PrEP uptake remains low, and there is a need to promote its availability more widely.","Doyle, Carla M; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Lambert, Gilles; Mishra, Sharmistha; Apelian, Herak; Messier-Peet, Marc; Otis, Joanne; Grace, Daniel; Hart, Trevor A; Moore, David M; Lachowsky, Nathan J; Cox, Joseph",AIDS behav,591,1

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. METHODS: Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe, and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. RESULTS: Levels of 14 cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IFN-Î³-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, hepatocyte growth factor, monokine-induced gamma IFN, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the 5 cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome. Furthermore, IFN-Î³-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 were excellent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of the 2 cytokines showed the biggest area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristics calculations with a value of 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report biomarkers that are highly associated with disease severity and progression of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of CLABSIs and CAUTIs in 78 US 12 months before COVID-19 and 6 months during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the 2 study periods, there were 795,022 central-line days and 817,267 urinary catheter days. Compared to the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, CLABSI rates increased by 51.0% during the pandemic period from 0.56 to 0.85 per 1,000 line days (P < .001) and by 62.9% from 1.00 to 1.64 per 10,000 patient days (P < .001). Hospitals with monthly COVID-19 patients representing >10% of admissions had a National Health Safety Network (NHSN) device standardized infection ratio for CLABSI that was 2.38 times higher than hospitals with <5% prevalence during the pandemic period (P = .004).

Herein we report a Japanese patient with iMCD with a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene. METHODS: We performed genetic analysis via targeted next-generation sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing and conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the hydrophobic interactions around the 729th amino acid in human pyrin. RESULTS: In February 2011, a 59-year-old man was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease at our department based on the findings of cervical and hilar lymphadenopathies, typical lung lesions and cervical lymph node biopsy. The patient was followed up without treatment, as he was asymptomatic. However, he had been experiencing prolonged fatigue and fever with high levels of CRP since June 2017. Axillary lymph node biopsy findings led to the diagnosis of iMCD. He was successfully treated with an IL-6 inhibitor and has been in remission for 12 months. Genetic analyses for hereditary autoinflammatory disease-related genes were performed, revealing a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the MEFV gene. We identified that this novel mutation significantly altered the local interaction of the human pyrin B30.2 domain by molecular dynamics simulation analysis and experimentally had the potential for inflammasome activation with increased inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: The abnormal function of pyrin due to a mutation in the MEFV gene in this patient may have contributed to the development of MCD by inducing IL-6 production via inflammasome signalling.","Endo, Yushiro; Koga, Tomohiro; Otaki, Hiroki; Sasaki, Daisuke; Sumiyoshi, Remi; Furukawa, Kaori; Tanaka, Yoshimasa; Katsunori, Yanagihara; Kawakami, Atsushi",Rheumatology (Oxford),591,14

RESULTS: The examined websites provide information about COVID-19, but only rarely about how to behave in the case of another (suspected) disease regarding healthcare utilization. Two health information provider portals, one health insurance company, but none of the KVs offer explicit decision support. KVs refer more often, but not consistently, to the general possibility of video consulting. DISCUSSION: Information concerning the topic is scarce for most of the patients.

Established cancer referral pathways were modified in response to reduced diagnostic availability. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer referral, presentation and stage. METHODS: This was a single centre, retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary referral centre. Patients diagnosed and managed with colorectal adenocarcinoma between January and December 2020 were compared with patients from 2018 and 2019 in terms of demographics, mode of presentation and pathological cancer staging. RESULTS: In all, 272 patients were diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma during 2020 compared with 282 in 2019 and 257 in 2018. Patients in all years were comparable for age, gender and tumour location (P > 0.05). There was a significant decrease in urgent suspected cancer referrals, diagnostic colonoscopy and radiological imaging performed between March and June 2020 compared with previous years. More patients presented as emergencies (P = 0.03) with increased rates of large bowel obstruction in 2020 compared with 2018-2019 (P = 0.01). The distribution of TNM grade was similar across the 3 years but more T4 cancers were diagnosed in 2020 versus 2018-2019 (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a relatively short-term impact on the colorectal cancer referral pathway can have significant consequences on patient presentation leading to higher risk emergency presentation and surgery at a more advanced stage. It is therefore critical that efforts are made to make this pathway more robust to minimize the impact of other future adverse events and to consolidate the benefits of earlier diagnosis and treatment.","Shinkwin, Michael; Silva, Louise; Vogel, Irene; Reeves, Nicola; Cornish, Julie; Horwood, James; Davies, Michael M; Torkington, Jared; Ansell, James",Colorectal dis,591,23

However, there are currently few publications that provide information on this issue. We pooled the information available on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, with and without disease-modifying therapy. DEVELOPMENT: The study consisted in a literature search focused on the types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the current status of their approval, and the data available on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis, including the new COVID-19 vaccines. Based on this search, the document has been designed taking into account current evidence and expert recommendations. There are no data on the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, evidence does exist to suggest that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are as safe in these patients as in other individuals. Some therapies with immunosuppressants might reduce the effectiveness of these vaccines and require the scheduling of their administration, preferably before the start of treatment if possible. CONCLUSION: The data available make it possible to recommend mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients on fingolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab, vaccination prior to the initiation of medication administration would be recommendable whenever possible.","Costa Frossard-França, L; García-Domínguez, J M; Moreno-Torres, I; Fortún, J; Villar, L M; Meca-Lallana, V",Rev Neurol,591,25

Limited information exists about determinants of its fatality worldwide. Thus, this ecological study examined the association of various predictors with Covid-19 fatality. Methods: International data bases of Covid-19 statistics and health metrics available primarily at WHO were reviewed to collect information for 113 countries. The dependent variable was Covid-19 case fatality rate. Independent variables were demographic, social, clinical, economic, heath care and child health factors. Results: Case fatality rate of Covid-19 varies across countries with an average of 4.2 +/- 3.8%, and about half of countries had fatality rate &gt;3.2% (median). Significant relationships were observed between Covid-19 fatality rate and socio-economic, clinical, and health variables at the unadjusted regression analysis. At the multivariate adjusted model, percentage of population with age&gt;60 years was positively associated with Covid-19 fatality (B = 0.032, p = 0.005), while Polio-3 immunization at 1-year old was inversely related (B = -0.057, p = 0.017). Conclusions: This ecological investigation highlights the higher risk of death among elderly with Covid-19 pandemic and suggests that Polio-3 immunization coverage among 1-year-olds may be associated with better survival. Future research is warranted to validate these findings.","Alshogran, O. Y.; Altawalbeh, S. M.; Al-Azzam, S. I.; Karasneh, R.",Annals of Medicine &amp; Surgery,591,24

These movements yield abrupt luminance changes on the retina, which elicit robust neural discharges at fixation onsets. Yet little is known about the spatial content of saccade transients. Here, we show that saccades redistribute spatial information within the temporal range of retinal sensitivity following two distinct regimes: saccade modulations counterbalance (whiten) the spectral density of natural scenes at low spatial frequencies and follow the external power distribution at higher frequencies. This redistribution is a consequence of saccade dynamics, particularly the speed/amplitude/duration relation known as the main sequence. It resembles the redistribution resulting from inter-saccadic eye drifts, revealing a continuum in the modulations given by different eye movements, with oculomotor transitions primarily acting by regulating the bandwidth of whitening. Our findings suggest important computational roles for saccade transients in the establishment of spatial representations and lead to testable predictions about their consequences for visual functions and encoding mechanisms.","Mostofi, Naghmeh; Zhao, Zhetuo; Intoy, Janis; Boi, Marco; Victor, Jonathan D; Rucci, Michele",Curr. biol,591,16

HP typically remains asymptomatic, however complications such as acute pancreatitis can arise. Gastrointestinal involvement with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not uncommon and there are reported cases of associated pancreatitis.Case presentationA 31-year-old male presented to the Emergency department (ED) with a 3-day history of right iliac fossa pain. The patient was found to have COVID-19 and a planned laparoscopic appendectomy was later converted to a midline laparotomy when a mass close to the duodeno-jejunal (DJ) flexure was identified. Following a hand-sewn anastomosis the patient made a good post-operative recovery. Histology illustrated the presence of heterotopic pancreatic tissue within the small bowel with underlying fat necrosis typical of acute pancreatitis. Follow-up radiology supported the intraoperative finding of intestinal malrotation.Clinical DiscussionRarely the combined presence of intestinal malrotation and HP in patients has been noted. Heterotopic pancreatitis can present in a multitude of ways and it is a difficult diagnosis to make pre-operatively. Emerging literature documents the potential presentation of COVID-19 with acute pancreatitis. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the pancreas is believed to play a role. Conclusion: This is the first documented case of heterotopic pancreatitis with intestinal malrotation in a COVID-19 positive patient. We hypothesise that the COVID-19 infection contributed to the heterotopic pancreatitis.","Tomasi, Ivan; Scott, Luca; Cullen, Jack; di Maggio, Francesco; Ebied, Husam; Wheatstone, Sarah",Int J Surg Case Rep,591,1

This study as a part of ECEALHBA's Project, reports the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic over 2020-21 bronchiolitis epidemic period in the Central and Eastern regions of Spain. METHOD: Multicenter, observational, descriptive and ambispective study of admitted infants with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis in 16 Spanish hospitals involved in the investigation project. Five epidemic periods previous to COVID-19 pandemic, from 2015 to 2020, were compared with the current one, 2020-21, in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. RESULTS: Total of 4,643 infants were admitted to the participating hospitals along the study period. Pandemic season hospital admissions for bronchiolitis were 94.1% lower than in pre-pandemic period. December and January were peak months for bronchiolitis admissions during pre-pandemic period, but September was the peak month during pandemic year. There was a progressive decrease of admissions from this moment until the end of the follow up, in April 2021. Rhinovirus has been the commonest etiology for bronchiolitis in 2020-21 epidemic period of bronchiolitis. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the non-pharmaceutical interventions initiated because of COVID-19 pandemic are probably related to the dramatic decrease of bronchiolitis cases in 2020-21 season. It would be rewarding to purpose novel research to clarify how these simple interventions can be useful, close to vaccines and antiviral drugs, to achieve the goal of avoiding the spread of respiratory viruses in pediatric population.","Rius-Peris, Juan Manuel; Lucas-García, Jesús; García-Peris, Mónica; Tomás, Pascual Escrivá; Manuel Sequí-Canet, José; de Dios, Javier González",An. pediatr.

Biolubrication gets impaired due to diseases such as osteoarthritis, in which cartilage damage results from alterations in synovial fluid and lamina splendens composition. Osteoarthritis is treated with hyaluronic acid (HA) orally or via intra-articular injection, but due to the poor adsorption of HA on the cartilage surface in the absence of adhesive molecules, pain relief is temporary. Here, we describe how natural lubrication on degraded cartilage surface can be restored with the help of a bioinspired mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan catechol (Chi-C). Quartz crystal microbalance was used to mimic the formation of lamina splendens in vitro, known as synovial fluid conditioning films (SyCF), and colloidal probe atomic force microscopy was used to measure their nanoscale frictional properties. Clear evidence of glycoprotein (PRG4) recruitment by Chi-C increased the softness of SyCF, which also improved nanoscale lubrication in vitro, decreasing the friction coefficient from 0.06 to 0.03. At the macroscale, cartilage damage induced by Chondroitinase ABC increased the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.07â¯±â¯0.04 (healthy tissue) to 0.15â¯±â¯0.03 (after tissue damage) in the presence of synovial fluid after sliding for 50â¯min. After Chi-C treatment of damaged cartilage, the COF fell to 0.06â¯±â¯0.03, which is comparable to healthy cartilage. Chi-C did not adversely affect the metabolic activity of human chondrocytes. This study provides new key insight into the potential for restoring biolubrication through the use of muco-adhesive molecules.","Wan, Hongping; Ren, Ke; Kaper, Hans J; Sharma, Prashant K",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,591,30

It has already been over a century post-the Spanish Flu pandemic, and we are witnessing a new type of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for Covid-19. It emerged from the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and within a few months, the virus propagated itself globally now resulting more than 50 million cases with over 1 million deaths. The high infection rates coupled with dynamic population movement demands for tools, especially within a Brazilian context, that will support health managers to develop policies for controlling and combating the new virus. Methods: In this work, we propose a tool for real-time spatio-temporal analysis using a machine learning approach. The COVID-SGIS system brings together routinely collected health data on Covid-19 distributed across public health systems in Brazil, as well as taking to under consideration the geographic and time-dependent features of Covid-19 so as to make spatio-temporal predictions. The data are sub-divided by federative unit and municipality. In our case study, we made spatio-temporal predictions of the distribution of cases and deaths in Brazil and in each federative unit. Four regression methods were investigated: linear regression, support vector machines (polynomial kernels and RBF), multilayer perceptrons, and random forests. We use the percentage RMSE and the correlation coefficient as quality metrics. Results: For qualitative evaluation, we made spatio-temporal predictions for the period from 25 to 27 May 2020. Considering qualitatively and quantitatively the case of the State of Pernambuco and Brazil as a whole, linear regression presented the best prediction results (thematic maps with good data distribution, correlation coefficient >0.99 and RMSE (%) <4% for Pernambuco and around 5% for Brazil) with low training time: [0.00; 0.04 ms], CI 95%. Conclusion: Spatio-temporal analysis provided a broader assessment of those in the regions where the accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 were concentrated. It was possible to differentiate in the thematic maps the regions with the highest concentration of cases from the regions with low concentration and regions in the transition range. This approach is fundamental to support health managers and epidemiologists to elaborate policies and plans to control the Covid-19 pandemics.","da Silva, Cecilia Cordeiro; de Lima, Clarisse Lins; da Silva, Ana Clara Gomes; Silva, Eduardo Luiz; Marques, Gabriel Souza; de Araújo, Lucas Job Brito; Albuquerque Júnior, Luiz Antônio; de Souza, Samuel Barbosa Jatobá; de Santana, Maíra Araújo; Gomes, Juliana Carneiro; Barbosa, Valter Augusto de Freitas; Musah, Anwar; Kostkova, Patty; Dos Santos, Wellington Pinheiro; da Silva Filho, Abel Guilhermino",Front Public Health,591,24

Although displaying a wide variety of shapes and sizes, they are all composed of nucleic acid encapsulated into a protein capsid. After virions enter the host cell, they replicate to produce multiple copies of themselves. They then lyse the host, releasing virions to infect new cells. The high proliferation rate of viruses is the underlying cause of their fast transmission among living species. Although many viruses are harmless, some of them are responsible for severe diseases such as AIDS, viral hepatitis, and flu. Traditionally, electron microscopy is used to identify and characterize viruses. This approach is time- and labor-consuming, which is problematic upon pandemic proliferation of previously unknown viruses, such as H1N1 and COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrate a novel diagnosis approach for label-free identification and structural characterization of individual viruses that is based on a combination of nanoscale Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Using atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy, we were able to probe structural organization of the virions of Herpes Simplex Type 1 viruses and bacteriophage MS2. We also showed that tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) could be used to reveal protein secondary structure and amino acid composition of the virus surface. Our results show that AFM-IR and TERS provide different but complementary information about the structure of complex biological specimens. This structural information can be used for fast and reliable identification of viruses. This nanoscale bimodal imaging approach can be also used to investigate the origin of viral polymorphism and study mechanisms of virion assembly.","Dou, Tianyi; Li, Zhandong; Zhang, Junjie; Evilevitch, Alex; Kurouski, Dmitry",Anal Chem,591,5

This fact can be a potential threat to all athletes using these supplements, and therefore, there is of increased interest in the implementation of rapid methods for the detection of AAS. The presented study describes the development of an immunostrip test for the detection of multiple 17α-methylated AAS based on direct and indirect competitive principle using gold nanoparticles as a label. As a capture reagent on test lines conjugated stanazolol to rabbit serum albumin (RSA/ST-3) was used, the intensity of color formed in the test line of the AAS-positive sample was visually distinguishable from that of negative sample within 10 min. The optimized closed direct and indirect format of the test provided a similar visual detection limit (0.7 and 0.9 ng/mL, respectively). The most commonly orally abused AAS (17α-methyltestosterone, methandienone, methyldihydrotestosterone, oxandrolone and oxymetholone) showed a strong cross-reaction. Developed immunostrips were successfully applied to analysis of artificially contaminated dietary supplements with 17α-methylated AASs. The developed immunostrips offer potential as a useful user-friendly method for capturing suspicious dietary supplement samples with different contents of AAS at levels far below the usually used concentrations of AAS.","Holubová, Barbora Kubešová Pavla Huml Lukáš Vlach Miroslav Lapčík Oldřich Jurášek Michal Fukal Ladislav",Foods,591,24

However, there is a lack of consensus in favor of or against NRS use due to the risks of worsening hypoxemia, intubation delay, and aerosols environmental contamination associated with the use of these tools. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the use of NRS in adult patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia (i.e. H1N1, SARS, MERS) and AHRF. We also searched for studies evaluating the risk of aerosolization/contamination with these tools. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed EMBASE and two major preprint servers (biorXiv and medRxiv) from inception to April 14, 2020, for studies on the use of respiratory support in AHRF and viral pneumonia. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The search identified 4086 records and we found only one randomized controlled trial out of 58 studies included, with great variabilities in support utilization and failure rates. Fifteen studies explored the issue of aerosolization/contamination showing a high risk of airborne transmission via droplets generation during the use of these modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NRS and treatment failure in the context of COVID-19 and viral infection associated-AHRF, varied widely. Dispersion of exhaled air is different depending on the type of respiratory therapies and interfaces.

While impacts on mortality and, to some extent, short-term migration flows are beginning to be documented, it is too early to measure actual consequences for family demography. To gain insight into potential future consequences of the lockdown for family demography, we use cross-national Google Trends search data to explore whether trends in searches for words related to fertility, relationship formation, and relationship dissolution changed following lockdowns compared to average, pre-lockdown levels in Europe and the United States. Because lockdowns were not widely anticipated or simultaneous in timing or intensity, we exploit variability over time and between countries (and U.S. states). We use a panel event-study design and difference-in-differences methods, and account for seasonal trends and average country-level (or state-level) differences in searches. We find statistically significant impacts of lockdown timing on changes in searches for terms such as wedding and those related to condom use, emergency contraception, pregnancy tests, and abortion, but little evidence of changes in searches related to fertility. Impacts for union formation and dissolution tended to only be statistically significant at the start of a lockdown with a return to average-levels about 2 to 3 months after lockdown initiation, particularly in Europe. Compared to Europe, returns to average search levels were less evident for the U.S., even 2 to 3 months after lockdowns were introduced. This may be due to the fact, in the U.S., health and social policy responses were less demarcated than in Europe, such that economic uncertainty was likely of larger magnitude. Such pandemic-related economic uncertainty may therefore have the potential to slightly increase already existing polarization in family formation behaviours in the U.S. Alongside contributing to the wider literature on economic uncertainty and family behaviors, this paper also proposes strategies for efficient use of Google Trends data, such as making relative comparisons and testing sensitivity to outliers, and provides a template and cautions for their use in demographic research when actual demographic trends data are not yet available.","Berger, Lawrence M; Ferrari, Giulia; Leturcq, Marion; Panico, Lidia; Solaz, Anne",PLoS One,591,21

The proportion of New Zealand European paediatric presentations during lockdown increased by 6.09% (P = 0.01), while Pacific peoples decreased by 3.36% (P = 0.005). The proportion of <1-year-old presentations increased by 5.56% (P = 0.001), while 11-15 years decreased by 7.91% (P = 0.0001). Respiratory-related paediatric presentations decreased by 30% and proportional decreased by 4.92% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study has identified a significant reduction in paediatric presentations to a tertiary emergency department in New Zealand during the national Alert Level 4 Lockdown for COVID-19. The proportional increase in the <1-year-old group may suggest a greater need for community-based child health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health support services may also need to adapt and expand to provide adequate psychological support for children during this crisis. Recognising the needs of these vulnerable groups will be critical during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in addition to informing response plans for similar events in the future.","Bothara, Roshit K; Raina, Aditya; Carne, Brennan; Walls, Tony; McCombie, Andrew; Ardagh, Michael W; Joyce, Laura R",J. paediatr. child health,591,16

However, it is unclear whether gist-like representations reflect a loss of detail through degradation or the blending of experiences into statistical averages, and whether the strength of these representations increases, decreases, or remains stable over time. We report three behavioral experiments that address these questions by examining distributional learning during spatial navigation. In Experiment 1, human subjects navigated a virtual maze to find hidden objects with locations varying according to spatial distributions. After 15 minutes, 1 day, 7 days, or 28 days, we tested their navigation performance and explicit memory. In Experiment 2, we created spatial distributions with no object at their mean locations, thereby disentangling learned object exemplars from statistical averages. In Experiment 3, we created only a single, bimodal distribution to avoid possible confusion between distributions and administered tests after 15 minutes or 28 days. Across all experiments, and for both navigation and explicit tests, representations of the spatial distributions were present soon after exposure, but then receded over time. These findings suggest gist-like representations do not improve over time, helping to clarify the temporal dynamics of consolidation in human learning and memory.

An online survey was performed to assess the prevalence of pandemic-related emotional burden, mental health disorders and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers of children and adolescents with diabetes under the age of 18 and caregivers of youth without diabetes for the non-diabetes group were invited to participate. For the primary outcome, mental health disorders were evaluated using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), while pandemic-related emotional burden and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care were evaluated in different domains with specific questions. For analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy was performed. A total of 764 participants were included in the study. Regarding the pandemic period, caregivers of youth with type 1 diabetes endorsed significantly more pandemic-related emotional burden for both themselves (OR 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.53) and for their child (OR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.38) when compared to the non-diabetes group. The emotional burden evaluation on different age ranges showed that the two groups were similar when the dependent youth was younger than 6 years. Moreover, a positive screening for mental health disorders during social distancing was higher in the diabetes group compared to the non-diabetes group (OR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.70 to 3.47), particularly in those aged under 12 years old. There was no difference between groups in mental health disorders among caregivers of adolescents older than 12 years. Our results allow to conclude that concern, burden and mental health disorders can be present in caregivers of youth with diabetes, and behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may enhance this situation.","Alessi, Janine; de Oliveira, Giovana Berger; Feiden, Gabriela; Schaan, Beatriz D; Telo, Gabriela Heiden",Sci Rep,591,20

Due to the severe pneumonia infiltration, the patient received the clinical-trial treatment Remdesivir. In addition to facing the isolation and new-drug-related anxieties of the patient, the medical team faced difficulties in communicating effectively with the patient and in helping him through the isolation period. During the period of hospitalization (March 14th to April 13th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform a nursing assessment, which confirmed that the patient faced the following problems: (1) ineffective breathing pattern related to COVID-19, (2) impaired verbal communication related to hearing impairment, and (3) social isolation related to the isolation experience and the communication barrier with healthcare workers. During the nursing care process, the author helped the patient receive the antiviral treatment and taught him how to do diaphragmatic breathing in a comfortable, recumbent position to improve his breathing pattern. To reduce the difficulty of communication, the author made a pile of cards with common care-related words, provided pen and paper to write, and used a mobile-phone-based social-networking application to communicate with the patient. The author used writing to communicate with the patient and learned some simple signs from him to enable interaction. Moreover, the intervention helped him adapt to the isolation and treatment protocols to reach holistic nursing care. Based on this experience, the author suggests that hospitals cooperate with sign language organizations to teach healthcare workers simple communication skills, including sign language and cards to provide more complete care for patients with hearing loss during hospitalization.","Chen, Cheng-Hsuan; Pan, Mei-Yan; Liu, Hsiu-Yun",Hu Li Za Zhi,591,7

Digital health information technologies can be applied in three aspects, namely digital patients, digital devices, and digital clinics, and could be useful in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Recent reviews have examined the role of digital health in controlling COVID-19 to identify the potential of digital health interventions to fight the disease. However, this study aims to review and analyze the digital technology that is being applied to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. METHODS: For this review, the Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched in August 2020 to retrieve publications from December 2019 to March 15, 2020. Furthermore, the Google search engine was used to identify additional applications of digital health for COVID-19 pandemic control. RESULTS: We included 32 papers in this review that reported 37 digital health applications for COVID-19 control. The most common digital health projects to address COVID-19 were telemedicine visits (11/37, 30%). Digital learning packages for informing people about the disease, geographic information systems and quick response code applications for real-time case tracking, and cloud- or mobile-based systems for self-care and patient tracking were in the second rank of digital tool applications (all 7/37, 19%). The projects were deployed in various European countries and in the United States, Australia, and China. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the potential of available information technologies worldwide in the 21st century, particularly in developed countries, it appears that more digital health products with a higher level of intelligence capability remain to be applied for the management of pandemics and health-related crises.","R Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh; Bahaadinbeigy, Kambiz; Deldar, Kolsoum; Gholamzadeh, Marsa; Hajesmaeel-Gohari, Sadrieh; Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mohammad",J Med Internet Res,591,16

A cross-sectional study,16.634764,10.374631,2020,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have highlighted the increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 for health-care workers and suggest that oral health-care workers may carry the greatest risk. Considering the transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a similar increased risk can be hypothesized for other respiratory infections. However, no study has specifically assessed the risk of contracting COVID-19 within the dental profession. METHODS: An online survey was conducted within a population of French dental professionals between April 1 and April 29, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore risk indicators associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes (i.e. phenotypes present in 15% or more of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases). RESULTS: 4172 dentists and 1868 dental assistants responded to the survey, representing approximately 10% of French oral health-care workers. The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was 1.9% for dentists and 0.8% for dental assistants. Higher prevalence was found for COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes both in dentists (15.0%) and dental assistants (11.8%). Chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with increased odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, whereas working in a practice limited to endodontics was associated with decreased odds. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of public transportation and having a practice limited to periodontology were associated with increased odds of presenting a COVID-19-related clinical phenotype. Moreover, changes in work rhythm or clinical practice were associated with decreased odds of both outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although oral health-care professionals were surprisingly not at higher risk of COVID-19 than the general population, specific risk indicators could exist, notably among high aerosol-generating dental subspecialties such as periodontology. Considering the similarities between COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes other viral respiratory infections, lessons can be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the usefulness of equipping and protecting oral health-care workers, notably during seasonal viral outbreaks, to limit infection spread. IMPACT: Results from this study may provide important insights for relevant health authorities regarding the overall infection status of oral health-care workers in the current pandemic and draw attention to particular at-risk groups, as illustrated in the present study. Protecting oral health-care workers could be an interesting public health strategy to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or the emergence of new pandemics.","Jungo, Sébastien; Moreau, Nathan; Mazevet, Marco E; Ejeil, Anne-Laure; Biosse Duplan, Martin; Salmon, Benjamin; Smail-Faugeron, Violaine",PLoS One,591,22

However, it is still unknown the prevalence of different types of cancer in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this study will explore which type of cancer patients are more susceptible to the SARS-COX-2. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching several electronic databases for relevant studies published before April 28, 2020. The language was restricted to English or Chinese. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.0. The GEPIA database evaluated the expression of SARS-COX-2 infection key genes in different types of normal and tumor samples. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies, including 205 patients, were identified to be eligible for this meta-analysis. Among the cancer patients infected by SARS-COX-2, the proportion of patients with the lung, colorectal, breast, esophagus, bladder, pancreatic and cervical cancer were 24.7 %, 20.5 %, 13.0 %, 7.6 %,7.3 %,6.1 %,and 6.0 %, respectively. These findings were also corroborated by the results of the GEPIA database.

Primary objective of study was to analyse the 14-day and 28-day mortality. Secondary objectives were to correlate age, comorbidities and remission status with outcome. METHODS: Retrospective multicentre observational study conducted in 11 centres across India. Total 130 patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 were enrolled. RESULTS: Fever and cough were commonest presentation. Eleven percent patients were incidentally detected. Median age of our cohort was 49.5 years. Most of our patients had a lymphoid malignancy (n = 91). One-half patients (52%) had mild infection, while moderate and severe infections contributed to one-fourth each. Sixty seven patients (52%) needed oxygen For treatment of COVID-19 infection, half(n = 66) received antivirals. Median time to RT-PCR COVID-19 negativity was 17 days (7-49 days). Nearly three-fourth (n = 95) of our patients were on anticancer treatment at time of infection, of which nearly two-third (n = 59;64%) had a delay in chemotherapy. Overall, 20% (n = 26) patients succumbed. 14-day survival and 28-day survival for whole cohort was 85.4% and 80%, respectively. One patient succumbed outside the study period on day 39.

Absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. Our goal was to estimate the association of voter turnout with county-level COVID-19 risks. METHODS: We used publicly available data on voter turnout in the March 10 primary in three states, COVID-19 confirmed cases by day and county, and county-level census data. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the association of voter turnout with COVID-19 incidence, adjusted for county-level population density and proportions: over age 65 years, female, Black, with college education, with high school education, poor, obese, and smokers. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk was associated with voter turnout, most strongly in Michigan during the week starting 3 days postelection (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.33). For longer periods, the association was progressively weaker (risk ratio 0.98-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased absentee-ballot voting in the primary, our results suggest an association of voter turnout in at least one state with a detectable increase in risks associated with and perhaps due to greater exposures related to the primary.","Flanders, W Dana; Flanders, William D; Goodman, Michael",Ann Epidemiol,591,24

In the ensuing weeks, American jurisdictions attempted to manage disease spread on a regional basis using non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., social distancing), as uneven disease burden across the expansive geography of the United States exerted different implications for policy management in different regions. While Arizona policymakers relied initially on state-by-state national modeling projections from different groups outside of the state, we sought to create a state-specific model using a mathematical framework that ties disease surveillance with the future burden on Arizona's healthcare system. Our framework uses a compartmental system dynamics model using a SEIRD framework that accounts for multiple types of disease manifestations for the COVID-19 infection, as well as the observed time delay in epidemiological findings following public policy enactments. We use a compartment initialization logic coupled with a fitting technique to construct projections for key metrics to guide public health policy, including exposures, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths under a variety of social reopening scenarios. Our approach makes use of X-factor fitting and backcasting methods to construct meaningful and reliable models with minimal available data in order to provide timely policy guidance in the early phases of a pandemic.","Gel, Esma S; Jehn, Megan; Lant, Timothy; Muldoon, Anna R; Nelson, Trisalyn; Ross, Heather M",PLoS One,591,22

This article describes how our clinic implemented an automated software solution for this purpose into an established software platform in 10 days. The underlying hypothesis was that modern academic centers in radiology are capable of developing and implementing such tools by their own efforts and fast enough to meet the rapidly increasing clinical needs in the wake of a pandemic. METHOD: Deep convolutional neural network algorithms for lung segmentation and opacity quantification on chest CTs were trained using semi-automatically and manually created ground-truth (Ntotalâ¯=â¯172). The performance of the in-house method was compared to an externally developed algorithm on a separate test subset (Nâ¯=â¯66). RESULTS: The final algorithm was available at day 10 and achieved human-like performance (Dice coefficientâ¯=â¯0.97). For opacity quantification, a slight underestimation was seen both for the in-house (1.8 %) and for the external algorithm (0.9 %). In contrast to the external reference, the underestimation for the in-house algorithm showed no dependency on total opacity load, making it more suitable for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of machine learning and a clinically embedded software development platform enabled time-efficient development, instant deployment, and rapid adoption in clinical routine. The algorithm for fully automated lung segmentation and opacity quantification that we developed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was ready for clinical use within just 10 days and achieved human-level performance even in complex cases.","Anastasopoulos, Constantin; Weikert, Thomas; Yang, Shan; Abdulkadir, Ahmed; Schmülling, Lena; Bühler, Claudia; Paciolla, Fabiano; Sexauer, Raphael; Cyriac, Joshy; Nesic, Ivan; Twerenbold, Raphael; Bremerich, Jens; Stieltjes, Bram; Sauter, Alexander W; Sommer, Gregor",Eur J Radiol,591,26

METHODS: Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1 January 2017 to 7 August 2020. Care home-level data linked with CQC care home register to identify home characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent) and size (small/medium/large). Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths. RESULTS: Up to 7 August 2020, there were 29,542 (95% CI 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95% CI 5.5 to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities. The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0), to older people and/or with dementia (OR 5.5, 95% CI 4.4 to 6.8), amongst larger (vs. small) homes (OR 13.3, 95% CI 11.5 to 15.4) and belonging to a large provider/brand (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers. CONCLUSIONS: To limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission. Our findings provide specific characteristic targets for further research on mechanisms and policy priority.","Morciano, Marcello; Stokes, Jonathan; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Hall, Ian; Turner, Alex J",BMC Med,591,20

The city imposed different levels of social distancing including, the closure of sports venues and restrictions on eateries. This inevitably affects the eating behaviour and physical activities of the population. We examined the changes in eating behavior and physical activities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified sociodemographic factors associated with the behavioral changes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study via a random telephone survey of Chinese adults conducted in Hong Kong from May to June, 2020 - a period in which social distancing measures were being imposed. We measured the physical activity habits from four aspects and dietary consumption patterns from seven aspects before and during the pandemic based on the World Health Organization's guidelines and previous publications. RESULTS: In total, 724 participants were recruited. Individuals were found to cook more frequently at home (p < 0.001) and order take-out (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. While no significant change in the frequency of fast food consumption was observed, we found significant increases in the frequency of eating fruits (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.004). The frequencies of walking, moderate-intensive sports, and high-intensity sports were significantly reduced (p < 0.001). We found that healthy lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic were negatively associated with participants' economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measures likely provided an opportunity for individuals to stay home and thus eat healthier. However, in a prolonged period of social restrictions, a lower physical activity level poses a risk to public health. Public health officials are thus advised to monitor physical health on a population-wide basis. The findings highlighted the importance of interventions tailored to individuals who have prolonged home stays - particularly for individuals in the low economic group.","Wang, Jingxuan; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Yung, Tony Ka Chun; Wong, Martin Chi Sang; Dong, Dong; Chen, Xiao; Chan, Maggie Ka Ying; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Wu, Yushan; Guo, Zihao; Wang, Yawen; Zhao, Shi; Chong, Ka Chun",J Int Soc Sports Nutr,591,32

The aim of the article is to analyse the current data on PIMS-TS in relation to ARF. PIMS-TS and ARF are associated with an abnormal immune response to specific pathogens (SARS-CoV-2 and group A streptococcus, respectively). The main symptoms of both diseases are fever and cardiac involvement. Current therapy for PIMS-TS is based on anti-inflammatory treatment: intravenous immunoglobulin (first-line), intravenous glucocorticoids (second-line), or biological therapy (third-line; including interleukin [IL]-1 antagonists, IL-6 receptor blockers, and anti-tumour necrosis factor agents). Vaccination might be good prophylaxis, but the efficacy and safety of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been established in children. Interesting insights may be gained by considering PIMS-TS in light of what is known of ARF due to their similar courses, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding this disease and its pathogenesis.","Opoka-Winiarska, Violetta; Grywalska, Ewelina; Rolinski, Jacek",Int. j. mol. sci.

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in patients with COVID-19 who died or discharged alive. Approach & Results: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, using a fixed or random-effects model. In our meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included a total of 4,103 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were respectively 31.7 and 51.0 IU/L in the patients with COVID-19 who died and 27.7 and 32.9 IU/L in those discharged alive (both p < 0.0001). Compared with the patients discharged alive, those who died tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time and higher international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction. The patients who died from COVID-19 tended to have different liver chemistries from those discharged alive.

However since the COVID-19 pandemic, the same radiological appearance have become synonymous with COVID-19 pneumonia. We present a case of a patient who was mistakenly presumed to have COVID-19 and was later found to be a case of EVALI. Case Presentation: 33 year old obese Caucasian male with 15 pack year smoking history and no past medical history presented with one month of worsening exertional dyspnea associated with cough, sore throat, subjective chills, and diaphoresis. He was admitted to the COVID-19 unit due to hypoxemia requiring 3 L/min of oxygen and chest CT scan with contrast showing bilateral ground glass opacities with mosaic attenuation. COVID-19 reverse transcriptase RNA PCR test was negative twice. Labs showed leukocytosis of 12,700 with 74.4% neutrophils and 15.7% lymphocytes, normal procalcitonin of 0.09 ng/mL, and normal BNP of 83 pg/mL. Pulmonary was consulted and after detailed history was obtained, the patient reported vaping nicotine three weeks prior to admission. Respiratory viral panel, including influenza A and B, urine legionella and pneumococcal antigens were all negative. He underwent inpatient flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with right upper lobe bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy. BAL cell count showed 89% alveolar macrophages including numerous lipid laden macrophages and 6% eosinophils with transbronchial biopsy showing benign respiratory epithelium with unremarkable alveolated lung parenchyma. Diagnosis of EVALI was made, and patient clinically improved after starting on prednisone. He was discharged on steroid taper and will be followed in the pulmonary clinic with repeat CT imaging to check for resolution. Discussion: With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic there is a bias in diagnosing all ground glass opacities on CT chest in the setting of hypoxemia as COVID-19 pneumonia. However, as per CDC guidelines, our patient met the criteria for EVALI with recent history of vaping within 90 days, typical radiological findings, and infectious causes ruled out. This diagnosis was made more robust by the findings of lipid laden macrophages on BAL. Our case emphasizes the importance of preventing anchoring bias during this COVID-19 pandemic by taking time to obtain a more thorough history and including other causes of lung injury, such as, EVALI in our differential diagnoses.","Seneviratne, C.

Distance estimation is based on interpreting the signal pathloss with a basic linear and a logarithmic model. Further, we compare our results with accurate ultra-wideband (UWB) distance measurements. While the results indicate that distance estimation by BLE is not accurate enough, a contact detector can detect contacts below 2.5 m with a true positive rate of 0.65 for the logarithmic and of 0.54 for the linear model. Further, the measurements reveal that multi-path signal propagation reduces the effect of body shielding and thus increases detection accuracy in indoor scenarios.","Etzlinger, Bernhard; Nussbaummuller, Barbara; Peterseil, Philipp; Hummel, Karin Anna",,591,16

This study describes a novel strategy for preventing and controlling COVID-19 infection in the third-tier city of Liaocheng, China. The prevention and control measurements included city-wide orders to close workspaces, sanitize essential workspaces, quarantine individuals with a travel history to an epidemic area, and issue emergency medical responses to quarantine and treat COVID-19 patients using all necessary technologies, personnel, and resources. As a result, there were only 38 diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Liaocheng since the pandemic began in China in late 2019, including in the metropolitan area and six suburban counties, accounting for more than 6.39 millions residents living in a 8,715 km2 area. There was no COVID-19-related fatality and no healthcare professional inter-transmission as of June 25, 2020.

In this study, the aim was to identify factors associated with headache in COVID-19 and headache characteristics. METHODS: This case-control study includes COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during March 2020. Controls comprise COVID-19 patients without headache and the cases are COVID-19 patients with headache. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records. Headache characteristics were evaluated by semi-structured telephonic interview after discharge. RESULTS: Of a total of 379 COVID-19 patients, 48 (13%) developed headache. Amongst these, 30 (62%) were men and the median age was 57.9 (47-73) years. Headache was associated with younger age, fewer comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-reactive protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, whilst urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available for 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%) patients, of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and of holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that headache is associated with a more benign SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated headache appears as an early symptom and as a novel headache with characteristics of headache attributed to systemic viral infection. Further research addressing the underlying mechanisms to confirm these findings is warranted.","Gonzalez-Martinez, Alicia; Fanjul, Víctor; Ramos, Carmen; Serrano Ballesteros, Jorge; Bustamante, Marta; Villa Martí, Almudena; Álvarez, Claudia; García Del Álamo, Yaiza; Vivancos, José; Gago-Veiga, Ana Beatriz",Eur. j. neurol,591,1

Underserved communities already battling the opioid epidemic had new challenges in accessing medication assisted treatment (MAT). The investigators sought to determine if patients were retaining access to their opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and maintaining sobriety during the pandemic, with the intention of using this information to improve subsequent patient care while the pandemic continues. METHODS: In the assessment, seventy-five patient Epic EMR (electronic medical record) charts were reviewed to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic factors, healthcare access and sobriety during the pandemic period between March 1st, 2020 and June 15th, 2020. Patient charts were selected based on those receiving office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) for OUD at an urban healthcare center. RESULTS: 98.7% of patients accessed the healthcare center in some form since March 1st, 2020. The most common form of communication was through telemedicine with 94.6% of calls over audio. Out of the 21 toxicology screens performed during the pandemic period, 16 (76%) patients were found to be adhering to their buprenorphine treatment. Only 78.7% had documented they had Narcan at their disposal. Among all patients, 11 (14.6%) reoccurrences in opioid use were documented during the pandemic period. Few patients (76%) were adhering to their prescribed buprenorphine treatment, revealing that patients may not be receiving needed MAT support amid the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This assessment reveals short-comings of patient education in managing craving and the maintenance of support systems amid social-isolating conditions.","Rahman, Fatima; Evans, NaKiera; Bernhardt, Jean",Subst Use Misuse,591,26

We aimed to develop a quantitative algorithm to assess and interpret these inconclusive results. METHODS: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases). RESULTS: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive result. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients. The quantitative algorithm we created was shown to be effective and could provide a useful tool for clinicians and hospital epidemiologists to interpret inconclusive COVID-19 PCR results and provide clinical guidance when additional PCR or antibody test results are available.","Yang, Shangxin; Stanzione, Nicholas; Uslan, Daniel Z; Garner, Omai B; de St Maurice, Annabelle",Am. j. clin. pathol,591,16

Bat is the widely believed original host of SARS-CoV-2. However, its intermediate host before transmitting to humans is not clear. Some studies proposed pangolin, snake, or turtle as the intermediate hosts. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which determines the potential host range for SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of structural information of the complex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), we analyzed the affinity to S protein of the 20 key residues in ACE2 from mammal, bird, turtle, and snake. Several ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae, and Cetacea maintained the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The simulated structures indicated that ACE2 proteins from Bovidae and Cricetidae were able to associate with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that nearly half of the key residues in turtle, snake, and bird were changed. The simulated structures showed several key contacts with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in turtle and snake ACE2 were abolished. This study demonstrated that neither snake nor turtle was the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which further reinforced the concept that the reptiles are resistant against infection of coronavirus. This study suggested that Bovidae and Cricetidae should be included in the screening of intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.","Luan, Junwen; Jin, Xiaolu; Lu, Yue; Zhang, Leiliang",J. med. virol,591,21

In this study of recipients of allogeneic (Allo) and autologous (Auto) hematopoietic cell transplant and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we aimed to identify clinical variables associated with COVID-19 severity and assess lymphocyte populations.METHODSWe retrospectively investigated patients diagnosed between March 15, 2020, and May 7, 2020. In a subset of patients, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, quantitative real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status were available.RESULTSWe identified 77 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were recipients of cellular therapy (Allo, 35; Auto, 37; CAR T, 5; median time from cellular therapy, 782 days; IQR, 354-1611 days). Overall survival at 30 days was 78%. Clinical variables significantly associated with the composite endpoint of nonrebreather or higher oxygen requirement and death (n events = 25 of 77) included number of comorbidities (HR 5.41, P = 0.004), infiltrates (HR 3.08, P = 0.032), and neutropenia (HR 1.15, P = 0.04). Worsening graft-versus-host disease was not identified among Allo recipients. Immune profiling revealed reductions and rapid recovery in lymphocyte populations across lymphocyte subsets. Antibody responses were seen in a subset of patients.CONCLUSIONIn this series of Allo, Auto, and CAR T recipients, we report overall favorable clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 without active malignancy and provide preliminary insights into the lymphocyte populations that are key for the antiviral response and immune reconstitution.FUNDINGNIH grant P01 CA23766 and NIH/National Cancer Institute grant P30 CA008748.","Shah, Gunjan L; DeWolf, Susan; Lee, Yeon Joo; Tamari, Roni; Dahi, Parastoo B; Lavery, Jessica A; Ruiz, Josel; Devlin, Sean M; Cho, Christina; Peled, Jonathan U; Politikos, Ioannis; Scordo, Michael; Babady, N Esther; Jain, Tania; Vardhana, Santosha; Daniyan, Anthony; Sauter, Craig S; Barker, Juliet N; Giralt, Sergio A; Goss, Cheryl; Maslak, Peter; Hohl, Tobias M; Kamboj, Mini; Ramanathan, Lakshmi; van den Brink, Marcel Rm; Papadopoulos, Esperanza; Papanicolaou, Genovefa; Perales, Miguel-Angel",J. clin. invest,591,23

The current administrative measures of lock-down, social distancing, and self-isolation are intended at reducing the spread of the viral infection, minimizing contacts between potentially infected individuals and healthy subjects. However, they can complicate the management of children with neurological illnesses by instigating or worsening concomitant anxiety and depression, hindering the interactions with physicians, and leading to shortages or inconsistent supply of medicines. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to provide information on the medical care and wellbeing of children with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic and provide the best possible care for those children while avoiding visits to urgent care facilities and hospitalizations during the pandemic. METHODS: The current study was an observational cross-section survey study. One hundred twenty children with epilepsy following in the epilepsy clinic of Medical Research Center of Excellence, and epilepsy clinic at Neurology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University aged above 4 years were recruited. The authors designed a 22-items questionnaire to address impact of COVID-19 crisis on the care, seizure outcome, behavior of children, and concerns of their parents. The study was conducted during the period from May 2020 to November 2020. RESULTS: The study included 120 epileptic children, 47 males and 73 females, with age ranged from 4 to 17 years with mean age 8.34 ± 3.877 years. Before COVID pandemic, 18.3% of care providers had worries about epilepsy, while during the pandemic, 78.3% of them had the same worries. Twenty percent of the studied patients showed worsened sleep during the pandemic. Medical follow-up difficulties and drug access difficulties were found in 18.3% and 50% of the patients, respectively, during the pandemic. Child anxiety was 20% before the pandemic and 97.5% during the pandemic. Of the care providers, 95.8% were worried about their children of getting COVID 19. Thirty percent showed a need for psychological support, 76.7% for medical support, and 75% for information support about epilepsy. Medical support by phone or online during the pandemic was accepted by 80.8% of the caregivers. The study also showed that epileptic children with age ≤12 years needed more psychological support than those &gt;12 years. All children without anxiety before the COVID-19 pandemic had anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic, while 87.5% of those with anxiety before COVID still had anxiety during the pandemic, signifying that COVID 19 pandemic increased the anxiety of the epileptic children significantly. CONCLUSION: The present study found no increase in seizure exacerbation during the outbreak of COVID-19. During the pandemic, worries of the care providers about progression of the frequency of seizure and epileptic children anxiety increased significantly. Physicians should offer health care facilities including medications and information as much as possible at home to keep children with epilepsy in good psychological and mental status as well as minimizing of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence. Effective telemedicine tools will prove useful for the long-term management of these patients.","Azmy, A.; Abushady, E. M.; Shady, M. M. A.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,591,17

We reviewed the clinical and radiologic features of GI ischemia and its related complications in thirty-one COVID-19 patients reported in literature. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using a search strategy on all studies published from January 1, 2020, to June 13, 2020, and updated on September 6, 2020, on databases from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Every study with at least one presentation of COVID-19-related GI ischemia complication and one GI imaging finding was included. RESULTS: In total, twenty-two studies and thirty-one patients with the mean age of 59 ± 12.7 (age range: 28-80) years old were included, of which 23 (74.2%) patients were male, 7 (22.5%) female, and one unknown gender. The significant GI imaging findings include mesenteric arterial or venous thromboembolism, followed by small bowel ischemia. Nine patients (29%) presented with arterial compromise due to superior mesenteric thromboembolism, resulting in bowel ischemia. Also, 6 patients (19.3%) demonstrated occlusive thrombosis of the portal system and superior mesenteric vein. More than two-thirds of patients (20, 64.5%) required laparotomy and bowel resection. Eventually, five (16.1%) patients were discharged, of whom four cases (12.9%) readmitted. Five (16.1%) patients remained ICU hospitalized at the report time and 12 (38.7%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Macrovascular arterial/venous thrombosis is identified in almost half of COVID-19 patients with bowel ischemia. Overall mortality in COVID-19 patients with GI ischemia and radiologically evident mesenteric thrombotic occlusion was 38.7% and 40%, retrospectively.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Rafiee, Faranak; Kavandi, Hadiseh; Goudarzi, Sogand; Heidari, Firouzeh; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,591,20

Accordingly, the study of the potential routes of virus spreading is crucial to limit the infection. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of most past and current studies that dealt with the causes of the spread of the new COVID-19, mostly surface water and groundwater. The threat is commonly associated with the direct use of contaminated surface or groundwater by sewage sources arose mainly from the mixing of clean water with sewage through several pathways. The second wave of COVID-19 is currently invading the world, especially with the emerging new virus strains that invaded Britain in December 2020, having double the infectivity of the COVID-19 of the first wave. Accordingly, a water management system is required to monitor the increased transmission rate by developing biosensors and IoT to detect and estimate the SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and drinking water. Besides, the integration of IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies could examine how effectively the AI could monitor the outbreaks to help decision-makers curb the infection. This work will also shed light on increasing public awareness of the virus's risk spread through distinct contaminated surface and groundwater paths, especially when consumed directly without disinfection procedures. Additionally, a case study in the East Nile Delta is discussed to show how the contamination of surface water represents a potential route for virus transmission through the direct use of contaminated groundwater, where a potential wastewater flow paths were recorded from a heavily polluted drain to the nearby wells.

Groups of photosensitive birds were exposed for four weeks to resonance light dark cycles comprising of a light phase of 6 h (L) combined with dark phase of different durations (D) such that the period of LD cycles varied by 12 h increments viz. 12- (6 L/6D), 24- (6 L/18D), 36- (6 L/30D), 48- (6 L/42D), 60- (6 L/54D) and 72- (6 L/66D)h. In addition, a control group (C) was maintained under long day length (14 L/10D). Observations, recorded at the beginning and end of experiment, revealed significant testicular growth with corresponding increase in the hypothalamic expression of GnRH-I peptide but low levels of GnIH mRNA and peptide in the birds exposed to resonance cycles of 12, 36 and 60 h which were read as long days. On the other hand, birds experiencing resonance cycles of 24, 48 and 72 h read them as short days wherein they maintained their quiescent gonads and low levels of GnRH-I peptide but exhibited significant increase in GnIH mRNA and peptide expressions. Thus, sparrows responded to resonance light dark cycles differently despite the fact that each of them contained only 6 h of light. These findings suggest that an endogenous circadian rhythm is involved in photoperiodic expressions of above molecules and indicate a shift in their expressions depending upon whether the light falls in the photoinducible or non-photoinducible phase of an endogenous circadian rhythm.","Dixit, Anand S; Byrsat, Sanborlang; Singh, Namram Sushindrajit",J Photochem Photobiol B,591,16

At the New Haven Unit, there have been a number of complaints regarding poor communication and lack of updates given to families during COVID-19.The aim is to:To increase the overall satisfaction of the family with the service received for their loved onesEnsure effective and timely communication of updates to the families, to prevent further complaints, by assigning a member of staff per patient to be the primary individual responsible for family contactCreate an addition to the weekly ward round MDT proforma on ‘Carenotes’ where communication can be documentedMethodA standardised questionnaire has been sent to the relatives of inpatients at the New Haven Unit. Qualitative data are being collated, which will lead to quantitative statistical analysis of the satisfaction ratings.Based on the current bed state on the ward at the time of the project all 32 relatives of current inpatients were contacted and 23 agreed to complete the survey which was sent out either by email or post.The new MDT proforma will be added, which will be used to record actions needed to be taken involving communication and updating family members on a weekly basis. This opportunity to record communication will improve continuity of care and satisfaction amongst family members.There will be follow-up via a second questionnaire to identify improvement.ResultThe average results of selected categories so far are shown below (still awaiting further responses):Frequency of updates regarding loved ones = 4.33/10 (10-excellent)To what degree were your concerns listened to? 7.33/10Quality of content discussed with staff members = 3.33/4 (4- excellent)Other categories scoring below the expected standard, included awareness of visiting guidelines and questions regarding lasting power of attorney, in which 33.3% of participants responded either ‘no’ or ‘not sure’ respectively.Questions addressing formalities of introduction and confidentiality through identity confirmation, scored highly.ConclusionWe are awaiting more survey responses in order to identify additional areas of improvement;however, it is already clear to see that there are areas that would be advanced through structured, assigned reminders via an MDT amendment.We will also be introducing set dates for conference calls with the families now involving the whole MDT;one within the first week of admission, one after six weeks and one at the point of discharge as a minimum.","Jones, Felicity Khanna Bhavna Almoosawi Batool Humm Alex Mahon Upjeet Edwards Rosie",BJPsych Open,591,14

In two months we have performed a huge number of thorax CT scans collecting effective and equivalent organ doses and evaluating also the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of lung and other major cancers. MATERIALS AND METHOD: From February 24th to April 28th, 3224 high-resolution thorax CT were acquired. For all patients we have examined the volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol), the dose length product (DLP), the size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) and effective dose (E103) using a dose tracking software (Radimetrics Bayer HealthCare). From the equivalent dose to organs for each patient, LAR for lung and major cancers were estimated following the method proposed in BEIR VII which considers age and sex differences. RESULTS: Study population included 3224 patients, 1843 male and 1381 female, with an average age of 67 years. The average CTDIvol, SSDE and DLP, and E103 were 6.8 mGy, 8.7 mGy, 239 mGy·cm and 4.4 mSv respectively. The average LAR of all solid cancers was 2.1 cases per 10,000 patients, while the average LAR of leukemia was 0.2 cases per 10,000 patients. For both male and female the organ with a major cancer risk was lung. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impressive increment in thoracic CT examinations due to COVID-19 outbreak, the high resolution low dose protocol used in our hospital guaranteed low doses and very low risk estimation in terms of LAR.","Ghetti, C; Ortenzia, O; Maddalo, M; Altabella, L; Sverzellati, N",Phys Med,591,16

No vaccines or antiviral treatments have yet proven effective against COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 experience elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can result in cytokine storm, followed by massive immune cell infiltration into the lungs leading to alveolar damage, decreased lung function, and rapid progression to death. As many of the elevated cytokines signal through Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2, inhibition of these pathways with ruxolitinib has the potential to mitigate the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm and reduce mortality. This is supported by preclinical and clinical data from other diseases with hyperinflammatory states, where ruxolitinib has been shown to reduce cytokine levels and improve outcomes. The urgent need for treatments for patients with severe disease support expedited investigation of ruxolitinib for patients with COVID-19.","Yeleswaram, Swamy; Smith, Paul; Burn, Timothy; Covington, Maryanne; Juvekar, Ashish; Li, Yanlong; Squier, Peg; Langmuir, Peter",Clin Immunol,591,20

We assessed the ability of laboratory-confirmed deaths to capture mortality in the EU during the 2009 pandemic, and examined the likelihood that these findings are applicable to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We present unpublished results from the Global Pandemic Mortality (GLaMOR) project, in which country-specific mortality estimates were made for the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic. These estimates were compared with laboratory-confirmed deaths during the 2009 pandemic to estimate the ability of surveillance systems to capture pandemic mortality. RESULTS: For the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic, we estimated that the proportion of true pandemic deaths captured by laboratory-confirmed deaths was approximately 67%. Several differences between the two pandemics (e.g. age groups affected) make it unlikely that this capture rate will be equally high for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The surveillance of laboratory-confirmed deaths in the EU during the 2009 pandemic was more accurate than previously assumed. We hypothesize that this method is less reliable for SARS-CoV-2. Near-real-time excess all-cause mortality estimates, routinely compiled by EuroMOMO, probably offer a better indicator of pandemic mortality. We urge more countries to join this project and that national-level absolute mortality numbers are presented.","Staadegaard, Lisa; Taylor, Robert J; Spreeuwenberg, Peter; Caini, Saverio; Simonsen, Lone; Paget, John",Int J Infect Dis,591,16

During the COVID-19 lockdown and pandemic, with students across the world forced into home-based learning via remote teaching, a VR classroom shows potential as a tool for adding depth to their learning. The possibility of immersing students in a virtual environment could provide an answer to motivation and engagement issues for today's students as well as a solution to some of the current constraints faced by teachers. In particular, VR has the potential to increase the time students are able to spend in (virtual) environments that are suitable for teaching and learning practical skills. With the cost of VR equipment reducing rapidly and the increasing quality of virtual experiences, it appears VR is on the tipping-point of becoming a regular part of school programmes.This article outlines the development and testing of a VR Classroom for the delivery of a food-based lesson with middle school students in a New Zealand school. Kitchens are a costly commodity for schools and the obvious health and safety issues make teaching practical cooking skills challenging.

Objective: To describe the consequences at 4 months in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a prospective uncontrolled cohort study, survivors of COVID-19 who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in France between March 1 and May 29, 2020, underwent a telephone assessment 4 months after discharge, between July 15 and September 18, 2020. Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. Exposures: Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Results: Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (n = 145) was 25 (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale ""role limited owing to physical problems"" (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Conclusions and Relevance: Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the disease.","Morin, Luc; Savale, Laurent; Pham, Tài; Colle, Romain; Figueiredo, Samy; Harrois, Anatole; Gasnier, Matthieu; Lecoq, Anne-Lise; Meyrignac, Olivier; Noel, Nicolas; Baudry, Elodie; Bellin, Marie-France; Beurnier, Antoine; Choucha, Walid; Corruble, Emmanuelle; Dortet, Laurent; Hardy-Leger, Isabelle; Radiguer, François; Sportouch, Sabine; Verny, Christiane; Wyplosz, Benjamin; Zaidan, Mohamad; Becquemont, Laurent; Montani, David; Monnet, Xavier",JAMA,591,16

AIM: We aimed to report the largest number of COVID-19-positive cases in KTR in a single center and to discuss their demographics, management, and evolution. METHODS: We enrolled all the two thousand KTR followed up in our center in Kuwait and collected the data of all COVID-19-positive KTR (104) from the start of the outbreak till the end of July 2020 and have reported the clinical features, management details, and both patient and graft outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the one hundred and four cases reported, most of them were males aged 49.3 ± 14.7 years. Eighty-two of them needed hospitalization, of which thirty-one were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main comorbidities among these patients were hypertension in 64.4%, diabetes in 51%, and ischemic heart disease in 20.2%. Management strategies included anticoagulation in 56.7%, withdrawal of antimetabolites in 54.8%, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal in 33.7%, the addition of antibiotics in 57.7%, Tocilizumab in 8.7%, and antivirals in 16.3%. During a follow-up of 30 days, the reported number of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 28.7%, respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy 46.2%, and overall mortality rate was 10.6% with hospital mortality of 13.4% including an ICU mortality rate of 35.5%. CONCLUSION: Better outcome of COVID-19-positive KTR in our cohort during this unremitting stage could be due to the younger age of patients and early optimized management of anticoagulation, modification of immunosuppression, and prompt treatment of secondary bacterial infections. Mild cases can successfully be managed at home without any change in immunosuppression.","AlOtaibi, Torki M; Gheith, Osama A; Abuelmagd, Mohammed M; Adel, Mohammed; Alqallaf, Ahmed K; Elserwy, Nabil A; Shaker, Mohamed; Abbas, Ahmad M; Nagib, Ayman M; Nair, Prasad; Halim, Medhat A; Mahmoud, Tarek; Khaled, Mahmoud M; Hammad, Mohamed A; Fayyad, Zoheer A; Atta, Ahmed F; Mostafa, Ahmed Y; Draz, Ahmed S; Zakaria, Zakaria E; Atea, Khaled A; Aboatya, Hasaneen H; Ameenn, Mohamed E; Monem, Mohamed A; Mahmoud, Amro M",Clin Transplant,591,29

In an increasingly connected world, training in GH and STEGH can provide essential knowledge and practical skills to trainees, particularly at the graduate medical education level. The current core programmatic components and the essential competencies and curricula that support ethical and effective STEGH, however, still vary widely. The authors conducted a survey of the 228 EM residency programs in the United States to describe the current state of GH training and STEGH. Methods: An online survey was developed in REDCap by a team of GH faculty. In July 2018, programs were invited to participate via individual invitation of program directors from a directory. The programs received two reminders to participate until January 2019. Results: Of the 84 programs that responded, 75% offer STEGH and 39% have longitudinal GH curricula. Within these programs, only 55% have dedicated GH faculty and only 70% have dedicated sites. Both faculty and residents encounter funding and insurance barriers; most notably, only 20% of programs that offer STEGH provide evacuation insurance for their residents. Most residents (95%) engage in clinical work along with teaching and other activities, but 24% of programs do not allow these activities to fulfill any residency requirements. Finally, only 80 and 85% of programs offer preparatory and debriefing activities for residents, respectively. Conclusions: While the results of this survey show progress relative to prior surveys, there are still barriers to implementing GH curricula and supporting safe, ethical, and effective STEGH, particularly in the form of continued financial and logistic support for faculty and for residents, in U.S. EM training programs.","Rybarczyk, Megan M.; Muck, Andrew; Kolkowitz, Ilan; Tupesis, Janis P.; Jacquet, Gabrielle A.",AEM Edu.

In this paper were investigated the physiological traits of two populations of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata, living at two different pH for several generations to assess the reasons of the algae reduced abundance at current (8.1) compared to low pH (6.7). Besides, through transplant experiments, the two populations were analysed for the stress response and reversibility of physiological performance at different pH. The long-term acclimation to high pCO2/low pH favours an ecotype characterised by low energetic costs, higher photochemical efficiency and more resistance to the oxidative stress, compared to individuals living at current pH. These traits promoted the growth and reproduction of the community living at pH 6.7, favouring a lower macroalgal diversity, but a higher ecological success under ocean acidification. The similar behaviour observed between Dictyota living at pH 6.7 and transplanted thalli from pH 6.7 to 8.1, suggested a high tolerance to pH changes in the short-term. On the contrary, adaptive responses may have favoured molecular adjustments on the long-term, as showed by the significant differences between the wild populations at pH 8.1 and 6.7. The overall data indicate that both plasticity and adaptive mechanisms may be the reasons for the success of the brown seaweeds under future high pCO2/low pH. The plasticity due to photochemistry adjustments is likely involved in the early response to environmental changes. Conversely, modifications in the photosynthetic biochemical machinery suggest that more complex adaptive mechanisms occurred in the current population of Dictyota living at pH 6.7. Further studies on population genetics will reveal if any differentiation is taking place at the population level or a local adaptation has already occurred in Dictyota and other brown algae under chronic low pH.","Porzio, Lucia; Arena, Carmen; Lorenti, Maurizio; De Maio, Anna; Buia, Maria Cristina",Sci Total Environ,591,1

MethodsEligible trials randomized hospitalized patients with COVID-19 that compared either interleukin-6 receptor antagonist with usual care or placebo in a recent prospective meta-analysis (27 trials, 10930 patients) or that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab. Data were restricted to patients receiving corticosteroids and either non-invasive or invasive ventilation at randomization. Pairwise associations between tocilizumab, sarilumab and usual care or placebo for all-cause mortality 28 days after randomization were estimated using a frequentist contrast-based network meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs), implementing multivariate fixed-effects models that assume consistency between the direct and indirect evidence. ResultsOne trial (REMAP-CAP) was identified that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab and supplied results on all-cause mortality at 28-days. This network meta-analysis was based on 898 eligible patients (278 deaths) from REMAP-CAP and 3710 eligible patients from 18 trials (1278 deaths) from the prospective meta-analysis.

However, a significant percentage of symptomatic patients may test negative. We evaluated the reliability of COVID-19 diagnosis made by radiologists and clinicians and its accuracy versus serology in a sample of patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 with multiple negative swabs. METHODS: Admission chest CT-scans and clinical records of swab-negative patients, treated according to the COVID-19 protocol or deceased during hospitalization, were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists and two clinicians, respectively. RESULTS: Of 254 patients, 169 swab-confirmed cases and one patient without chest CT-scan were excluded. A total of 84 patients were eligible for the reliability study. Of these, 21 patients died during hospitalization; the remaining 63 underwent serological testing and were eligible for the accuracy evaluation.

This study aimed to compare the utilisation of healthcare services for RTIs between individuals with and without diabetes attending primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Qatar. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic database of all individuals who had a diagnosis of RTI. SETTING: PHCCs in Qatar from July 2015 to December 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the study were all adult individuals (aged &#8805;18 years) who visited the primary healthcare facilities and were diagnosed with an RTI during the study period. PRIMARY AND OUTCOME MEASURES: For each participant, visits to the healthcare facility, antibiotic use and use of other medications were extracted from the electronic database and compared between participants with and without a diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 32 857 participants were included, of whom 7407 (22.5%) had a diabetes diagnosis. Results from a negative binomial regression indicate that diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with increased visits to the healthcare facility (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.076 to 1.134, p<0.001), antibiotic use (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.046 to 1.145, p<0.001) and use of other medications (IRR 1.11, 95% CI 1.078 to 1.143, p<0.001).

For this purpose, we intend as an attempt at investigating the fractional COVID-19 model through Caputo operator with order &#967; &#8712; ( 0 , 1 ) . Employing the fixed point theorem, it is shown that the solutions of the proposed fractional model are determined to satisfy the existence and uniqueness conditions under the Caputo derivative. On the other hand, its iterative solutions are indicated by making use of the Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional operator. Also, we establish the stability criteria for the fractional COVID-19 model via the fixed point theorem. The invariant region in which all solutions of the fractional model under investigation are positive is determined as the non-negative hyperoctant R + 7 . Moreover, we perform the parameter estimation of the COVID-19 model by utilizing the non-linear least squares curve fitting method. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R 0 c is carried out to determine the effects of the proposed fractional model's parameters on the spread of the disease.

In light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for surgical masks was investigated. In order to determine the efficacy of the protective equipment we used a cough simulator. The protective equipment considered was placed on a manikin head that simulated human breathing. Concentration and size distribution of small particles that reached the manikin respiration pathways during the few tens of seconds following the cough event were monitored. Additionally, water sensitive papers were taped on the tested protective equipment and the manikin face. In the case of frontal exposure, for droplet diameter larger than 3 µm, the shield efficiency in blocking cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular surgical masks, with enhanced protection for portions of the face that the mask does not cover. Additionally, for finer particles, down to 0.3 µm diameter, a shield blocked about 10 times more fine particles than the surgical mask. When exposure from the side was considered, the performance of the shield was found to depend dramatically on its geometry. While a narrow shield allowed more droplets and aerosol to penetrate in comparison to a mask under the same configuration, a slightly wider shield significantly improved the performance. The source control potential of shields was also investigated. A shield, and alternatively, a surgical mask, were placed on the cough simulator, while the breathing simulator, situated 60 cm away in the jet direction, remained totally exposed. In both cases, no droplets or particles were found in the vicinity of the breathing simulator. Conducted experiments were limited to short time periods after expiratory events, and do not include longer time ranges associated with exposure to suspended aerosol. Thus, additional evidence regarding the risk posed by floating aerosol is needed to establish practical conclusions regarding actual transmittance reduction potential of face shields and surgical face masks.","Ronen, Ayala; Rotter, Hadar; Elisha, Shmuel; Sevilia, Sagi; Parizer, Batya; Hafif, Nir; Manor, Alon",J Occup Environ Hyg,591,16

One of the most frequent manifestations of aphasia are word finding disorders. In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the temporary approval of video therapy enables the maintenance of speech therapy treatment. This leads to the necessity to investigate the effectiveness of screen-to-screen therapy via a video conferencing system compared to conventional face-to-face therapy of adult aphasia patients. METHODS: For this scoping review, a literature search in the databases Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science was conducted for the period February 2010 to 2020. We included German- and English-language studies comparing the effectiveness of a classic face-to-face therapy with a screen-to-screen therapy of adults with aphasia. The studies were selected using the PRISMA flowchart. RESULTS: A total of five studies were identified. Both face-to-face therapy and screen-to-screen therapy showed significant improvements in naming performance in an Italian crossover study, a Canadian randomized study and a quasi-randomized study conducted in the UK. No improvements were found for both forms of intervention in an Israeli crossover study. In a German comparative study, significant improvements in naming performance were found for face-to-face therapy, but the results did not differ significantly from the screen-to-screen therapy intervention group. DISCUSSION: In all included studies, screen-to-screen therapy and face-to-face therapy had a comparable effectiveness on naming performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a screen-to-screen therapy under everyday conditions. However, it is possible that this form of therapy cannot always be implemented. Barriers to screen-to-screen therapy can be the use of technologies and restrictions in the visual field due to a neglect. One limitation of the scoping review was that only the naming performance was considered as an outcome, another was the small number of studies included. CONCLUSION: For many patients screen-to-screen therapy is currently the only possibility to receive speech therapy treatment. Therefore it is a positive aspect that screen-to-screen therapy is as effective as face-to-face therapy. Screen-to-screen therapy can provide expanded access to health care and professional expertise in health services.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 from 19 designated hospitals between January 1 to February 29, 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was administration of thymosin &#945;1. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to account for baseline confounders, cluster analysis and Cox proportional hazard model was used to account for subgroup analysis. RESULTS: A total of 771 patients were included, and 327/771 (42.4%) patients received thymosin &#945;1 therapy. The 28-day mortality in thymosin group was significantly lower than that in control group (41.3% vs. 60.6%, p < 0.001). After PSM 522 patients were included in analysis and the 28-day mortality in thymosin &#945;1 group and control group were 51.0% and 52.9% respectively, with no significant difference. In subgroup analyses, the association between thymosin &#945;1 therapy and 28-day mortality appeared to be stronger among male patients (HR 0.673, 95% CI 0.454-0.998; p = 0.049). There were no benefits of thymosin &#945;1 in 28-day mortality in other subgroups. There were two phenotypes after cluster analysis, but no benefits of thymosin &#945;1 were shown in phenotype 1 (HR 0.823 95% CI 0.581-1.166; p = 0.273) and phenotype 2 (HR 1.148 95% CI 0.710-1.895; p = 0.442). CONCLUSION: There was no association between use of thymosin &#945;1 and decreased mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Subgroups analysis and phenotype analysis also showed no differences on mortality after thymosin &#945;1 therapy.","Sun, Qin; Xie, Jianfeng; Zheng, Ruiqiang; Li, Xuyan; Chen, Hui; Tong, Zhaohui; Du, Bin; Qiu, Haibo; Yang, Yi",Int Immunopharmacol,591,1

Since COVID-19 spreads through contact and droplet infection routes, careful attention to infection control and surgical management is important to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Tracheostomy is an effective method to treat severe respiratory dysfunction with prolonged respiratory management and should be performed as a high-risk procedure METHOD: The anesthetic and surgical considerations in this case involved difficult goals of the patient safety and the management of infection among health care workers. Our surgical procedure was developed based on the previous experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). RESULTS: We described the management procedures for tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19, including the anesthesia preparation, surgical procedures, required medical supplies (a N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator, goggles, face shield, cap, double gloves, and a water-resistant disposable gown), and appropriate consultation with an infection prevention team. CONCLUSION: Appropriate contact, airborne precautions, and sufficient use of muscle relaxants are essential for performing tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19.","Hiramatsu, Mariko; Nishio, Naoki; Ozaki, Masayuki; Shindo, Yuichiro; Suzuki, Katsunao; Yamamoto, Takanori; Fujimoto, Yasushi; Sone, Michihiko",Auris Nasus Larynx,591,23

Given current limitations, our goal is to leverage a SARS antibody testing platform with a newly developed automated endpoint titer analysis program to rapidly define SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in CP donors and hospitalized patients. A newly developed antibody detection platform was used to perform a serial dilution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Data were then analyzed using commercially available software, GraphPad Prism, or a newly developed program developed in Python called TiterScape, to analyze endpoint titers.

Serial dilution analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels revealed a high level of heterogeneity between individuals. Commercial platform analysis required significant time for manual data input and extrapolated endpoint titer values when the last serial dilution was above the endpoint cutoff, occasionally producing erroneously high results. By contrast, TiterScape processed 1008 samples for endpoint titer results in roughly 14 minutes compared with the 8 hours required for the commercial software program analysis.

Initial experiments performed more than 30 years ago found that global disruption of RNA led to visible rearrangements of nuclear organization. Yet, this idea remained controversial for many years, in large part because it was unclear what specific RNAs might be involved, and which specific nuclear structures might be dependent on RNA. Over the past few years, the contributions of RNA to organizing nuclear structures have become clearer with the discovery that many nuclear bodies are enriched for specific noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); in specific cases, ncRNAs have been shown to be essential for establishment and maintenance of these nuclear structures. More recently, many different ncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in initiating the three-dimensional (3D) spatial organization of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules in the nucleus. These examples, combined with global imaging and genomic experiments, have begun to paint a picture of a broader role for RNA in nuclear organization and to uncover a unifying mechanism that may explain why RNA is a uniquely suited molecule for this role. In this review, we provide an overview of the history of RNA and nuclear structure and discuss key examples of RNA-mediated bodies, the global roles of ncRNAs in shaping nuclear structure, and emerging insights into mechanisms of RNA-mediated nuclear organization.","Quinodoz, Sofia A; Guttman, Mitchell",Cold Spring Harbor perspect. biol,591,29

The temporal expression and distribution of cell-specific and tissue-specific mtDNA heteroplasmy in healthy individuals may be functionally associated with intracellular mitochondrial signaling pathways and nuclear DNA gene expression. The maintenance of endogenously regulated tissue-specific copy numbers of heteroplasmic mtDNA may represent a sensitive biomarker of homeostasis of mitochondrial dynamics, metabolic integrity, and immune competence. Myeloid cells, monocytes, macrophages, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells undergo programmed changes in mitochondrial metabolism according to innate and adaptive immunological processes. In the central nervous system (CNS), the polarization of activated microglial cells is dependent on strategically programmed changes in mitochondrial function. Therefore, variations in heteroplasmic mtDNA copy numbers may have functional consequences in metabolically competent mitochondria in innate and adaptive immune processes involving the CNS. Recently, altered mitochondrial function has been demonstrated in the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Accordingly, our review is organized to present convergent lines of empirical evidence that potentially link expression of mtDNA heteroplasmy by functionally interactive CNS cell types to the extent and severity of acute and chronic post-COVID-19 neurological disorders.","Stefano, George B; Kream, Richard M",Cell. mol. neurobiol,591,16

Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is an important public health problem worldwide. Sustained virological response (SVR) can be achieved and HCV-related mortality and morbidity can be prevented with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), which have been used in recent years. However, if CHC is not diagnosed, it can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. Since the diagnosis and treatment of these patients require follow-up, they are among the most affected chronic diseases during the pandemic. It does not seem possible to predict when the COVID-19 outbreak will end. Diagnosis and treatment need of CHC patients should be met in special areas where protection measures are taken in health institutions.

Background: It has been suggested that COVID-19 and the associated restrictions are likely to have a negative impact on the provision of positive behavioural support (PBS) to people with an intellectual disability. Methods: Fifty-eight staff, who had recently completed an accredited positive behavioural support (PBS) programme, responded to an online questionnaire, which asked them to rate the impact of COVID-19 on factors related to PBS. Results: Participants reported a neutral or somewhat positive impact on all the areas measured, with the exception of the activities and quality of life of those they supported, which were somewhat negatively affected. The participants rated the learning from their PBS programme as helping them cope with COVID-19 to some extent.

This led to the identification and characterization of tautomeric equilibria. Structural elucidation was required to understand the potential impurity profile, thus impacting method development for quality control. In this work, characterization of the chemical structures, AZ13581258 and AZD5718, and equilibria of the tautomeric forms was performed using a range of advanced analytical techniques such as preparative chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), chromatographic detection by mass spectrometry (MS), MSMS, and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). Predictions using density functional theory (DFT) further explains and confirms the tautomer equilibria through predictions of reaction barrier energies, UV-spectra and NMR data. These investigations led to fully understand the impurity profile and to the development of a quality control method for AZD5718 drug substance and drug product. In conclusion, ring-chain tautomeric structures are predominately formed under acidic conditions, and the additional peaks observed in LC during organic impurity determination were found to originate from ring-chain closed tautomers in equilibria with the parent open form compound. Hence, the closed and open tautomer forms should all be considered as the same compound.","Ottosson, Jenny E; Gränfors, Malin; van Pelt, Sally; Langborg Weinmann, Annika; Nilsson Lill, Sten O; Hulthe, Gustaf; Grönberg, Gunnar",J Pharm Biomed Anal,591,24

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) enables early detection of pandemic viruses and plays a vital role in preventing onward transmission. However, the requirement of skilled operators, expensive instrumentation, and biosafety laboratories has hindered the use of NAAT for screening and diagnosis of suspected patients. Here we report development of a fully automated centrifugal microfluidic system with sample-in-answer-out capability for sensitive, specific, and rapid viral nucleic acid testing. The release of nucleic acids and the subsequent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) were integrated into the reaction units of a microfluidic disc. The whole processing steps such as injection of reagents, fluid actuation by rotation, heating and temperature control, and detection of fluorescence signals were carried out automatically by a customized instrument. We validate the centrifugal microfluidic system using oropharyngeal swab samples spiked with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) armored RNA particles. The estimated limit of detection for armored RNA particles is 2 copies per reaction, the throughput is 21 reactions per disc, and the assay sample-to-answer time is approximately 70 min. This enclosed and automated microfluidic system efficiently avoids viral contamination of aerosol, and can be readily adapted for virus detection outside the diagnostic laboratory.

The laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes of the disease in discharged patients remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the laboratory and echocardiographic findings of patients with COVID-19 after discharge and the relation between left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and inflammatory parameters in discharged patients. METHODS: A total of 75 patients recovering from COVID-19 as the study group were prospectively recruited from the COVID-19 outpatient clinic for their follow-up visits at a median 6 months after discharge. Patients were classified into groups according to pneumonia severity and impairment in LVGLS. Laboratory findings of patients both at admission and after discharge were evaluated and the relation with pneumonia severity at admission and LVGLS after discharge were analyzed. RESULTS: Serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) levels after discharge were significantly higher in the study group than the control group (n = 44). Ferritin was found to be related to pneumonia severity. Serum ferritin and LDH values after discharge were significantly higher in patients with impaired LVGLS than those with preserved. There was a significant correlation between LVGLS, serum ferritin and LDH values after discharge (r = -0.252, p = 0.012; r = -0.268, p = 0.005, respectively).

This discrepancy centres on whether they are considered to be an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP), thus requiring airborne protection to prevent transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs). The need to don higher-level PPE has to be weighed against the resulting delay to emergency treatment.We performed a literature search on this topic which found eight relevant studies. All were observational with low patient numbers and multiple confounding factors, but describe cases of acute respiratory infection transmission during chest compressions. One systematic review concluded that chest compressions were not an AGP. Two simulated studies (released as preprints) potentially demonstrate aerosol generation. Given that there is evidence for infection transmission during chest compressions, we conclude that a precautionary approach with appropriate PPE is necessary to protect HCW from contracting a potentially fatal infection.","Brown, Evelyn; Chan, Lai Man",Clin Med (Lond),591,30

In the UK, antibody testing originally formed the third pillar of the UK Government's COVID-19 testing programme and was thought to offer hope that those with a positive antibody test result could return to normal life. However, at that time scientists and the public had little understanding of the longevity of COVID-19 antibodies, and whether they provided immunity to reinfection or transmission of the virus. OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the UK public's understanding of COVID-19 testing, perceived test accuracy, the meaning of a positive test result, willingness to adhere to restrictive measures in response to an antibody test result and how they expect other people to respond. METHODS: On-line synchronous focus groups were conducted in April/May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic and the most stringent period of the COVID-19 restrictive measures. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: There was confusion in responses as to whether those with a positive or negative test should return to work and which restrictive measures would apply to them or their household members. Participants raised concerns about the wider public response to positive antibody test results and the adverse behavioural effects. There were worries that antibody tests could create a divided society particularly if those with a positive test result were given greater freedoms or chose to disregard the restrictive measures. CONCLUSION: Should these tests be offered more widely, information should be developed in consultation with the public to ensure clarity and address uncertainty about test results and subsequent behaviours.","Lecouturier, Jan; Kelly, Michael P; Graham, Fiona; Meyer, Carly; Tang, Mei Yee; Goffe, Louis; Bonell, Chris; Michie, Susan; Sniehotta, Falko F",Soc Sci Med,591,20

The first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia was announced on March 2, 2020. Several psychiatric manifestations may appear during pandemics, especially among frontline healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to explore depression and anxiety levels among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 502 healthcare providers in the Ministry of Health. Depression and anxiety were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: The respondents represented various healthcare occupations: administrators (28.49%), nurses (26.29%), physicians (22.11%), non-physician specialists (13.94%), technicians (6.77%), and pharmacists (2.30%). The majority of them were male (68.1%). More than half of them had depressive disorder (55.2%), which ranged from mild (24.9%), moderate (14.5%), and moderately severe (10%) to severe (5.8%). Half of the sample had generalized anxiety disorder (51.4%), which ranged from mild (25.1%) and moderate (11%) to severe (15.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that males were significantly less predicted to have anxiety (Beta=-0.22, P-value <0.04), 30-39 years age group were significantly more predicted to have depression and anxiety group (Beta=0.204, P-value <0.001 and beta=0.521, P-value <0.003 respectively), and nurses had significantly higher mean score of anxiety (Beta=0.445, P-value <0.026). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that depression and anxiety are prevailing conditions among healthcare providers. Although efforts were accelerated to support their psychological well-being, more attention should be paid to the mental health of female, 30-39 age group and nursing staff. Promoting healthcare service as a humanitarian and national duty may contribute to making it a more meaningful experience in addition to advocating for solidarity, altruism, and social inclusion. Longitudinal research studies need to be conducted to follow up on healthcare providers' mental health symptoms and develop evidence-based interventions.","AlAteeq, Deemah A; Aljhani, Sumayah; Althiyabi, Ibrahim; Majzoub, Safaa",J Infect Public Health,591,23

Using SurveyMonkey, an adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale-Healthcare version (CAS-HC) was administered to 231 adult healthcare professionals in Mexico. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety symptoms cohered into a reliable, single factor structure of coronaphobia. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the classification features of the CAS-HC were strong, but supported a less stringent cut-score for this population. Construct validity was supported by the positive correlations between the CAS-HC and measures of depression and generalized anxiety, while known groups validity was found with high CAS-HC scores exhibited by those working in emergency rooms, triage, and intensive care units. The findings collectively support the coronaphobia construct with healthcare professionals, and the finding that over one third of the participants in the study scored in the clinical range on this measure points to the critical importance of assessing and alleviating this form of distress in this vulnerable but indispensable workforce.","Mora-Magaña, Ignacio; Lee, Sherman A; Maldonado-Castellanos, Isaac; Jiménez-Gutierrez, Carlos; Mendez-Venegas, José; Maya-Del-Moral, Azareel; Rosas-Munive, Margarita D; Mathis, Amanda A; Jobe, Mary C",Death Stud,591,26

MethodsEssential workers were selected from a seroprevalence survey cohort in Geneva, Switzerland and were linked to a state centralized registry compiling SARS-CoV-2 infections. Primary outcome was the number of virologically-confirmed infections from serological assessment (between May and September 2020) to January 25, 2021, according to baseline antibody status and stratified by three pre-defined occupational groups (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity, involving brief regular contact or others). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of infection. Results10457 essential workers were included (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity accounted for 3057 individuals, those involving regular brief contact, 3645, and 3755 workers were classified under ""Other essential occupations""). After a follow-up period of over 27 weeks, 5 (0.6%) seropositive and 830 (8.5%) seronegative individuals had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with an incidence rate of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.9 to 3.4) cases per person-week, respectively. Incidences were similar across occupational groups. Seropositive essential workers had a 93% reduction in the hazard (HR of 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17) of having a positive test during follow-up with no significant between-occupational group difference. ConclusionsA ten-fold reduction in the hazard of being virologically tested positive was observed among anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive essential workers regardless of their sector of occupation, confirming the seroprotective effect of a previous SARS-CoV2 exposure at least six months after infection.

Conversely, little is known about the clinical course of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: The Italian Society of Hospital Neurosciences (SNO) promoted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study (SNO-COVID-19), involving 20 Neurological Departments in Northern Italy. Clinical data on patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases, admitted from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, were collected. A comparison was made of the demographical and clinical features of both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients with ICH. RESULTS: 949 patients were enrolled (average age 73.4 years; 52.7% males); 135 patients had haemorrhagic stroke and 127 (13.4%) had a primary ICH. Only 16 patients with ICH (12.6%) had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia or respiratory distress (OR 5.4), lobar location (OR 5.0) and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (OR 2.9) were the only factors significantly associated with increased mortality in ICH. SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of respiratory involvement, led to a non-significantly increased risk of in-hospital death (37.5% vs 23.4%, p = 0.2). DISCUSSION: ICH patients with COVID-19 did not experience an increase in mortality as striking as ischemic stroke. The inflammatory response and respiratory complications could justify the slight increase of death in ICH. Bleeding sites and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment were the only other predictors of a worse outcome.","Sangalli, Davide; Martinelli-Boneschi, Filippo; Versino, Maurizio; Colombo, Irene; Ciccone, Alfonso; Beretta, Simone; Marcheselli, Simona; Altavilla, Riccardo; Roncoroni, Mauro; Beretta, Sandro; Lorusso, Lorenzo; Cavallini, Anna; Prelle, Alessandro; Guidetti, Donata; La Gioia, Sara; Santalucia, Paola; Zanferrari, Carla; Grampa, Giampiero; D039,; Adda, Elisabetta; Peverelli, Lorenzo; Colombo, Antonio; Salmaggi, Andrea",J Neurol Sci,591,1

Os oocistos destas espécies de coccídios são morfologicamente indistinguíveis de forma que o diagnóstico coprológico diferencial entre os dois agentes é virtualmente impossível, se utilizadas metodologias convencionais de diagnóstico. Situação análoga é verificada com os gatos (e outras espécies de felídeos) com relação à infecção por T. gondii e H. hammondi. O objetivo deste trabalho foi propor a reconstrução filogenética de protozoários pertencentes à sub-família Toxoplasmatinae pela análise de seqüências de nucleotídeos de genes mitocondriais e de apicoplasto. Foram empregadas seqüências gênicas de CytB mitocondrial e de dois genes de apicoplasto, o gene codificador da subunidade beta de RNA polimerase DNA dependente (RpoB) e o gene codificador de proteína caseinolitica (ClpC). Pelas análises filogenéticas e de variabilidade nucleotídica e de aminoácidos, verifica-se que a espécie H. heydorni é eqüidistante de todas as outras espécies de toxoplasmatineos. Os posicionamentos relativos dos gêneros Toxoplasma, Neospora e Hammondia nas árvores filogenéticas não foram congruentes em todas as reconstruções, pois dependendo dos táxons que são empregados como grupos externos, as topologias das reconstruções variam e os clados formados são estatisticamente pouco suportados. Assim, a reconstrução de topologias produzindo com ramos curtos que derivam nós de baixo suporte estatístico, somado à eqüidistância evolutiva entre os táxons avaliados (Neospora spp., H. heydorny e T. gondii) permite supor que uma politomia consistente explicaria a evolução para estes organismos, ou seja, a resolução para o posicionamento relativo entre estes táxons poderia ser resultado de evolução radiada. Os genes de organelas mostraram-se mais conservados em relação aos genes nucleares. Embora os genes de apicoplasto possam ser mais conservados que genes nucleares, eles parecem ter relações entre substituições não sinônimas e substituições sinônimas consideravelmente superiores àquelas de genes nucleares e mitocondriais, o que pode indicar que os produtos gênicos estejam sendo submetidos a pressão seletiva positiva. No caso dos genes mitocondriais e nucleares, é possível supor que os mesmos estejam submetidos à pressão seletiva negativa, indicando que as substituições tendem a ser deletérias aos organismos e por isso as mudanças nos produtos gênicos devam ser menos freqüentemente registradas. Ainda, a variabilidade em sítios não sinônimos é consideravelmente superior para seqüências de apicoplasto em relação às demais, particularmente no caso das seqüências RpoB. Também em termos de variabilidade em sítios não sinônimos, percebe-se que as seqüências de genes de apicoplasto de H. heydorni são tão distintas das de T. gondii quanto de N. caninum. Nas análises realizadas com genes de apicoplasto, é marcante a divergência entre as duas linhagens de H. heydorni. Vale ressaltar que as diferenças genotípicas entre as duas linhagens de H. heydorni são maiores que as diferenças entre as duas espécies reconhecidas de Neospora, indicando que as duas linhagens de H. heydorni poderiam ser classificadas como duas espécies distintas, se apenas critérios de evolução molecular fossem considerados","Sercundes, Michelle Klein",,591,24

METHODS: Systematic analysis of all non-ICU patient hospitalizations for COVID-19 completing discharge between March 13 and May 1, 2020, in a large US health care system utilizing off-site central monitoring. Variables of interest were examined in relation to a composite event rate of death, ICU transfer, or increased oxygen requirement to high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Among 350 patients (age, 64 ± 16 years; 55% male), most (73%) required 3 L/min or less of supplemental oxygen during admission. Telemetry was widely utilized (79%) yet arrhythmias were uncommon (14%) and were predominantly (90%) among patients with abnormal troponin levels or known cardiovascular disease. Ventricular tachycardia was rare (5%), nonsustained, and not associated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatment. Adverse events occurred in 62 patients (18%), including 22 deaths (6%), 48 ICU transfers (14%), and 49 patients with increased oxygen requirement (14%) and were independently associated with elevated C-reactive protein (odds ratio, 1.09 per 1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; P = .04) and lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.006 per 1U/L; 95% CI, 1.001-1.012; P = .03) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Among non-critically ill patients hospitalized within a nonepicenter health care system, overall survival was 94% with the development of more severe illness or death independently associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase on admission. Clinical decompensation was largely respiratory-related, while serious cardiac arrhythmias were rare, which suggests that telemetry can be prioritized for high-risk patients.","Nemer, David M; Wilner, Bryan R; Burkle, Alicia; Aguilera, Jose; Adewumi, Joseph; Gillombardo, Carl; Wazni, Oussama; Menon, Venu; Pengel, Shannon; Foxx, Meredith; Petre, Marc; Hamilton, Aaron C; Cantillon, Daniel J",J Hosp Med,591,16

This study aimed to predict the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia based on clinical characteristics at hospital presentation. Case-control study of all patients admitted for pneumonia at Semmelweis University Emergency Department. Cases (n = 30) were patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia (based on polymerase chain reaction test) between 26 March 2020 and 30 April 2020; controls (n = 82) were historical pneumonia cases between 1 January 2019 and 30 April 2019. Logistic models were built with SARS-CoV-2 infection as outcome using clinical characteristics at presentation. Patients with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia were younger (mean difference, 95% CI: 9.3, 3.2-15.5 years) and had a higher lymphocyte count, lower C-reactive protein, presented more frequently with bilateral infiltrate, less frequently with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea in age- and sex-adjusted models. A logistic model using age, sex, abdominal pain, C-reactive protein, and the presence of bilateral infiltrate as predictors had an excellent discrimination (AUC 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) and calibration (p = 0.27-Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The clinical use of our screening prediction model could improve the discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 related from other community-acquired pneumonias and thus help patient triage based on commonly used diagnostic approaches.

The screening of infected people in the population still mainly depends on clinical symptoms. However, there is limited research on the characteristics of clinical symptoms in different populations, especially in imported cases. METHODS: To retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 494 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Shanghai from January 20, 2020, to March 31, 2020, we compared the clinical manifestations in different populations and their influencing factors in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: (1) Of the 494 patients, 453 (91.7%) had different symptoms at admission, and 39 (7.89%) patients were asymptomatic. (2) We compared the symptoms of patients according to different stratifications and found the following results: (a) The proportion of dyspnea was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (P < .05). (b) The proportions of a stuffy nose, sore throat, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly higher in children than in adult patients (P < .05). (c) The proportions of fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and fatigue were significantly higher in local cases than in imported cases. In comparison, the proportions of nasal congestion, stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly lower in imported cases than in imported cases (P < .05). (d) The proportions of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and dyspnea were significantly higher in severely ill patients than in those with mild symptoms (P < .05). (3) Thirty-one asymptomatic patients were significantly younger than symptomatic patients, and they had a higher proportion of imported cases, white blood cell and lymphocyte count levels, and fewer abnormal CT cases than the group of symptomatic patients (P < .05). (4) The number of days since the onset of the disease needed for the symptoms to disappear was associated with the epidemiological history (imported cases), the number of days until the pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative, the days of hospitalization, the days of onset, and the white blood cell and lymphocyte count levels (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 patients (91.7%) had early symptoms, whereas 7.89% of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. Younger patients had fewer symptoms, mainly the upper respiratory symptoms, and the illness condition was milder, which was more common in imported cases.

To address this, we generated and analyzed two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of the human minor salivary glands and gingiva (9 samples, 13,824 cells), identifying 50 cell clusters. Using integrated cell normalization and annotation, we classified 34 unique cell subpopulations between glands and gingiva. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry factors such as ACE2 and TMPRSS members were broadly enriched in epithelial cells of the glands and oral mucosae. Using orthogonal RNA and protein expression assessments, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the glands and mucosae. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and sustained SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acellular and cellular salivary fractions from asymptomatic individuals were found to transmit SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples displayed distinct viral shedding dynamics, and salivary viral burden correlated with COVID-19 symptoms, including taste loss. Upon recovery, this asymptomatic cohort exhibited sustained salivary IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these data show that the oral cavity is an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and implicate saliva as a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Huang, Ni; Pérez, Paola; Kato, Takafumi; Mikami, Yu; Okuda, Kenichi; Gilmore, Rodney C; Conde, Cecilia Domínguez; Gasmi, Billel; Stein, Sydney; Beach, Margaret; Pelayo, Eileen; Maldonado, Jose O; Lafont, Bernard A; Jang, Shyh-Ing; Nasir, Nadia; Padilla, Ricardo J; Murrah, Valerie A; Maile, Robert; Lovell, William; Wallet, Shannon M; Bowman, Natalie M; Meinig, Suzanne L; Wolfgang, Matthew C; Choudhury, Saibyasachi N; Novotny, Mark; Aevermann, Brian D; Scheuermann, Richard H; Cannon, Gabrielle; Anderson, Carlton W; Lee, Rhianna E; Marchesan, Julie T; Bush, Mandy; Freire, Marcelo; Kimple, Adam J; Herr, Daniel L; Rabin, Joseph; Grazioli, Alison; Das, Sanchita; French, Benjamin N; Pranzatelli, Thomas; Chiorini, John A; Kleiner, David E; Pittaluga, Stefania; Hewitt, Stephen M; Burbelo, Peter D; Chertow, Daniel; Frank, Karen; Lee, Janice; Boucher, Richard C; Teichmann, Sarah A",Nat Med,591,33

Methods: Data of COVID-19 cases reported in Guangzhou and Wenzhou as of 29 February, 2020 were collected. The incidence curves of COVID-19 in two cities were constructed. The real time reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in two cities was calculated respectively. Results: A total of 346 and 465 confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, respectively. In two cities, most cases were aged 30-59 years (Guangzhou: 54.9%; Wenzhou: 70.3%). The incidence curve peaked on 27 January, 2020 in Guangzhou and on 26 January, 2020 in Wenzhou, then began to decline in both cities. The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou. In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou. In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant. Despite the different epidemic pattern, the R(t) and the number of COVID-19 cases declined after strict prevention and control measures were taken in Guangzhou and in Wenzhou.

In this work, we provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of mask-wearing. To this end, we propose a novel agent-based model of viral spread on networks where agents may either wear no mask, or wear one of several types of masks with different properties (e.g., cloth or surgical). We derive analytical expressions for three key epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the aforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the contact network, viral transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different types of masks within the population. We then investigate the impact of different allocations of masks within the population through extensive simulations. We also investigate tradeoffs between masks with high outward efficiency but low inward efficiency and masks with high inward efficiency but low outward efficiency. Interestingly, we find that the former type of mask is most useful for controlling the spread in the early stages of an epidemic, while the latter type is most useful in mitigating the impact of an already large spread.","Tian, Yurun; Sridhar, Anirudh; Poor, H.Vincent; Yagan, Osman",,591,16

From the reported cases in the literatures, the level of D-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is positively correlated with the severity of illness, which needs the attention of clinical workers. According to Western medicine, the increase of D-dimer is related to the hyperactivity of fibrinolytic system and the shortening of prothrombin time (PT), resulting in excessive production and degradation of plasma fibrin and hypercoagulable state of blood, while traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) believes that the above syndromes belong to the pathogenesis of ""blood stasis"" according to TCM theories. Over the years, TCM has a significant effect on promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis and improving microcirculation.

The effects a single training session, plus two researcher coaching sessions were evaluated using a nonconcurrent multiple probes across participants design. Primary dependent variables included (a) the number of completed targeted communication turns between the parent and child and (b) the number of child independent target communication responses (gestures and manual signs) during family-selected routines. Additional measures examined whether parents used strategies taught to them during training, and whether early intervention providers addressed strategies taught via coaching. A social validity measure was used to determine parent and provider views of the training. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, training and post-training sessions were delivered via telehealth for two triads. While data trends and variability differed across triads, following training, all three families increased the number of completed target communication turns and all three children showed higher rates of independent communication responses.

Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors. METHODS: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. RESULTS: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.","Dixon, Brian E; Mukherjee, Sumit; Wiensch, Ashley; Gray, Mary L; Ferres, Juan M Lavista; Grannis, Shaun J",J Med Internet Res,591,16

A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.","Rahman, Md. Mokhlesur; Thill, Jean-Claude; Paul, Kamal Chandra",,591,16

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the pandemic on self-reported outcomes in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI). DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective longitudinal survey study at 2 tertiary centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with AI. INTERVENTION: Patient-centered questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, Short Form-36, and AI self-management. RESULTS: Of 342 patients, 157 (46%) had primary AI, 109 (32%) had secondary AI, and 76 (22%) had glucocorticoid-induced AI. When compared to prepandemic, daily glucocorticoid dose and number of adrenal crises did not change. However, patients reported a higher financial impact from AI (34% vs 23%, Pâ =â 0.006) and difficulty accessing medical care (31% vs 7%, Pâ <â 0.0001) during the pandemic. A third of patients reported difficulty managing AI during the pandemic. After adjusting for duration and subtypes of AI, younger patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.3, CI 95% 1.3-4.1], women (OR 3.7, CI 95% 1.9-7.1), poor healthcare access(OR 4.2, CI 95% 2.3-7.7), lack of good insurance support (OR 2.8, CI 95% 1.3-5.9), and those with a higher financial impact (OR 2.3, CI 95% 1.3-4.3) reported greater difficulties managing AI. Patients were more likely to report a higher anxiety score (&#8805;8) if they found managing AI challenging during the pandemic (OR 3.0, CI 95% 1.3-6.9), and had lower Physical Component Summary (OR 4.9, CI 95% 2.2-11.0) and Mental Component Summary (OR 4.1, CI 95% 1.8-9.5) scores prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A third of patients with AI reported difficulties with management of AI during the pandemic, particularly in younger patients, women, and those with poor healthcare access.","Li, Dingfeng; Suresh, Malavika; Abbondanza, Tiffany; Vaidya, Anand; Bancos, Irina",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,591,1

This study assesses the effects of before and after the lockdown on functionality rates and quality of life (QoL) in patients with ALS. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted. Participants were assessed three times - early January (T0), before mandatory lockdown (T1), and during lockdown (T2) - using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the ALS-Specific Quality of Life-Short Form (ALSSQOL-SF). The paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included with a mean age of 56.9 (SD 14.2) years and mean symptoms onset of 27.1 (SD 14.3) months. ALSFRS-R mean scores decayed significantly over time when comparing T0-T1 (0.26 ± 0.38) and T1-T2 (1.36 ± 1.43) slopes (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between T1 and T2 for ALSSQOL-SF scores (115.31 ± 17.06 vs. 104.31 ± 20.65), especially in four specific domains, and FSS scores (34.06 ± 16.84 vs. 40.09 ± 17.63). Negative correlations between negative emotions and physical symptoms assessed by ALSSQOL-SF and FSS were found. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS: Rehabilitation treatment routines in palliative care, such as physiotherapy and speech therapy, appear to mitigate the ALSFRS-R slope. Prolonged interruption of rehabilitation during the lockdown may have accelerated the functional decline in ALS patients' motor skills with as measured after 2 months by the ALSFRS-R in the limb and bulbar subscores, but not respiratory subscore. Other short-term effects, increased fatigue and negative impact on QoL, were also verified.","Gonçalves, Filipe; Magalhães, Bruno",Palliat Support Care,591,6

This study, which used a cross-sectional correlational design, aimed to assess the levels of fear and health anxiety and to investigate their predictors during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in immunocompromised and chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia. Sociodemographic and clinical data, fear of COVID-19, and health anxiety measurements were collected by online surveys from June 15 to July 15, 2020. Univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors. A total of 1,030 patients in 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. A significant number of patients with chronic diseases experienced considerable levels of fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that 21.44% of participants met the criteria for anxiety cases, and 19.4% were considered borderline anxiety cases. In regression analysis, significant predictors of fear and health anxiety were female gender, lower education, middle-aged, divorced or widowed, receiving immunosuppressants, type of chronic disease (Crohn's disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases), and media use as a source of knowledge about COVID-19. Immunocompromised and chronic disease patients are vulnerable to fear and anxiety during epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Optimizing this population's compliance with appropriate infection prevention and control strategies is crucial during the infectious outbreaks to ensure their safety, to decrease the risk of infection and serious complications, and reduce their fear and health anxiety. Effective positive psychological interventions and support strategies also need to be immediately implemented to increase psychological resilience and improve the mental health of these patients. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia need special attention from health authorities, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to manage maladaptive forms of health anxiety and fear.","Al-Rahimi, Jehan S; Nass, Nada M; Hassoubah, Shahira A; Wazqar, Dhuha Y; Alamoudi, Soha A",PLoS One,591,1

We report on an 80-year old patient with pulmonary, renal, circulatory, and hepatic failure. We decided against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to old age and a SOFA-score of 13. However, the patient was continuously treated with the extracorporeal multi-organ- ""ADVanced Organ Support"" (ADVOS) device (ADVITOS GmbH, Munich, Germany). During eight 24h-treatment-sessions blood flow (100-300 mL/min), dialysate flow (160-320 mL/min) and dialysate pH (7.6-9.0) were adapted to optimize arterial PaCO2 and pH. Effective CO2 removal and correction of acidosis could be demonstrated by mean arterial- versus post-dialyzer values of pCO2 (68.7 ± 13.8 vs. 26.9 ± 11.6 mmHg; p < 0.001). The CO2-elimination rate was 48 ± 23mL/min. The initial vasopressor requirement could be reduced in parallel to pH-normalization. Interruptions of ADVOS-treatment repeatedly resulted in reversible deteriorations of paCO2 and pH. After 95 h of continuous extracorporeal decarboxylating therapy the patient had markedly improved circulatory parameters compared to baseline. In the context of secondary pulmonary infection and progressive liver failure, the patient had a sudden cardiac arrest. In accordance with the presumed patient will, we decided against mechanical resuscitation. Irrespective of the outcome we conclude that extracorporeal CO2 removal and multiorgan-support were feasible in this COVID-19-patient. Combined and less invasive approaches such as ADVOS might be considered in old-age-COVID-19 patients with MOF.","Huber, Wolfgang; Lorenz, Georg; Heilmaier, Markus; Böttcher, Katrin; Sahm, Philipp; Middelhoff, Moritz; Ritzer, Barbara; Schulz, Dominik; Bekka, Elias; Hesse, Felix; Poszler, Alexander; Geisler, Fabian; Spinner, Christoph; Schmid, Roland M; Lahmer, Tobias",Int J Artif Organs,591,23

Sound preparation is required during pre-registration nursing education to enable student nurses to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent and control healthcare-associated infection and promote patient safety. Few studies have explored nursing students' education and training in aseptic technique. OBJECTIVES: To investigate what, when and how pre-registration nursing students are taught aseptic technique and how they are assessed in undergraduate, pre-registration nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: National cross-sectional survey exploring preparation to undertake aseptic technique in pre-registration nursing curricula in the United Kingdom. SETTING: Universities providing undergraduate, pre-registration adult nursing programmes in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Nurse educators. METHODS: Structured telephone interviews were conducted with nurse educators. Descriptive and inferential statistical data analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Response rate was 70% (n = 49/70). A variety of different learning and teaching methods were reported to be in use. Teaching in relation to aseptic technique took place in conjunction with teaching in relation to different clinical procedures rather than placing emphasis on the principles of asepsis per se and how to transfer them to different procedures and situations. Wide variation in teaching time; use of multiple guidelines; inaccuracy in the principles identified by educators as taught to students; and limited opportunity for regular, criteria based competency assessment were apparent across programmes.

We sought to determine the change in rates and types of admissions to tertiary and specialty care hospitals in the COVID-19 era compared with pre-COVID-19 era. METHODS: Acute care admissions to the largest tertiary care referral hospital, designated national referral centers for cardiac, cancer and maternity hospital in the State of Qatar during March 2020 (COVID-19 era) and January 2020 and March 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) were compared. We calculated total admissions, admissions for eight specific acute care conditions, in-hospital mortality rate, and length of stay at each hospital. RESULTS: A total of 18,889 hospital admissions were recorded. A sharp decline ranging from 9% to 75% was observed in overall admissions. A decline in both elective and non-elective surgeries was observed. A decline of 9%-58% was observed in admissions for acute appendicitis, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, bone fractures, cancer, and live births, whereas an increase in admissions due to respiratory tract infections was observed. Overall length of stay was shorter in the COVID-19 period possibly suggesting lesser overall disease severity, with no significant change in in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted mortality rate for Qatar showed marginal increase in the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a sharp decline in acute care hospital admissions, with a significant decline in admissions due to seven out of eight acute care conditions. This decline was associated with a shorter length of stay but not associated with a change in in-hospital mortality rate.","Butt, A A; Kartha, A B; Masoodi, N A; Azad, A M; Asaad, N A; Alhomsi, M U; Saleh, H A H; Bertollini, R; Abou-Samra, A-B",Public Health,591,1

Current circumstances, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, are even forcing the introduction of distributed collaboration in product development. Regarding to the Covid-19 pandemic, in many cases the transition was completed in a short time and even unplanned. The transition to a distributed approach creates new, unexpected problems in the collaboration of distributed product development teams, which have to be solved continuously. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a concept that offers methods for the continuous improvement of distributed collaboration that are appropriate to the specific circumstances. Following a literature search, 135 participants were asked about the need for methodological support in identifying and developing improvement potentials in distributed collaboration. The demand was confirmed by the majority of participants. Consequently, a concept was developed to methodically support the improvement process. The developed concept was designed as an interactive tool, which offers the user methods for methodical approach to improvement potentials in accordance with his needs and resources. The basis is the problem-solving methodology SPALTEN. For a standardized and comprehensive description of the methods, fact sheets were prepared. The tool and the concept were evaluated in the industry in a distributed and agile development simulator. The evaluation confirmed the added benefit of the methodical support for the improvement process in the distributed collaboration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Evidence from NSE,16.406822,1.650954,2020,"BACKGROUND: Neutralization tests (NT) are the gold standard for detecting and quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAb), but their complexity restricts them to research settings or reference laboratories. Antibodies against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to confer a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Assays quantitatively measuring anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be of great value for NAb screening of potential donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy, assessing natural or vaccine-induced immunity, stratifying individuals for vaccine receipt, and documenting vaccine response. METHODS: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S), a high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for quantitative measurement of pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, was evaluated against NT on 357 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory using a Slovenian SARS-CoV-2 isolate; the NT titer &#8805;1:20 was considered positive. RESULTS: Elecsys-S detected pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 352/357 (98.6 %) samples. NAb were identified by NT in 257/357 (72 %) samples. The Elecsys-S/NT agreement was moderate (Cohen's kappa 0.56). High NT titer antibodies (&#8805;1:160) were detected in 106/357 (30 %) samples. Elecsys-S's pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations correlated with individual NT titer categories (the lowest concentrations were identified in NT-negative samples and the highest in samples with NT titer 1:1,280), and the Elecsys-S cutoff value for reasonable prediction of NAb generated after natural infection was established (133 BAU/mL). CONCLUSION: Although NT should remain the gold standard for assessing candidates for convalescent-phase plasma donors, selected commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays with optimized cutoff, like Elecsys-S, could be used for rapid, automated, and large-scale screening of individuals with clinically relevant NAb levels as suitable donors.","Resman Rus, Katarina; Korva, Misa; Knap, Natasa; Avsic Zupanc, Tatjana; Poljak, Mario",J Clin Virol,591,9

As of 18th July 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 13 million confirmed cases including close to 600,000 deaths across 216 countries and territories. Despite several government measures, India has gradually moved up the ranks to become the third worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US and Brazil, thus causing widespread anxiety and fear among her citizens. As majority of the world's population continues to remain confined to their homes, more and more people have started relying on social media platforms such as Twitter for expressing their feelings and attitudes towards various aspects of the pandemic. With rising concerns of mental well-being, it becomes imperative to analyze the dynamics of public affect in order to anticipate any potential threats and take precautionary measures. Since affective states of human mind are more nuanced than meager binary sentiments, here we propose a deep learning-based system to identify people's emotions from their tweets. We achieve competitive results on two benchmark datasets for multi-label emotion classification. We then use our system to analyze the evolution of emotional responses among Indians as the pandemic continues to spread its wings. We also study the development of salient factors contributing towards the changes in attitudes over time. Finally, we discuss directions to further improve our work and hope that our analysis can aid in better public health monitoring.","Mukherjee, Rajdeep; Poddar, Sriyash; Naik, Atharva; Dasgupta, Soham",,591,18

This article aims to understand the relevant factors that affect SARS-COV-2 clearance time. METHODS: The clinical data of 115 COVID-19 patients with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid positive time exceeding 14 days were collected retrospectively, and the relationship between clinical characteristics, chest CT scans, blood cells, biochemical indicators, and the time of viral nucleic acid turning negative were analyzed. RESULTS: The time from symptom onsets to nucleic acid turning negative was (32.5 ± 8.7) days in this group of patients. The time of nucleic acid turning negative: no fever group was longer than fever group, diabetes group was longer than no comorbidity group, elevated levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), or GLU (fasting blood glucose) group, decreased levels of ALB (albumin) group or HDLC (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) group was longer than it's normal group separately (P < 0.05). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that ALT [odds ratio (OR): 2.164 (95% CI: 1.276-3.670), P = 0.004], GLU [OR: 2.064 (95% CI: 1.195-3.566), P = 0.009] and HDLC [OR: 0.527 (95% CI: 0.307-0.907), P = 0.021] were independent factors which affected the time of nucleic acid turning negative. CONCLUSIONS: ALT, GLU and HDLC were independent factors that influenced the time of nucleic acid turning negative. Although diabetes or hyperglycemia is a known risk factor, HDLC is the first to be identified, clinicians should be aware of dyslipidemia in covid-19 patients.","Ding, Xinmin; Zhang, Jie; Liu, Lifei; Yuan, Xiaodong; Zang, Xuefeng; Lu, Feiping; He, Ping; Wang, Qian; Zhang, Xiaomeng; Xu, Yimin; Li, Xiang; Liu, Ying; Li, Qun; Tan, Xuebing; Zheng, Yunhui; Lin, Xue; Liu, Yuhang",Respir Med,591,16

However, older adults do not complete ACP at expected rates due to patient and clinician barriers. We present the original design, methods and rationale for a trial aimed at improving ACP for older patients with advanced cancer and the modified protocol in response to changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Advance Care Planning: Promoting Effective and Aligned Communication in the Elderly study is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial examining a Comprehensive ACP Program. The programme combines two complementary evidence-based interventions: clinician communication skills training (VitalTalk) and patient video decision aids (ACP Decisions). We will implement the programme at 36 oncology clinics across three unique US health systems. Our primary outcome is the proportion of eligible patients with ACP documentation completed in the electronic health record. Our secondary outcomes include resuscitation preferences, palliative care consultations, death, hospice use and final cancer-directed therapy. From a subset of our patient population, we will collect surveys and video-based declarations of goals and preferences. We estimate 11 000 patients from the three sites will be enrolled in the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Regulatory and ethical aspects of this trial include Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval via single IRB of record mechanism at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Data Use Agreements among partners and a Data Safety and Monitoring Board.

Population density scaling models revealed residual variance and skewness to be sensitive indicators of the dynamics of propagation. Lockdowns and schools reopening triggered increased variance indicative of outbreaks with local impact and country scale heterogeneity. University reopening and December holidays triggered reduced variance indicative of country scale homogenisation which reached a minimum in mid-January 2021. Homogeneous propagation was associated with better correspondence with normally distributed residuals while heterogeneous propagation was more consistent with skewed models. Skewness varied from strongly negative to strongly positive revealing an unappreciated feature of community propagation. Hot spots and super-spreading events are well understood descriptors of regional disease dynamics that would be expected to be associated with positively skewed distributions. Positively skewed behaviour was observed; however, negative skewness indicative of cold-spots and super-isolation dominated for approximately 8 months during the period of study. In contrast, death metrics showed near constant behaviour in scaling, variance, and skewness metrics over the full period with rural regions preferentially affected, an observation consistent with regional age demographics in England and Wales. Regional positions relative to density scaling laws were remarkably persistent after the first 5-9 days of the available data set. The determinants of this persistent behaviour probably precede the pandemic and remain unchanged.","Sutton, Jack; Shahtahmassebi, Golnaz; Ribeiro, Haroldo V.; Hanley, Quentin S.",,591,21

CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic situation and the strict confinement measures have had a significant impact on the school population, who had experienced the greatest restrictions. Household infrastructure has been shown to be a clear differentiator that deepens social inequalities and the impact that the situation has on school children. More studies are needed on the long-term psychosocial impact of this situation on their physical and mental health.","Tíscar-González, Verónica; Santiago-Garín, Jaione; Moreno-Casbas, Teresa; Zorrilla-Martínez, Iñaki; Nonide-Robles, Marta; Portuondo-Jiménez, Janire","Gac. sanit.

However, little is known about which pandemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in four age groups in the Polish population during the COVID-19 lockdown; (ii) differences in perceived difficulties related to the pandemic in these groups; and (iii) which factors and difficulties related to the pandemic are the best predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHOD: A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, a Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, a Social Support Scale, and a Scale of Pandemic-Related Difficulties. RESULTS: Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Household relationship difficulties were among the most significant predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus was one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18 and 29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms exclusively in the youngest group. CONCLUSIONS: The youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members are the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the various challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gambin, Malgorzata; Sekowski, Marcin; Wozniak-Prus, Malgorzata; Wnuk, Anna; Oleksy, Tomasz; Cudo, Andrzej; Hansen, Karolina; Huflejt-Lukasik, Miroslawa; Kubicka, Karolina; Lys, Agnieszka Ewa; Gorgol, Joanna; Holas, Pawel; Kmita, Grazyna; Lojek, Emilia; Maison, Dominika",Compr Psychiatry,591,16

Black breast cancer patients face significant disparities in stage of presentation, surgical management, and mortality. The objective of this editorial is to examine the possible implications of the surgical delay imposed by the pandemic on black breast cancer patients. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons, the Society of Surgical Oncology, and the American Society of Breast Surgeons recommendations for surgical delay during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were evaluated and discussed. RESULTS: Guidelines by major surgical organizations on surgical delay for breast cancer patients may inadvertently exacerbate disparities in time to surgery for black breast cancer patients. Our recommendations to better characterize the impact of these guidelines on surgical delay among vulnerable populations include the following: (1) track time from biopsy-proven diagnosis to surgery by race and ethnicity, (2) document patient and institution-related reasons for surgical delay, (3) record patient and disease-related variables/reasons for the selection of breast conservation surgery, mastectomy, and reconstruction by race and ethnicity, and (4) collect data on impactful social determinants of health such as financial reserve, housing conditions, stress, and transportation. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate delays in time to surgery among black breast cancer patients. Surgeons should incorporate collection of social determinants of health into their clinical practice to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic disparities in surgical management.","Obeng-Gyasi, Samilia; Oppong, Bridget; Paskett, Electra D; Lustberg, Maryam",Breast Cancer Res Treat,591,15

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of HILT in patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: We conducted a search of articles in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases up to March 2020 for randomized controlled trials investigating HILT intervention, placebo, or active intervention as comparator groups for alleviating pain in knee osteoarthritis. Two independent reviewers evaluated the methodological quality and extracted pain and functional outcomes using a pre-specified form. A meta-analysis was performed using an inverse-variance random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I2 with p-values. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. For VAS pain, 334 patients from four studies showed that HILT significantly decreased pain compared to the control (MD, -1.18; 95% CI, -1.68 to -0.69). HILT significantly improved WOMAC stiffness (SMD -1.00; 95% CI -1.32, -0.68) and function (SMD, -5.36; 95% CI -7.39 to -3.34) compared to the control. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of HILT on pain, stiffness, and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis is promising. However, due to the limited number of studies, further randomized controlled trials with large, well-designed samples are needed.","Song, Hyun-Jin; Seo, Hyun-Ju; Kim, Donghwi",J. back musculoskelet. rehabil,591,16

METHODS: A validated electronic survey was administered May-June, 2020 to US medical oncologists (MO), radiation oncologists (RO), and surgeons (SO) involved in clinical trials organizations. Questions on NET use included practice patterns for locoregional management following NET. RESULTS: 114 Physicians from 29 states completed the survey-42 (37%) MO, 14 (12%) RO, and 58 (51%) SO. Before COVID-19, most used NET 'rarely' (49/107, 46%) or 'sometimes' (36, 33%) for ER + BC. 46% would delay surgery 2 months without NET. The preferred NET regimen was tamoxifen for premenopausal and aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. 53% planned short term NET until surgery could proceed. Most recommended omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for one micrometastatic node after 1, 2, or 3 months of NET (1 month, N = 56/93, 60%; 2 months, N = 54/92, 59%; 3 months, N = 48/90, 53%). With longer duration of NET, omission of ALND decreased, regardless of years in practice, percent of practice in BC, practice type, participation in multidisciplinary tumor board, or number of regional COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: More physicians preferred NET for ER + BC during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic times. As the duration of NET extended, more providers favored ALND in low volume metastatic axillary disease. The Covid-19 pandemic affected practice of ER + BC; it remains to be seen how this may impact outcomes.","Park, Ko Un; Gregory, Megan; Bazan, Joey; Lustberg, Maryam; Rosenberg, Shoshana; Blinder, Victoria; Sharma, Priyanka; Pusztai, Lajos; Shen, Chengli; Partridge, Ann; Thompson, Alastair",Breast cancer res. treat,591,24

STUDY DESIGN: Beginning March 22, 2020, all pregnant women from one large obstetrical practice in New York City were contacted regularly to inquire about symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, anosmia), or sick contacts. A running log was kept of these patients, as well as all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing. For this report, we included every patient with suspected COVID-19 infection, which was defined as at least two symptoms, or a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020 until April 30, 2020, 757 pregnant women in our practice were evaluated and 92 had known or suspected COVID-19 (12.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.0-14.7%). Of these 92 women, 33 (36%) had positive COVID-19 test results. Only one woman required hospital admission for 5 days due to COVID-19 (1.1%, 95% CI: 0.2-5.9%). One other woman received home oxygen. No women required mechanical ventilation and there were no maternal deaths. One woman had an unexplained fetal demise at 14 weeks' gestation around the time of her COVID-19 symptoms. Twenty one of the 92 women have delivered, and all were uncomplicated. CONCLUSIONS: Among 92 women with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, the overall morbidity was low. These preliminary results are encouraging for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Years of inadequate funding of the nation's federal, state, and local public health agencies, together with mismanagement by the Trump administration, hampered the early response to the epidemic. Meanwhile, barriers to care faced by uninsured and underinsured individuals in the United States could deter COVID-19 care and hamper containment efforts, and lead to adverse medical and financial outcomes for infected individuals and their families, particularly those from disadvantaged groups. While the United States has a relatively generous supply of Intensive Care Unit beds and most other health care infrastructure, such medical resources are often unevenly distributed or deployed, leaving some areas ill-prepared for a severe respiratory epidemic. These deficiencies and shortfalls have stimulated a debate about policy solutions. Recent legislation, for instance, expanded coverage for testing for COVID-19 for the uninsured and underinsured, and additional reforms have been proposed. However comprehensive health care reform - for example, via national health insurance - is needed to provide full protection to American families during the COVID-19 outbreak and in its aftermath.","Gaffney, Adam; Himmelstein, David U; Woolhandler, Steffie",Int J Health Serv,591,1

To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. RESULTS: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78 %) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children's development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.","Segre, G; Campi, R; Scarpellini, F; Clavenna, A; Zanetti, M; Cartabia, M; Bonati, M",BMC Pediatr,591,9

Short-term elevations in GC levels are necessary for survival, whereas longer-term changes can lead to reduced reproductive output and immunosuppression. Persistent environmental contaminants (ECs) are widespread globally. Experimental exposure of individuals to ECs is associated with varying GC responses, within, and across, species and contaminants. Individuals exposed to ECs over long durations are expected to have prolonged GC elevations, which likely affect their health. We conducted a meta-analysis to test for a relationship between fish GC levels and experimental exposure to ECs, and to explore potential moderators, including duration of exposure, that could help explain the variation in effect sizes within and between studies. We report almost exclusively on cortisol responses of teleost fish to ECs. Although there was much variation in effect sizes, captive-bred fish exposed to ECs had baseline GC levels 1.5× higher than unexposed fish, and fish exposed to pharmaceuticals (estradiols and stimulants being mainly considered) had baseline GC levels approximately 2.5× higher than unexposed fish. We found that captive-bred and wild-caught fish did not differ in GC levels after exposure to the same classes of ECs - studies on captive bred fish may thus enable inferences about GC responses to ECs for wild species. Furthermore, effect sizes did not differ between baseline and challenge-induced GC measures. In different analyses, duration of exposure was negatively correlated to effect size, suggesting that the GC response may acclimate after chronic exposure to some ECs which could potentially alter the GC response of EC-exposed fish to novel stressors. Future studies should explore the effect of multiple stressors on the fish GC response and perform tests on a broader array of contaminant types and vertebrate classes.","Rohonczy, Jillian; O039,; Dwyer, Katie; Rochette, Alicia; Robinson, Stacey A; Forbes, Mark R",Sci Total Environ,591,10

Misophonia is a complex neurophysiological and behavioral disorder of multifactorial origin, characterized by an intense physiological and emotional response produced by intolerance to auditory stimuli of the same pattern, regardless of physical properties. The present work studied the secondary impact that strict confinement caused in 342 adults (224 women: 118 men) regularly attending a medical psychological center in Barcelona. Misophonia, usually underdiagnosed, showed a prevalence of 35%, the same for women (37%) than men (31%). A retrospective analysis using a physical-psychological-social inventory of 10 variables evaluated the number of individuals that during confinement and self-confinement (March 11 - June 29, 2020) canceled (mostly M-) and/or requested a therapeutic intervention, the reasons for their request, and the strategies they used to self-manage the situation. Ten main variables indicated that the confinement exponentially increased the effects of misophonia compared with results from the same individuals during the last quarter of 2019. Most people diagnosed with misophonia continued with tele-assistance during the confinement because of this impact's self-concern. Besides the impacts as part of the general population, M+ also developed different symptoms causing significant personal, social, and job/occupational imbalance, as compared to M-. Health, fears, conflicts with neighbors, study-related difficulties were outstanding reasons for consultations. The LSB-50 test for 'Psychological and Psychosomatic Symptoms' applied to M+ revealed the increase of 8 of 9 items of this psychopathological test. Sleep disorders (coronasomnia), hostility, depression, and somatization were more severe than in previous assessments. Women presented the worst psychological and psychosomatic states (eight out of nine, as compared to one out of nine in males). The study unveiled the complex physical-psychological-social burden, the need for dissemination and a gender perspective to understand the secondary impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the population with misophonia. The results also show that in this new COVID era people suffering from misophonia need to develop coping strategies addressing modifiable risk and protective factors. They deserve familial/social comprehension, stronger clinical support and a gender medicine perspective.","Ferrer-Torres, A.; Gimenez-Llort, L.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,591,1

Because coronavirus potentially diversifies by mutation, broadly neutralizing Abs are especially sought. Here, we report a possibly novel approach to rapid generation of potent broadly neutralizing human anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.7 × 10-12 M to 6.7 × 10-15 M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC50 < 6.7 × 10-12 M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","de Mattos Barbosa, Mayara Garcia; Liu, Hui; Huynh, Daniel; Shelley, Greg; Keller, Evan T; Emmer, Brian T; Sherman, Emily; Ginsburg, David; Kennedy, Andrew A; Tai, Andrew W; Wobus, Christiane; Mirabeli, Carmen; Lanigan, Thomas M; Samaniego, Milagros; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Prak, Eline T Luning; Platt, Jeffrey L; Cascalho, Marilia",JCI insight,591,30

Pregnant women aged 18 to 40 years with laboratory-proven exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (group A, n = 300) will be compared to control subjects with no laboratory evidence of in-pregnancy exposure to the virus (group B, n = 300). Subjects exposed to other infections during pregnancy will be excluded. The BORN substudy is a long-term follow-up study assessing the offspring of women who entered the prior substudy. It will describe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 exposure during pregnancy on children's growth, neurodevelopment and metabolism from birth up to five years of age. It includes two comparison groups: group A (exposed, n = 300) comprises children born from SARS-CoV-2-exposed pregnancies, and group B (controls, n = 300) comprises children from nonexposed mothers. RESULTS: Recruitment began in July 2020, and as of September 2020, 115 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 80 newborns had been included. Data analysis is scheduled to start after all data have been collected. CONCLUSIONS: Upon completion of the study, we expect to have obtained comprehensive data to provide a better understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its inflammatory and immunological processes on pregnancy, puerperium and infancy. Our findings will inform clinical decisions regarding the care of exposed mothers and children and support the development of evidence-based public health policies.

However, it does place persons who are socially or politically marginalized, including those who are of lower socio-economic status, at risk of further harms. In other words, marginalized or disadvantaged persons are at risk of both contracting SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of harms that may come about because of the social distancing measures themselves. Finally, a third layer of risk faced by marginalized persons would be the overuse of utility (i.e., maximize the benefit of resource x) as the primary ethics principle upon which to make allocation decisions, since oftentimes it is resource-intensive to help those in positions of social marginality. This three-fold risk of harm to which marginalized persons are subjected runs counter to the very notion of social justice that underpins public health. Social distancing in a socially just manner requires dialoguing with affected populations and providing social supports to marginalized persons, regardless of the associated costs.","Silva, Diego S; Smith, Maxwell J",Can J Public Health,591,17

A clear and unambiguous understanding of a positive work environment, as perceived by healthcare professionals, is crucial for gaining systematic objective insights into the work environment. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on the concept of a positive work environment in the hospital. METHODS: This was a three-round Delphi study to establish consensus on what defines a positive work environment. A literature review and 17 semi-structured interviews with experts (transcribed and analyzed by open and thematic coding) were used to generate items for the Delphi study. RESULTS: The literature review revealed 228 aspects that were clustered into 48 work environment elements, 38 of which were mentioned in the interviews also. After three Delphi rounds, 36 elements were regarded as belonging to a positive work environment in the hospital. DISCUSSION: The work environment is a broad concept with several perspectives. Although all 36 elements are considered important for a positive work environment, they have different perspectives. Mapping the included elements revealed that no one work environment measurement tool includes all the elements. CONCLUSION: We identified 36 elements that are important for a positive work environment. This knowledge can be used to select the right measurement tool or to develop interventions for improving the work environment. However, the different perspectives of the work environment should be considered.","Maassen, Susanne M; van Oostveen, Catharina; Vermeulen, Hester; Weggelaar, Anne Marie",PLoS One,591,26

Despite bearing some resemblance with traditional distributed training, FL has four distinct challenges that complicate the optimization towards shorter time-to-accuracy: information deficiency, coupling for contrasting factors, client heterogeneity, and huge configuration space. Motivated by the need for inspiring related research, in this paper we survey highly relevant attempts in the FL literature and organize them by the related training phases in the standard workflow: selection, configuration, and reporting. We also review exploratory work including measurement studies and benchmarking tools to friendly support FL developers.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the recovery and detection of infectious and heat-inactivated (65 °C for 30 min) SARS-CoV-2 from stainless steel by the modified US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Diagnostic Panel. METHODS: Viral stocks were diluted in viral transport medium and deposited onto stainless steel test areas at 2 x 103 and 2 x 104 genomic copies for low and high, respectively. Test areas were sampled, and aliquots of the resulting test solutions analyzed by RT-qPCR according to the CDC method. Results were analyzed by Probability of Detection (POD) statistics. RESULTS: The low level, where fractional positive results (25-75%) are expected, yielded PODI = 0.80 (0.58, 0.92) for the infectious virus and PODHI = 0.15 (0.05, 0.36) for the heat-inactivated virus. The bias, dPODHI = -0.65 (-0.80, -0.35), demonstrated a statistical difference between infectious and heat-inactivated virus detection. No difference was observed at the high inoculation level. CONCLUSION: Despite the statistical difference observed, the use of the heat-inactivated virus is a viable alternative for matrix extension studies using a method comparison study design. HIGHLIGHTS: The use of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 can mitigate the need for a BSL-3 facility for matrix extension validation of alternative methods in SARS-CoV-2 studies.","Brunelle, Sharon L; Bird, Patrick M; Boone, Jeremy; Nelson, Maria; Johnson, Zerlinde; Coates, Scott",J.

The lukewarm response of active value capture mechanisms such as betterment levies in Australia is also discussed.Design/methodology/approachA case study of the Sydney Metro City and Southwest (SMCSW) project in Sydney is used to illustrate passive value capture mechanisms.FindingsUnlike many developed countries, passive value capture mechanisms have been adopted in Australia. This approach is an effective form of value capture mechanisms to capture the value uplift to offset the total development cost of the SMCSW project. However, this approach is highly sensitive to property transaction activities that could be affected by the general economic conditions and unprecedented events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, there is a widespread discussion of the efficiency of land tax in New South Wales (NSW) in capturing all properties subject to the value uplift. Consequently, a shift towards a broad-based land tax is recommended in which it would provide a more efficient way of infrastructure funding.Practical implicationsPolicymakers should consider a broad-based land tax for residential and commercial properties in order to improve the efficiency of passive value capture mechanisms. This also highlights property valuers should play a greater role in the development of broad-based land tax system.Originality/valuePrevious studies have extensively demonstrated property value impacts of transit investments;very little research assesses the growth of value capture funding mechanisms, particularly passive value capture mechanisms. Specifically, this paper is the first paper to assess the effectiveness of passive value capture mechanisms.","Chyi Lin, Lee Locke Martin",Journal of Property Investment &amp; Finance,591,20

Crises like these can harm the academic functioning and psychophysical health of nursing students. With this qualitative study, we aim to explore how students perceive the COVID-19 crisis and what their personal experiences were while studying during the global pandemic. In the study, data saturation was achieved after analyzing the reports of 33 undergraduate nursing students, using the inductive thematic saturation method. Data were collected using an online form, which students filled out, describing their perceptions and experiences. Qualitative inductive content analysis of students’ reports resulted in 29 codes, indicating different student perceptions of the efficiency of state institutions in crises. All students described the spread of misinformation on social networks and the risky behavior of the population. Most are afraid of infection and worried about the well-being of their family, so they constantly apply protective measures. Students recognize their responsibility to the community and the importance and risks of the nursing profession. They also describe negative experiences with public transportation and residence in the student dorm. The fear of possible infection in the classroom is not significant, however, students are afraid of the clinical settings. Thirteen students reported difficulty in concentrating and learning, while all students praised teacher support and faculty work in this crisis.","Lovrić, Robert; Farčić, Nikolina; Mikšić, Štefica; Včev, Aleksandar",Educ.

In this study we employ a new approach to elucidate the composition of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) of a prototypical arbovirus called Sindbis (SINV). SINV RNPs contain 453 cellular and 6 viral proteins, many of these proteins are nuclear in uninfected cells and redistribute to the cytoplasm upon infection. These findings suggest that SINV RNAs act as spiderwebs, capturing host factors required for viral replication and gene expression in the cytoplasm. Functional perturbation of several of these host proteins causes profound effects in virus infection, as illustrated here with the tRNA ligase complex. Moreover, inhibition of viral RNP components with available drugs hampers the infection of a wide range of viruses, opening new avenues for the development of broad-spectrum therapies.

Methods: We collected demographic data, medical histories, clinical courses and outcomes of 1 350 COVID-19 patients reported in Guangdong as of 4 March 2020 via epidemiological investigation and process tracking. Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. Results: Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal. The median duration of illness were 23 days (P(25)-P(75): 18-31 days) and the median length of hospitalization were 20 days (P(25)-P(75): 15-27 days). For severe cases, the median time of showing severe manifestations was on the 12th day after onset (P(25)-P(75): 9th to 15th days), and the median time of severe manifestation lasted for 8 days P(25)-P(75): 4-14 days). Among 1 066 discharged/fetal cases, 36.4% (36/99) and 1.0% (1/99) of the mild cases developed to ordinary cases and severe cases respectively after admission; and 5.2% (50/968) and 0.6% (6/968) of the ordinary cases developed to severe cases, and critical cases respectively after admission. In severe cases, 11.4% developed to critical cases (10/88). The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (aHR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.43-2.46), older age (aHR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (aHR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (aHR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (aHR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.06-2.09). Conclusions: The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes. The severe cases were mainly occurred in populations at high risk. In the epidemic period, classified management of COVID-19 cases should be promoted according to needs for control and prevention of isolation and treatment for the purpose of rational allocation of medical resources.","Zhang, Y T; Deng, A P; Hu, T; Chen, X G; Zhuang, Y L; Tan, X H; Zhen, H Z; Sun, L M; Li, Y; Zhong, H J; He, J F; Song, T; Kang, M",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,591,24

Monitoring trends in HIV-related care outcomes is needed to inform programs aimed at reducing new HIV infections in the United States. SETTING: The setting is 33 United States jurisdictions that as of December 2019 had complete laboratory reporting for specimens through September 2019. METHODS: Estimated annual percent change (EAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess trends in stage of disease at time of diagnosis, linkage to HIV medical care within 1 month after HIV diagnosis, and viral suppression within 6 months after HIV diagnosis. Differences in percentages were analyzed by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and transmission category for persons with HIV diagnosed from 2014-2018. RESULTS: Among 133,477 persons with HIV diagnosed during 2014-2018, the percentage of persons that received a diagnosis classified as stage 0 increased 13.7% , stages 1-2 (early infections) increased 2.9%, stage 3 (AIDS) declined 1.5%, linkage to HIV medical care within 1 month after HIV diagnosis increased 2.3%, and viral suppression within 6 months after HIV diagnosis increased 6.5% per year, on average. Subpopulations and areas that showed the least progress were persons aged 45-54 years, American Indian/Alaska Native persons, Asian persons, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander persons, and rural areas with substantial HIV prevalence.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional associations of AT-IR with fat mass and distribution, and IR-related cardiometabolic variables were examined in 210 young and 148 middle-aged women whose average body mass index (BMI) was <23 kg/m2 and waist was <80 cm. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify most important determinants of AT-IR. RESULTS: Young and middle-aged women did not differ in AT-IR (3.5±2.7 and 3.2±2.1, respectively). In both young and middle-aged women, AT-IR was positively associated with trunk/leg fat ratio, a sophisticated measure of abdominal fat accumulation, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting triglycerides (FTG), serum alanine aminotransferase and Î³-glutamyl-transpeptidase (all p<0.05). Furthermore, in middle-aged but not in young women, AT-IR showed positive associations with BMI, waist, fat mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (all p<0.05). AT-IR showed no association with hemoglobin A1c, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 in two groups of women. On multivariate analysis including waist, FPG, FTG, HDL cholesterol and systolic BP as independent variables, FPG, FTG and HDL cholesterol emerged as independent determinants of AT-IR in young women (cumulative R2=0.141) and waist in middle-aged women (cumulative R2=0.056). In a model which included trunk/leg fat ratio instead of waist, trunk/leg fat ratio and systolic BP were determinants of AT-IR in middle-aged women (cumulative R2=0.093). Results did not alter in young women. CONCLUSIONS: AT-IR may be a simple and useful surrogate index of adipose tissue insulin resistance even in populations without diabetes and obesity.","Kitaoka, Kaori; Tsuboi, Ayaka; Minato-Inokawa, Satomi; Honda, Mari; Takeuchi, Mika; Yano, Megumu; Kurata, Miki; Wu, Bin; Kazumi, Tsutomu; Fukuo, Keisuke",,591,2

We discuss the challenges related to data curation. A causal model is employed for forecasting with one free time-varying parameter, calibrated against case data. The model is then run forward in time to obtain multiple forecasts. We retrospectively evaluate the performance and, while forecast quality suffers during the campus reopening phase, the model makes reasonable forecasts as the fall semester progresses.

The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on the Orthopedic and Trauma departments, focusing on: hospital reorganization (flexibility, workload, prevalence of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, standards of care); effects on staff; subjective orthopedic perception of the pandemic. Material and Methods: Data regarding 1390 patients and 323 surgeons were retrieved from a retrospective multicentric database, involving 14 major hospitals. The subjective directors' viewpoints regarding the economic consequences, communication with the government, hospital administration and other departments were collected. Results: Surgical procedures dropped by 73%, compared to 2019, elective surgery was interrupted. Forty percent of patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2: 7% with positive results. Seven percent of the patients received medical therapy for COVID-19, and only 48% of these treated patients had positive swab tests. Eleven percent of surgeons developed COVID-19 and 6% were contaminated. Fourteen percent of the staff were redirected daily to COVID units. Communication with the Government was perceived as adequate, whilst communication with medical Authorities was considered barely sufficient. Conclusions: Activity reduction was mandatory; the screening of carriers did not seem to be reliable and urgent activities were performed with a shortage of workers and a slower workflow. A trauma network and dedicated in-hospital paths for COVID-19-patients were created. This experience provided evidence for coordinated responses in order to avoid the propagation of errors.","Aprato, Alessandro; Guindani, Nicola; Massè, Alessandro; Castelli, Claudio C; Cipolla, Alessandra; Antognazza, Delia; Benazzo, Francesco; Bove, Federico; Casiraghi, Alessandro; Catani, Fabio; Dallari, Dante; D039,; Apolito, Rocco; Franceschini, Massimo; Momoli, Alberto; Ravasi, Flavio; Rivera, Fabrizio; Zagra, Luigi; Zatti, Giovanni; Angelo, Fabio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),591,13

This adversity is amplified in applicants from medical schools without a home plastic surgery residency program and academic division. There is a paucity of data on the advantage of medical students applying from an institution with a home residency program. Applicant data from the past 5 years were accessed from the Association of American Medical Colleges Electronic Residency Application Services statistics form. Individual home programs of successfully matched applicants were collected from plastic surgery residency websites. A survey was distributed to 32 students pursuing specialty residencies from home medical schools without a plastic surgery residency. Evaluation of a subset of incoming plastic surgery interns revealed that 72% of matched applicants attended home medical institutions with plastic surgery residency programs. Seventy-seven percent of survey respondents felt strongly that students at institutions with home residency programs had a significant advantage. The current COVID pandemic is changing the landscape of subinternships and bringing to light the disadvantage students face without home residency programs. The development of virtual subinternships, online mentorship, and selection of students for subinternships from geographic areas without home programs may help address some disparities in educational opportunities. Continuing these virtual programs and offering preferential help to disadvantaged medical students permanently is an avenue for the field of plastic surgery to be a leader in diversity and inclusion.","Baghchechi, Mohsen; Oviedo, Parisa; McLean, Paige; Dean, Riley; Dobke, Marek",Ann. plast. sur,591,1

As a result, QAC consumption has increased more than twice during the pandemic. Consequently, the concentration of QACs in wastewater and receiving environments may increase. Due to their antimicrobial activity, high levels of QACs in wastewater may cause malfunctioning of biological treatment systems resulting in inadequate treatment of wastewater. In this study, a biocatalyst was produced by entrapping Pseudomonas sp. BIOMIG1 capable of degrading QACs in calcium alginate. Bioactive 3-mm alginate beads degraded benzalkonium chlorides (BACs), a group of QACs, with a rate of 0.47 µM-BACs/h in shake flasks. A bench-scale continuous up-flow reactor packed with BIOMIG1-beads was operated over one and a half months with either synthetic wastewater or secondary effluent containing 2-20 µM BACs at an empty bed contact time (EBCT) ranging between 0.6 and 4.7 h. Almost complete BAC removal was achieved from synthetic and real wastewater at and above 1.2 h EBCT without aeration and effluent recirculation. The microbial community in beads dominantly composed of BIOMIG1 with trace number of Achromobacter spp. after the operation of the reactor with the real wastewater, suggesting that BIOMIG1 over-competed native wastewater bacteria during the operation. This reactor system offers a low cost and robust treatment of QACs in wastewater. It can be integrated to conventional treatment systems for efficient removal of QACs from the wastewater, especially during the pandemic period.","Sakarya, Fahri Koray; Haznedaroglu, Berat Zeki; Tezel, Ulas",J Hazard Mater,591,26

These situations, while relevant, do not cover all situations in which CD8+ T cell memory is relevant. It is increasingly clear that CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype form in response to infections with extensive or prolonged tissue inflammation, for example, influenza, herpes, and more recently, COVID-19. In these circumstances, inflammatory mediators expectedly affect forming memory CD8+ T cells, especially in tissues in which pathogens establish.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether patients taking tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) or methotrexate are at increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes. METHODS: In this large comparative cohort study, real-time searches and analyses were performed on adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were treated with TNFis or methotrexate compared with those who were not treated. The likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were compared between groups with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. RESULTS: More than 53 million (53,511,836) unique patient records were analyzed, of which 32,076 (0.06%) had a COVID-19-related diagnosis documented starting after January 20, 2020. Two hundred fourteen patients with COVID-19 were identified with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure compared with 31,862 patients with COVID-19 without TNFi or methotrexate exposure. After propensity matching, the likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were not significantly different between the treatment and nontreatment groups (risk ratio = 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.22], P = .5260 and risk ratio = 0.87 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.78], P = .6958, respectively). LIMITATIONS: All TNFis may not behave similarly. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that patients with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure do not have increased hospitalization or mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 without recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure.","Yousaf, Ahmed; Gayam, Swapna; Feldman, Steve; Zinn, Zachary; Kolodney, Michael",J Am Acad Dermatol,591,16

New treatments are required to supplement the current standard of care. Paclitaxel (PTX), an effective chemotherapeutic for HNSCC, has serious side effects. A polymeric nanocarrier system was developed for the delivery of PTX to improve HNSCC treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of PTX-loaded polymeric nanoparticles based on &#945;-TOS (PTX-NPs) administered by direct intratumoral injection into a Hypopharynx carcinoma squamous cells (FaDu) tumor xenograft mouse model. The nanocarrier system based on block copolymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a methacrylic derivative of &#945;-TOS was synthesized and PTX was loaded into the delivery system. Tumor volume was measured to evaluate the antitumor effect of the PTX-NPs. The relative mechanisms of apoptosis, cell proliferation, growth, angiogenesis, and oxidative and nitrosative stress were detected by Western blotting, fluorescent probes, and immunohistochemical analysis. The antitumor activity results showed that compared to free PTX, PTX-NPs exhibited much higher antitumor efficacy and apoptosis-inducing in a FaDu mouse xenograft model and demonstrated an improved safety profile. Ki-67, EGFR, and angiogenesis markers (Factor VIII, CD31, and CD34) expression were significantly lower in the PTX-NPs group compared with other groups (p < .05). Also, PTX-NPs induced oxidative and nitrosative stress in tumor tissue. Direct administration of PTX-loaded polymeric nanoparticles based on &#945;-Tocopheryl Succinate at the tumor sites, proved to be promising for HNSCC therapy.","Riestra-Ayora, Juan; Sánchez-Rodríguez, Carolina; Palao-Suay, Raquel; Yanes-Díaz, Joaquín; Martín-Hita, Ana; Aguilar, María Rosa; Sanz-Fernández, Ricardo",Drug Deliv,591,25

We aimed to distinguish clinical data and computed tomography (CT) images between COVID-19 and other lung diseases in an advanced care hospital. METHODS: We assessed clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 between February 20 and May 21, 2020, at the University of Tokyo Hospital. RESULTS: Typical appearance for COVID-19 on CT images were found in 24 of 29 COVID-19 cases and 21 of 168 non-COVID-19 cases, according to the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement (for predicting COVID-19, sensitivity 0.828, specificity 0.875, positive predictive value 0.533, negative predictive value 0.967). When we focused on cases with typical CT images, loss of taste or smell, and close contact with COVID-19 patients were exclusive characteristics for the COVID-19 cases. Among laboratory data, high fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and low white blood cell count (P < 0.01) were good predictors for COVID-19 with typical CT images in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively low prevalence region, CT screening has high sensitivity to COVID-19 in patients with suspected symptoms. When chest CT findings are typical for COVID-19, close contact, loss of taste or smell, lower white blood cell count, and higher fibrinogen are good predictors for COVID-19.","Amano, Yosuke; Kage, Hidenori; Tanaka, Goh; Gonoi, Wataru; Nakai, Yudai; Kurokawa, Ryo; Inui, Shohei; Okamoto, Koh; Harada, Sohei; Iwabu, Masato; Morizaki, Yutaka; Abe, Osamu; Moriya, Kyoji; Nagase, Takahide",Respir Investig,591,6

An ample number of clinical trials with multiple drugs is underway to overcome the current perilous condition. Still, the situation is alarming with no therapeutic measure in our hand at present. Keeping the present scenario in mind, this review comprises the research, clinical knowledge, and repurposed herbals with regard to COVID-19. Preventive measures such as yoga, nasal breathing, and herbal administration could also provide protection and beneficial effects against coronavirus. Innumerable clinical trials are ongoing to manage COVID-19 and the drugs were selected on the basis of life cycle of coronavirus. The selection of herbals was done on the basis of the previous reported pharmacological activities and docking study. The results concluded that garlic, liquorice, and Ashwagandha have a potential against SARS-CoV-2, which was further proved via a docking study and their reported biological functions. The very well-known fact ""prevention is always better than cure"" is applied to overcome with coronavirus infection. It is expected that following the preventive measures could impede or lessen the adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2.","Rathor, Richa; Suryakumar, Geetha; Singh, Som Nath; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,591,22

It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations would foster addiction-related habits, such as caloric/salty (C/S) food intake, screen use, and substance use. However, no data has supported this assumption until now. OBJECTIVE: To assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. METHODS: Online survey among 11,391 participants, opened from day-8 to day-13 of the containment (started 03/17/2020). Questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress ([1-10] Visual Analog Scale), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described, and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Overall, increases in addiction-related habits were more frequent than decreases, as they were reported by 28.4% (C/S food), 64.6% (screens), 35.6% (tobacco), 24.8% (alcohol), and 31.2% (cannabis) of the concerned subjects, respectively. Reduced well-being score and increase stress score were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (p-values<0.001 for all types of habits). The main specific factors of increase in C/S food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR=1.62; 95%CI=1.48-1.77), being aged less than 29 years (p-values<0.001), having a partner (aOR=1.19; 95%CI=1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per one m2/person decrease: aOR=1.02; 95%CI=1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR=1.29; 95%CI=1.11-1.49), and reporting a current (aOR=1.94; 95%CI=1.62-2.31) or past (aOR=1.27; 95%CI=1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. The main specific factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR=1.31; 95%CI=1.21-1.43), being aged less than 29 years (p<0.001), having no partner (aOR=1.18; 95%CI=1.06-1.32), being professionally active (p-values <0.001), an intermediate/high education level (p-values <0.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR=1.16; 95%CI=1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR=1.15; 95%CI=1.01-1.32), in an urban environment (p-values <0.01), and not working (p-values <0.001). The main specific factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2,787) were female gender (aOR=1.31; 95%CI=1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR=1.30; 95%CI=1.06-1.59), having and intermediate/low education level (p-values <0.01), and still working at workplace (aOR=1.47; 95%CI=1.17-1.86). The main specific factors of increase in alcohol use (n= 7,108) were being aged 30-49 years (p-values <0.05), a high level of education (p-values <0.001), or a current psychiatric treatment (aOR=1.44; 95%CI=1.10-1.88). The main specific factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was an intermediate/low level of education (p-values <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of the COVID-19 containment in France led to widespread increases in addiction-related habits in the general population. Reduced well-being and increased stress were universal factors of increase. More specific factors were associated with increases in each of the explored habits.","Rolland, Benjamin; Haesebaert, Frédéric; Zante, Elodie; Benyamina, Amine; Haesebaert, Julie; Franck, Nicolas",,591,24

METHODS: We followed up 1174 patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)who were recovered and discharged for 6 months. RESULTS: There were 175 cases with clear IgG results 6 months after discharge, of which 82 (46.9%) were IgG (+) and 16 (9.1%) were IgG (dim+). Four hundred and forty-one participants (55.4%) had some kind of sequelae. The most common symptoms were fatigue (25.3%), sleep disorder (23.2%) and shortness of breath (20.4%). In those who had sequelae, 262 (59.4%) had more than one symptom. Critical cases were more likely to have cough (20.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.023) and hypomnesis (15.1% vs 8.0%, p = 0.041) than severe cases. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women are more likely to have multiple symptoms (p = 0.002), fatigue (p = 0.009) and sleep disorder (p = 0.008), whereas critical illness was found as independent risk factor for hypomnesis (p = 0.045).

The purpose of this paper is to document that more than 50% of the world population is affected by World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the 2020 coronavirus crisis. The WHO admits that the evidence quality for the effectiveness of these recommendations is low or very low. Design/methodology/approach: This self-contradiction is confirmed by a WHO document published in October 2019 as well as supporting documentation from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Findings: This viewpoint concludes that an obvious resolution of this self-contradiction would be to limit restrictions and interventions to those for whose effectiveness the WHO’s document reported that there was at least moderate evidence.

An analysis of the Covid-19 compensation fund,16.480787,1.8471895,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: COVID-19 pandemic led to wide-spread use of face-masks, respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers. Various symptoms attributed to the use of PPE are believed to be, at least in part, due to elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) levels. We evaluated concentrations of CO2 under various PPE. METHODS: In a prospective observational study on healthy volunteers, CO2 levels were measured during regular breathing while donning 1) no mask, 2) JustAir® powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), 3) KN95 respirator, and 4) valved-respirator. Serial CO2 measurements were taken with a nasal canula at a frequency of 1-Hz for 15-min for each PPE configuration to evaluate whether National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) limits were breached. RESULTS: The study included 11 healthy volunteers, median age 32 years (range 16-54) and 6 (55%) men. Percent mean (SD) changes in CO2 values for no mask, JustAir® PAPR, KN95 respirator and valve respirator were 0.26 (0.12), 0.59 (0.097), 2.6 (0.14) and 2.4 (0.59), respectively. Use of face masks (KN95 and valved-respirator) resulted in significant increases in CO2 concentrations, which exceeded the 8-h NIOSH exposure threshold limit value-weighted average (TLV-TWA). However, the increases in CO2 concentrations did not breach short-term (15-min) limits. Importantly, these levels were considerably lower than the long-term (8-h) NIOSH limits during donning JustAir® PAPR. There was a statistically significant difference between all pairs (p < 0.0001, except KN95 and valved-respirator (p = 0.25). However, whether increase in CO2 levels are clinically significant remains debatable. CONCLUSION: Although, significant increase in CO2 concentrations are noted with routinely used face-masks, the levels still remain within the NIOSH limits for short-term use. Therefore, there should not be a concern in their regular day-to-day use for healthcare providers. The clinical implications of elevated CO2 levels with long-term use of face masks needs further studies. Use of PAPR prevents relative hypercapnoea. However, whether PAPR should be advocated for healthcare workers requiring PPE for extended hours needs to evaluated in further studies.","Rhee, Michelle S M; Lindquist, Carin D; Silvestrini, Matthew T; Chan, Amanda C; Ong, Jonathan J Y; Sharma, Vijay K",BMC Infect Dis,591,8

We assessed the quality of life of invasively ventilated COVID-19 ARDS survivors. METHODS: We carried out a prospective follow-up study of the patients admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a teaching hospital. Patients affected by COVID-19 ARDS who required invasive ventilation and were successfully discharged home were assessed through the telephone administration of validated tests. We explored survival, functional outcomes, return to work, quality of life, cognitive and psychological sequelae. The main variables of interest were the following: demographics, severity scores, laboratory values, comorbidities, schooling, working status, treatments received during ICU stay, complications, and psychological, cognitive, functional outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 116 consecutive invasively ventilated patients, overall survival was 65/116 (56%) with no death occurring after hospital discharge. Forty-two patients were already discharged home with a median follow-up time of 61 (51-71) days after ICU discharge and 39 of them accepted to be interviewed. Only one patient (1/39) experienced cognitive decline. The vast majority of patients reported no difficulty in walking (32/35:82%), self-care (33/39:85%), and usual activities (30/39:78%). All patients were either malnourished (15/39:38%) or at risk for malnutrition (24/39:62%). Exertional dyspnea was present in 20/39 (51%) patients. 19/39 (49%) reported alterations in senses of smell and/or taste either before or after hospitalization.

Burn patients are physiologically immunocompromised, increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection in them. This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient trends in a burn and plastic unit and assesses the effect of COVID-19 infection in burns. Methods This single-center, retrospective observational case-control study was conducted in the Department of Burns, Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. Patient data was collected from April 1, 2019 to August 10, 2019 and from April 1, 2020 to August 10, 2020. All data of burns and trauma patients collected was analyzed and compared. Results There were total 350 admissions during COVID time period and 562 admissions during non-COVID time period. The admission rate, type of burn injury, and death rate did not vary significantly during the two time periods. Thermal burn was the most common type of burn injury. There were total 18 cases diagnosed to be COVID-19 positive during the pandemic. There were two deaths among COVID-19 positive burn cases. Conclusion This study finds no difference in patient patterns during COVID and non-COVID time period. Amongst burn patients, no increased risk of COVID-19 infection is seen with larger body surface area of burns. No increase in mortality is seen in burn patients infected with COVID-19. © 2021 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co. KG. All rights reserved.","Aggarwal, N.; Srivastava, R.

Treating radiation oncologist should know the prevention and treatment of every grade of radiodermatitis. Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the topical corticosteroid and moisturizer usage in breast cancer RT. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery referred to our department for adjuvant RT between October 2009 and October 2016 were compared with regard to topical steroid or moisturizer usage. Patients were followed up weekly after the start of treatment. Results: Mean age was 46 years. Twenty-four patients had stage 1 breast cancer and 26 patients had stage 2 disease. KPS (Karnofsky performance score) was 100 for all patients. Five patients (20.8%) had grade 2 and seven (29.1%) patients had grade 1 acute radiodermatitis in the first group. Eleven (42.3%) patients had grade 2 and 12 (46.1%) patients had grade 1 acute radiodermatitis in the second group. Thirteen (54.1%) patients in the first group had no acute radiodermatitis and three (11.5%) patients in the second group had no acute radiodermatitis. No patient in either group experienced grade 3 radiodermatitis. Conclusions: Daily use of topical betamethasone for breast cancer RT improves dermal sparing, reduces acute radiodermatitis, and may be recommended for patients receiving RT to the breast.","Uysal, Bora; Gamsiz, Hakan; Dincoglan, Ferrat; Demiral, Selcuk; Sager, Omer; Dirican, Bahar; Beyzadeoglu, Murat",Indian J Dermatol,591,33

To this end, the relationship between demographic, socio-economic, and environmental conditions and the spread of the novel coronavirus in China is analyzed with spatial regression models on variables deflated by population size. The infection rate - as measured by the number of cases per 100 thousand inhabitants - is found to be strongly related to the population density.

Serology could help to diagnose suspected cases which lack molecular confirmation. Two case reports are presented as illustration. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of several commercial assays for COVID-19 serology. We illustrated the added value of COVID-19 serology testing in suspect COVID-19 cases with negative molecular test. Study design: Twenty-three sera from 7 patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were tested using 14 commercial assays. Additionally, 10 pre-pandemic sera and 9 potentially cross-reactive sera were selected. We calculated sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we discuss the diagnostic relevance of COVID-19 serology in a retrospective cohort of 145 COVID-19 cases in which repetitive molecular and serological SARS-CoV-2 tests were applied. Results: The interpretation of the pooled sensitivity of IgM/A and IgG resulted in the highest values (range 14-71% on day 2-7; 88-94% on day 8-18). Overall, the specificity of the assays was high (range 79-100%). Among 145 retrospective cases, 3 cases (2%) remained negative after sequential molecular testing but positive on final SARS-CoV-2 serology. Conclusion: Sensitivity of COVID-19 serological diagnosis was variable but consistently increased at >7 days after symptom onset. Specificity was high. Our data suggest that serology can complement molecular testing for diagnosis of COVID-19, especially for patients presenting the 2nd week after symptom onset or later.","Van Honacker, Eveline; Coorevits, Liselotte; Boelens, Jerina; Verhasselt, Bruno; Van Braeckel, Eva; Bauters, Fré; De Bus, Liesbet; Schelstraete, Petra; Willems, Jef; Vandendriessche, Stien; Padalko, Elizaveta",Acta Clin Belg,591,19

Current clinical guidelines rely mainly on histopathological markers with relatively weak prognostic value. This motivates further search for prognostic markers. METHODS: This explorative study aimed to identify potential candidate gene mutations to facilitate differentiation between subgroups of patients with CRC stage II. Panel-based massive parallel sequencing was used to genetically characterize tumor tissues from 85 patients radically operated for CRC stage II, of which 12 developed recurrent cancer during follow-up. Genetic data was compared between patients with or without cancer recurrence, between tumors located in colon and in rectum, and for association with tumor differentiation grade. RESULTS: Genetic variation in ATM, C11ORF65 was associated with recurrence-free survival. Previous reports regarding the association between BRAF mutation and a higher age at diagnosis, and tumor location in colon were confirmed. APC, BRAF, or KRAS mutation was associated with tumor differentiation grade. Multiple correspondence analyses revealed no obvious clustering of patients with the studied clinical characteristics, indicating that the genetic signatures observed here were unique for each individual. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we have demonstrated the utility of panel-based massive parallel sequencing to explore the pathogenesis of CRC stage II. We have identified promising candidate gene mutations associated with cancer recurrence, tumor location, and differentiation grade in patients with CRC stage II, which merit further investigation.","Dimberg, Jan; Andersson, Roland E; Haglund, Sofie",Oncology,591,16

This work builds computational models using matrix completion techniques to predict drug-virus association for drug re-positioning. The aim is to assist clinicians with a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right set of antivirals for the mutated isolate. The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide, which is a novel Tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety when compared to its original counterpart (older version) Tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail, the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also demonstrate how the drugs to be used against the virus would vary as SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time by predicting the drugs for the mutated strains, suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction. We believe this work would open up possibilities for applying machine learning models to clinical research for drug-virus association prediction and other similar biological problems.","Mongia, Aanchal; Saha, Sanjay Kr; Chouzenoux, Emilie; Majumdar, Angshul",Sci Rep,591,16

Elia Metchnikoff received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine for this discovery in 1908. Since its discovery almost 140 years before, phagocytosis remains the hot topic of research in immunology. The phagocytosis research has seen a great advancement since its first discovery. Functionally, phagocytosis is a simple immunological process required to engulf and remove pathogens, dead cells and tumor cells to maintain the immune homeostasis. However, mechanistically, it is a very complex process involving different mechanisms, induced and regulated by several pattern recognition receptors, soluble pattern recognition molecules, scavenger receptors (SRs) and opsonins. These mechanisms involve the formation of phagosomes, their maturation into phagolysosomes causing pathogen destruction or antigen synthesis to present them to major histocompatibility complex molecules for activating an adaptive immune response. Any defect in this mechanism may predispose the host to certain infections and inflammatory diseases (autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases) along with immunodeficiency. The article is designed to discuss its mechanistic complexity at each level, varying from phagocytosis induction to phagolysosome resolution.","Kumar, Vijay",Int Rev Immunol,591,23

The ongoing unprecedented crisis causes more stress, especially among nurses, as they are the most vulnerable group who predominantly get impacted while delivering comprehensive care. Aim: This study explored the level of stress among nurses working in different healthcare settings. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study among nurses from developed and developing countries between 7 February and 7 April 2020 was adopted for this research. Sixty-four nurses working in different healthcare settings were included in the study. A self-developed online questionnaire using google documents was used to collect data that comprised baseline data, Cohen Perceived stress scale, simplified coping items, and items of psychosocial perception. Results: It was revealed that 75.64% of studied participants (N=64) had a high level of stress, with a mean anxiety score and Standard deviation of 3.52 +/- 1.084, during the Covid-19 pandemic situation. A statistically significant association was found between the demographic variables such as experience and participation in the COVID-19 team at p&lt;.05, whereas gender, age, and working unit do not show any significant associations. Conclusion: Heath institutions' effective and efficient protocols are required to enhance nurses' mental strength and alleviate their lack of coping strategies, particularly during a crisis.","Alsolami, F.

Both pre-clinical and clinical dental education have experienced challenges ranging from fully online educational content to limited dental training for senior dental students. This crisis appears to be a tipping point that produced confusion in dental teaching especially clinical sciences. Although medical institutions immediately started to adapt to the unexpected COVID-19 crisis, dental and oral health educational services are profoundly impaired due to the dental team's propinquity to the patient and the aerosols generated during routine dental therapeutic procedures. Dental students unlike other medical students are considered to be at the highest risk due to the nature of their clinical training that includes working in the oral cavity of patients using aerosol-generating equipment. Some dental schools have taken the leadership and documented their modifications during this pandemic;however, there is a serious need for further investigation and wide range screening of the situation in the dental schools during the COVID-19 crisis.

The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for the potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and National Health Service UK evidence up to 27 July 2020. A protocol was published and Cochrane guidance for rapid review methodology was adhered to throughout. Twenty-eight studies were identified. Seven out of eight epidemiological studies suggest aerosol transmission may occur, with enclosed environments and poor ventilation noted as possible contextual factors. Ten of the 16 air sampling studies detected SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid; however, only three of these studies attempted to culture the virus with one being successful in a limited number of samples. Two of four virological studies using artificially generated aerosols indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is viable in aerosols. The results of this review indicate there is inconclusive evidence regarding the viability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Epidemiological studies suggest possible transmission, with contextual factors noted. Viral particles have been detected in air sampling studies with some evidence of clinical infectivity, and virological studies indicate these particles may represent live virus, adding further plausibility. However, there is uncertainty as to the nature and impact of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and its relative contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic compared with other modes of transmission.","Comber, Laura; O Murchu, Eamon; Drummond, Linda; Carty, Paul G; Walsh, Kieran A; De Gascun, Cillian F; Connolly, Máire A; Smith, Susan M; O039,; Neill, Michelle; Ryan, Máirín; Harrington, Patricia",Rev Med Virol,591,6

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce.

The clinical data of 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive unit of Tongji Guanggu Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei Province from February 10th to 29th in 2020 were collected, including their general information, routine blood test, coagulation function, inflammatory parameters, cytokines, and organ function related laboratory parameters at admission. The patients were divided into two groups, namely D-dimer normal group (< 0.5 mg/L) and D-dimer elevated group (&#8805; 0.5 mg/L). The differences of general data, inflammatory parameters and cytokines between the two groups were compared. Besides, the correlation between D-dimer and organ function was analyzed by linear regression. The change in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) between the first visit after the onset of the disease and admission to intensive unit &#8805; 2 was defined as being combined with organ damage. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of D-dimer on organ damage in patients with COVID-19.

Linear regression analysis showed that D-dimer level was negatively related with pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) and platelet count (PLT) with ß values of -0.493, -11.615, and -0.018, respectively (all P < 0.05). However, D-dimer level was positively related with respiratory rate (RR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBil) and direct bilirubin (DBil) with ß values of 0.485, 0.107, 0.291, and 0.404 (all P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of D-dimer for predicting organ injury in COVID-19 patients was 0.889, and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.753-1.000. When the optimal cut-off value was 2.36 mg/L, the sensitivity was 85.7%, and the specificity was 78.1%. CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients are correlated with inflammatory factors and organ function, and it can be used to predict organ injury.","Xu, Ying; Qian, Yajun; Gu, Qin; Tang, Jian",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,591,16

Therefore, this study aimed at assessing depression, anxiety, stress and identifying their associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We invited students to complete an online survey using Google forms comprising consent, socio-demographic characteristics, and the standard validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. After completion of the survey from June 30 to July 30, 2020, we exported the data into SPSS 22. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were computed. Associated factors were identified using binary logistic regression and variables with a p-value <0.05 were declared as statistically significant factors with the outcome variables. RESULTS: A total of 423 students completed the online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 46.3%, 52%, and 28.6%, respectively. In the multivariable model, female sex, poor self-efficacy to prevent COVID-19, those who do not read any material about COVID-19 prevention, lack of access to reading materials about their profession, and lack of access to uninterrupted internet access were significantly associated with depression. Female sex, lower ages, students with non-health-related departments, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, and those who do not read any materials about COVID-19 prevention were significantly associated with anxiety. Whereas, being female, students attending 1st and 2nd years, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, presence of confirmed COVID-19 patient at the town they are living in, and lack of access to reading materials about their profession were significantly associated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: Depression, anxiety, and stress level among University students calls for addressing these problems by controlling the modifiable factors identified and promoting psychological wellbeing of students.","Simegn, Wudneh; Dagnew, Baye; Yeshaw, Yigizie; Yitayih, Sewbesew; Woldegerima, Birhanemeskel; Dagne, Henok",PLoS One,591,6

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.","Atluri, Sairam; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain Physician,591,16

Decision support tools of risk stratification are needed to predict outcomes in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study recruited 2425 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A logistic regression model was used to select and estimate the factors independently associated with outcomes. Simplified risk stratification score systems were constructed to predict outcomes in moderate and severe patients with COVID-19, and their performances were evaluated by discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: We constructed two risk stratification score systems, named as STPCAL (including significant factors in the prediction model: number of clinical symptoms, the maximum body temperature during hospitalization, platelet count, C-reactive protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase) and TRPNCLP (including maximum body temperature during hospitalization, history of respiratory diseases, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and prothrombin time), to predict hospitalization duration for moderate patients and disease progression for severe patients, respectively. According to STPCAL score, moderate patients were classified into three risk categories for a longer hospital duration: low (Score 0-1, median = 8 days, with less than 20.0% probabilities), intermediate (Score 2-6, median = 13 days, with 30.0-78.9% probabilities), high (Score 7-9, median = 19 days, with more than 86.5% probabilities). Severe patients were stratified into three risk categories for disease progression: low risk (Score 0-5, with less than 12.7% probabilities), intermediate risk (Score 6-11, with 18.6-69.1% probabilities), and high risk (Score 12-16, with more than 77.9% probabilities) by TRPNCLP score. The two risk scores performed well with good discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Two easy-to-use risk stratification score systems were built to predict the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with different clinical types. Identifying high risk patients with longer stay or poor prognosis could assist healthcare providers in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare during COVID-19 outbreak.","Huang, Jiaqi; Xu, Yu; Wang, Bin; Xiang, Ying; Wu, Na; Zhang, Wenjing; Xia, Tingting; Yuan, Zhiquan; Li, Chengying; Jia, Xiaoyue; Shan, Yifan; Chen, Menglei; Li, Qi; Bai, Li; Li, Yafei",BMC Pulm Med,591,20

In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of &#8805; 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.","Mishra, Ajay; Lal, Amos; Sahu, Kamal Kant; George, Anu Anna; Martin, Kevin; Sargent, Jennifer",Acta Biomed,591,6

A time-dependent nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations model was constructed involving type-I cells, type-II cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus, inflammatory mediators, interleukins along with host pulmonary gas exchange rate, thermostat control, and mean pressure difference. This formalism introduced about 17 unknown parameters. Estimating these unknown parameters requires a mathematical association with the in vivo sparse data and the dynamic sensitivities of the model. The cybernetic model can simulate a dynamic response to the reduced pulmonary alveolar gas exchange rate, thermostat control, and mean pressure difference under a very critical condition based on equilibrium (steady state) values of the inflammatory mediators and system parameters. In silico analysis of the current cybernetical approach with system dynamical modeling can provide an intellectual framework to help experimentalists identify more active therapeutic approaches.","Saha, Asit; Saha, Barsha",Rev Med Virol,591,24

Objective: To compare the clinical characteristics and sources of infection among children and youths with COVID-19 during the 3 waves of outbreaks in Hong Kong in 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study involved children and youths aged 18 years or younger with COVID-19 in the 3 waves of outbreaks from January 23 through December 2, 2020. Data were analyzed from December 2020 through January 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, travel and contact histories, lengths of hospital stay, and symptoms were captured through the central electronic database. Individuals who were infected without recent international travel were defined as having domestic infections. Results: Among 397 children and youths confirmed with COVID-19 infections, the mean (SD) age was 9.95 (5.34) years, 220 individuals (55.4%) were male, and 154 individuals (38.8%) were asymptomatic. There were significantly more individuals who were infected without symptoms in the second wave (59 of 118 individuals [50.0%]) and third wave (94 of 265 individuals [35.5%]) than in the first wave (1 of 14 individuals [7.1%]) (P = .001). Significantly fewer individuals who were infected in the second and third waves, compared with the first wave, had fever (first wave: 10 individuals [71.4%]; second wave: 22 individuals [18.5%]; third wave: 98 individuals [37.0%]; P < .001) or cough (first wave: 6 individuals [42.9%]; second wave: 15 individuals [12.7%]; third wave: 52 individuals [19.6%]; P = .02). Among all individuals, 394 individuals (99.2%) had mild illness. One patient developed chilblains (ie, COVID toes), 1 patient developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 1 patient developed post-COVID-19 autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In all 3 waves, 204 patients with COVID-19 (51.4%) had domestic infections. Among these individuals, 186 (91.2%) reported having a contact history with another individual with COVID-19, of which most (183 individuals [90.0%]) were family members. In the third wave, 18 individuals with domestic infections had unknown contact histories. Three schoolmates were confirmed with COVID-19 on the same day and were reported to be close contacts.

However, myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) can offset the benefit of reperfusion therapy and worsen the outcome. In both ischemia and reperfusion, autophagy remains problematic. Activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1) is an important protein in autophagy regulation, and its function in MIRI remains unclear. Thus, we used H9C2 cells to investigate the function of Ambra1 in MIRI and the underlying mechanisms involved. Hypoxia and reoxygenation of H9C2 cells were used to mimic MIRI in vitro. During hypoxia, autophagy flux was blocked, then recovered in reoxygenation. Ambra1 overexpression increased autophagy in the H9C2 cells, as the LC3B II/I ratio increased, and alleviated cellular necrosis and apoptosis during hypoxia and reoxygenation. This effect was counteracted by an autophagy inhibitor. Knocking down Ambra1 can block autophagy which P62 sediment/supernatant ratio increased while the ratio of LC3B II/I decreased, and worsen outcomes. Ambra1 enhances autophagy in H9C2 cells by improving the stability and activity of the ULK1 complex. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an important cause of MIRI. ROS were reduced when Ambra1 was overexpressed and increased when Ambra1 was knocked down, indicating that Ambra1 can protect against hypoxia and reoxygenation injury in H9C2 cells by promoting autophagy and reducing ROS.","Zhao, Lin; Cheng, Liting; Wu, Yongquan",Biomed Res Int,591,16

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called""knowns"", and there are more we do not know called""unknowns"". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to""open""the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","Shu, Yu; Shi, Yemin; Wang, Yaowei; Huang, Tiejun; Tian, Yonghong",,591,1

Exposed patients were divided into two groups: quarantine patients with and without COVID-19. All patients were prospectively examined at the following time points: 0, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days after confirmation or exclusion of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Infection was confirmed in a total of 5/20 health care workers and 10/19 patients. Among the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mortality rate was 36.8 %. The probability of death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 increased 8-fold (p = 0.03). Bacterial, fungal, and viral co-infection significantly decreased survival in these patients (p < 0.05).

High perceived stress levels endanger physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the perceived stress levels of medical staff and explore its risk factors. We recruited 600 medical staff from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, to evaluate perceived stress scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived stress level among medical staff in the radiology departments during the COVID-19 outbreak was high and a sense of tension was strongly present. A positive correlation was found between anxiety score and perceived stress. Multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for perceived stress were female, existing anxiety, and fears of being infected at work, an uncontrollable outbreak, and not being able to pay rent or mortgage. Conversely, good knowledge about COVID-19, being unmarried, and working in a higher-grade hospital were protective factors for perceived stress. Therefore, more attention should be given to medical staff in the radiology departments that present the risk factors outlined above. Timely risk assessment of psychological stress and effective intervention measures should be taken for these high-risk groups to keep their perceived stress within normal limits.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Chen, Xijian; Xu, Huayan; Guo, Yingkun; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang",Psychol Health Med,591,9

Methods: This is a descriptive, multi-centered, observational design feasibility study based on an AI tool for the rapid detection of COVID-19 in chest computed tomography (CT) images of patients with respiratory difficulties attending the country’s public hospitals. The patients’ digital CT images were transmitted to the AI diagnostic platform, and after a few minutes, radiologists and pneumologists specialized in COVID-19 downloaded the images for evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, and comparison with the genetic diagnosis (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)). It was also determined the percentage of agreement between two similar AI systems applied in parallel to study the viability of using it as an alternative method of screening patients with COVID-19 through telemedicine. Results: Between March and August 2020, 911 rapid diagnostic tests were carried out on patients with respiratory disorders to rule out COVID-19 in 14 hospitals nationwide. The average age of patients was 50.7 years, 62.6% were male and 37.4% female. Most of the diagnosed respiratory conditions corresponded to the age group of 27–59 years (252 studies), the second most frequent corresponded to the group over 60 years, and the third to the group of 19–26 years. The most frequent findings of the radiologists/pneumologists were severe pneumonia, bilateral pneumonia with pleural effusion, bilateral pulmonary emphysema, diffuse ground glass opacity, hemidiaphragmatic paresis, calcified granuloma in the lower right lobe, bilateral pleural effusion, sequelae of tuberculosis, bilateral emphysema, and fibrotic changes, among others. Overall, an average of 86% agreement and 14% diagnostic discordance was determined between the two AI systems. The sensitivity of the AI system was 93% and the specificity 80% compared with RT-PCR. Conclusion: Paraguay has an AI-based telemedicine screening system for the rapid stratified detection of COVID-19 from chest CT images of patients with respiratory conditions. This application strengthens the integrated network of health services, rationalizing the use of specialized human resources, equipment, and inputs for laboratory diagnosis.","Galván, P.; Fusillo, J.; González, F.; Vukujevic, O.; Recalde, L.; Rivas, R.; Ortellado, J.; Portillo, J.; Mazzoleni, J.; Hilario, E.",Medicine Access at Point of Care,591,17

The identification of SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes is of critical importance for peptide vaccines or diagnostic tools of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, a number of SARS-CoV-2-derived HLA-I binding peptides were predicted by NetMHCpan-4.1 and selected by Popcover to achieve pancoverage of the Chinese population. The top 5 ranked peptides derived from each protein of SARS-CoV-2 were then evaluated using PBMCs from unexposed individuals (negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG). RESULTS: Seven epitopes derived from 4 SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified. Interestingly, most (5 out of 7) of the SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides with predicted affinities for HLA-I molecules were identified as HLA-II-restricted epitopes and induced CD4+ T cell-dependent responses. These results complete missing pieces of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and suggest that pre-existing T cells targeting all SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins can be discovered in unexposed populations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the current study, we present an alternative and effective strategy for the identification of T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy subjects, which may indicate an important role in the development of peptide vaccines for COVID-19.","Ma, Yipeng; Liu, Fenglan; Lin, Tong; Chen, Lei; Jiang, Aixin; Tian, Geng; Nielsen, Morten; Wang, Mingjun",J. infect. dis,591,16

The interactions have been investigated by using molecular docking, quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulations methods. The molecular structures of all the ligands are studied quantum chemically in terms of their optimized structures, 3-D orbital distributions, global chemical descriptors, molecular electrostatic potential plots and HOMO-LUMO orbital energies. All the ligands show reasonably good binding affinities with nsp-13 protein. The ligand L2 shows to have better binding affinities to Chain A and Chain B of nsp13 protein, which are -6.7 and -6.4 kcal/mol. The study of intermolecular interactions indicates that L2 shows different hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with both chains. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations of the nsp13-L2 complex are obtained over a time scale of 60 ns, which indicates its stability and flexibility behavior as assessed in terms of its RMSD and RMSF graphs. The ADMET analysis also shows no violation of Lipinski rule (RO5) by studied phenolic compounds. We believe that the current findings will be further confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies of these recent phenolic compounds for their potential as inhibitors for SARS-Co-V-2 virus.","Zia, Maimoona; Muhammad, Shabbir; Bibi, Shamsa; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G; Chaudhary, Aijaz Rasool; Bai, Fu Quan",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,591,26

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide healthcare registers in Denmark and Norway. PARTICIPANTS: All people aged 18-65 years who received a first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S from 9 February 2021 to 11 March 2021. The general populations of Denmark (2016-18) and Norway (2018-19) served as comparator cohorts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed 28 day rates of hospital contacts for incident arterial events, venous thromboembolism, thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders, and bleeding among vaccinated people compared with expected rates, based on national age and sex specific background rates from the general populations of the two countries. RESULTS: The vaccinated cohorts comprised 148 792 people in Denmark (median age 45 years, 80% women) and 132 472 in Norway (median age 44 years, 78% women), who received their first dose of ChAdOx1-S. Among 281 264 people who received ChAdOx1-S, the standardised morbidity ratio for arterial events was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.20). 59 venous thromboembolic events were observed in the vaccinated cohort compared with 30 expected based on the incidence rates in the general population, corresponding to a standardised morbidity ratio of 1.97 (1.50 to 2.54) and 11 (5.6 to 17.0) excess events per 100 000 vaccinations. A higher than expected rate of cerebral venous thrombosis was observed: standardised morbidity ratio 20.25 (8.14 to 41.73); an excess of 2.5 (0.9 to 5.2) events per 100 000 vaccinations. The standardised morbidity ratio for any thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders was 1.52 (0.97 to 2.25) and for any bleeding was 1.23 (0.97 to 1.55). 15 deaths were observed in the vaccine cohort compared with 44 expected. CONCLUSIONS: Among recipients of ChAdOx1-S, increased rates of venous thromboembolic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, were observed. For the remaining safety outcomes, results were largely reassuring, with slightly higher rates of thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders and bleeding, which could be influenced by increased surveillance of vaccine recipients. The absolute risks of venous thromboembolic events were, however, small, and the findings should be interpreted in the light of the proven beneficial effects of the vaccine, the context of the given country, and the limitations to the generalisability of the study findings.","Pottegård, Anton; Lund, Lars Christian; Karlstad, Øystein; Dahl, Jesper; Andersen, Morten; Hallas, Jesper; Lidegaard, Øjvind; Tapia, German; Gulseth, Hanne Løvdal; Ruiz, Paz Lopez-Doriga; Watle, Sara Viksmoen; Mikkelsen, Anders Pretzmann; Pedersen, Lars; Sørensen, Henrik Toft; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Hviid, Anders",BMJ,591,16

We find that the average housing price in communities with COVID-19 infections decreases by approximately 1.3% compared to communities with no confirmed cases. The economic implication is that homebuyers are willing to pay a premium equivalent to approximately 1.3% of the average housing price to avoid health risks. The response of real estate markets to epidemic shocks is heterogeneous in community and city characteristics.

Ongoing quality improvement studies in various locales and within many affected healthcare institutions are needed. A template design for small-scale quality improvement surveys is proposed. Such surveys have the potential for rapid implementation and completion, are cost-effective, impose little administrative or workforce burden, can reveal occupational risks while taking community risks into account, and can be repeated easily with short time intervals between repetitions. This article describes a template design and proposes a survey instrument that is easily modifiable to fit the particular needs of various healthcare institutions in the hope of beginning a collaborative effort to refine the design and instrument. These methods, along with data management and analytic techniques, can be widely useful and shared globally.

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted an open-data policy recommendation in such situations. OBJECTIVES: The present cross-sectional meta-research study aimed to assess the availability of open data and metrics and of articles pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak in five high-impact journals. METHODS: All articles regarding the SARS-CoV-2, published in five high impact journals (Ann Intern Med, BMJ, JAMA, NEJM and Lancet) until March 14, 2020 were retrieved. Meta-data (namely the type of article, number of authors, number of patients, citations, errata, news and social media mentions) were extracted for each article in each journal in a systematic way. Google Scholar and Scopus were used for citations and author metrics respectively, and Altmetrics and PlumX were used for news and social media mentions retrieval. The degree of adherence to the PHEIC open data call was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 140 articles were published until March 14, 2020, mostly opinion papers. Sixteen errata followed these publications. The number of authors in each article ranged from 1 to 63, whereas the number of patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reached 2,645. The impact of these publications reached a total of 4,210 cumulative crude citations and 342,790 news and social media mentions. Only one publication (0.7%) provided complete open data, while 32 (22.9%) included patient data.

SETTING: Community Health Division, Bangalore Baptist Hospital, Bangalore. STUDY DESIGN: We used mixed methods research with a quantitative (QUAN) paradigm nested in the primary qualitative (QUAL) design. QUAL methods included ethnography research methods, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. PARTICIPANTS: A healthcare team of doctors, nurses, paramedical and support staff. Out of 87 staff, 42 participated in the QUAL methods and 64 participated in the QUAN survey. RESULTS: Being cognizant of the extreme vulnerability of the slums, the health team struggled with conflicting thoughts of self-preservation and their moral obligation to the marginalised section of society. Majority (75%) of the staff experienced fear at some point in time. Distracting themselves with hobbies (20.3%) and spending more time with family (39.1%) were cited as a means of emotional regulation by the participants in the QUAN survey. In the QUAL interviews, fear of death, the guilt of disease transmission to their loved ones, anxiety about probable violence and stigma in the slums and exhaustion emerged as the major themes causing stress among healthcare professionals. With positive cognitive reappraisal, the health team collectively designed and implemented adaptive interventions to ensure continuity of care. They dealt with the new demands by positive reframing, peer support, distancing, information seeking, response efficacy, self-efficacy, existential goal pursuit, value adherence and religious coping. CONCLUSION: The novel threat of the COVID-19 pandemic threw insurmountable challenges potentiating disastrous consequences; slums becoming a threat to themselves, threat to the health providers and a threat for all. Perhaps, a lesson we could learn from this pandemic is to incorporate 'slum health' within universal healthcare.","George, Carolin Elizabeth; Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; Rajukutty, Shon; de Witte, Luc P",BMJ Open,591,1

AIM OF THE STUDY: : This manuscript reviews the traditional usage of southern African plant species to treat bacterial respiratory diseases with the aim of highlighting gaps in the literature and focusing future studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive review of ethnobotanical books, reviews and primary scientific studies was undertaken to identify southern African plants which are used in traditional southern African medicine to treat bacterial respiratory diseases. We also searched for southern African plants whose inhibitory activity against bacterial respiratory pathogens has been conmfirmed, to highlight gaps in the literature and focus future studies. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven southern African plant species are recorded as traditional therapies for bacterial respiratory infections. Scientific evaluations of 178 plant species were recorded, although only 42 of these were selected for screening on the basis of their ethnobotanical uses. Therefore, the potential of 146 species used teraditionally to treat bacterial respiratory diseases are yet to be verified.

VIRIM uncovered a striking heterogeneity in replication dynamics between cells and revealed extensive coordination between translation and replication of single viral RNAs. Furthermore, using VIRIM, we identify the replication step of the incoming viral RNA as a major bottleneck of successful infection and identify host genes that are responsible for inhibition of early virus replication.

According to the differences of S1 protein in various infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains, a target DNA sequence that can specifically recognize H120 RNA forming a DNA-RNA hybridized double-strand structure has been designed. Then, the residual single-stranded target DNA is hydrolyzed by S1 nuclease. Therefore, the content of target DNA becomes equal to the content of virus RNA. After equivalent coronavirus, the target DNA is separated from DNA-RNA hybridized double strand by heating, which can partly hybridize with probe 2 modified on the electrode surface and probe 1 on AuNPs’ surface. Thus, AuNPs are pulled to the surface of the electrode and the abundant DNA on AuNPs’ surface could adsorb a large amount of hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride (RuHex) molecules, which produce a remarkably amplified electrochemical response. The voltammetric signal of RuHex with a peak near − 0.28 V vs. Ag/AgCl is used as the signal output. The proposed method shows a detection range of 1.56e(−9) to 1.56e(−6) μM with the detection limit of 2.96e(−10) μM for IBV H120 strain selective quantification detection, exhibiting good accuracy, stability, and simplicity, which shows a great potential for IBV detection in vaccine research and avian infectious bronchitis diagnosis.

Rapid progress in circRNA biology has coincided with its identification in a plethora of diverse roles including regulation of gene expression and probable coding potential, as well as competing interactions with proteins and microRNAs in various pathological conditions. Emerging evidence suggests that circRNAs also function in viral infections. The deregulation of circRNAs during viral infection has prompted investigations into the possibilities of circRNA as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that modulates response to infection. Recently, viruses have been shown to encode circRNAs with proviral functions, providing a strong impetus for focused efforts to elucidate the networks coaxed by circRNAs during infection.

A critique of force majeure clauses from an environmental perspective will help to clarify how energy contracts lock buyers and suppliers into a carbon-intensive path. By not relieving buyers from their purchase obligations, even after respective market meltdowns and the disappearance of demand, force majeure, as defined in most energy contracts, can incentivise irrational energy use and waste, and is thus incompatible with a low-carbon transition. Climate regulation preventing a party from using fossil fuels can excuse performance of the obligation to purchase fossil energy, but the affected party can be required to challenge these decarbonisation measures and thus oppose the low-carbon transition. To avoid these perverse effects and align energy contracts to the reality of decarbonisation, economic hardship and environmental regulation should be explicitly included in force majeure clauses.","Boute, Anatole",Journal of Environmental Law,591,6

Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with ∼1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18∼25°C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37°C and 56°C, respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories.

This unprecedented collaborative effort culminated in the generation of 1275 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, which represent 15.5% of all confirmed cases in March 2020, making Portugal one of the countries generating the highest volumes of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data during early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We reconstructed and characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and early dissemination in Portugal using recent phylodynamic models that allow integration of individual-based travel history, in order to obtain a more realistic reconstruction of the viral dynamics. Results: We detected at least 277 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions, mostly from European countries (namely the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy and Switzerland), which was broadly consistent with the available travel history data, as well as with the countries with most frequent connectivity and/or with the highest number of Portuguese immigrants. Although most introductions were estimated to have occurred during the last week of February and the first week of March 2020, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 was silently circulating in Portugal several weeks before the first confirmed local cases on March 2, 2020. Discussion and Conclusion: While the implemented preventive and early control measures seem to have been successful in mitigating community transmission from most independent introductions, our results suggest that their earlier implementation could have largely minimized the number of introductions and subsequent virus expansion. Here we lay the foundation for genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal, and highlight the need for systematic, continuous and geographically-representative genomic surveillance to guide national and international public health authorities toward the characterization and control of SARS-CoV-2 circulating diversity.","Borges, V.; Isidro, J.; Trovao, N.

Many of them are well-studied ribosome-targeting antibiotics that block translocation, the peptidyl transferase center or the polypeptide exit tunnel, modulate the binding of translation machinery components to the ribosome, and induce miscoding, premature termination or stop codon readthrough. Such inhibitors are widely used as anticancer, anthelmintic and antifungal agents in medicine, as well as fungicides in agriculture. Chemicals that affect the accuracy of stop codon recognition are promising drugs for the nonsense suppression therapy of hereditary diseases and restoration of tumor suppressor function in cancer cells.

Some of them have antidepressant, immunosuppressive and geroprotective properties. Translation inhibitors are also used in research for gene expression analysis by ribosome profiling, as well as in cell culture techniques. In this article, we review well-studied and less known inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis (with the exception of mitochondrial and plastid translation) classified by their targets and briefly describe the action mechanisms of these compounds. We also present a continuously updated database (http://eupsic.belozersky.msu.ru/) that currently contains information on 370 inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis.","Dmitriev, S.

We find that the decay rate of daily cases or deaths from peak levels varies by a factor of ~40 between countries. This measure of country-level resilience to COVID-19 is positively correlated with trust within society, and with the adaptive increase in stringency of government interventions when epidemic waves occur. All countries where >40% agree most people can be trusted achieve a near complete reduction of new cases and deaths. In contrast, countries where governments maintain greater background stringency tend to be less trusting and less resilient. Building trust is therefore critical to resilience, both to epidemics and other unexpected disruptions, of which COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last.","Lenton, T. M.; Boulton, C.

Many studies have revealed that the binding of EGCG and other catechins to proteins is involved in its action mechanism. Computational docking analysis (CMDA) and X-ray crystallographic analysis (XCA) have provided detailed information on catechin-protein interactions. Several of these studies have revealed that the galloyl moiety anchors it to the cleft of proteins through interactions with its hydroxyl groups, explaining the higher activity of galloylated catechins such as EGCG and epicatechin gallate than non-galloylated catechins. In this paper, we review the results of CMDA and XCA of EGCG and other plant catechins to understand catechin-protein interactions with the expectation of developing new drugs with health-promoting properties.","Nakano, Shogo; Megro, Shin-ichi; Hase, Tadashi; Suzuki, Takuji; Isemura, Mamoru; Nakamura, Yoriyuki; Ito, Sohei",Molecules,591,20

It has also heavily burdened healthcare professionals and the virus poses serious risks for their personal and professional lives. Therefore, the present study examined the associations between fear of COVID-19 and workplace phobia among doctors in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 421 doctors in Pakistan between April 10 and May 25, 2020. The Workplace Phobia Scale (WPS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were the main psychometric instruments used in this study. RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and workplace panic anxiety and workplace avoidance behavior. Significantly higher fear of COVID-19 was found among (i) females compared to males, (ii) doctors with 5 years or less of work experience compared to those with more than 5 years, and (iii) postgraduate trainees compared with other ranks. Two groups (doctors who were above 30 years old and postgraduate trainees) were found to have higher levels of workplace phobia compared to their counterparts. Doctors with severe levels of fear of COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of workplace panic anxiety and workplace avoidance behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with workplace phobia which may negatively affect doctors’ performance. Therefore, important steps are needed to protect doctors’ health by providing sufficient resources to allay their fears and anxieties which consequently help them in carrying out their frontline duties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malik, Sadia; Ullah, Irfan; Irfan, Muhammad; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H.; Griffiths, Mark D.; Rehman, Ibad Ur; Minhas, Rafia",BMC Public Health,591,6

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A search of PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and clinicaltrials.gov found three completed randomized trials: one pre-exposure prophylaxis trial and two post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. The risk ratio estimated for each of the individual trials were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35-1.37). The pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61-0.99). All three trials found a similar rate of adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups. Discussion: The available evidence indicates that HCQ reduces the risk of COVID-19 by about 20%. Yet the findings from the randomized trials were widely interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply because they were not statistically significant when taking them individually. Completion of the ongoing prophylaxis trials is needed to generate more precise estimates of the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.","Garcia-Albeniz, X.; Del Amo, J.; Polo, R.; Morales Asencio, J.

However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.","Täufer, Matthias",bioRxiv,591,1

The susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases, and the risks or benefits of immunosuppressive therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Methods. We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Incidences of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. Results. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Systemic autoimmune or immune mediated diseases (AI/IMID) patients showed a significant increase, whereas inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. IA patients on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARD), but not those on conventional-synthetic (csDMARD), had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. Conclusion. Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of aging, therapies, and disease specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyze the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.","Pablos, J.

Data suggests a high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in ventilated patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and the diagnostic yield of Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for PE. We also examined the utility of D-dimer and conventional pre-test probability for diagnosis of PE in COVID-19. PATIENTS/METHODS: Retrospective review of single-centre data of all CTPA studies in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 identified from Electronic Patient Records (EPR). RESULTS: There were 1477 patients admitted with COVID-19 and 214 CTPA scans performed, of which n = 180 (84%) were requested outside of critical care. The diagnostic yield for PE was 37%. The overall proportion of PE in patients with COVID-19 was 5.4%. The proportions with Wells score of ≥4 (‘PE likely’) was 33/134 (25%) without PE vs 20/80 (25%) with PE (P = 0.951). The median National Early Warning-2 (NEWS2) score (illness severity) was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3–9) in PE group vs 4 (IQR 2–7) in those without PE (P = 0.133). D-dimer was higher in PE (median 8000 ng/mL; IQR 4665–8000 ng/mL) than non-PE (2060 ng/mL, IQR 1210–4410 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In the ‘low probability’ group, D-dimer was higher (P < 0.001) in those with PE but had a limited role in excluding PE. CONCLUSIONS: Even outside of the critical care environment, PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is common. Of note, approaching half of PE events were diagnosed on hospital admission. More data are needed to identify an optimal diagnostic pathway in patients with COVID-19.

Our study aimed to evaluate the robustness of neutrophil to CD4+ lymphocyte ratio (NCD4LR) in predicting the negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to evaluate the independency of NCD4LR in predicting NCT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Compared with low NCD4LR patients, patients with high NCD4LR had an older age; higher incidence of fever, fatigue, chest distress/breath shortness, severer disease assessment on admission; higher levels of inflammatory indicators; low levels of lymphocyte subsets, and a longer NCT. Multivariate analysis also identified NCD4LR as an independent risk factor for delayed NCT. ROC analysis showed that NCD4LR had a better performance than neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in predicting the virus negative conversion within 2 weeks (AUC = 0.772), 3 weeks (AUC = 0.710), 4 weeks (AUC = 0.728), or 5 weeks (AUC = 0.815). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that NCD4LR is a potential and useful biomarker for predicting the virus negative conversion time in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, due to the NCDLR value is easily calculated, it can be widely used as a clinical biomarker for disease progression and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Haizhou; Zhang, Yongxi; Mo, Pingzheng; Liu, Jing; Wang, Hongling; Wang, Fan; Zhao, Qiu",Int Immunopharmacol,591,16

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir reduces hospitalization among high-risk patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Brazil. Recently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 685 patients. Statistical analysis was performed in December 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily for 9 days), lopinavir-ritonavir (loading dose of 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, every 12 hours followed by 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 hours for the next 9 days), or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death assessed at 90 days after randomization. COVID-19–associated hospitalization was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: all-cause hospitalization, viral clearance, symptom resolution, and adverse events. RESULTS: Of 685 participants, 632 (92.3%) self-identified as mixed-race, 377 (55.0%) were women, and the median (range) age was 53 (18-94) years. A total of 214 participants were randomized to hydroxychloroquine; 244, lopinavir-ritonavir; and 227, placebo. At first interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment of both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir groups because of futility. The proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 3.7% (8 participants) in the hydroxychloroquine group, 5.7% (14 participants) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 4.8% (11 participants) in the placebo group. We found no significant differences between interventions for COVID-19–associated hospitalization (hydroxychloroquine: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.30-1.88]; lopinavir-ritonavir: HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.53-2.56] as well as for the secondary outcome of viral clearance through day 14 (hydroxychloroquine: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]; lopinavir-ritonavir: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94-1.16]). At the end of the trial, there were 3 fatalities recorded, 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the lopinavir-ritonavir intervention group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir-ritonavir showed any significant benefit for decreasing COVID-19–associated hospitalization or other secondary clinical outcomes. This trial suggests that expedient clinical trials can be implemented in low-income settings even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under the effect of chemotherapeutics, the virus may change its genetic material and produces various strains, which are the main reasons behind the dreadful attack of COVID-19. The nuclear genetic components are composed of main protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which are responsible for producing nascent virion and viral replication in the host cells. To explore the biochemical mechanisms of various small molecule inhibitors, structure-based drug design can be attempted utilizing NMR crystallography. The process identifies and validates the target protein involved in the disease pathogenesis by the binding of a chemical ligand at a well-defined pocket on the protein surface.

The exacerbations are the major cost drivers in consumption of healthcare resources by COPD patients. Although bacterial infections are the most common etiologic agents, the role of viruses in COPD exacerbations is being increasingly recognized. The efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in acute exacerbations has established a causative role for bacterial infections. Recent molecular typing of sputum isolates further supports the role of bacteria in AECOPD. Isolation of a new strain of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with a considerable risk of an exacerbation. Lower airway bacterial colonization in stable patients with COPD instigates airway inflammation, which leads to a protracted self-perpetuating vicious circle of progressive lung damage and disease progression. A significant proportion of patients treated for COPD exacerbation demonstrate incomplete recovery, and frequent exacerbations contribute to decline in lung function. The predictors of poor outcome include advanced age, significant impairment of lung function, poor performance status, comorbid conditions and history of previous frequent exacerbations requiring antibacterials or systemic corticosteroids. These high-risk patients, who are likely to harbor organisms resistant to commonly used antimicrobials, should be identified and treated with antimicrobials with a low potential for failure. An aggressive management approach in complicated exacerbations may reduce costs by reducing healthcare utilization and hospitalization.","Sharma, Sat; Anthonisen, Nicholas",Treat Respir Med,591,33

Rethinking assumptions about the relationship between teaching quality and school-level advantage,16.909302,1.9388471,2021-07-28,"Health care–associated infections (HCAIs) are a significant concern for both health care workers (HCWs) and patients. They are a major contributing factor of disease in industrialized countries, and are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and a direct annual financial loss of $6-7 billion in North America alone. They are an increasingly challenging health issue due to multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci among others, along with an increasing number of susceptible patients. Over the last three decades, the risk of HCAIs has increased in the radiology department (RD) in part because of an increased number of patients visiting the department and an increase in the utilization of imaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss how patients and staff can be exposed to HCAIs in the RD, including contaminated inanimate surfaces, radiology equipment, and associated medical devices. As the role of medical imaging has extended from primarily diagnosis to include more interventions, the implementation and development of standardized infection minimization protocols and infection control procedures are vital in the RD, particularly in interventional radiology. With globalisation and the rapid movement of people regionally, nationally, and globally, there is greater risk of exposure to contagious diseases such as Ebola, especially if infected patients are undiagnosed when they travel. For effective infection control, advanced training and education of HCWs in the RD is essential. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of HCAIs as related to activities of the RD. We will discuss the following major topics including the variety of HCAIs commonly encountered, the role of the RD in HCAIs, transmission of infections to patients and HCWs in the RD, standard infection prevention measures, and the management of susceptible/infected patients in the RD. We shall also examine the role of, and the preparedness of, HCWs, including RD technologists and interventional radiologists, who may be exposed to undiagnosed, yet infected patients. We shall conclude with a brief discussion of the role of further research related to HCAIs. Learning Objectives After the completion of this review article, the readers will • Understand the exposure and role of radiology department in health care–associated infections, • Know the causes/modes/transmission of infections in radiology department, • Be conscious of standard disinfection protocols, • Be aware of current and future strategies required for the effective control of health care–associated infection in the radiology department.

Then, this study aimed to model and forecast of COVID-19 new cases in these top 10 infected African countries. Methods: In this study, the COVID 19 new cases data have been modeled and forecasted using curve estimation regression and time series models for these top 10 infected African countries from Feb 14 to Sep 6, 2020. Results: From July to August, the prevalence of COVID-19 cumulative cases was declined in South Africa, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Cameron, Nigeria, and Algeria by 31%, 26%, 22%, 20%, 14%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. But, it was highly raised in Ethiopia and Morocco by 41%, and 38% in this period, respectively. In Kenya, it was raised only by 1%. In this study, the cubic regression models for the ln(COVID-19 new cases) data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. And, the quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire and Ghana. The Algeria data was followed the logarithmic regression model. In the time series analysis, the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana, and Nigeria data have fitted the simple exponential smoothing models. The Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. In the analysis, the trends of COVID-19 new cases will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia, and the trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, it will be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya, and significantly for Morocco and South Africa from September 7 to October 6, 2020. Conclusion: This study was conducted with the current measures; the forecasts and trends obtained may differ from the number of cases that occur in the future. Thus, the study finding should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in African countries. And, the researcher recommended that as many countries continue to relax restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, and more are opening their airspaces, and the countries other public and private sectors are reopening. So, strong appropriate public health and social measures must be instituted on the grounds again.","Argawu, A.",,591,20

The purpose of this study was to describe the first few COVID 19 cases in Ethiopia. METHOD: Descriptive study was conducted on the first 33 consecutive RT-PCR confirmed COVID 19 cases diagnosed and managed at Ekka-Kotebe COVID Treatment Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. RESULT: The median age of the cases was 36 years. Cough, headache and fever were the most frequent symptoms. Diarrhea, sore throats, loss of taste and/or smell sensation were among the rare symptoms. Most (84.8%) had mild to moderate disease, and 15.2%(n=5) were critical at the time of admission. Among the five ICU admissions, four patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Thirty cases were discharged after two pairs of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples turned negative for SARS CoV2. Three cases from the ICU died while on mechanical ventilator. The age of the two deaths was 65 years, and one was 60 years. With the exception of three, all cases were either imported from abroad or had contact with confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: Most of our patients were in the younger age group with male predominance and few with comorbidities. Cough was the commonest symptom followed by headache and fever. As it was in the early stage of the pandemic, observation of more cases in the future will reveal further clinical and demographic profiles of COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia.","Teklu, Sisay; Sultan, Menbeu; Azazh, Aklilu; Worku, Aschalew; Redae, Berhane; Walelegn, Miraf; Tefera, Muluwork; Argaw, Rahel; Waganew, Woldesenbet; Yifru, Sisay; Amogne, Wondwossen; Tssema, Natinael; Bekele, Abebaw; Gebregziabher, Yonas; Araya, Hiruy; Birhanu, Addisu; Demoz, Getachew; Tadesse, Bethlehem; Seman, Yakob; Abayneh, Aschalew",Ethiop J Health Sci,591,11

Experience with a computer-based case simulation OSCE (CCS-OSCE)(),16.750132,1.6050644,2021-06-19,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently emerged virus that has caused a number of human infections and deaths, primarily in the Middle East. The transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camels, but evidence of human-to-human transmission also exists. In order to work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory setting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that MERS-CoV should be handled at a biosafety level (BSL) 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. Many processes and procedures used to characterize MERS-CoV and to evaluate samples from MERS-CoV infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at BSL-2 or lower containment. In order to complete experimental work at BSL-2, demonstration or proof of inactivation is required before removal of specimens from biocontainment laboratories. In the studies presented here, we evaluated typical means of inactivating viruses prior to handling specimens at a lower biocontainment level. We found that Trizol, AVL buffer and gamma irradiation were effective at inactivating MERS-CoV, that formaldehyde-based solutions required at least 30 minutes of contact time in a cell culture system while a mixture of methanol and acetone required 60 minutes to inactivate MERS-CoV. Together, these data provide a foundation for safely inactivating MERS-CoV, and potentially other coronaviruses, prior to removal from biocontainment facilities.","Kumar, Mia; Mazur, Steven; Ork, Britini L.; Postnikova, Elena; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Johnson, Reed; Holbrook, Michael R.",Journal of Virological Methods,591,26

Sin embargo, se desconoce en qué medida podría estar en relación con la inflamación sistémica e hipercoagulabilidad producidas en el contexto de la infección. Métodos: Descripción de cuatro pacientes atendidos en nuestro Centro por ictus isquémico y diagnóstico de COVID-19, clasificándolos según el grado de probabilidad causal entre el estado de hipercoagulabilidad y el ictus isquémico. Revisión de la literatura sobre los posibles mecanismos implicados en la etiopatogenia del ictus isquémico en este contexto. Resultados: Dos pacientes se consideraron con alta probabilidad causal: presentaban infartos corticales, sin patología cardioembólica ni arterial significativa, con parámetros de inflamación sistémica e hipercoagulabilidad; las otras dos pacientes eran de edad avanzada y el ictus isquémico se consideró cardioembólico, con una probable asociación casual de COVID-19. Conclusiones: La inflamación sistémica, junto con la posible acción directa del virus, provocaría disfunción endotelial, generando un estado de hipercoagulabilidad que podría considerarse una causa potencial de ictus isquémico. Sin embargo, puesto que los mecanismos del ictus pueden ser múltiples, se precisan estudios más amplios que evalúen esta hipótesis. Mientras tanto, el estudio etiológico del ictus en pacientes con COVID-19 debe ser sistemático atendiendo a los protocolos vigentes, con las adaptaciones necesarias en relación con las circunstancias clínicas y epidemiológicas de la actual pandemia. Abstract Introduction: Ischaemic stroke has been reported in patients with COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases. However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. Materials and methods: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. Results: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. Conclusions: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis. The management protocol for patients with stroke and COVID-19 should include a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed.","María Barrios-López, José; Rego-García, Iago; Martínez, Claudia Muñoz; Romero-Fábrega, Juan Carlos; Rodríguez, Mar Rivero; Giménez, Jesús Antonio Ruiz; Escamilla-Sevilla, Francisco; Mínguez-Castellanos, Adolfo; Pérez, María Dolores Fernández",Neurologia,591,20

This puts them at a high risk of psychological distress which may compromise patient care. In this study we aim to explore the risk perceptions and psychological distress between HCWs and non-healthcare workers (NHCWs) in Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Pakistan using an online self-administered questionnaire. Respondents were categorized into HCWs (completed or aspiring to complete education in Medicine or allied fields) and NHCWs. HCWs were further categorized into front-line (direct patient care) and back-end HCWs. Results Data from 1406 respondents (507 HCWs and 899 NHCWs) was analyzed. No significant difference was observed between HCWs and NHCWs perception of susceptibility and severity towards COVID-19. Healthcare graduates perceived themselves (66% students vs. 80% graduates, p-value 0.011) and their family (67% students vs. 82% graduates, p-value 0.008) to be more susceptible to COVID-19 than the healthcare students. Frontline HCWs perceived themselves (83% frontline vs. 70% back-end, p-value 0.003) and their family (84% frontline vs. 72% back-end, p-value 0.006) as being more susceptible to COVID-19 than back-end healthcare professionals. Over half of the respondents were anxious (54% HCWs and 55% NHCWs). Female gender, younger age and having COVID-19 related symptoms had a significant effect on the anxiety levels of both HCWs and NHCWs. Conclusion Frontline HCWs, healthcare students, young people, females and individuals with lower income were at a higher risk of psychological distress due to the pandemic. Government policies should thus be directed at ensuring the mental well-being of frontline HCWs, and improving their satisfaction in order to strengthen health care delivery system.","Abid, D.

Since 2009, China has implemented a new series of medical system reforms and the shortage and loss of primary medical staff have been alleviated accordingly. However, China has a large population and it is difficult to distribute health human resources evenly across regions. This study aimed to explore the current status of turnover intention and its relationship with psychological capital, social support, and job burnout, as well as how these factors influence turnover intention of primary medical staff in Anhui province, China. METHODS: Using structured questionnaires to collect data, including demographic characteristics, turnover intention, psychological capital, social support, and Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. A total of 1152 primary medical workers of Anhui were investigated. Data were analyzed by t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: Total scores of turnover intention, psychological capital, social support, and job burnout of subjects were 14.15 ± 4.35, 100.09 ± 15.98, 64.93 ± 13.23 and 41.07 ± 9.437, respectively. Multiple linear regression showed the related factors of turnover intention were age, job position, work unit, and scores of job burnout. Pearson correlation showed psychological capital and social support were negatively correlated with turnover intention, while the score of job burnout was positively correlated with turnover intention. CONCLUSION: The improvement of psychological capital and social support and the reduction of job burnout may play an important role in reducing turnover intention of primary medical staff. Primary medical managers should strengthen the humanistic care for primary medical staff, optimize the incentive mechanism, and improve internal management of medical institutions for stability.","Chen, Guimei; Sang, Lingzhi; Rong, Jian; Yan, Huosheng; Liu, Hongzhang; Cheng, Jing; Wang, Li; Ding, Hong; Chen, Ren",Hum Resour Health,591,20

Vaccination programs have also helped to increase food production notably poultry, cattle, and milk production due to lower incidence of infectious diseases in farm animals. Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines. Currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, and parasitic diseases including malaria. Abuse of antibiotics has resulted in the generation of several antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains; hence there is a need to develop novel vaccines for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

Quality improvement (QI) has been identified as a key framework and philosophy to guide organizational emergency response efforts; however, the nature and extent to which it has been used in public health settings during the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of literature published January 2020 - February 2021 and focused on the topic of QI at public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search was conducted on four bibliographic databases, in addition to a supplementary grey literature search using custom Google search engines and targeted website search methods. Of the 1,878 peer-reviewed articles assessed, 15 records met the inclusion criteria. An additional 11 relevant records were identified during the grey literature search, for a total of 26 records included in the scoping review. Results: Records were organized into five topics: 1) collaborative problem solving and analysis with stakeholders; 2) supporting learning and capacity building in QI; 3) learning from past emergencies; 4) implementing QI methods during COVID-19; and 5) evaluating performance using frameworks/indicators. Conclusions: The literature indicates that QI-oriented activities are occurring at the organizational and program levels to enhance COVID-19 response. To optimize the benefits that QI approaches and methodologies may offer, it is important for public health agencies to focus on both widespread integration of QI as part of an organization's management philosophy and culture, as well as project level activities at all stages of the emergency management cycle.","Yin, X.

These connections are particularly relevant in locations which have permanent or temporary limited accessibility. In these circumstances, people are required to be self-sufficient in providing emergency and long-term healthcare with limited resources. Planning and preparing to mitigate further harm after illness or injury from disasters (disaster risk reduction) must include people living and working in locations with limited accessibility, meaning that participatory research can be used. The challenges and opportunities of enacting participatory research in such contexts have not been thoroughly examined. The research question of this paper is therefore, “What challenges and opportunities occur when participatory research links disaster risk reduction and healthcare to mitigate illness and injury in locations with limited accessibility?” To answer this research question, the method used is a qualitative evidence synthesis, combined with an overview paper approach. Two principal themes of challenges and opportunities are examined: defining the data and collecting the data. The themes are explored in theory and then through contextual examples. The conclusion is that an overarching challenge is divergent goals of research and actions that, when recognized, lead to opportunities for improved connections between disaster risk reduction and healthcare.","Kelman, Ilan; Harris, Myles",Int J Environ Res Public Health,591,14

These symptoms are increasingly referred to as “long COVID” syndrome. They may be associated with radiological changes on computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function impairment. OBJECTIVES: To discuss the role of long-term assessment of COVID-19 patients to determine which patients may benefit from follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article presents the current results of clinical, radiological, and pulmonary function follow-up tests after COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Chronic fatigue and dyspnea are the most common persistent symptoms after COVID-19. Patients also present impaired exercise capacity. On CT, ground-glass opacities and parenchymal bands are the most common residual changes after COVID-19 pneumonia, histologically corresponding to organizing pneumonia. A proportion of patients who had severe COVID-19 pneumonia may show fibrotic-like changes during follow-up. Patients with severe acute infection may present with a restrictive syndrome with lower diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and total lung capacity (TLC) values. Overall, significant and continuous improvement in all symptoms as well as radiomorphological and functional changes were observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with persistent symptoms after COVID-19 should be evaluated and treated in specialized post-COVID-19 clinics in a multidisciplinary manner.","Milos, Ruxandra-Iulia; Kifjak, Daria; Heidinger, Benedikt H.; Prayer, Florian; Beer, Lucian; Röhrich, Sebastian; Wassipaul, Christian; Gompelmann, Daniela; Prosch, Helmut",Radiologe,591,8

METHODS: The search was conducted on April 30 and May 7, 2020, using Ovid database and Google search. Patients’ characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as selected characteristics regarding antibiotic use (indication, class used, rates and types of bacterial secondary and co-infection, and duration of treatment) were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical studies reporting data from 2834 patients were included. Mean rate of antibiotic use was 74.0 % of cases. Half the studies reported occurrence of a bacterial co-infection or complication (10 studies). Amongst the latter, at least 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections. Pooled data of 4 studies show that half of patients receiving antibiotics were not severe nor critical. Detailed data on antibiotic use lack in most articles. CONCLUSIONS: The present review found a major use of antibiotics amongst Covid-19 hospitalized patients, mainly in an empirical setting. There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.","Chedid, Marie; Waked, Rami; Haddad, Elie; Chetata, Nabil; Saliba, Gebrael; Choucair, Jacques",J Infect Public Health,591,20

Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems. Author summary Through ongoing human adaptation, spill-back events from other animal intermediates, or with the distribution of vaccines and therapeutics, the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation is certain to change. The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 will continue to adapt to mammalian hosts depend on genetic variation generated within and between hosts. Here, using domestic cats as a model, we show that within-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation is predominantly influenced by genetic drift and purifying selection. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between hosts is defined by a narrow transmission bottleneck, involving 2-5 viruses. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which arises rapidly and is transmitted in cats. Spike H655Y has been previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies and is currently found in over 1000 human sequences. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge, underscoring the importance of continued genomic surveillance in humans and non-human mammalian hosts.","Braun, Katarina M.; Moreno, Gage K.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Hodcroft, Emma B.; Baker, David A.; Boehm, Emma C.; Weiler, Andrea M.; Haj, Amelia K.; Hatta, Masato; Chiba, Shiho; Maemura, Tadashi; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Koelle, Katia; O’Connor, David H.; Friedrich, Thomas C.",bioRxiv,591,24

They can activate the goblet-cell-derived production of mucins, a major component of the mucus layer and a physical barrier participating in limiting the proximity of microorganisms to the epithelial layer. In the last decade, Bacillus spp. strains have gained interest in human and animal health due to their tolerance and stability under gastrointestinal tract conditions. Moreover, Bacillus spp. strains can also produce various antimicrobial peptides that can support their use as commercial probiotic supplements and functional foods. The present study aimed to evaluate and determine the ability of selected Bacillus spp. strains to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4 and to reduce binding of ETEC F4 to HT29-16E (mucus-secreting and goblet-like) human intestinal cells. Moreover, mucus production in the HT29 cells in the presence of the Bacillus spp. strains was quantified by ELISA. Bacillus spp. strains (CHCC 15076, CHCC 15516, CHCC 15541, and CHCC 16872) significantly inhibited the growth of ETEC F4. Moreover, the ability of the probiotic Bacillus spp. strains to stimulate mucin release was highly strain dependent. The treatment with Bacillus subtilis CHCC 15541 resulted in a significant increase of both MUC2 and MUC3 in HT29-16E cells. Therefore, this strain could be an up-and-coming candidate for developing commercial probiotic supplements to prevent infections caused by ETEC F4 and, potentially, other pathogens.","Bravo Santano, Natalia; Juncker Boll, Erik; Catrine Capern, Lena; Cieplak, Tomasz Maciej; Keleszade, Enver; Letek, Michal; Costabile, Adele",Antibiotics (Basel),591,16

A common denominator of all affected organs is the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protease responsible for the conversion of Angiotensin 1-8 (Ang II) to Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7). Ang 1-7 acts on these tissues and in other target organs via Mas receptor (MasR), where it exerts beneficial effects, including vasodilation and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis, along an attenuation of cardiac and vascular remodeling. Unfortunately, ACE2 also serves as the binding receptor of SARS viral spike glycoprotein, enabling its attachment to host cells, with subsequent viral internalization and replication. Although numerous reports have linked the devastating organ injuries to viral homing and attachment to organ-specific cells widely expressing ACE2, little attention has been given to ACE-2 expressed by the immune system. Herein we outline potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on macrophages and dendritic cells, key cells of the immune system expressing ACE2. Specifically, we propose a new hypothesis that, while macrophages play an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, in the case of SARS-CoV, they may also serve as a Trojan horse, enabling viral anchoring specifically within the pulmonary parenchyma. It is tempting to assume that diverse expression of ACE2 in macrophages among individuals might govern the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, reallocation of viral-containing macrophages migrating out of the lung to other tissues is theoretically plausible in the context of viral spread with the involvement of other organs.","Abassi, Zaid; Knaney, Yara; Karram, Tony; Heyman, Samuel N.",Front Immunol,591,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and two pre-print repositories (bioRxiv, medRxiv) were searched from inception to 8th June 2020 for RCTs and nonrandomized studies (retrospective and prospective, including single-arm, studies) addressing the use of CQ/HCQ in any dose or combination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included (6 RCTs, 26 nonrandomized, 29,192 participants). Two RCTs had high risk, two ‘some concerns’ and two low risk of bias (Rob2). Among nonrandomized studies with comparators, nine had high risk and five moderate risk of bias (ROBINS-I). Data synthesis was not possible. Low and moderate risk of bias studies suggest that treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 with CQ/HCQ may not reduce risk of death, compared to standard care. High dose regimens or combination with macrolides may be associated with harm. Postexposure prophylaxis may not reduce the rate of infection but the quality of the evidence is low. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 should be treated with CQ/HCQ only if monitored and within the context of high quality RCTs.

The implementation of social distancing measures strongly affected the Chilean economy: the unemployment rate grew rapidly as well as the proportion of population temporarily excluded from the labour force. This article analyses the strategies deployed by Chilean households to cope with the impact of the pandemic at the intersection with household structure and its socio-economics characteristics. Secondary data analysis from the Encuesta Social COVID-19 (COVID-19 Social Survey), carried out by the Chilean Ministry for Social Development and Families, were used to analyse the income-generating and expenditure-minimising strategies adopted by households during the early months (March to July of 2020) of the pandemic. The results show that 60.3% of households experienced a drop in family income, 70.3% indicated that they had to use at least one income-generating strategy, and 76.6% at least one expenditure-minimising strategy during the early months of the pandemic. Indebtedness and decapitalisation characterised most of the coping strategies adopted by households. While living in multigenerational households does not protect family members from declining economic well-being, older people living in one- and two-generation households were found to be least affected economically during the crisis. They were also less likely to resort to these coping strategies, insofar as their income was mainly secured from pensions. Although female-headed households did not show a greater reduction in income than male-headed households, they were more likely to adopt income-generating strategies. This article draws attention to the possible effects of decapitalisation and indebtedness on the long-term economic well-being of households with different structures, and the resulting inequalities in their capacity to recover from the effects of the pandemic. The findings suggest that having a source of family income that is not dependent on labour market flows is crucial in times of crises.","Palma, Julieta; Araos, Consuelo",Front Sociol,591,3

We investigated the clinical and laboratory features of recovered COVID-19 patients without pre-existing hematologic diseases at Wuhan No. 1 Hospital. Fifty-nine male and 68 female Chinese patients were included with the median age at 64 years in the present study. Eosinopenia (37.80%), monocytosis (51.97%), lymphocytopenia (25.20%), and anemia (51.97%) were the most common hematologic findings in our cohort, particularly in severe or critically ill COVID-19. The levels of changes in leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets, hemoglobin levels, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are overall associated with lung involvement, oxygen demand, and disease activity. However, changes of eosinophils (end hospitalization-baseline) (coefficients = 10.32; 95% CI = 1.03–19.60, P = 0.03) and basophils (Max − Min) (coefficients = 71.43; 95% CI = 8.55–134.31, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of delayed recovery in the hospital by the multivariate analysis in this recovered population.

One particularly promising first-line intervention is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via the Internet (iCBT). The outbreak of the Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) has made the need for solid digital mental health care systems clear. This is the first published study exploring the transition among therapists of working with face-to-face treatment to using iCBT for youths suffering from anxiety treated in primary care. METHODS: Fourteen primary care therapists were included in the study. Semi-structured interviews (n = 26) were conducted on two occasions: before starting to use iCBT for youths, and at a subsequent follow-up after gaining treatment experience. Data was summarized into thematic categories. RESULTS: The overarching themes that were identified were: Attitudes to iCBT before and after implementation; Experiences of treatment delivery; Characteristics of “the right patient;” and The role of the digital therapist. CONCLUSION: The participants generally had positive attitudes to iCBT for youths and saw it as a valuable alternative to face-to-face treatments. However, they identified challenges related to patient selection, and to motivating patients and maintaining a therapeutic relationship through mainly written communication. The participants appreciated the increase in variety that iCBT brought to their schedules, and also experienced iCBT as a relief from common challenges of therapeutic work, such as emotional stress and high cognitive demands. The participating therapists' positive experiences support the introduction of iCBT for youths in routine primary care.","Weineland, Sandra; Ribbegårdh, Rasmus; Kivi, Marie; Bygdell, Andreas; Larsson, Anna; Vernmark, Kristofer; Lilja, Josefine L.",Internet Interv,591,16

Although studies have examined the potential association between them, the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the true effect of ACEI/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Methods Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between ACEI/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results 22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI/ARBs was not associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%) or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19. The use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%).

METHODS: Electrocardiograms were recorded within, on average, 15 min from 705 patients in Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic. Interpretable 12-lead and 6-lead recordings were available for 685 out of 705 (97%) eligible patients. The most common diagnosis was congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS, 343/685 [50%]), followed by unaffected relatives and patients (146/685 [21%]), and patients with other genetic heart diseases, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (36 [5.2%]), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (23 [3.4%]), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (14 [2.0%]). IDMs were performed by a central ECG laboratory using lead II with a semi-automated technique. RESULTS: Despite differences in patient position (supine for 12-lead ECGs and sitting for 6-lead ECGs), mean IDMs were comparable, with mean values for the 12-lead and 6-lead ECGs for QTcF, heart rate, PR, and QRS differing by 2.6 ms, -5.5 beats per minute, 1.0 and 1.2 ms, respectively. Despite a modest difference in heart rate, intervals were close enough to allow a detection of clinically meaningful abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The 6-lead hand-held device is potentially useful for a clinical follow-up of remote patients, and for a safety follow-up of patients participating in clinical trials who cannot visit the investigational site. This technology may extend the use of 12-lead ECG recordings during the current COVID-19 pandemic as remote patient monitoring becomes more common in virtual or hybrid-design clinical studies.","Kleiman, Robert; Darpo, Borje; Brown, Randy; Rudo, Todd; Chamoun, Svetlana; Albert, David E; Bos, Johan Martijn; Ackerman, Michael J",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,591,6

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","Yu, Lin; Wu, Shanshan; Hao, Xiaowen; Li, Xuelong; Liu, Xiyang; Ye, Shenglong; Han, Heng; Dong, Xue; Li, Xin; Li, Jiyao; Liu, Jianmin; Liu, Na; Zhang, Wanzhong; Pelechano, Vicent; Chen, Wei-Hua; Yin, Xiushan",,591,4

Although this phenomenon forms an important part of the innate immune response to invading pathogens, it is responsible for the collateral host tissue damage observed in chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and in more acute disorders such as the lung injuries associated with COVID-19 infection. Previously, a combinatorially selected activity-based probe revealed an unexpected substrate preference for oxidised methionine, which suggests a link to oxidative pathogen clearance by neutrophils. Here we use oxidised model substrates and inhibitors to confirm this observation and to show that neutrophil elastase is specifically selective for the di-oxygenated methionine sulfone rather than the mono-oxygenated methionine sulfoxide. We also posit a critical role for ordered solvent in the mechanism of HNE discrimination between the two oxidised forms methionine residue. Preference for the sulfone form of oxidised methionine is especially significant. While both host and pathogens have the ability to reduce methionine sulfoxide back to methionine, a biological pathway to reduce methionine sulfone is not known. Taken together, these data suggest that the oxidative activity of neutrophils may create rapidly cleaved elastase “super substrates” that directly damage tissue, while initiating a cycle of neutrophil oxidation that increases elastase tissue damage and further neutrophil recruitment.","Leahy, Darren; Grant, Cameron; Jackson, Alex; Duff, Alex; Tardiota, Nicholas; Van Haeften, Jessica; Chen, Xingchen; Peake, Jonathan M.; Kruppa, Michael D.; Smith, Eliot T.; Johnson, David A.; Lott, William B.; Harris, Jonathan M.",Molecules,591,24

This resulted in large numbers of deaths, injuries, and population displacements, with collapse of the healthcare systems. Furthermore, the situation was complicated by the emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, which made the populations of these countries struggle under unusual conditions to deal with both the pandemic and the ongoing wars. This study aimed to determine the impact of the armed conflicts on the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) within these war-torn countries and highlight the strategies needed to combat the spread of the pandemic and its consequences. Methods: Official and public data concerning the dynamics of the armed conflicts and the spread of SARS-COV-2 in Libya, Syria and Yemen were collected from all available sources, starting from the emergence of COVID-19 in each country until the end of December 2020. Datasets were analyzed by a set of statistical techniques and the weekly resolved data were used to probe the link between the intensity levels of the conflict and the prevalence of COVID-19. Results: The data indicated that there was an increase in the intensity of the violence at an early stage from March to August 2020, when it approximately doubled in the three countries, particularly in Libya. During that period, few cases of COVID-19 were reported, ranging from 5 to 53 cases/day. From September to December 2020, a significant decline in the intensity of the armed conflicts was accompanied by steep upsurges in the rate of COVID-19 cases, which reached up to 500 cases/day. The accumulative cases vary from one country to another during the armed conflict. The highest cumulative number of cases were reported in Libya, Syria and Yemen. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that the armed conflict provided an opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 to spread. The early weeks of the pandemic coincided with the most intense period of the armed conflicts, and few cases were officially reported. This indicates undercounting and hidden spread during the early stage of the pandemic. The pandemic then spread dramatically as the armed conflict declined, reaching its greatest spread by December 2020. Full-blown transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in these countries is expected. Therefore, urgent national and international strategies should be implemented to combat the pandemic and its consequences.","Daw, Mohamed A.",Front Public Health,591,16

Methods We integrated patch-clamp studies utilizing In Vitro ProArrhythmia Assay (CiPA) Schema IC50 paradigms, molecular modelling, cardiac multi-electrode array and voltage (RH237) mapping, ECG studies, and Ca2+ (Rhod-2 AM) mapping in isolated Langendorff-perfused guinea-pig hearts with human in-silico ion current modelling. Results HCQ blocked IKr and IK1 with IC50s (10±0.6 and 34±5.0 μM) within clinical therapeutic ranges, INa and ICaL at higher IC50s, leaving Ito and IKs unaffected. AZM produced minor inhibition of INa, ICaL, IKs, and IKr,, sparing IK1 and Ito. HCQ+AZM combined inhibited IKr and IK1 with IC50s of 7.7±0.8 μM and 30.4±3.0 μM, sparing INa, ICaL and Ito. Molecular modelling confirmed potential HCQ binding to hERG. HCQ slowed heart rate and ventricular conduction. It prolonged PR, QRS and QT intervals, and caused prolonged, more heterogeneous, action potential durations and intracellular Ca2+ transients. These effects were accentuated with combined HCQ+AZM treatment, which then elicited electrical alternans, re-entrant circuits and wave break. Modelling studies attributed these to integrated HCQ and AZM actions reducing IKr and IK1, thence altering cell Ca2+ homeostasis. Conclusions Combined HCQ+AZM treatment exerts pro-arrhythmic ventricular events by synergetically inhibiting IKr, IKs with resulting effects on cellular Ca2+ signalling, and action potential propagation and duration. These findings provide an electrophysiological basis for recent FDA cardiac safety guidelines cautioning against combining HCQ/AZM when treating Covid-19.","Wang, Gongxin; Lu, Chieh-Ju; Trafford, Andrew W.; Tian, Xiaohui; Flores, Hannali M; Maj, Piotr; Zhang, Kevin; Niu, Yanhong; Wang, Luxi; Du, Yimei; Ji, Xinying; Xu, Yanfang; Wu, Lin; Li, Dan; Herring, Neil; Paterson, David; Huang, Christopher L.-H.; Zhang, Henggui; Lei, Ming; Hao, Guoliang",bioRxiv,591,16

As a result, the general population has significantly decreased their physical activity levels. The consequences of this abrupt, sedentary lifestyle in Spanish people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) were unknown. Our aim was to examine the impact of COVID-19 home confinement on neuromuscular performance, functional capacity, physical self-perception, and anxiety in pwMS. METHODS: Eighteen pwMS (8:10 men/women, age: 43.41±10.88 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale: 2.85±1.34) participated in the study. Rate of force development (RFD) and maximal voluntary isometric contraction during knee extension in both legs, Timed-Up and Go test (TUG), sit-to-stand test, 6 min walk test, 10 m walk test, Physical-Self Perception Questionnaire (PSPQ) and State-Train Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were performed just before and after home confinement. RESULTS: A non-significant moderate effect (p = 0.07; ES = -0.48) was observed in the time in the sit-to-stand test compared to pre-home confinement. There was a significant increase in the time in TUG (p = 0.02; ES = -0.67). The PSQP score decreased (p = 0.01; ES = 0.79) and STAI-state increased (p = 0.01; ES = -0.65) following home confinement. CONCLUSION: Home confinement had an impact on functional capacity, physical self-perception and state anxiety.

They can be adopted and applied to outdoor environments. However, many studies have shown that these two disinfectants are toxic to fishes and aquatic non-target organisms (primary producers and macroinvertebrates). The global market of these disinfectants will increase in coming years due to COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to highlight the toxicities of these disinfectants. The main findings of this article allow the community to develop a new strategy to protect the environment against the hazardous effects of disinfectants. Therefore, we use the “toxicity calculated ratio (TC ratio)” that refers to the fold increase or decrease in the toxicities reported in the literature (NOEC, LOEC, LC50 and EC50) relative to the WHO-recommended dose of HP and HC. The calculated TC ratios are valuable for policy makers to formulate the regulations to prevent disinfectant exposure in the environment. Our results were collected via PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) guidelines and showed that the TC ratios are from the single digits to several thousand-fold lower than the HP and HC recommended dose, which means these disinfectants are potentially dangerous to non-target organisms. The results also showed that HP and HC are toxic to the growth and reproduction of non-target organisms. Therefore, we recommend policymakers formulate protocols for critical assessment and monitoring of the environment—especially on non-target organisms in water bodies located in and around disinfectant-exposed areas to safeguard the environment in the future.","Subpiramaniyam, Sivakumar",Sci Total Environ,591,30

Harm reduction centres are often linked to social services, mental health services, and infectious disease testing, in addition to tools and services that help to reduce the harms associated with injecting drugs. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on these services in four autonomous communities in Spain. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that employed a seven-section structured survey administered electronically to 20 centres in July 2020. Data from the most heavily affected months (March–June) in 2020 were compared to data from the same period in 2019. Averages were calculated with their ranges, rates, and absolute numbers. RESULTS: All 11 responding centres reported having had to adapt or modify their services during the Spanish state of alarm (14 March–21 June 2020). One centre reported complete closure for 2 months and four reported increases in their operating hours. The average number of service users across all centres decreased by 22% in comparison to the same period in the previous year and the average needle distribution decreased by 40% in comparison to 2019. Most centres reported a decrease in infectious disease testing rates (hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis) for March, April, and May in 2020 compared to the previous year. Reported deaths as a result of overdose did not increase during the state of alarm, but 2/11 (18%) centres reported an increase in overdose deaths immediately after finalisation of the state of alarm. CONCLUSION: Overall, Spanish harm reduction centres were able to continue operating and offering services by adjusting operating hours. The number of overall service users and needles distributed fell during the Spanish state of alarm lockdown period, suggesting that fewer clients accessed harm reduction services during this time, putting them at greater risk of reusing or sharing injecting equipment, overdosing, acquiring infectious diseases with decreased access to testing or discontinuing ongoing treatment such as methadone maintenance therapy, hepatitis C treatment, or antiretroviral therapy.","Picchio, Camila A.; Valencia, Jorge; Doran, Jason; Swan, Tracy; Pastor, Marta; Martró, Elisa; Colom, Joan; Lazarus, Jeffrey V.",Harm Reduct J,591,16

Here, we describe a new use-case of conducting targeted wastewater surveillance to complement clinical testing for case identification in a small community at risk of COVID-19 transmission. On 2 July 2020, a cluster of COVID-19 cases in two unrelated households residing on different floors in the same stack of an apartment building was reported in Singapore. After cases were conveyed to healthcare facilities and six healthy household contacts were quarantined in their respective apartments, wastewater surveillance was implemented for the entire residential block. SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently detected in wastewaters in an increasing frequency and concentration, despite the absence of confirmed COVID-19 cases, suggesting the presence of fresh case/s in the building. Phone interviews of six residents in quarantine revealed that no one was symptomatic (fever/ respiratory illness). However, when nasopharyngeal swabs from six quarantined residents were tested by PCR tests, one was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive case reported episodes of diarrhea and the case's stool sample was also positive for SARS-CoV-2, explaining the SARS-CoV-2 spikes observed in wastewaters. After the case was conveyed to a healthcare facility, wastewaters continued to yield positive signals for five days, though with a decreasing intensity. This was attributed to the return of recovered cases, who had continued to shed the virus. Our findings demonstrate the utility of wastewater surveillance as a non-intrusive tool to monitor high-risk COVID-19 premises, which is able to trigger individual tests for case detection, highlighting a new use-case for wastewater testing.","Wong, Judith Chui Ching; Tan, Joanna; Lim, Ying Xian; Arivalan, Sathish; Hapuarachchi, Hapuarachchige Chanditha; Mailepessov, Diyar; Griffiths, Jane; Jayarajah, Praveena; Xiang, Setoh Yin; Tien, Wei Ping; Low, Swee Ling; Koo, Carmen; Yenamandra, Surya Pavan; Kong, Marcella; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming; Ching, Ng Lee",Sci Total Environ,591,20

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly associated with cardiovascular complications requiring hospitalizations; however, the mechanisms underlying these complications remain unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) are gasotransmitters that regulate key cardiovascular functions. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients and 33 controls and NO and H(2)S metabolites were assessed. H(2)S and NO levels were compared between cases and controls in the entire study population and subgroups based on race. The availability of gasotransmitters was examined based on severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. The performance of H(2)S and NO levels in predicting COVID-19 infection was also analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the effects of traditional determinants of gasotransmitters on NO and H(2)S levels in the patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Significantly reduced NO and H(2)S levels were observed in both Caucasian and African American COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher NO and H(2)S levels compared to COVID-19 patients who survived. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of NO and H(2)S metabolites in the study population showed free sulfide levels to be highly predictive of COVID-19 infection based on reduced availability. Traditional determinants of gasotransmitters, namely age, race, sex, diabetes, and hypertension had no effect on NO and H(2)S levels in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: These observations provide the first insight into the role of NO and H(2)S in COVID-19 infection, where their low availability may be a result of reduced synthesis secondary to endotheliitis, or increased consumption from scavenging of reactive oxygen species.","Dominic, Paari; Ahmad, Javaria; Bhandari, Ruchi; Pardue, Sibile; Solorzano, Juan; Jaisingh, Keerthish; Watts, Megan; Bailey, Steven R.; Orr, A.

A total of 1067 questionnaires were collected through snowball sampling. After three levels of coding based on Grounded Theory and Field Theory, parents’ key concerns were categorized as four personal factors (i.e., intuitive expectation, health issue, learning effectiveness, perceived epidemic safety) and three environmental factors (i.e., school environment, family environment, social environment). By factor weight analysis using the Kruskal–Wallis H test, a field model of factors that affect parents’ willingness was set up. Results indicated that learning effectiveness is the most critical factor affecting parents’ willingness. By considering both personal and environmental factors, most parents were not satisfied with the effect of home-based online education and expressed their willingness to send their children back to school and resume classes; however, they also worried about students’ epidemic awareness and self-protection abilities. Students’ development highly depends on the social atmosphere, a regular schedule, and environmental support from schools, which can hardly be achieved by home-based online learning. The findings suggest that the joint efforts of society, schools, and families are needed on the issue of students returning to school after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Zhan, Zehui; Li, Yuanmin; Yuan, Xinyue; Chen, Qi",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,591,1

Ebolavirus (EBOV) causes a severe, frequently fatal hemorrhagic syndrome in humans. Each outbreak of the Ebolavirus over the last three decades has perpetuated fear and economic turmoil among the local and regional populations in Africa. Until now it has been considered a tragic malady confined largely to the isolated regions of the African continent, but it is no longer so. The frequency of outbreaks has increased since the 1970s. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa has been the most severe in history and was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Given the widespread use of modern transportation and global travel, the EBOV is now a risk to the entire Global Village, with intercontinental transmission only an airplane flight away. Clinically, symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of approximately 11 days. A flu-like syndrome can progress to full hemorrhagic fever with multiorgan failure, and frequently, death. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of viral antigens or Ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the blood or other body fluids. Although historically the mortality of this infection exceeded 80%, modern medicine and public health measures have been able to lower this figure and reduce the impact of EBOV on individuals and communities. The treatment involves early, aggressive supportive care with rehydration. Core interventions, including contact tracing, preventive initiatives, active surveillance, effective isolation and quarantine procedures, and timely response to patients, are essential for a successful outbreak control. These measures, combined with public health education, point-of-care diagnostics, promising new vaccine and pharmaceutical efforts, and coordinated efforts of the international community, give new hope to the Global effort to eliminate Ebola as a public health threat. Here we present a review of EBOV infection in an effort to further educate medical and political communities on what the Ebolavirus disease entails, and what efforts are recommended to treat, isolate, and eventually eliminate it.","Kalra, Sarathi; Kelkar, Dhanashree; Galwankar, Sagar C.; Papadimos, Thomas J.; Stawicki, Stanislaw P.; Arquilla, Bonnie; Hoey, Brian A.; Sharpe, Richard P.; Sabol, Donna; Jahre, Jeffrey A.",J Glob Infect Dis,591,1

Confinement required finding innovative approaches to teaching and student assessment. This paper aims to share the experience of adapting the course in Biochemical Engineering, part of the Biotechnology program at Francisco de Vitoria University (Madrid, Spain), to remote learning. A sequence of collaborative learning activities, with active student participation, was designed to replace the traditional mid-term exam. Activities were carefully implemented, considering the range of learning styles. Engineering skills, transversal competences and higher-order thinking skills were fostered through these activities. The analysis of the teaching/learning experience was based on teacher observations, academic performance and student surveys. All indicators showed that the adopted methodology had a positive impact of student performance. Student participation, especially among those repeating the course, also improved. Furthermore, students gained a more accurate and positive perception of the link between Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, which may have a favourable impact on the teaching of Bioreactors in the coming academic year.","Ripoll, Vanessa; Godino-Ojer, Marina; Calzada, Javier",,591,15

This study employed a qualitative design to examine practitioners’ views pertaining to the roles and challenges of family participation in IA intervention. In total, 10 practitioners working with adolescents with IA were interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcribed interviews. Three overreaching themes were synthesized: That family involvement in IA intervention is challenging yet important; shifting the focus from the adolescent to the relationship; and provision of individualized services and intervention to address the heterogeneous nature of cases. The findings show that family participation in IA treatment is successful in enhancing positive outcomes. The needs of adolescents with IA and family members are addressed through individual counseling and psychoeducation, respectively. Conjoint therapy sessions foster effective communication, improve family interactions and functioning, and restore relationships. However, caution regarding family dynamics is required when considering whether family involvement is appropriate. Practitioners need to establish therapeutic alliances and be flexible when working with family members in terms of the degree and arrangement of participation.","Lo, Camilla Kin Ming; Yu, Lu; Cho, Yuet Wing; Chan, Ko Ling",Int J Environ Res Public Health,591,16

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of SARS in 165 clinically confirmed severe cases. Both age and existence of other diseases before SARS were significantly correlated with prognosis (r = 0.506 and r = 0.457, respectively; P < .001). During the acute phase of SARS, lactate dehydrogenase level, degree of hypoxemia, respiratory rate, α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase isoenzyme—MB, platelet count, and number of involved lobes noted on chest radiographs, and so on, correlated markedly with the prognosis (r = 0.257–0.788; P < .05). The multivariate prognosis regression model was associated with degree of hypoxemia and platelet count. The model was defined by the formula P(y=1) = e(s)/(1 + e(s)), where S is [2.490 × degree of hypoxemia]-[0.050 × number of platelets], and it had a high sensitivity (91.67%), specificity (98.33%), and accuracy (96.42%).

DESCRIPTION: The COVID-19 was first detected in China in December of 2019 and by March 2020 spread to the United States. As this virus has been associated with severe illness, it poses a threat to vulnerable populations—including pregnant women. The obstetric population already faces multiple barriers to receiving quality healthcare due to personal, environmental and economic barriers, now challenged with the additional risks of COVID-19 exposure and limited care in times much defined by social distancing. ASSESSMENT: The current prenatal care framework requires patients to attend multiple in-office prenatal visits that can exponentially multiply depending on maternal and fetal comorbidities. To decrease the rate of transmission of the COVID-19 and limit exposure to patients, providers in Hillsborough County, Florida (and nationwide) are rapidly transitioning to telehealth. The use of a virtual care model allows providers to reduce in-person visits and incorporate virtual visits into the schedule of prenatal care. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of telehealth and telehealth have become crucial to ensure the safe and effective delivery of obstetric care. This implementation is one that will continue to require attention to planning, procedures and processes, and thoughtful evaluation to ensure the sustainability of telehealth and telehealth post COVID-19 pandemic.","Fryer, Kimberly; Delgado, Arlin; Foti, Tara; Reid, Chinyere N.; Marshall, Jennifer",Matern Child Health J,591,1
690304,690304,690304,Potential long-term impacts of surgical placement cancellations,16.719595,1.9265229,2020-06-28,"COVID-19 in humans is caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that belongs to the beta family of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness in 10–15% of infected individuals and mortality in 2–3%. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and to contain viral spread. Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the “cold chain” transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS-CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated T(H)1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development. Finally, our vaccination regimens generated neutralizing antibodies that partially cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Kulkarni, Rakesh; Chen, Wen-Ching; Lee, Ying; Kao, Chi-Fei; Hu, Shiu-Lok; Ma, Hsiu-Hua; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Liao, Chun-Che; Liang, Jian-Jong; Ko, Hui-Ying; Sun, Cheng-Pu; Lin, Yin-Shoiou; Wang, Yu-Chiuan; Wei, Sung-Chan; Lin, Yi-Ling; Ma, Che; Chao, Yu-Chan; Chou, Yu-Chi; Chang, Wen",PLoS One,591,15
