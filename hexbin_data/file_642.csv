344,Mathematical Modeling of the Effectiveness of Facemasks in Reducing the Spread of Novel Influenza A (H1N1),2010-02-10,"On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) a pandemic. With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%. We can conclude from our model that, if worn properly, facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.","Tracht, Samantha M.; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Hyman, James M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818714/,642
2151,Identification of Known and Novel Recurrent Viral Sequences in Data from Multiple Patients and Multiple Cancers,2016-02-19,"Virus discovery from high throughput sequencing data often follows a bottom-up approach where taxonomic annotation takes place prior to association to disease. Albeit effective in some cases, the approach fails to detect novel pathogens and remote variants not present in reference databases. We have developed a species independent pipeline that utilises sequence clustering for the identification of nucleotide sequences that co-occur across multiple sequencing data instances. We applied the workflow to 686 sequencing libraries from 252 cancer samples of different cancer and tissue types, 32 non-template controls, and 24 test samples. Recurrent sequences were statistically associated to biological, methodological or technical features with the aim to identify novel pathogens or plausible contaminants that may associate to a particular kit or method. We provide examples of identified inhabitants of the healthy tissue flora as well as experimental contaminants. Unmapped sequences that co-occur with high statistical significance potentially represent the unknown sequence space where novel pathogens can be identified.","Friis-Nielsen, Jens; Kjartansdóttir, Kristín Rós; Mollerup, Sarah; Asplund, Maria; Mourier, Tobias; Jensen, Randi Holm; Hansen, Thomas Arn; Rey-Iglesia, Alba; Richter, Stine Raith; Nielsen, Ida Broman; Alquezar-Planas, David E.; Olsen, Pernille V.

Both infants had severe apneic spells, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV). Chest radiographs changed after a few days after institution of MV from initial bronchopneumonia like pattern to severe ARDS. Assessment of respiratory system mechanics (single breath occlusion technique) revealed severe restrictive disease in both cases. The first patient recovered with residual restrictive changes determined during a follow-up 2.5 months later, whereas the second infant died because of ARDS, pulmonary interstitial emphysema and hypoxemic hypoxia.","Bachmann, D.

16778,Improving VLBW infant outcomes with big data analytics,2021-04-13,"There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord provides benefits for term and preterm infants. These benefits include reductions in mortality in preterm infants and improved developmental scores at 4 years of age in term infants. However, non-breathing or non-vigorous infants at birth are excluded due to the perceived need for immediate resuscitation. Recent studies have demonstrated early physiological benefits in both human and animal models if resuscitation is performed with an intact cord, but this is still an active area of research. Given the large number of ongoing and planned trials, we have brought together an international group that have been intimately involved in the development or use of resuscitation equipment designed to be used while the cord is still intact. In this review, we will present the benefits and limitations of devices that have been developed or are in use. Published trials or ongoing studies using their respective devices will also be reviewed.","Katheria, Anup; Lee, Henry C.; Knol, Ronny; Irvine, Leigh; Thomas, Sumesh",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042840/,642
17332,AI-driven deep CNN approach for multi-label pathology classification using chest X-Rays,2021-04-20,"Traffic flow prediction is the foundation of many applications in smart cities, and the granular precision of traffic flow prediction has to be enhanced with refined applications. However, most of the existing researches cannot meet these requirements. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal attention based fusion network (ST-AFN), for lane-level precise prediction. This seq2seq model consists of three parts, namely speed process network, spatial encoder, and temporal decoder. In order to exploit the dynamic dependencies among lanes, attention mechanism blocks are embedded in those networks. The application of deep spatial-temporal information matrix results in progresses in term of reliability. Furthermore, a specific ground lane selection method is also proposed to ST-AFN. To evaluate the proposed model, four months of real-world traffic data are collected in Xiaoshan District, Hangzhou, China. Experimental results demonstrate that ST-AFN can achieve more accurate and stable results than the benchmark models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning method has been applied to forecast traffic flow at the lane level on urban ground roads instead of expressways or elevated roads.","Shen, Guojiang; Yu, Kaifeng; Zhang, Meiyu; Kong, Xiangjie",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8080424/,642

21130,A Hybrid SSA and SMA with Mutation Opposition-Based Learning for Constrained Engineering Problems,2021-09-07,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases and has no specific treatment. It has been shown that dysfunction of pancreatic acinar cells can lead to AP progression. Emodin is a natural product, which can alleviate the symptoms of AP. However, the mechanism by which emodin regulates the function of pancreatic acinar cells remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which emodin modulates the function of pancreatic acinar cells. To mimic AP in vitro, pancreatic acinar cells were cotreated with caerulein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Exosomes were isolated using the ExoQuick precipitation kit. Western blot analysis, Nanosight Tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were performed to detect the efficiency of exosome separation. Gene expression was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were detected by ELISA. The data indicated that emodin significantly decreased the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the supernatant samples derived from AR42J cells cotreated with caerulein and LPS. In addition, emodin significantly promoted the proliferation of AR42J cells cotreated with caerulein and LPS, and inhibited apoptosis, while the effect of emodin was reversed by long non-coding (lnc)RNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) overexpression. The expression level of TUG1 in AR42J cells or exosomes derived from AR42J cells was significantly increased following treatment of the cells with LPS and caerulein, while this effect was notably reversed by emodin treatment. In addition, exosomes derived from caerulein and LPS cotreated AR42J cells inhibited the differentiation and anti-inflammatory function of regulatory T cells, while treatment of the cells with emodin significantly decreased this effect. In conclusion, the data indicated that emodin inhibited the induction of inflammation in AR42J cells by regulating the expression of cellular and exosomal lncRNA. Therefore, emodin may be used as a potential agent for the treatment of AP.","Wen, Xiumei; He, Beihui; Tang, Xing; Wang, Bin; Chen, Zhiyun",Mol Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441981/,642

23882,Towards Merging Models of Information Spreading and Dynamic Phenomena in Social Networks,2013,"Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is the first leading cause of death due to infection worldwide.Many gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria, funguses and viruses can cause the infectious pulmonary disease, and the severity of pneumonia depends on the balance between the microorganism charge, the body immunity defenses and the quality of the underlying pulmonary tissue. The microorganisms may reach the lower respiratory tract from inhaled air or from infected oropharyngeal secretions. The same organism may produce several different patterns that depend on the balance between the microorganism charge and the body immunity defenses.CAP is classified into three main groups: lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia.Lobar pneumonia is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces by edema full of white and inflammatory cells. Necrotizing pneumonia consists of a fulminant process associated with focal areas of necrosis that results in abscesses. Bronchopneumonia or lobular pneumonia, is characterized by a peribronchiolar inflammation with thickening of peripheral bronchial wall, the diffusion of inflammation to the centrilobular alveolar spaces and development of nodules.The interstitial pneumonia represents with the destruction and esfoliation of the respiratory ciliated and mucous cells. The interstitial septa, the bronchial and bronchiolar walls become thickened for the inflammation process and lymphocytes interstitial infiltrates.Chest radiography represents an important initial examination in all patients suspected of having pulmonary infection and for monitoring response to therapy.Its role is to identify the pulmonary opacities, their internal characteristics and distribution, pleural effusion and presence of other complications as abscesses and pneumothorax.High spatial CT resolution allows accurate assessment of air space inflammation.The CT findings include nodules, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular reticular opacities, ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud pattern, lobar-segmental consolidation, lobular consolidation, abscesses, pneumatocele, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal and hilar lymphoadenopaties, airway dilatation and emphysema.","Agarwal, P.; Romano, L.; Prosch, H.; Schueller, G.",Emergency Radiology of the Chest and Cardiovascular System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120007/,642

30437,Contributed Abstracts,2005-07-25,"OBJECTIVE: Respiratory syncytial virus is a pathogen frequently involved in nosocomial outbreaks. Although several studies have reported nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units, molecular epidemiology data are scarce. Here, the authors describe two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks caused by genotypes ON‐1 and NA‐2 in a neonatal intensive care unit in São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus‐A (ten and 14 with ON‐1 and NA‐2 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961 g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks. Risk factors (heart disease, lung disease, and prematurity) were present in 80% and 85.7% of infants in the ON‐1 and NA‐2 groups, respectively. In total, 45.8% of infants were asymptomatic and 20.8% required mechanical ventilation. Coinfections were not detected during the outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who develop abrupt respiratory symptoms should be tested for respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus. Even in the absence of severe symptoms, respiratory syncytial virus detection can prevent nosocomial transmission through infection control measures. A better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology is essential for developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs against respiratory syncytial virus.","Silva, Daniella Gregoria Bomfim Prado da; Almeida, Flávia Jacqueline; Arnoni, Mariana Volpe; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Mimica, Marcelo Jenne; Jarovsky, Daniel; Rossetti, Gabriela Pereira de Almeida; Magalhães, Mauricio; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Colmanetti, Thais Cristina; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Berezin, Eitan Naaman",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156209/,642

A 26-year-old man was referred to our hospital presenting with jaundice, lower limb edema, and dyspnea. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with spur cell anemia related to alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Spur cell anemia is an independent predictor of mortality in liver cirrhosis and has been associated with extremely poor prognosis. The most effective treatment for spur cell anemia is liver transplantation. As seen in the literature, the treatment of spur cell anemia without liver transplantation is quite challenging. This report highlights the importance of management and treatment strategies, including control of fluid retention, blood transfusion, plasma diafiltration, and administration of diuretics.

33504,Online Reinforcement Learning for Self-adaptive Information Systems,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is a parasitic disease that causes serious medical consequences if treatment is delayed. Despite a decline in the number of VL cases in the Indian subcontinent, the commencement of the disease in newer areas continues to be a major concern. Although serological diagnosis mainly by immunochromatographic tests has been found to be effective, a test of cure in different phases of treatment is still desired. Even though a good prophylactic response has been obtained in murine models by a number of vaccine candidates, few have been proposed for human use. METHODS: In this study, nine antigenic components (31, 34, 36, 45, 51, 63, 72, 91 and 97 kDa) of Leishmania promastigote membrane antigens (LAg), were electroeluted and evaluated through ELISA to diagnose and distinguish active VL from one month cured and six months post-treatment patients. Further, to investigate the immunogenicity of electroeluted proteins, human PBMCs of cured VL patients were stimulated with 31, 34, 51, 63, 72 and 91 kDa proteins. RESULTS: We found that 34 and 51 kDa proteins show 100% sensitivity and specificity with healthy controls and other diseases. After six months post-treatment, antibodies to 72 and 91 kDa antigens show a significant decline to almost normal levels. This suggests that 34 and 51 kDa proteins are efficient in diagnosis, whereas 72 and 91 kDa proteins may be used to monitor treatment outcome. In another assay, 51 and 63 kDa proteins demonstrated maximum ability to upregulate IFN-γ and IL-12 with minimum induction of IL-10 and TGF-β. The results indicating that 51 and 63 kDa proteins could be strong candidates for human immunization against VL. In contrast, 34 and 91 kDa proteins demonstrated a reverse profile and may not be a good vaccine candidate. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary data obtained in this study proposes the potential of some of the antigens in Leishmania diagnosis and for test of cure. Additionally, some antigens demonstrated good immunoprophylactic cytokine production through T cell-mediated immune response, suggesting future vaccine candidates for VL. However, further studies are necessary to explore these antigens in diagnosis and to access the long-term immune response.

However, most approaches adopt a crisp evaluation of deviations, with the result that small violations are considered at the same level of significant ones. Furthermore, in the presence of multiple data constraints the overall deviation severity is assessed by summing up each single deviation. This approach easily leads to misleading diagnostics; furthermore, it does not take into account user’s needs, that are likely to differ depending on the context of the analysis. We propose a novel methodology based on the use of aggregation functions, to assess the level of deviation severity for a set of constraints, and to customize the tolerance to deviations of multiple constraints.","Zhang, Sicui; Genga, Laura; Dekker, Lukas; Nie, Hongchao; Lu, Xudong; Duan, Huilong; Kaymak, Uzay",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274327/,642

The material appearance of products is greatly affected by the distribution of the particle size. From that fact, it is important to obtain the distribution of the particle size to design the material appearance of products. To obtain the particle size distribution, it is necessary to segment particle regions in the microscopic image of colorants. Conventionally, this segmentation is performed manually using simple image processing. However, this manual processing leads to low reproducibility. Therefore, in this paper, to extract the particle region with high reproducibility, segmentation is performed using U-Net based deep convolutional networks. We improved deep convolutional U-Net type networks based on the feature maps trained for a microscopic image of colorants. As a result, we obtained more accurate segmentation results using the improved network than conventional U-Net.","Tsunomura, Mari; Shishikura, Masami; Ishii, Toru; Takahashi, Ryo; Tsumura, Norimichi",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340946/,642

At present, the decision tree reasoning technique and data mining are often used in multi-objective optimization research to solve flexible job shop scheduling issues. Unfortunately, when job shop scheduling problems involve complex logic, it becomes difficult to implement data-driven automatic scheduling without human intervention. Based on the analysis of mass data and specialized knowledge in the scheduling domain, an ontology-based scheduling knowledge model and a method of knowledge representation can be established. Considering the relationship between data mining and knowledge, this paper illustrates the acquisition process of scheduling rules. These scheduling rules were applied to improve the initialization process of the artificial fish algorithm. Then, a scheduling experiment was designed, the results of which show that the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm has been improved. The desired uncertain information analysis, decision-making support for production planning and scheduling on the shop floor are provided and an adaptive scheduling algorithm for complex manufacturing systems is established by building a knowledge-based system.","Peng, Jieyang; Wang, Jiahai; Wang, Dongkun; Kimmig, Andreas; Ovtcharova, Jivka",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354815/,642

The new approach computes the performance antipatterns present across the operational profile space of a software system under development, enabling engineers to identify operational profiles likely to be problematic for the analysed design, and supporting the selection of refactoring actions when performance requirements are violated for an operational profile region of interest. We demonstrate the application of our approach for a software system comprising a combination of internal (i.e., in-house) components and external third-party services.","Calinescu, Radu; Cortellessa, Vittorio; Stefanakos, Ioannis; Trubiani, Catia",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418116/,642

Modi declared that Australia was no longer on the ‘periphery’ of New Delhi’s ‘vision’, ‘but at the centre of our thoughts’. He pledged to work with Canberra at the G20 and regional multilateral forums, deepen the bilateral security partnership, and conclude a free trade deal. These promises were only partly realised. Progress was made in defence and security cooperation, within and outside the Quad, but a free trade deal proved too hard. Canberra struggled to maintain momentum in improving ties because of leadership challenges in Australian government and New Delhi’s preference for protectionism. This article examines these dynamics, looking back at the drivers of the strategic partnership, as well as at the challenges encountered in the Modi era.","Hall, Ian",Int Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7851315/,642

47208,"New Zealand Shellfish Detection, Recognition and Counting: A Deep Learning Approach on Mobile Devices",2021-03-18,"This paper investigates the payment scheme and forecast information sharing issues in the express delivery logistics with the high-speed railway. The HSR carriers need to coordinate the transportation capacity between passenger and freight. It is widely recognized that the advance payment scheme (APS) using as deposit is a beneficial way for the HSR carriers to make decisions on the transportation capacity preserved for express delivery. However, the express service providers, who possess private forecast information of express delivery demand, may share inaccurate information with the HSR carriers to acquire sufficient preserved transportation capacity. This paper discusses what payment scheme is preferred by the HSR carrier, the express service provider through discussing the deposit decisions with or without forecast information sharing. We show that sharing demand forecast information can reduce the prereserved capacity and increase the profits of the HSR carrier. With the delayed payment scheme (DPS), the express service provider has no motivation to share the information; while with the APS, the HSR carrier can reasonably choose the deposit to encourage the express service provider to share the demand information. Our analysis also shows that the HSR carrier’s profits with the APS is restricted by the investment returns and the express service provider’s information sharing decisions. We also analyze the value range of the deposit, which is a proportion of the overall payment, that allows both the HSR carrier and the express service provider to prefer the APS, as well as to encourage the express service provider to share the demand information.","Duan, Huawei; Ye, Yusen; Lei, Zheng; Wang, Mengting",Complex Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971411/,642

Instead of approaching PSM’s market impact from a crowding-out perspective, we focus on how these organizations contribute to creating, shaping, and sustaining markets. We identify two key areas of risk that PSM organizations are actively negotiating and/or as part of a change to their remit and responsibilities: first, in creating and sustaining a supply base of indigenous content, and second, in contributing to innovation capacity. Whilst we don’t argue that all PSM organizations are engaging in these equally, or even delivering effectively on these agendas, we want to highlight the important contribution that PSM makes to creative economies and to economic and cultural activity within nation states more generally. The chapter concludes by arguing that by undermining the scale and funding of PSM their capacity to assume that risk is weakening, and that this will have implications for the entire marketplace.","Rodríguez-Castro, Marta; Noonan, Caitriona; Ramsey, Phil",The Values of Public Service Media in the Internet Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971634/,642

This case study revisits two research projects on curricular resources: the first, in 2019, analyzes partially structured syllabi data in digital humanities, and the second, in 2021, focuses on unstructured course titles and descriptions in LIS course catalogs. Findings reexamine data collection and analysis processes in which the lack of linked semantic metadata and persistent digital objects in curricular resources impedes fruitful research on how (inter)disciplinary topics are taught and future researchers trained. Consequently, the case study locates a gap: the role of pedagogical documentation in the research lifecycle has not been considered. As suggested by the emergence of FAIR principles, metadata expertise is a foundation for establishing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of persistent digital objects in research outputs. FAIRising pedagogical documentation for the research lifecycle holds potential to link curricular resources with other research outputs. Information professionals have a leadership role in assisting faculty to create FAIRised pedagogical documentation, and curricular resources so prepared address the gap for integrating pedagogical documentation with the research lifecycle. Benefits include recognition of curricular resources as vital research outputs and facilitating longitudinal research on (inter)disciplinary pedagogical practices in the FAIR ecosystem.","Garwood, Deborah A.; Poole, Alex H.",Metadata and Semantic Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971792/,642

47682,Feature Learning of Patent Networks Using Tensor Decomposition,2020-12-10,"Purpose: the research of the significance, positive and negative socio-economic factors, features of scientific, technological and legal development of biotechnology in Russia and in the world; the identification of the existing problems of the legal regulation of biotechnology in Russia; studying the experience of foreign countries in the legal regulation of biotechnological activities; studying the characteristics of biotechnological objects to correlate them with the sources of increased danger, including the activities related to the development, creation and testing of viruses, as having increased danger to others. Design/Methodology/Approach: Industry 4.0 leads to the mass introduction of cyber-physical systems in production, to the automation of most of the production processes, to the endowment of devices with artificial intelligence and the introduction of many other modern technologies. Biotechnology is an integral part of Industry 4.0, which involves a rapid breakthrough in the research of medicines, diagnostic methods, finding new vaccines, creating the ways to protect human organisms and biosystems, and creating artificially modified biological microorganisms. The demand for biotechnology creates the need to create and improve the legal framework for biotechnological developments. The authors used the methods of systematic analysis and comparative legal analysis to identify and consider the existing problems of the legal regulation of biotechnology in Russia. Findings: biotechnology implies significant changes in various spheres of society’s activity, including a positive modification of the medical sphere, due to the wide spread of new methods of personalized medicine, and an increase in the efficiency of treatment. The issue of recognizing the increased harmfulness of certain objects or activities in relation to such areas of biotechnology as the energy waste management, biofuel production, bioenergy engineering, the prevention and elimination of environmental pollution, bioengineering, breeding technology, production of electrical energy from biomaterials, etc. remains unresolved. The liability for causing harm by activities that create increased danger, due to the inability of a person to fully control it, is one of the gaps in the current civil law regulation. The justification and assessment of recognizing certain specific types of biotechnology as a source of increased danger have yet to be objectively justified by the doctrinal basis, judicial practice and the regulations. Originality/Value: it is concluded that the high prospects of the theoretical biotechnological developments cause the need for their legalization and legislative regulation. Based on the danger, harmfulness and uncontrollability of viruses, any activity related to viruses, from their creation to the work of medical staff to treat an infected person, is recommended to be recognized as a source of increased danger. The definition of the source of increased danger is given, and the criteria for classifying an object as a source of increased danger are called. The identified criteria are compared with the characteristic features of biotechnological objects. It is suggested that the activities associated with the risk of infection with infectious diseases be considered a priori as a source of increased danger. The inability of a person to control the spread of viruses, including infection, harmfulness and increased probability of causing harm, prove the need for a separate indication in the legislation of this source and the adoption of appropriate measures for any activity in which a person is directly exposed to the contact with infection and the threat of infection and spread of the disease.","Inshakova, Agnessa O.; Baltutite, Iolanta V.; Epifanov, Alexander E.; Abesalashvili, Marine Z.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972286/,642

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are a unique population that require long-term care to achieve and maintain deep remission of disease. Thus, they require stable and continuous contact with healthcare providers, often with multiple appointments. We examined an IBD predominant practice, also providing care for general gastrointestinal (GI) conditions in Kelowna, British Columbia. As telehealth has the potential to become a standard of care for clinics, patient satisfaction must be considered. We hypothesize that with the efficacy and ease of remote appointments, there will be an increase in patient satisfaction, quality of care, and quality of communication. AIMS: We aim to compare the level of patient satisfaction between in-person appointments pre-pandemic, and current remote appointment telehealth practices. METHODS: An online survey was sent to the 608 patients who had participated in one or more remote appointment between March 15-June 15, 2020. The survey compared the level of patient satisfaction, quality of care, and quality of communication between patient and doctor before and during the pandemic. It was also determined if patients would elect to continue with remote appointments in the future due to ease of use, and time/financial resources saved. RESULTS: Of the 273 participants, 80% were IBD patients while 20% were treated for other GI conditions. A total of 78% reported that they would elect to continue with remote appointments as their primary point of care with their doctor. The remaining 22% reported that they prefer in-person visits due to the necessity of a physical exam, yet specified that communication by these remote means was still of good quality. Levels of patient satisfaction before and during the pandemic remained consistent, where 59% of patients assigned a satisfaction rating of 10 (highest) to their pre-pandemic in-person appointments, and 54% of patients assigned a rating of 10 to their remote appointments during the pandemic. Similar consistent results were found for quality of care and quality of communication. A total of 70% of patients reported that if this service had not been available, they would have sought out other forms of care; 18% of the total responses considering emergency care. CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients at Kelowna Gastroenterology perceived similar levels of satisfaction, quality of care, and quality of communication with both in-person and telehealth appointments. This suggests that telehealth practices may be a cost-effective, sustainable appointment style that provides comparable quality to in-person appointments.

48763,Telemedicine AI App for Prediction of Pets Joint Diseases,2021-01-03,"The paper is an attempt to relate renewable energy (RE) diffusion to important macroeconomic variables for India. It has utilized macroeconometric time-series methods to estimate the potential for RE diffusion by capturing its temporal movement with respect to variables such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, fiscal deficit, call money rate, energy imports and unemployment rate. An auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model has been estimated, which is then used to forecast the RE potential under three alternative cases—business-as-usual, optimistic and pessimistic. The ARDL model estimation pointed towards an equilibrium co-integrating long-run relationship between RE and key macroeconomic variables. The long-run level of GDP, call money rate and the ratio of renewable energy to fossil energy tariffs were found to be positively associated with RE diffusion, while fiscal deficit, net energy imports, population access to electricity, population level and unemployment displayed a negative relationship with RE. It has also been found that, relative to the initial official target of RE capacity of 175 GW by 2022 (recently revised to 225 GW) of the Indian government, these are likely to be achieved later in time. Further, the contribution of the RE sector to cumulative job creation in 2042 has been assessed at around 4390 thousand, 5055 thousand and 2227 thousand in the case of business-as-usual (BAU), optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, respectively. Thus, besides energy and environmental security, RE could offer significant employment co-benefits to the macroeconomy of India.

49515,Blended Teaching Reform and Practice of Tax Law Based on TPACK Framework,2020-12-18,"Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause infection in susceptible host cells. Virus infections could be lytic, chronic, latent or immortalizing. Viruses causing latent infection are associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The human body is protected from viral infection by physical and chemical barriers. However, when these barriers are breached, the body generates an antiviral immune response mediated by Natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, Dendritic Cells (DCs), type I interferon (IFN), neutralizing antibodies, and T cells. DCs play an important role in generating a cell-mediated adaptive immune response to viruses, with conventional DCs playing a crucial role in the interactions between DCs and viruses. Crosstalk between NK cells and DCs facilitates DC maturation in antiviral innate immunity whereas crosstalk between DCs and T cells in antiviral adaptive immunity amplifies the function of mature DC. Viruses employ various strategies to evade the host immune system. They can block Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) - mediated production of type I IFNs, inhibit maturation and functionality of DCs, and interfere with cell-mediated immunity. Here we will focus on important human disease-causing viruses including latest COVID19 that caused worldwide pandemic. Because of the high mortality rate associated with viral diseases, there is an urgent need to re-evaluate current antiviral agents with more research focusing on developing alternative anti-viral therapies with an enhanced therapeutic index and safety profiles. Future directions in approaching the development of vaccines should focus on specific vaccines that can induce CD8(+)T cell responses and produce IFN-gamma to promote a Th1-biased CD4(+)T-cell response.","Hoffman, Matilde; Chigbu, DeGaulle I.; Crumley, Brenndan L.; Sharma, Ravi; Pustylnikov, Sergey; Crilley, Thomas; Ginwala, Rashida; Loonawat, Ronak; Joseph, Julie; Sales, Dominic; Wilson, Sydney; Jain, Pooja",Advanced Concepts in Human Immunology: Prospects for Disease Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980828/,642

Four main points have to be considered: first, the constitutional response to the economic emergency through the entrenchment of new emergency provisions (or by using already existing provisions) and their legitimacy; second, once the emergency concluded, the concrete possibility to restore, partially or completely, the status ante, in particular with respect to rights protection and, third, if this is not the case, how constitutionalism can react to the economic emergency; forth the theoretical possibility to equate economic crisis to the more traditional emergency situations and, if not, to face a sort of new genus of emergency with all its implications.

50063,Key Global Organizations,2021,"Broadcast consensus protocols (BCPs) are a model of computation, in which anonymous, identical, finite-state agents compute by sending/receiving global broadcasts. BCPs are known to compute all number predicates in [Formula: see text] where n is the number of agents. They can be considered an extension of the well-established model of population protocols. This paper investigates execution time characteristics of BCPs. We show that every predicate computable by population protocols is computable by a BCP with expected [Formula: see text] interactions, which is asymptotically optimal. We further show that every log-space, randomized Turing machine can be simulated by a BCP with [Formula: see text] interactions in expectation, where T is the expected runtime of the Turing machine. This allows us to characterise polynomial-time BCPs as computing exactly the number predicates in [Formula: see text] , i.e. predicates decidable by log-space, randomised Turing machine with zero-error in expected polynomial time where the input is encoded as unary.","Czerner, Philipp; Jaax, Stefan",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984118/,642
50111,Detecting Automatically Managed Accounts in Online Social Networks: Graph Embeddings Approach,2021-02-20,"Deductive verification techniques based on program logics (i.e., the family of Floyd-Hoare logics) are a powerful approach for program reasoning. Recently, there has been a trend of increasing the expressive power of such logics by augmenting their rules with additional information to reason about program side-effects. For example, general program logics have been augmented with cost analyses, logics for probabilistic computations have been augmented with estimate measures, and logics for differential privacy with indistinguishability bounds. In this work, we unify these various approaches via the paradigm of grading, adapted from the world of functional calculi and semantics. We propose Graded Hoare Logic (GHL), a parameterisable framework for augmenting program logics with a preordered monoidal analysis. We develop a semantic framework for modelling GHL such that grading, logical assertions (pre- and post-conditions) and the underlying effectful semantics of an imperative language can be integrated together. Central to our framework is the notion of a graded category which we extend here, introducing graded Freyd categories which provide a semantics that can interpret many examples of augmented program logics from the literature. We leverage coherent fibrations to model the base assertion language, and thus the overall setting is also fibrational.","Gaboardi, Marco; Katsumata, Shin-ya; Orchard, Dominic; Sato, Tetsuya",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984559/,642

Using personal health record (PHR) apps as an example, this study identifies how potential users in Germany and Denmark evaluate a set of 26 app features, and whether evaluation differences can be explained by the differences in four pertinent user characteristics, namely privacy concerns, mHealth literacy, mHealth self-efficacy, and adult playfulness. Based on survey data from both countries, we employed the Kano method to evaluate PHR features and applied a quartile-based sample-split approach to understand the underlying relationships between user characteristics and their perceptions of features. Our results not only reveal significant differences in 14 of the features between Germans and Danes, they also demonstrate which of the user characteristics best explain each of these differences. Our two key contributions are, first, to explain the evaluation of specific PHR app features on user satisfaction in two different healthcare contexts and, second, to demonstrate how to extend the Kano method in terms of explaining subgroup differences through user characteristic antecedents. The implications for app providers and policymakers are discussed.","Gimpel, Henner; Manner-Romberg, Tobias; Schmied, Fabian; Winkler, Till J.",Electron Markets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987738/,642
51589,Teaching Responsible Data Science: Charting New Pedagogical Territory,2021-04-15,"The results of structural studies on a series of halogen-substituted derivatives of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) are reported. 2-DG is an inhibitor of glycolysis, a metabolic pathway crucial for cancer cell proliferation and viral replication in host cells, and interferes with D-glucose and D-mannose metabolism. Thus, 2-DG and its derivatives are considered as potential anticancer and antiviral drugs. X-ray crystallography shows that a halogen atom present at the C2 position in the pyranose ring does not significantly affect its conformation. However, it has a noticeable effect on the crystal structure. Fluorine derivatives exist as a dense 3D framework isostructural with the parent compound, while Cl- and I-derivatives form layered structures. Analysis of the Hirshfeld surface shows formation of hydrogen bonds involving the halogen, yet no indication for the existence of halogen bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) periodic calculations of cohesive and interaction energies (at the B3LYP level of theory) have supported these findings. NMR studies in the solution show that most of the compounds do not display significant differences in their anomeric equilibria, and that pyranose ring puckering is similar to the crystalline state. For 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (2-FG), electrostatic interaction energies between the ligand and protein for several existing structures of pyranose 2-oxidase were also computed. These interactions mostly involve acidic residues of the protein; single amino-acid substitutions have only a minor impact on binding. These studies provide a better understanding of the structural chemistry of halogen-substituted carbohydrates as well as their intermolecular interactions with proteins determining their distinct biological activity.","Ziemniak, Marcin; Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk, Anna; Pawlędzio, Sylwia; Malinska, Maura; Sołtyka, Maja; Trzybiński, Damian; Koźmiński, Wiktor; Skora, Stanisław; Zieliński, Rafał; Fokt, Izabela; Priebe, Waldemar; Woźniak, Krzysztof; Pająk, Beata",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8038202/,642

Inflammation plays an important role in BRB dysfunction. This study aimed to understand the role of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17A in BRB dysfunction and the mechanism involved. Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line ARPE19 and murine brain endothelial line bEnd.3 were cultured on transwell membranes to model the outer BRB and inner BRB, respectively. IL-17A treatment (3 days in bEnd.3 cells and 6 days in ARPE19 cells) disrupted the distribution of claudin-5 in bEnd.3 cells and ZO-1 in ARPE19 cells, reduced the transepithelial/transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased permeability to FITC-tracers in vitro. Intravitreal (20 ng/1 μL/eye) or intravenous (20 ng/g) injection of recombinant IL-17A induced retinal albumin leakage within 48 h in C57BL/6J mice. Mechanistically, IL-17A induced Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) phosphorylation in bEnd.3 but not ARPE19 cells. Blocking JAK1 with Tofacitinib prevented IL-17A-mediated claudin-5 dysmorphia in bEnd.3 cells and reduced albumin leakage in IL-17A-treated mice. Our results suggest that IL-17A can damage the BRB through the activating the JAK1 signaling pathway, and targeting this pathway may be a novel approach to treat inflammation-induced macular oedema.","Byrne, Eimear M.; Llorián-Salvador, María; Tang, Miao; Margariti, Andriana; Chen, Mei; Xu, Heping",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301352/,642

Responding to the argument that COVID-19-driven changes may not be sustainable, this essay offers a counter narrative from the Korean context, in which educators re-visited existing school systems and re-constructed policies and teaching practices to fill the educational vacuum caused by the pandemic. This essay specifically builds on interviews conducted with Korean educators throughout the 2020 school year during COVID-19. First, we discuss ownership of educational change as reflected in educators’ narratives. We then explore three driving forces behind the transformation of the “grammar of Korean schooling”: policy discourse about “future education,” professional teaching culture, and administration for creativity. Based on our analysis, we offer several suggestions for policymakers, district leaders, and educators around the world for how to leverage and sustain the educational changes catalyzed by COVID-19. We conclude by arguing that educators’ desires to achieve change must be actualized in schools and policies through collaborative foresight and system-level support.","Kim, Taeyeon; Yang, Minseok; Lim, Sunbin",J Educ Change,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8487617/,642

64106,A Short Note on Optimizing Cost-Generalizability via a Machine-Learning Approach.,2021-12-01,"UNLABELLED Gap junctions (GJs) form intercellular channels which directly connect the cytoplasm between neighboring cells to facilitate the transfer of ions and small molecules. GJs play a major role in the pathogenesis of infection-associated inflammation. Mutations of gap junction proteins, connexins (Cxs), cause dysmyelination and leukoencephalopathy. In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), Cx43 was shown to be modulated in the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism behind Cx43 alteration and its role in MS remains unexplored. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection-induced demyelination is one of the best-studied experimental animal models for MS. Our studies demonstrated that MHV infection downregulated Cx43 expression at protein and mRNA levels in vitro in primary astrocytes obtained from neonatal mouse brains. After infection, a significant amount of Cx43 was retained in endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex (ER/ERGIC) and GJ plaque formation was impaired at the cell surface, as evidenced by a reduction of the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of Cx43. Altered trafficking and impairment of GJ plaque formation may cause the loss of functional channel formation in MHV-infected primary astrocytes, as demonstrated by a reduced number of dye-coupled cells after a scrape-loading Lucifer yellow dye transfer assay. Upon MHV infection, a significant downregulation of Cx43 was observed in the virus-infected mouse brain. This study demonstrates that astrocytic Cx43 expression and function can be modulated due to virus stress and can be an appropriate model to understand the basis of cellular mechanisms involved in the alteration of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) in CNS neuroinflammation. IMPORTANCE We found that MHV infection leads to the downregulation of Cx43 in vivo in the CNS. In addition, results show that MHV infection impairs Cx43 expression in addition to gap junction communication in primary astrocytes. After infection, Cx43 did not traffic normally to the membrane to form gap junction plaques, and that could be the basis of reduced functional gap junction coupling between astrocytes. This is an important first step toward understanding how viruses affect Cx43 expression and trafficking at the cellular level. This may provide a basis for understanding how structural alterations of astrocytic gap junctions can disrupt gap junction communication between other CNS cells in altered CNS environments due to infection and inflammation. More specifically, alteration of Cx43 may be the basis of the destabilization of Cx47 in oligodendrocytes seen in and around inflammatory demyelinating plaques in MS patients.","Basu, Rahul; Banerjee, Kaveri; Bose, Abhishek; Das Sarma, Jayasri",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02420-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26676788/,642

METHODS A retrospective review of all open ventral hernia repairs at a single institution from 2000 to 2010 was performed to assess readmissions between 1 to 30, 1 to 90, and 91 to 365 days. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of 30-day readmission. RESULTS Of the 888 patients, 75 (8%) were readmitted between 1 and 30 days, 97 (11%) between 1 and 90 days, and 78 (9%) between 91 and 365 days. Unplanned readmissions related to the surgery constituted the majority of 1-day to 30-day and 1-day to 90-day readmissions (82% and 74%, respectively) but not between 91 and 365 days (32%).

As outlined by the International Pharmaceutical Federation, community pharmacists have an important public health role during this Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency. We therefore investigated the current practices, response preparedness and professional development needs of community pharmacists in Qatar. METHODOLOGY A descriptive cross-sectional online 38-item questionnaire-based survey constructed on evidence-based public health roles of pharmacists was conducted between 28 May and 18 June 2020. Questions related to current practices required responses on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from ""always"" to ""never"". The questionnaire was evaluated for validity and the reliability analysis showed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.921. RESULTS The response (n = 311) rate for the survey was 34.2%. More than 75% of pharmacists ""always"" encouraged and practiced hygiene and social distancing measures. On the other hand, the proportion of pharmacists ""always"" involved in patient assessment, education or providing information related to COVID-19 and application of evidence-based protocol ranged from 32 to 73%. The vast majority (87-96%) of pharmacists indicated that they needed professional development related to COVID-19. Overall, 77% of pharmacists either ""strongly agreed"" or ""agreed"" that they have all the necessary COVID-19 related emergency response preparedness and training. Country from which pharmacists obtained their first degree, and the type of pharmacy where they practice influenced their overall perception toward emergency response preparedness.

METHODS From 2009 to 2015, 100 elective hemiarch reconstructions for proximal aortic aneurysms were performed under moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA). Cerebral perfusion was instituted with ACP via direct cannulation of the innominate artery. RESULTS Mean patient age was 63 ± 13 years (72 men; 72%). Mean MHCA temperature was 27.3°C ± 1.0°C (median, 28°C). Mean ACP time was 17 ± 4 minutes and mean crossclamp time was 134 ± 42 minutes. Proximal reconstruction included root replacement with composite valved graft (n = 47), valve sparing root reimplantation (n = 16), and aortic valve replacement (n = 19). In-hospital 30-day mortality (n = 1; 1%), stroke (1; 1%), reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (n = 1; 1%), coma (n = 0), and renal failure (n = 1; 1%) rates were low. There was no incidence of injury or dissection of the innominate artery. CONCLUSIONS Direct, central innominate artery cannulation for ACP yields excellent outcomes. This technique is safe, provides excellent cerebral protection during circulatory arrest and simplifies the circulatory management strategy for elective ascending aortic and hemiarch reconstruction.","Jassar, Arminder S; Vallabhajosyula, Prashanth; Bavaria, Joseph E; Gutsche, Jacob; Desai, Nimesh D; Williams, Matthew L; Milewski, Rita K; Hargrove, W Clark; Szeto, Wilson Y",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.11.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26725716/,642

Without appropriate incentives and coordination, however, firms may not respond at sufficient speed or scale, and competition among countries for limited supply may drive up prices and undercut efficient allocation. Programs relying on ""push"" incentives (direct cost reimbursement) can be complicated by the funder's inability to observe firms' private cost information. To address these challenges, we propose a ""pull"" program that incentivizes late-stage development (phase-3 trials and manufacturing) for COVID-19 vaccines by awarding advance purchase commitments to bidding firms. Using novel cost and demand data, we calculate the optimal size and number of awards. In baseline simulations, the optimal program induces the participation of virtually all ten viable vaccine candidates, spending an average of $110 billion to generate net benefits of $2.8 trillion, nearly double that generated by the free market.

This study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of enteral refeeding (ER) in premature and full-term neonates. METHODS A retrospective database of all consecutive neonates who had enterostomy during 2000-2014 in a regional center was analyzed. Thirteen patients with ER (ER group) and 14 patients without ER (control group) were included. Detailed clinical data were evaluated with reference to the increment in body weight during ER. RESULTS The ER group had a significantly higher rate in weight gain compared with the control group (P=0.0012), despite the gestational age (<37weeks: P=0.0012, ≥37weeks: P=0.029). ER starting at a lower body weight was also associated with a higher weight gain (P=0.0002). Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that only the ER procedure (P<0.0001) and birth weight (P=0.049) were significantly independent predictors of good weight gain. CONCLUSIONS Using ER, low-birth-weight infants may have benefits, such as better acceleration of growth, than normal-birth-weight infants. We do not hesitate to perform ER, even in low-birth-weight neonates or those with low body weight, when starting ER.","Koike, Yuhki; Uchida, Keiichi; Nagano, Yuka; Matsushita, Kohei; Otake, Kohei; Inoue, Mikihiro; Kusunoki, Masato",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2015.08.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26435521/,642

114335,A Conflict of Values: Nurses' Willingness to Work Under Threatening Conditions.,2019,"Background The third fatal coronavirus is the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) which first broke out in December 2019. Patients will develop rapidly if there is no any intervention, so the risk identification of severe patients is critical. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and rules of hematology changes in patients with COVID-19, and to explore the possibility differentiating moderate and severe patients using conventional hematology parameters or combined parameters. Methods The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms, and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between moderate and severe cases were analyzed, and the combination parameters with the best diagnostic performance were selected using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method. Results Of the 45 patients with the novel 2019 corona virus (COVID-19) (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 were female, with ages ranging from 16 to 62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and red cell volume distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD) parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, lymphocyte count (Lym#), eosinophil count (Eos#), high fluorescent cell percentage (HFC%), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), and hematocrit (HCT) parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than those in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR parameter, it's area under the curve (AUC), cutoff, sensitivity and specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively; meanwhile, for PLR parameter, it's AUC, cutoff, sensitivity and specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameters of NLR and RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC =0.938), and when the cutoff value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the combined parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC =0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively. Conclusions The combined NLR and RDW-SD parameter is the best hematology index. It may help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients and can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic.","Wang, Changzheng; Deng, Rongrong; Gou, Liyao; Fu, Zhongxiao; Zhang, Xiaomei; Shao, Feng; Wang, Guanzhen; Fu, Weiyang; Xiao, Jianping; Ding, Xiao; Li, Tao; Xiao, Xiulin; Li, Chengbin",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566620/,642
115911,ASO Author Reflections: Uptake of Surgical Innovations: More Evidence and Less Opinion and Enthusiasm.,2020-10-20,"PURPOSE The performance of most indices used to predict ventilator weaning outcomes remains below expectation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new weaning index, the timed inspiratory effort (TIE) index, which is based on the maximal inspiratory pressure and the occlusion time required to reach it. METHODS This observational prospective study included patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Patients ready to be weaned had their TIE index and 6 previously reported indices recorded. The primary end point was the overall predictive performance of the studied weaning indices (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUCs]). The secondary end points were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. P values <.05 were considered significant. RESULTS From the 128 initially screened patients, the 103 patients selected for the study included 45 women and 58 men (mean age 60.8 ± 19.8 years). In all, 60 patients were weaned, 43 were not weaned, and 32 died during the study period. Tracheotomy was necessary in 61 patients. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 ± 17.3 days. The AUC of 3 weaning predictors (the TIE index, the integrative weaning index, and the frequency-to-tidal volume [f/Vt] ratio index) was higher than the other indices. The TIE index had the largest AUC. CONCLUSION The TIE index performed better than the best weaning indices used in clinical practice.","de Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro; Guimarães, Fernando Silva; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066613483265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23753238/,642
115962,Infection forecasts powered by big data.,2018,"Emerging antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has necessitated the development of alternative approaches to combat drug-resistance-associated infection. The abolition of Staphylococcus aureus virulence by targeting multiple-virulence gene products represents a promising strategy for exploration. A multiplex promoter reporter platform using gfp-luxABCDE dual-reporter plasmids with selected promoters from S. aureus-virulence-associated genes was used to identify compounds that modulate the expression of virulence factors. One small-molecule compound, M21, was identified from a chemical library to reverse virulent S. aureus into its nonvirulent state. M21 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of ClpP and alters α-toxin expression in a ClpP-dependent manner. A mouse model of infection indicated that M21 could attenuate S. aureus virulence. This nonantibiotic compound has been shown to suppress the expression of multiple unrelated virulence factors in S. aureus, suggesting that targeting a master regulator of virulence is an effective way to control virulence. Our results illustrate the power of chemical genetics in the modulation of virulence gene expression in pathogenic bacteria.","Gao, Peng; Ho, Pak Leung; Yan, Bingpeng; Sze, Kong Hung; Davies, Julian; Kao, Richard Yi Tsun",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1720520115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012613/,642

In the study of myriad human conditions, each model requires in-depth characterization of its assets and limitations in order for it to be used to greatest advantage. Veterinary pathology expertise is critical in understanding the relevance and translational validity of animal models to conditions under study, assessing morbidity and mortality, and validating outcomes as relevant or not to the study interventions. Clear communication with investigators and education of research personnel on the use and interpretation of pathology endpoints in animal models are critical to the success of any research program. The veterinary pathologist is underutilized in biomedical research due to many factors including misconceptions about high fiscal costs, lack of perceived value, limited recognition of their expertise, and the generally low number of veterinary pathologists currently employed in biomedical research. As members of the multidisciplinary research team, veterinary pathologists have an important role to educate scientists, ensure accurate interpretation of pathology data, maximize rigor, and ensure reproducibility to provide the most reliable data for animal models in biomedical research.","Hoenerhoff, Mark James; Meyerholz, David K; Brayton, Cory; Beck, Amanda P",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985820974005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327888/,642
120270,Women in Malaria 2021: A Conference Premier.,2021-04-29,"Introduction: Thoracic surgery in children with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pulmonary disease is rare, as very limited virus-related lung lesions require intervention. However, some patients may suffer from other pulmonary abnormalities that can be worsened by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and they may consequently require lung surgery. COVID-19 affects the indications, surgical procedure, and postsurgical care of these patients. Background: We present a case of a 14-year-old girl with COVID-19 pulmonary disease and persistent air leak due to right apical bullae that required resection. Clinical, surgical, and safety implications are discussed. The role of thoracic minimally invasive surgery under COVID-19 conditions is also analyzed. Materials and Methods: The thoracoscopic procedure was scheduled earlier than normally expected. The surgery was performed in a COVID-19 reserved theatre with neutral pressure and only the necessary personnel was allowed inside. The use of the required personal protective equipment was supervised by an expert nurse before and after the intervention. Results: The surgeons used a three-port technique to resect the bullae with an endostapler and no mechanical pleural abrasion was added to the procedure. Electrocautery and CO2 insufflation were avoided, and a chest drain with a closed-circuit aspiration system was installed before removing the ports. The child was discharged home 3 days later after the removal of the chest drain. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an impact on the standard indications, surgical strategies and postoperative care of some conditions requiring intervention. Extra safety measures are needed in the operating room to limit the chance of transmission. Minimally invasive surgery for thoracic surgery remains safe if the current safety guidelines are followed closely.","Giné, Carlos; Laín, Ana; García, Laura; López, Manuel",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

120390,How Can Big Data Science Transform the Psychological Sciences?,2020-11-05,"PURPOSE To report a novel indication for the use of chimney grafts to preserve flow to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for aortobi-iliac aneurysms with coexistent bilateral occlusion of the internal iliac arteries (IIA). TECHNIQUE Via a cutdown over the left axillary artery, a 5-F vertebral catheter was delivered over a conventional 0.035-inch hydrophilic guidewire to selectively catheterize the IMA via a 7-F shuttle sheath, which was then advanced at least 2 cm into the target vessel. The first chimney graft was advanced into the sheath, and a standard EVAR procedure followed. The chimney graft was deployed at least 2 cm in the IMA; a second chimney graft was advanced and deployed with at least 2 cm overlapping with the first chimney stent parallel and outside of the main abdominal endograft and below the lowest renal artery. The chimney grafts were lined with additional bare nitinol stents. The technique is demonstrated in two male patients who suffered from symptomatic aortobi-iliac aneurysm with patent IMAs and bilateral IIA occlusion. The procedure was completed successfully in both cases without bowel ischemia. At 12 and 6 months, respectively, the chimney grafts remained patent without endoleak. The patients are asymptomatic. CONCLUSION The IMA chimney endovascular technique can be considered in EVAR cases with coexistent bilateral IIA occlusion to minimize the risk for bowel ischemia.","Donas, Konstantinos P; Torsello, Giovanni; Bisdas, Theodosios; Austermann, Martin; Stavroulakis, Konstantinos; Pitoulias, Georgios A",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/14-4745r.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101584/,642

125426,Lessons on Surviving a Pandemic From 35 Years of AIDS Cinema.,2021-05-01,"Background and Aims The GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] study is a continuing phase 3 trial investigating the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin antagonist for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease. We provide an interim analysis of efficacy in patients with UC. Methods Patients from the C13004 and GEMINI 1 studies and a cohort of vedolizumab-naïve patients received open-label vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Interim data were collected from May 22, 2009 to June 27, 2013. Clinical response and remission, evaluated using partial Mayo scores, and health-related quality of life [HRQL] were assessed for up to 152 weeks of cumulative treatment in the efficacy population. Results As of June 27, 2013, 63% of the efficacy population [n = 532/845] were continuing treatment. Among patients who responded to vedolizumab induction and had data available, 88% [n = 120/136] were in remission after 104 weeks of exposure (96% [n = 70/73] after 152 weeks). Among patients who withdrew from every-8-week vedolizumab maintenance in GEMINI 1 [n = 32] before week 52, increased dosing to every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS resulted in response and remission rates of 41% and 28%, respectively, after 52 weeks, an increase from 19% and 6%, respectively, from before the dose increase. Similar benefits were demonstrated regardless of prior tumour necrosis factor-antagonist exposure. Durable benefits on HRQL were also observed. Conclusions Patients with UC experienced clinical and HRQL improvements with continued vedolizumab treatment. Increased dosing frequency to every 4 weeks was beneficial in patients who had loss of response to 8-weekly dosing.","Loftus, Edward V; Colombel, Jean-Frédéric; Feagan, Brian G; Vermeire, Severine; Sandborn, William J; Sands, Bruce E; Danese, Silvio; D'Haens, Geert R; Kaser, Arthur; Panaccione, Remo; Rubin, David T; Shafran, Ira; McAuliffe, Megan; Kaviya, Arpeat; Sankoh, Serap; Mody, Reema; Abhyankar, Brihad; Smyth, Michael",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27683800/,642

MATERIALS AND METHODS The causes of mortality in the Veneto region (Italy) during the first epidemic wave, March-April 2020, were compared with the corresponding months of the previous two years. Both the underlying cause of death (UCOD), and all diseases reported in the death certificate (multiple causes of death) were investigated; a further analysis was carried out through a simulation where the UCOD was selected after substituting ICD-10 codes for COVID with unspecified pneumonia. RESULTS Overall 10,222 deaths were registered in March-April 2020, corresponding to a 24% increase compared to the previous two years. COVID-19 was mentioned in 1,444 certificates, and selected as the UCOD in 1,207 deaths. Based on the UCOD, the increases in mortality were observed for COVID and related respiratory conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ill-defined causes. Multiple causes of death and the simulation analysis demonstrated further increases in mortality related to dementia/Alzheimer and chronic lower respiratory diseases.

AIMS The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these treatments, alone or combined, on the neuropsychological profiles of patients with AD. METHODS Forty participants were assigned to three groups receiving either only AChEI (n = 14), AChEI + CS (n = 15), or only CS (n = 11). Cognition was evaluated at baseline and after three months. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate differences among the treatments in terms of changes in the patients' neuropsychological profiles. RESULTS Results, although preliminary because of the small sample size, suggest that a general improvement was found in patients who received AChEI + CS and those who received only CS compared with those who received only AChEI. Interestingly, individuals who received only CS showed a significant improvement in immediate memory recall than those who received only AChEI. Furthermore, the group receiving AChEI + CS showed an improvement in delayed recall than the other two groups. DISCUSSION The combination of AChEI and CS seems to have the greatest benefit for patients with mild AD. More interestingly, CS alone is more effective than AChEI alone, even in improving memory, considered to be the ""lost"" cognitive domain in AD.","Devita, Maria; Masina, Fabio; Mapelli, Daniela; Anselmi, Pasquale; Sergi, Giuseppe; Coin, Alessandra",Aging clinical and experimental research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01837-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763839/,642

METHODS RFA epiphysiodesis was done during 8 min in vivo in 40 growing pig tibia physis. In addition, three tibiae were ablated for 16 min and three more for 24 min. As a burned cartilage reference, six tibiae were ablated on the joint articular cartilage for 8 min. After the procedure, the animals were terminated and the tibiae were harvested. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done ex vivo to evaluate the joint articular cartilage in all samples. We used T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and water content sequences under a 1.5 T magnetic field. RESULTS On the burned articular cartilage, intensity changes were observed at MRI. We found no evidence of articular cartilage damage on the 40 8-min RFA procedures. The tibiae ablated for 16 min and 24 min showed intact joint cartilage. CONCLUSIONS Epiphysiodesis using RFA is safe for the adjacent articular cartilage. This study shows that RFA can be done safely in the growing physis of pigs, even with triple duration procedures.","Shiguetomi-Medina, Juan Manuel; Rahbek, O; Abood, A A H; Stødkilde-Jørgensen, H; Ramírez Garcia-Luna, J L; Møller-Madsen, B",Journal of children's orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11832-016-0747-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27278056/,642

Our aim was to investigate the comparative effectiveness and safety of the low-dose versus standard-dose intravenous alteplase strategy. METHODS A total of 1526 acute ischemic stroke patients who qualified for intravenous alteplase and treated within 4.5 hours were identified from a prospective, multicenter, and nationwide stroke registry database. Primary outcomes were a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 at 3 months after stroke and occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Inverse probability of low-dose alteplase weighting by propensity scores was used to remove baseline imbalances between the 2 groups, and variation among centers were also accounted using generalized linear mixed models with a random intercept. RESULTS Low-dose intravenous alteplase was given to 450 patients (29.5%) and standard-dose intravenous alteplase to 1076 patients (70.5%). Low-dose alteplase treatment was comparable to standard-dose therapy according to the following adjusted outcomes and odds ratios (95% confidence intervals): modified Rankin scale score 0 to 1 at 3 months and 0.95 (0.68-1.32); modified Rankin scale 0 to 2 at 3 months and 0.84 (0.62-1.15); symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation and 1.05 (0.65-1.70); and 3-month mortality and 0.54 (0.35-0.83). The associations were unchanged when the analysis was limited to those without endovascular recanalization.

153492,Imaging in StrokeNet: Realizing the Potential of Big Data.,2015,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Lung transplantation is an established therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory insufficiency. Graft dysfunction or rejection depends on the orchestrated prevention of infection(s) and the level of immune suppression. More recent reports underlined the role and pathogenicity of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in lung transplant recipients and the double-edged sword of maintaining antiviral immune responses versus guided immune suppression to avoid graft rejection. We present data concerning the nature of the cellular response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV, the subsequent use of cellular therapy in antiviral treatment modalities and discuss the role of H1N1 infection and other viral infections in lung transplantation recipients. RECENT FINDINGS Patients after lung transplantation showed a similar susceptibility to H1N1 infections as compared to the local, healthy community. After initial recovery and oseltamivir treatment, lung transplantation patients developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The genetic background of lung transplant recipients, defined by polymorphism in immune molecules, contributes to increased risk of CMV disease; CMV induces local pro-inflammatory chemokines (CXCL10). Anti-CMV prophylaxis does not impact on anti-CMV-directed cellular immune responses, defined by IFNγ and TNFα production. Asymptomatic EBV carriers showed higher numbers of EBV-reactive T cells. High EBV load carriers showed T cells with immune-exhaustion markers and decreased IFNγ production. Anti-CMV-directed cellular therapy may aid to better manage CMV-associated complications after lung transplantation. SUMMARY Pharmacological immune suppression, the genetic makeup of the patient as well as concurrent viral infections impact on the successful outcome of lung transplantation and call for more detailed immune-guided diagnostics and therapy.","Uhlin, Michael; Mattsson, Jonas; Maeurer, Markus",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0b013e3283521066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22388587/,642
157792,Clinical waste management under COVID-19 scenario in Malaysia.,2020-09-24,"Obesity has dramatically increased over the last 30 years and reaches according to World Health Organization dimensions of a global epidemic. The obesity-associated chronic low-level inflammation contributes to severe comorbidities and directly affects many immune cells leading to immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections. Thus, prophylaxis against vaccine-preventable diseases is crucial, yet the responsiveness to several vaccines is unclear under obesity. In order to assess the responsiveness to tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine, we revaccinated 37 obese individuals and 36 normal-weight controls with a licensed TBE vaccine. Metabolic, hormonal, and immunologic profiles along with vaccine-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months after TBE booster. Obese adults had significantly increased metabolic (triglycerides, cholesterol ratios, leptin, insulin) and proinflammatory (C-reactive protein) parameters. They showed stronger initial increase of TBE-specific Ab titers (d7_d28) followed by a significantly faster decline after 6 months, which correlated with high body mass index and leptin and insulin levels. The fold increase of Ab-titer levels was significantly higher in obese compared to control males and linked to reduced testosterone levels. Obesity also affected cellular responses: PBMCs of the obese vaccinees had elevated interleukin 2 and interferon γ levels upon antigen stimulation, indicating a leptin-dependent proinflammatory TH1 polarization. The expansion of total and naive B cells in obese might explain the initial increase of Ab titers, whereas the reduced B-memory cell and plasma blast generation could be related to fast Ab decline with a limited maintenance of titers. Among T follicular helper cell (Tfh) cells, the Tfh17 subset was significantly expanded particularly in obese males, where we observed a strong initial Ab increase. Systemic but not local vaccine side effects were more frequent in obese subjects as a possible consequence of their low-grade proinflammatory state. In summary, TBE booster vaccination was effective in obese individuals, yet the faster Ab decline could result in a reduced long-term protection. The sex-based differences in vaccine responses indicate a complex interplay of the endocrine, metabolic, and immune system during obesity. Further studies on the long-term protection after vaccination are ongoing, and also evaluation of primary vaccination against TBE in obese individuals is planned.

162440,AIoT: AI meets IoT and Web in Smart Healthcare,2021,"Purpose Little is known about the economic burden that malnutrition or its risk imposes on community-dwelling older adults. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we assessed the impact of malnutrition risk on healthcare utilization and costs in a cohort of older adults living in Spanish community. Patients and Methods Data from 1660 older (range 66-98 years), community-living adults participating in the Toledo Study on Healthy Ageing, waves 2 (year 2011-2013) and 3 (year 2015), were analyzed. Nutritional status categories were defined according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, using a two-step approach. First, screening for malnutrition risk. Once positive, individuals were classified as malnourished according to some phenotypic (body mass index, grip strength, and unintentional weight loss) and etiologic (disease burden/inflammation and reduced food intake or assimilation) criteria. Outcomes assessed included healthcare resources (hospital admissions, number of hospitalizations, length of hospital stay per hospitalization, and number of medications). Results Fifteen percent of the population was found to be at risk of malnutrition, while 12.6% was malnourished. Overall, patients from both groups were older, had lower functional status, and had more comorbidities compared to well-nourished counterparts (p<0.05). Results of our cross-sectional analysis showed that being at-risk/malnourished was associated with greater medication utilization, higher rates of hospital admission and longer stays, and higher hospitalization costs. However, when adjusting for covariates, malnutrition/risk was associated only with higher hospitalization costs (range: 11-13%). Longitudinal analysis results indicated that malnutrition/risk was significantly associated with more frequent hospitalizations, longer lengths of stay, higher hospitalization costs, and polypharmacy at follow-up. Conclusion Malnutrition or its risk, found in over one of four older adults in the Toledo community, was associated with higher healthcare resource use and increased costs. Such findings suggest that malnutrition risk-screening for older adults, and provision of nutrition counseling and care when needed, hold potential to improve their health and to lower costs of care in the Spanish healthcare system.","Rodríguez-Sánchez, Beatriz; Sulo, Suela; Carnicero, José Antonio; Rueda, Ricardo; Rodríguez-Mañas, Leocadio",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s256671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765021/,642

The rate of human to human transmission of COVID-19 is far higher than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). With no drugs or vaccines approved for the treatment of the disease, physicians have been using the pre-existing drugs to curb the disease. One potential anti-viral agent currently undergoing numerous clinical trial is remdesivir, a nucleotide analog that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE In this mini-review, we provide an overview of remdesivir's journey, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, used in patients with COVID-19 under compassionate use principle and clinical trials to understand the effect of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION In this mini-review, we provide an overview of remdesivir's journey, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, used in patients with COVID-19 under compassionate use principle and clinical trials to understand the effect of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Moirangthem, Dinesh Singh; Surbala, Laishram",Current drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389450121999201202110303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267759/,642
162891,Toward Efficient Academia-Industry Collaboration: A Case Study of Joint VR System Development,2021,"Background. DDX3X variants are a common cause of intellectual disability (ID) in females. Previous studies have reported high rates of autism spectrum disorder and emotional-behavioural difficulties within this group. However, no study has compared social and emotional characteristics in individuals with DDX3X variants to individuals with other monogenic causes of ID. Methods. Twenty-three females with pathogenic or likely pathogenic DDX3X variants were recruited via UK regional genetics centres, genetic research cohorts, and family support groups. Twenty-three females with ID and variants in other genes were recruited via the same routes. Phenotypic data were collected through semi-structured interviews and standardised questionnaires. Results. In line with previous research, we found a wide range of adaptive, social and emotional function within the DDX3X group. Autism characteristics assessed via the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) did not differ between DDX3X and comparison groups, while levels of anxiety and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) scores assessed via the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) were significantly higher in the DDX3X group. Autistic characteristics, anxiety and SIB scores were positively correlated within the DDX3X group. Individuals with DDX3X missense variants had poorer adaptive abilities than those with protein truncating variants as previously reported, but DDX3X variant type did not significantly predict emotional and behavioural characteristics. Conclusions. We provide quantitative evidence that overall incidence of autistic characteristics is not higher amongst girls and women with DDX3X variants than expected for ID. However, the DDX3X group demonstrates more SIBs and anxiety symptoms than expected, with close relationships between SIBs and anxiety, and between anxiety and autistic characteristics. Future work is warranted to explore the multilevel mechanisms contributing to social and emotional development in individuals with DDX3X variants, and consider whether these mechanisms are specific to this genetic diagnosis or shared with a subset of people with ID due to other causes.","Ng-Cordell, E.; Kolesnik-Taylor, A.; O'Brien, S.; Astle, D.; Scerif, G.; Baker, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.23.21264040v1?rss=1,642

In this research a very simple novel and robust deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model with less number of trainable-parameters is proposed to assist the radiologists and physicians in the early detection of COVID-19 patients. It also helps to classify patients into COVID-19, pneumonia and normal on the bases of analysis of augmented X-ray images. This augmented dataset contains 4803 COVID-19 from 686 publicly available chest X-ray images along with 5000 normal and 5000 pneumonia samples. These images are divided into 80% training and 20 % validation. The proposed CNN model is trained on training dataset and then tested on validation dataset. This model has a promising performance with a mean accuracy of 92.29%, precision of 99.96%, Specificity of 99.85% along with Sensitivity value of 85.92%.

In 2018, the St. Helena Healthy Communities Coalition held a forum to develop strategies to improve community health. Participants identified that a local farmer's market accepting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits was no longer operational and reopening the market with SNAP would increase food access and improve community health. SNAP recipients in a rural, majority Black parish in Louisiana. The St. Helena Farmer's Market YSWM program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2020), offering a $3 match for fresh fruit and vegetables for every $1 in SNAP benefits spent at the market. Observational data (customer counts, zip codes, and vendor sales) were collected at the market before and after the implementation of the YSWM program. Prior to implementation, the market averaged 33 customers per day. Five months following implementation, the market averaged 76 customers per day (+131.42%), and a total of $6,6213 SNAP and ""match"" dollars were reinvested into the local food system. Market reach also expanded. Prior to YSWM implementation, a majority of customers (95%) resided in the same town as the market. Following implementation, 66% of market customers resided in the market town (with 5% coming from over 30 miles away). More than half of SNAP customers reported being first time customers, with 92% reported visiting the market specifically for SNAP. Since implementation, the YSWM program has remained successful while confronting unique challenges. YSWM Program implementation generated an increase in market customers, a wider geographical reach, and increased access to fresh produce for surrounding communities during a public health crisis.

163344,Covid-19 SEIQR spread mathematical model,2021,"Background Since the pandemic began, people are becoming more individualistic through social distancing. This situation has led to a rapid increase in social atomization and it is necessary to reconsider the mission of multicultural public spaces. This article aims to provide suggestions on the design direction of multicultural public spaces in the increasingly atomized future world through a literature review and case studies. Methods This article reviews the literature on social atomization. The atomization of society is caused by the lack of social connections. With the development of society, the atomization of society has become a new challenge. Multicultural public spaces design in the post-epidemic era is still a relatively new research field. Therefore, this article combines representative examples of multicultural spaces, comprehensively considers the trend of modern society, and provides new ideas for the development of multicultural spaces under the background of social atomization. Results In this way, the designer must ensure that the task of the space takes into account the different needs of people, while providing the possibility to enjoy the space alone or by multiple people, so as to rebuild the connection between the individual and the society, and even build a vibrant intermediary community. Conclusions The concept of social atomization provides a new perspective with which to understand public spaces in a multicultural environment. We can obtain basic suggestions on how to improve multicultural public spaces through combining the results of a literature review and case studies. © 2021.

Coughing, sneezing, close contact with infected individuals speeds up the disease spread. Saudi Arabia's government and the Ministry of Health sought to spread social awareness of the importance of quarantine and restriction, but unprecedented challenges and obstacles emerged. Therefore, in this study, the effect of COVID-19 on the dispensing of medication and the use of health care services evaluated. Study design: This survey, cross-sectional, was performed in Makkah city individuals. Place and Duration of Study: This survey was run out in Makkah city, Saudi Arabia for seven days, starting from June 15, 2020, to June 22, 2020. Methodology: Survey of 112 applicants (33 men, 79 women;age range 16-56+ years) had been performed to explore COVID-19 impact on medication dispensing and the use of health care services regarding sociodemographic data in Makkah city residents, Saudi Arabia. Results: This study demonstrated that most of the survey respondents coped well with COVID-19 changes. A significant correlation was found between coping with COVID-19 changes and the age of participants (F((df)) = 7.846 ((4,107)), P-value 0.006) and (F((df)) = 4.025 ((4,107)), P-value 0.047), respectively. Of all the participants, 68.75% had been able to dispense a prescription medication during COVID-19 restrictions. Among them, 30.36, 21.43, and 16.96% dispensed a prescription once, twice, and more than three times, respectively. The data showed that 67.86% of the participants successfully purchased medication from a community pharmacy during COVID-19 restrictions. There was no change in medication availability or price, at about 61.61% and 76.79%, respectively. A significant correlation between medication availability- price (F((df)) = 4.025((3,105)), Pvalue 0.047) was found. During COVID-19 restrictions, 51.79% of the respondents were able to access health care services such as hospitals that provide health checking, or substance use for disease treatment. Interestingly, 25% of the participants had the same accessibility to health care services. Conclusion: This research revealed that through the COVID-19 pandemic, the dispensing, availability, and price changes of medication and the use of health care services were running in a good manner. This would show that although there were restrictions due to COVID-19, access to medication or health care services was running smoothly.","Tulbah, A.

This study investigates the (i)the association between mid-life sleep quality and later-life type 2 diabetes risk and (ii)a potential modifying effect of ethnicity. Research Design and Methods: The Southall and Brent REvisited (SABRE) cohort comprised Europeans, South Asians, and African Caribbeans (median follow-up = 19 years). Complete case analysis was performed on 2190 participants without diabetes at baseline (age= 51.7 {+/-} 7SD). Competing risks regressions were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of developing type 2 diabetes associated with four self-reported baseline sleep exposures (difficulty falling asleep, early morning waking, waking up tired and snoring) while adjusting for confounders. Modifying effects of ethnicity were analysed by (i) testing for interactions and (ii) performing ethnicity-stratified analysis. Results: Snoring was strongly associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk but only among South Asians in a fully-adjusted model (HR 1.42, 95%CI=1.08-1.85, P=0.011). Our results revealed no elevated risk for any of the sleep exposures across all three ethnic groups.

This is particularly true in public and working environments, where the turnover of occupants is high. The hospitality sector, in particular, has been severely affected by limitations related to emergency containment, and it needs to redefine its operations in the perspective of a ""new normal"" in the post-COVID-19 era. Considering the necessity to provide consistent information about indoor air quality, promote adequate management and increase safety, we developed a case study in cooperation with a major hotel in Turin. A sensing network has been implemented based on corporate-grade monitoring devices, compliant with the RESET standards, recently proposed and applied here to the hospitality sector for the first time. The network is able to detect the concentration of gaseous contaminants and fine particulate matter in semi-continuous mode. The study involved areas of the hotel with different purposes, such as guestrooms, hall, kitchen, restaurant and fitness center. Several valuable insights emerged in support of air quality management and pathways for future research can be outlined, based on the innovative dataset developed.

164719,An Application of Deep-Learning Techniques to Face Mask Detection During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Nursing homes residents often fail to mount robust responses to vaccinations and recent reports of breakthrough infections, particularly from variants of concern, raise questions about whether vaccination regimens elicit a sufficient humoral immune response or if booster doses are warranted. We examined SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and neutralizing capacity in nursing home residents 3-5 months after 2 doses of mRNA-1273 or BNT163b2 vaccination as per recommended schedules. Nursing home residents were recruited from eight long-term care homes in Ontario, Canada, between March and July 2021. Antibody levels and neutralization capacity from a previously published convalescent cohort were used as a comparator.Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgA/G/M against spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were measured by validated ELISA, with assay cut-off at the mean and 3 standard deviations of a pre-COVID-19 population from the same geographic region. Antibody neutralization was measured against the wild-type strain of SARS-CoV-2 and the beta variant of concern (B.1.351). No neutralizing antibodies were detected in ~20% of residents to the wild-type virus (30/155; 19%) or beta variant (27/134; 20%). Residents that received BNT163b2 had a ~4-fold reduction in neutralization to the wild-type strain, and a ~2-fold reduction in neutralization to the beta variant relative to those who received mRNA-1273. Current mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine regimens may not have equivalent efficacy in nursing home residents. Our findings imply that differences in the humoral immune response may contribute to breakthrough infections, and suggest that consideration of the type of vaccine administered to older adults will have a positive impact on the generation of protective immunity.","Breznik, J.

To gain insight into the spatio-temporal organization of the genome, we employ high-density photo-activated localization microscopy and deep learning to obtain temporally resolved super-resolution images of chromatin in living cells. In combination with high-resolution dense motion reconstruction, we confirm the existence of elongated ~ 45 to 90 nm wide chromatin ‘blobs’. A computational chromatin model suggests that these blobs are dynamically associating chromatin fragments in close physical and genomic proximity and adopt TAD-like interactions in the time-average limit. Experimentally, we found that chromatin exhibits a spatio-temporal correlation over ~ 4 μm in space and tens of seconds in time, while chromatin dynamics are correlated over ~ 6 μm and last 40 s. Notably, chromatin structure and dynamics are closely related, which may constitute a mechanism to grant access to regions with high local chromatin concentration.","Barth, R.; Bystricky, K.; Shaban, H.

All patients received AZT and HCQ, however, FVR was added to the combination in 32 patients with severe pneumonia at the beginning. ECG characteristics of all patients before treatment and on the fifth day of treatment were compared. Results: There was no significant difference between the HCQ+AZT group (n=52) and HCQ+AZT+FVR groups (n=32) in terms of baseline clinical characteristics. QTc interval significantly prolonged on the fifth day of treatment in the HCQ+AZT group (413,75±30,13;440,27±36,11 p<0.001) and in the HCQ+AZT+FVR group (426,65±32,83;468,22±42,13 p<0.001). When both groups were compared in terms of ΔQTc, a significant increase was observed in the HCQ+AZT+FVR group compared to the HCQ+AZT group (40(-14/175), 23(-28/213) respectively, p=0.042). In seven of the patients, QTc> 500 ms was detected after the treatment, four patients in the HCQ+AZT+FVR group and three patients in the HCQ+AZT group. Conclusion: We observed that FVR caused more prolongation in the QTc interval when used with the combination of HCQ+AZT. We recommend that patients who receive this treatment be monitored more closely for QTc.","Çerik, I.

Seroconversion rates in unexposed subjects after the first and second doses were 40% and 100%, respectively, showing a significant increase in antibody concentrations from dose 1 to dose 2 (p<0.0001). The highest antibody concentrations were found in younger subjects and women, remaining significantly associated in a multivariable linear regression model (p=0.005). A single dose of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine induced a strong antibody response in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2infection, while a second dose did not increase this response. A sharp increase in antibody concentrations was observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection in those participants who became infected after the first and second doses (p=0.008). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 exposure prior to vaccination showed significantly higher anti-spike IgG antibody levels, at all-time points, than those not exposed (p<0.001). Higher antibody titers were induced by a single dose in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals than those induced in naive subjects by two doses of the vaccine (p<0.0001). Three months after the second dose both groups showed a decline in antibody levels, being more abrupt in unexposed subjects. Overall, our results showed a trend towards lower antibody concentrations over time following BBIBP-CorV vaccination. Sex and age seem to influence the magnitude of the humoral response in unexposed subjects while the combination of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 plus vaccination, whatever the sequence of the events was, produced a sharp increase in antibody levels. Evaluation of the humoral responses over time and the analysis of the induction and persistence of memory B and T cell responses, are needed to assess long-term immune protection induced by BBIBP-CorV vaccine.","Badano, M.

166292,IDEAS: The first quarter century,2021,"Law no. 17/2014 on some measures to regulate the sale of agricultural land located outside the built-up area was adopted among other reasons to ensure food security and protect national interests in the exploitation of natural resources. These goals are perfectly justified and foreshadow changes in the global environment that will affect social and economic arrangements in the future with great impact. In this context, the importance of protecting agricultural land as a natural resource of central importance is a legitimate political goal. However, the methods used must be very carefully chosen in order to create a legal regime for the sale of agricultural land that respects, on the one hand, the requirements of European law and, on the other hand, fulfills the national interest as far as possible. The current legal regime, created by amending Law no. 17/2014 by Law no. 175/2020 for the amendment and completion of Law no. 17/2014, in force since 13 October 2020, creates a legal regime that raises more questions than it settles regarding the real challenges outlined above.","Veress, Emőd",Agrar - es Kornyezetjog,https://doi.org/10.21029/jael.2021.30.155,642

Non-contact infrared thermometers are able to measure forehead temperature in a timely manner and perform a fast fever screening in a population. However, forehead temperature measurements differ greatly from basal body temperatures and are the target of massive perturbations from the environment. Here we gathered a dataset of N=19392 measurements using the same precision infrared sensor in different locations while tracking both outside temperature, room temperature, time of measurement, and identity. From this, we propose a method able to extract and remove the influence of external perturbations and set a threshold for fever based on local statistics.

The importance of smoking in the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 disease is obvious. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of smoking on depression and perceived stress in healthcare workers who served at the forefront during the pandemic period. Material and Methods: In our study, participants were asked questions on the Depression Severity Scale (PHQ-9), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 14), and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) using aquestionnaire method, and the results were evaluated. Results: Depression and stress symptoms were most often found in the healthcare workers included in our study. However, there was no statistically significant difference in depression and perceived stress scale between smoking and non-smoking groups. Discussion: Previous studies have demonstrated that smokers are more affected by COVID-19 and that their morbidity rate is higher. Because of this informa-tion, smoking healthcare professionals are more symptomatic in terms of mental health disorders, but no statistical difference was reported between smokers and non-smokers in this study in terms of being symptomatic. Although smoking was revealed as a comorbidity for COVID-19, there was no significant difference between smoking and non-smoking healthcare professionals in terms of mental health disorders.","Taşkın, Ö Demir U.; Soylu, V.

In the context of a global increase in mental health diagnoses, the potential health benefits of nature have attracted attention. One practical nature treatment is to walk in nature. However, evidence for this practice on mental health has not been comprehensively appraised to date. This systematic review synthesized the effects of nature walks for depression and anxiety, and evaluated the methodological rigor of studies. Academic databases including ProQuest, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were utilized to identify eligible articles, which were examined using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Of 385 articles initially retrieved, 12 studies met all the eligibility criteria (nine pre-post within-subject studies, two quasi-experimental studies, and one experimental between-subjects study). These studies demonstrated that nature walks were effective for state anxiety but not generalized anxiety and the effects for depression were inconsistent. Findings indicate that nature walks may be effective for mental health, especially for reducing state anxiety. However, the quality of the included studies varied, and sample sizes were small, suggesting a need for more rigorous and large-scale research.","Kotera, Yasuhiro Lyons Melinda Katia Correa Vione Norton Briony",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13074015,642

Changes in the Perception of Truth under the Impact of Cyberspace,2021,"Although the existing flu vaccines elicit strong antigen-specific antibody responses, they fail to provide effective, long term protection – partly due to the absence of robust cellular memory immunity. We hypothesized that co-administration of combination adjuvants, mirroring the flu-virus related innate signaling pathways, could elicit strong cellular immunity. Here, we show that the small molecule adjuvant R848 and the RNA adjuvant PUUC, targeting endosomal TLR7s and cytoplasmic RLRs respectively, when delivered together in polymer nanoparticles (NP), elicits a broadened immune responses in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (mBMDCs) and a synergistic response in both mouse and human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). In mBMDCs, NP-R848-PUUC induced both NF-κB and interferon signaling. Interferon responses to co-delivered R848 and PUUC were additive in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and synergistic in human FLT3-differentiated mBMDCs and CAL-1 pDCs. Vaccination with NPs loaded with H1N1 Flu antigen, R848, and PUUC increased percentage of CD8+ T-cells in the lungs, percentage of antigen-specific CD4+T-cells in the spleen, and enhanced overall cytokine-secreting T cell percentages upon antigen restimulation. Also in the spleen, T lymphopenia, especially after in vitro restimulation, was observed.

170324,Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms Using COVID-19 Chest X-ray Images and Dataset,2022,"BACKGROUND Accurately identifying COVID-19 patients at-risk to deteriorate remains challenging. Tools integrating host-protein expression have proven useful in determining infection etiology and hold potential for prognosticating disease severity. METHODS Adults with COVID-19 were recruited at medical centers in Israel, Germany, and the United States. Severe outcome was defined as intensive care unit admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10; also known as CXCL10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using an analyzer providing values within 15 minutes. A signature indicating the likelihood of severe outcome was derived generating a score (0-100). Patients were assigned to 4 score bins. RESULTS Between March and November 2020, 518 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 394 were eligible, 29% meeting a severe outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the signature was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.91). Performance was not confounded by age, sex, or comorbidities and superior to IL-6 (AUC 0.77; p = 0.033) and CRP (AUC 0.78; p < 0.001). Likelihood of severe outcome increased significantly (p < 0.001) with higher scores. The signature differentiated patients who further deteriorated after meeting a severe outcome from those who improved (p = 0.004) and projected 14-day survival probabilities (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The derived immune-protein signature combined with a rapid measurement platform is an accurate predictive tool for early detection of COVID-19 patients at-risk for severe outcome, facilitating timely care escalation and de-escalation and appropriate resource allocation.

170329,Promoting Economic Development and Solving Societal Issues Within Connected Industries Ecosystems in Society 5.0,2021,"Predictive accuracy of surgical case duration plays a critical role in reducing cost of operation room (OR) utilization. The most common approaches used by hospitals rely on historic averages based on a specific surgeon or a specific procedure type obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) scheduling systems. However, low predictive accuracy of EMR leads to negative impacts on patients and hospitals, such as rescheduling of surgeries and cancellation. In this study, we aim to improve prediction of operation case duration with advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms. We obtained a large data set containing 170,748 operation cases (from Jan 2017 to Dec 2019) from a hospital. The data covered a broad variety of details on patients, operations, specialties and surgical teams. Meanwhile, a more recent data with 8,672 cases (from Mar to Apr 2020) was also available to be used for external evaluation. We computed historic averages from EMR for surgeon- or procedure-specific and they were used as baseline models for comparison. Subsequently, we developed our models using linear regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms. All models were evaluated with R-squre (R^2), mean absolute error (MAE), and percentage overage (case duration > prediction + 10 % & 15 mins), underage (case duration < prediction - 10 % & 15 mins) and within (otherwise). The XGB model was superior to the other models by having higher R^2 (85 %) and percentage within (48 %) as well as lower MAE (30.2 mins). The total prediction errors computed for all the models showed that the XGB model had the lowest inaccurate percent (23.7 %). As a whole, this study applied ML techniques in the field of OR scheduling to reduce medical and financial burden for healthcare management. It revealed the importance of operation and surgeon factors in operation case duration prediction. This study also demonstrated the importance of performing an external evaluation to better validate performance of ML models.","Huang, C.-C.; Lai, J.; Cho, D.-Y.; Yu, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.10.20127910v1?rss=1,642
170825,Systemic Analysis of the Territorial and Urban Planning of Guayaquil,2021,"Obesity and anxiety are morbidities notable for their increased impact on society during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the mechanisms governing susceptibility to these conditions will increase quality of life and our resilience to future pandemics. In the current study we explored the function of a highly conserved regulatory region (BE5.1) within the BDNF gene that harbours a polymorphism strongly associated with obesity (rs10767664; p=4.69×10−26). Analysis in primary cells suggested that the major T-allele of BE5.1 was an enhancer whereas the obesity associated A-allele was not. However, CRISPR/CAS9 deletion of BE5.1 from the mouse genome (BE5.1KO) produced no significant effect on the expression of BDNF transcripts in the hypothalamus, no change in weight gain after 28 days and only a marginally significant increase in food intake. Nevertheless, transcripts were significantly increased in the amygdala of female mice and elevated zero maze and marble burying tests demonstrated a significant increase in anxiety-like behaviour that could be reversed by diazepam. Consistent with these observations, human GWAS cohort analysis demonstrated a significant association between rs10767664 and anxiousness in human populations. Intriguingly, interrogation of the human GTEx eQTL database demonstrated no effect on BDNF mRNA levels associated with rs10767664 but a highly significant effect on BDNF-antisense (BDNF-AS) gene expression and splicing suggesting a possible mechanism. We discuss our findings within the context of the known function and regulation of BDNF in obesity and anxiety whilst exploring the validity of interrogating GWAS data using comparative genomics and functional analysis using CRISPR genome editing in mice.","McEwan, Andrew R.; Hing, Benjamin; Erickson, Johanna C.; Turnbull, Yvonne; Delibegovic, Mirela; Grassmann, Felix; MacKenzie, Alasdair",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.452916,642

The spread of COVID-19 and the need to change everyday habits has opened up the need to teach children the required precautions for limiting the spread of potential pandemics. In this paper we present the initial development of the game Infection Defender, promoting children's awareness of closing schools, social distancing, testing and hospitalization for fighting the spread of infectious diseases in Denmark. These activities are given in the hands of children, between 10 and 13 years old, and the goal of the game is achieving a balanced response to a possible infectious decease outbreak. We present the game, its design considerations and how the learning objectives are integrated into it. An analysis of the game by pedagogical workers is made and a pilot test is carried out assessing children's reactions to it. Initial positive feedback shows that the game sparks interest and discussion in children and can be used as part of the study curriculum to help children understand the need for certain measurements.","Nikolov, I.; Madsen, C.","Grapp: Proceedings of the 16th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Vol. 1: Grapp",https://doi.org/10.5220/0010284102530260,642

As a respiratory coronavirus, the model provides a suitable system for study, in addition to potential determination of systemic results. Specifically applied, MHV-1 has many key characteristics, such as symptoms and viral protein structures, that are in common or similar to other coronaviruses. Thus, this theorized model simultaneously addresses a key knowledge gap and provides useful insights into potential treatments for COVID-19 and similar disease-causing viruses.

Design/methodology/approach: With an exploratory-correlational approach and a quantitative study, this study conducted a statistical-descriptive analysis based on the premise of a general linear regression model with correlations between the variables, using a data collection instrument, whose construct and content validity was previously assessed by experts, which was answered by 564 students of the Degrees in Communication and Marketing from the Complutense University of Madrid, University of La Laguna, and ESERP Business and Law School. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett’s test of sphericity were implemented to analyze the correlation between variables;Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and Pearson and Spearman’s coefficients were also used. Findings: Those students who used social networks to receive news from university institutions about the COVID-19 pandemic deem these channels official, sound and credible. Similarly, the use of official information from university institutions on social networks increases students’ happiness levels. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies aiming to provide scientific evidence of the relationship between happiness management and university governance.

171462,An Automated Visualization Feature-Based Analysis Tool,2022,"Infectious illness is the biggest cause of death in children due to a physical illness, particularly in children under five years. If mortality is to be reduced for this group of children, it is important to understand factors affecting their pathways to hospital. The aim of this study was to retrospectively identify organisational and environmental factors, and individual child, family, and professional factors affecting timing of admission to hospital for children under five years of age with a serious infectious illness (SII). Methods An explanatory modified grounded theory mixed methods design was used in collaboration with parents. Two stages of data collection were conducted: Stage 1, interviews with 22 parents whose child had recently been hospitalised with a SII and 14 health professionals (HPs) involved in their pre-admission trajectories; Stage 2, focus groups with 18 parents and 16 HPs with past experience of SII in young children. Constant comparative analysis generated the explanatory theory. Findings The core category was Navigating uncertain illness trajectories for young children with serious infectious illness. Uncertainty was prevalent throughout the parents and HPs stories about their experiences of navigating social rules and overburdened health services for these children. The complexity of and lack of continuity within services, family lives, social expectations and hierarchies provided the context and conditions for childrens, often complex, illness trajectories. Parents reported powerlessness and perceived criticism leading to delayed help-seeking. Importantly, parents and professionals missed symptoms of serious illness. Risk averse services were found to refer more children to emergency departments. Conclusions Parents and professionals have difficulties recognising signs of SII in young children and can feel socially constrained from seeking help. The increased burden on services has made it more difficult for professionals to spot the seriously ill child.","Neill, S. J.; Bray, L.; Carter, B.; Roland, D.; Carrol, E.

In this study, a detection methodology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (wild-type and variants of concern) in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes (E and ORF1ab) by PEG precipitation and digital droplet PCR. This methodology was used to determine the SARS-CoV-2 concentration and the proportion of N501Y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany over a period of 1 year (June 2020 to July 2021). Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with reported COVID-19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation. Viral RNA titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data, demonstrating the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning system. Parallel PCR analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with E, ORF, RdRP2 and NSP9 assays. RdPP1 and NSP3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers, and in particular for N1 there was low correlation with the other assays due to outliers. The occurrence of the N501Y mutation in the wastewater of Karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha-variant (B.1.1.7) in the corresponding individual clinical tests. In batch experiments SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions, but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen. Overall, this study shows that wastewater-based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage, contributing to successful pandemic management.","Ho, J.; Stange, C.; Suhrborg, R.; Wurzbacher, C.; Drewes, J.

Participants: The prospective, population-based HUNT2 Survey (1995-97) in Norway invited 93,898 inhabitants >=20 years in the Nord-Trondelag region, whereof 65,237 (69.5%) participated. 46.8% of the participants were men. Exposures: Sex and potential mediators between sex and BSI; health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption), education attainment, cardiovascular risk factors (systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, body mass index) and previous or current comorbidities. Main outcome measures: Sex differences in risk of first-time BSI, BSI mortality (death within first 30 days after a BSI), BSI caused by the most frequent bacteria, and the impact of known BSI risk factors as mediators. Results: We documented a first-time BSI for 1,840 (2.9%) participants (51.3% men) during a median follow-up of 14.8 years. Of these, 396 (0.6%) died (56.6% men). Men had 41% higher risk of any first-time BSI (95% confidence interval (CI), 28 to 54%) than women. An estimated 34% of the excess risk of BSI in men was mediated by known BSI risk factors. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI for BSI due to S. aureus was 2.09 (1.28 to 2.54), S. pneumoniae 1.36 (1.05 to 1.76), and E. coli 0.97 (0.84 to 1.13) in men vs women. BSI related mortality was higher in men compared to women with HR 1.87 (1.53 to 2.28). Conclusions: This large population-based study show that men have higher risk of BSI than women. One-third of this effect was mediated by known risk factors for BSI. This raises important questions regarding sex specific approaches to reduce the burden of BSI.","Mohus, R. M.; Gustad, L.

171879,COVIDPRO-NET: a prognostic tool to detect COVID 19 patients from lung X-ray and CT images using transfer learning and Q-deformed entropy,2021,"Introduction: Advance planning of the design and analysis of vaccine trials conducted during infectious disease outbreaks increases our ability to rapidly define the efficacy and potential impact of a vaccine and inform public health response. Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEI) is an important measure for understanding the full impact of a vaccine, yet it is currently not identifiable in many vaccine trial designs because it requires knowledge of the vaccination status of infectors. Recent advances in pathogen genomics have improved our ability to accurately reconstruct transmission networks. We aim to assess if augmenting classical randomized controlled trial designs with pathogen sequence and contact tracing data can permit these trials to estimate VEI. Methods: We develop a transmission model with a vaccine trial in an outbreak setting, incorporate pathogen sequence evolution data and sampling as well as contact tracing data, and assign probabilities to likely infectors. We then propose and evaluate the performance of an estimator of VEI. Results: We find that under perfect knowledge of infector-infectee pairs, we are able to accurately estimate VEI. Use of sequence data results in imperfect reconstruction of the transmission networks, biasing estimates of VEI towards the null, with approaches using deep sequence data performing better than approaches using consensus sequence data. Inclusion of contact tracing data reduces the bias. Conclusion: Pathogen genomics enhance identifiability of VEI from individually randomized controlled trials, but imperfect transmission network reconstruction biases the estimates towards the null and limits our ability to detect VEI. Given the consistent direction of the bias, estimates obtained from trials using these methods will provide lower bounds on the true VEI. A combination of sequence and epidemiologic data results in the most accurate estimates, underscoring the importance of contact tracing in reconstructing transmission networks.","Kahn, R.; Wang, R.; Leavitt, S.; Hanage, W.

This is a particularly important task for local tourism governances in terms of developing mechanisms for involving residents in planning and decision making. This research focuses on gaining insights into the relationship between the tourism dependency of residents and their perception of local tourism governance in terms of satisfaction with the organization of local public and private tourism stakeholders, as well as with the involvement of residents in tourism planning and decision making. The added value of the research lies in comparing the attitudes of residents in a highly-visited destination and a destination in the early stage of development. Both selected destinations are seaside destinations. with prevailing private accommodation and residential type of tourism. Responses were analyzed using ANOVA and the t-test, and the obtained results indicate that residents with no connection to tourism are the most dissatisfied with the local tourism governance dimensions. Also, residents who live in highly-visited destination had lower mean values of perceived local tourism governance than those living in less-visited destination. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

This paper aims to fill two research gaps important for understanding utility of real-time social media data for policymaking: What policy-relevant information is contained in this data and whether this information changes in periods of abrupt social, economic, and policy change. To do so, this paper focuses on two salient policy areas heavily affected by the lockdown policies responding to the 2020 COVID-19 crisis – early childhood education and care policies, and labor market policies focused on (un)employment. We utilize Twitter data for a four-month period during the first wave of COVID-19 and data for the same four-month period the preceding year.

With regards to the first research gap, we show that there is policy-relevant information in Twitter data, but that the majority of our data is of limited relevance, and that the data that is relevant present some challenges and limitations. With regards to the second research gap, we successfully quantify the change in relevant information between periods of ‘normalcy’ and ‘crisis’.

The objective of this study was to characterize the association between timing of treatment and survival and to evaluate how extended delays to guideline-concordant treatment for suspected stage I high grade serous ovarian cancer might impact survival. Using the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2015), patients surgically treated for clinical stage I high grade serous ovarian cancer were identified. Patients receiving surgery within 14 days of diagnosis were compared to those receiving surgery 2-4 months after diagnosis. The groups were propensity matched with 2:1 matching to balance baseline characteristics. Survival outcomes of the two cohorts were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis. During the study period, 10,957 patients underwent guideline-concordant surgery for stage I high-grade serous ovarian cancer within 14 days of diagnosis (early) and 171 patients underwent surgery 2-4 months following diagnosis (delayed). Between patients in the early versus delayed treatment groups, the delayed group was more likely to be Black (5.3% vs 11.8%, p=0.003) and have a smaller tumor size (8.0 vs. 6.2 cm, p<0.001). The early group was more likely to have private insurance (57.4% vs 44.9%, p=0.006). There was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival between the unmatched early versus delayed groups (56.6% vs 50.8%, p=0.36). Propensity-score 2:1 matching was used to create two groups of patients who received early (n=342) or delayed (n=171) surgery that were well-matched with regards to baseline characteristics. The only significant difference between groups in the matched cohort was patients in the delayed group had smaller tumors (8.0 vs 6.2 cm, p<0.001). There was no significant difference in 3-year overall survival (early 73.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 68.2 - 78.2] vs delayed 72.6% [95% CI: 64.4 - 79.2]) or 5-year overall survival (early 56.6% [95% CI: 50.3 - 62.4] vs delayed 50.8% [95% CI: 41.6 - 59.3], log-rank p=0.52) between the early versus delayed groups (Figure 1). In Cox proportional hazards analysis, age in years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=1.03, [CI: 1.01 - 1.04], p=0.003) and Charlson Deyo comorbidity composite score of 2 (aHR=2.58, [CI: 1.44 - 4.62], p=0.001) were associated with worse survival. Private insurance status was associated with improved overall survival (aHR=0.51, [CI: 0.27 - 0.96], p=0.04). Surgical delay was not significantly associated with different overall survival (aHR=1.19, [CI: 0.90 - 1.58], p=0.23). [Display omitted] In this national analysis, extended delay of treatment for stage I high grade serous ovarian cancer was associated with similar survival outcomes when compared to timely treatment in pre-match and post-match cohorts. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospital resources may be limited, delays in surgery are concerning and prompt oncologic treatment is preferred;however, at least based on these retrospective data, delays in surgery for presumed stage I ovarian cancer may not be associated with significantly worse survival.

172716,Health Analytics on COVID-19 Data with Few-Shot Learning,2021,"Systemic amyloidoses are a group of progressive and life-threatening rare diseases. Patients often feel overwhelmed by the complexities of symptoms, treatment options, and management of their care team. The Amyloidosis Appointment Companion (AAC) was created to help patients identify their goals of care, changes in their condition, as well as the challenges they are facing and share these with their health care providers (HCPs). The AAC has been developed to create a synergy between patients and their clinicians as it relates to not only their health and wellbeing but their overall life goals, and to guide discussion and development of their treatment plan. Here we report on the findings of the first 70 patients to use the AAC at the Amyloidosis Center of Boston University Medical Center (BUMC). The Amyloidosis Research Consortium (ARC) in collaboration with Patient Discovery, a virtual healthcare platform, created the AAC, a digital tool to guide patients through a personalized, interactive survey in order to capture their current status, treatment goals and preferences, correct misperceptions, frame decisions, and promote adherence to treatment plans. The tool was beta tested at 5 amyloidosis centers to assess dissemination and clinical integration strategies, decision-making processes, and communication. The tool launched at BUMC in January 2020, after being integrated into the appointment process as part of both in person and virtual telehealth visits via the Amyloid Center Office and included in the appointment scheduling workflow. Data collected via the tool is securely shared with BUMC by patients and entered into their charts. Additional telehealth-specific features were added to the AAC when the BUMC clinic added virtual appointments in response to COVID-19. This is a report of the findings from the first 70 patients utilizing the tool over a five-month time period. There was a completion rate of 82%, well above the industry standard for patient surveys of 41%. The average user age was 65 years (range, 24 to 86), and 41% (n=29) of patients used the AAC on a mobile device. Patients reported the following subtypes of amyloidosis: Patients spent an average of 16.5 minutes using the AAC prior to their appointment and completed the following tasks: • Completing Clinic Intake Forms • Preparing for Telehealth Appointments • Reconciling Medications • Capturing Treatment Satisfaction and Preferences • Sharing Goals of Care • Reporting Symptoms and Side Effects • Charting Labs • Reviewing Educational Videos • Reporting on Quality of Life Measures Of these 70 patients, 60% (n=42) patients reported slight to moderate levels of anxiety or depression and 69% (n=48) pain and 59% (n=41) restricted mobility. Two main types of reported goals of care were identified: 1) short term, isolated goals (such as attending a specific life event) and 2) long term, lifestyle goals (such as regaining exercise tolerance or living independently). Individualized to their responses, patients prioritized a list of topics to discuss with their clinicians, the most common topics were: 1. Understanding treatment options, 2. Learning more about my disease, 3. Managing my symptoms and side effects, 4. Concern my disease is progressing. Three providers within the Amyloidosis Center at BUMC independently reported enhanced satisfaction with outcome of appointments as a result of patients having used the AAC. The data patients shared led to greater efficiency during telehealth appointments in particular with the time saved on medicine reconciliation and vital signs, allowing more time during the appointment to focus on delivering personalized care. The AAC demonstrated improved patient to physician communication particularly during a time of increased telehealth visits. The AAC is a patient and provider centered tool that facilitates patient communication and involvement in decision making, as well as helping providers understand their patients' preferences and goals of care. The tool improves appointment efficiency in particular, educing significantly the time taken up in a telehealth visit for medication reconciliation, obtaining vitals and in some cases, technical support. The tool emphasizes patient engagement to improve patient-provider communication. Furthermore, insights from these data provide powerful information that may help improve development of assistance programs, clinical trials, and research.

The mechanisms of end-organ damage and mortality in severe COVID are slowly being unraveled. COVID-related coagulopathy is a characteristic syndrome that plays a key role in multi-organ dysfunction and severe disease. Mechanistically, many components including endothelial cells, the coagulation system, complement system, cytokines, and NETosis are involved in the pathogenesis of this syndrome and provide potential therapeutic targets.

Considering that the importance of distance education has increased with the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is aimed to propose an adaptive e-learning system solution that offers more effective learning experiences by taking into account the individual differences in the learning processes of the students. The Felder and Silverman learning style model was used to represent individual differences in students’ learning processes. In our system, it is aimed to recommend learning materials that are suitable for learning styles and previous knowledge levels of the students. With the multi-agent based structure, an effective control mechanism is devised to monitor the interaction of students with the system and to observe the learning levels of each student. The purpose of this control mechanism is to provide a higher efficiency in the subjects the students study compared to non-personalized e-learning systems. This study focuses on the proposed architecture and the development of the first prototype of it. In order to test the effectiveness of the system, personalized course materials should be prepared according to the learning styles of the students. In this context, it is planned to use the proposed system in future studies within the scope of a course in which the educational content is personalized. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ciloglugil, B.; Alatli, O.; Inceoglu, M.

173274,Choosing cyber during COVID,2021,"Abstract As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many courses were forced online. This posed particular challenges for courses with laboratory or hands-on components. A group of instructors at the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin-Madison designed an online, asynchronous course structure for teaching introductory horticulture courses with laboratory components. Uniquely, the courses described in this article, while delivered through the online teaching platform Canvas, focused on developing hands-on activities that got students away from their computers to observe, work with, and grow plants. The course included hands-on activities that complemented lecture readings and videos and guided students through designing and setting up experiments in their homes. We heard many positive reviews from student course evaluations for this style of course and want to share the structure and the types of experiential activities we included to engage students with plants and the process of science, as well as lessons that we learned while teaching in this online learning environment. We found that the ability to care for and observe plants on a daily basis wove together the lecture and lab materials in ways that were not previously seen during in-person courses. As instructors, we would adapt some of the components of these online courses into our in-person courses in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

173547,The Most Significant Biomarkers and Specific Antibodies for the Early Diagnosis and Monitoring in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Background: With over 40 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in the US and discussion of both vaccine mandates as well as boosters ongoing, we aim to examine protection conferred by previous infection compared with vaccination so that citizens and policy makers can make informed decisions. Objectives: To compare mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity against immunity induced by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 between June and August 2021 when the Delta variant became dominant in the US. We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing two groups whose incident vaccination or infection occurred within the first two months of 2021: (1) SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a full mRNA vaccination - 2 doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, (2) newly infected individuals who were subdivided into those have not been vaccinated and those have been vaccinated after their infection. Matched multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was applied. We evaluated laboratory (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up, COVID-related hospitalization, and deaths. Setting: Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Main outcomes: Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, COVID-related hospitalization, and deaths. Protection was estimated from hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 9,539 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first two months of 2021 were matched to 14,458 and 23,105 patients fully vaccinated with Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines, during the same two months. 3,917 (41%) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were subsequently vaccinated. We plan to study this group separately. Consequently, protections were estimated among those with infection but were not subsequently vaccinated and those vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine. Among seniors, Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines offered stronger protection against infection, lowering the risk by an additional 66% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)] and 68% [HR: 0.32 (95% CI, 0.14-0.70)]; stronger protection against hospitalization, lowering the risk by an additional 61% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)] and 45% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)]; and stronger protection against deaths lowering the risk by an additional 95% [HR: 0.05 (95% CI, 0.004-0.62)] and 99% [HR: 0.01 (95% CI, 0.001-0.44)]. Among young adults (age < 65), the protections offered by vaccines were statistically equivalent to that provided by previous infection, especially in terms of absolute incidence rate. Conclusions Among the elderly (age 65 or older), two-dose mRNA vaccines provided stronger protection against infection, hospitalization, and death, compared to natural immunity. Among young adults (age < 65), the protections offered between natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity were similar.","Young-Xu, Y.; Smith, J.; Korves, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.27.21264194v1?rss=1,642
173788,Challenges of online laboratory electrical engineering exercises,2021,"Background Phase III trials have estimated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We explore the direction and magnitude of potential biases in these estimates and their implications for vaccine protection against infection and against disease in breakthrough infections. Methods We developed a mathematical model that accounts for natural and vaccine-induced immunity, changes in serostatus and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of tests for infection and antibodies. We estimated expected biases in VE against symptomatic, asymptomatic and any SARS-CoV-2 infections and against disease following infection for a range of vaccine characteristics and measurement approaches, and the likely overall biases for published trial results that included asymptomatic infections. Results VE against asymptomatic infection measured by PCR or serology is expected to be low or negative for vaccines that prevent disease but not infection. VE against any infection is overestimated when asymptomatic infections are less likely to be detected than symptomatic infections and the vaccine protects against symptom development. A competing bias towards underestimation arises for estimates based on tests with imperfect specificity, especially when testing is performed frequently. Our model indicates considerable uncertainty in Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S VE against any infection, with slightly higher than published, bias-adjusted values of 59.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.4 to 77.1) and 70.9% (95% UI 49.8 to 80.7) respectively. Conclusion Multiple biases are likely to influence COVID-19 VE estimates, potentially explaining the observed difference between ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. These biases should be considered when interpreting both efficacy and effectiveness study results.","Williams, L. R.; Ferguson, N. M.; Donnelly, C. A.; Grassly, N.

174271,"Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques for Effective Future Predictions of COVID-19: A Review",2022,"LaVO$_3$ (LVO) has been proposed as a promising material for photovoltaics because its strongly correlated \textit{d} electrons can facilitate the creation of multiple electron-hole pairs per incoming photon, which would lead to increased device efficiency. In this study, we intentionally grow off-stoichiometric LVO films by changing the growth conditions such as laser fluence. Our aim is to study how deviating La:V stoichiometries affect the electronic properties of LVO thin films. We find that the off-stoichiometry clearly alters the physical properties of the films. Structural characterization shows that both La-rich and V-rich films have different levels of structural distortion, with La-rich (V-rich) films showing a larger (smaller) out-of-plane lattice parameter compared to what one would expect from epitaxial strain effects alone. Both types of films show deviation from the behavior of bulk LVO in optical measurement, i.e., they do not show signatures of the expected long range orbital order, which can be a result of the structural distortions or the presence of structural domains. In transport measurements, La-rich films display clear signatures of electronic phase separation accompanying a temperature induced metal-insulator transition, while V-rich films behave as Mott insulators. The out-of-plane lattice parameter plays a crucial role in determining the transport properties, as the crossover from Mott-insulating to disorder-induced phase-separated behavior occurs around a lattice parameter value of 3.96 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$, quite different from what has been previously reported.","Zhang, Biwen; Xin, Yan; Karapetrova, Evguenia; Holleman, Jade; McGill, Stephen A.; Beekman, Christianne",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09302v1.pdf,642

Through descriptive analysis, this paper builds on earlier papers by the authors on the Australian response, with a focus on the changing dynamics of travel activity, concern with public transport, and attitudes surrounding activity given the perception of risk of COVID-19 and the level of public support for regulatory intervention and restrictions on movement. We find that Australia continues to suppress travel, particularly that for commuting, that comfort in completing day-to-day activities continues to rise (with the exception of Victoria where confidence feel significantly), and while support for intervention measures remains high, there has been an erosion in sentiment. As with previous work, we discuss what this might mean for future transport policy, and attempt to draw lessons from the Australian experience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Beck, M. J.; Hensher, D.

A search on electronic database like PubMed was undertaken using the search terms “coronavirus mental health healthcare workers”. 20 articles were included in this review.ResultsStudies revealed that health care workers have prensented considerable psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, stress, insomnia, somatization, mental and physical exhaustion, addiction and obssessive compulsive symptoms. The prevalence of these symptoms varies from study to another with almost a more notable prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The following factors that predispose to developing mental distress were noted: being a frontline health worker, having direct contact with infected patients, working in a city with a high infection rate, female sex, isolation, being a suspected case, stigmatization, change of organization, lack of materials, lack of information, lack of communication, lack of support, fear of contamination or of contaminating loved ones, having an organic pathology.ConclusionsThis notable impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers alerts us as colleagues and civil society to the ultimate need for an urgent adequate and up-to-date intervention to alleviate this distress.","Sellami, S.; Mami, H.; Kacem, M.; Hriz, E.

HSV induces host organelle rearrangement and forms dispersed assembly compartments in epithelial cells, which complicates the study of HSV assembly. In this study, we show that HSV forms a visually distinct unitary cytoplasmic viral assembly center (cVAC) in both cancerous and primary neuronal cells that concentrates viral structural proteins and is the site of capsid envelopment. The HSV cVAC also concentrates host membranes that are important for viral assembly, such as Golgi- and recycling endosome-derived membranes. Lastly, we show that HSV cVAC formation and/or maintenance depends on an intact microtubule network and a viral tegument protein, pUL51. Our observations suggest that the neuronal cVAC is a uniquely useful model to study common herpesvirus assembly pathways, and cell-specific pathways for membrane reorganization. Summary This study shows that HSV forms a viral assembly center in neuronal cells by reorganization of host membranes. This system is a novel and powerful tool to study herpesvirus assembly pathways and host cell membrane dynamics.","White, Shaowen; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Harata, N.

The project ran over 6 months, from August 2019 to January 2020.The project team consisted of nine local staff members and two UK doctors working through the NHS ‘Improving Global Health through Leadership Development’ (IGH) programme.MethodsTo understand existing processes and identify areas for improvement, baseline data was gathered and a ‘process mapping’ meeting was held.Improvements were implemented using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology.A QI committee involving key stakeholders met fortnightly to discuss project progress.ResultsInterventions were varied but included introduction of a pre-transfusion bedside safety checklist and staff transfusion training via a sustainable video.Documentation of critical patient identifiers improved both on transfusion request forms and at transfusion initiation. Completion of the bedside safety checklist was 65.5% by three months.Knowledge scores improved following transfusion training. 77% of staff strongly agreed and 21% agreed that the training was useful.Importantly, team members from both organisations reflected on their personal learning and development through the experience.DiscussionInitial progress was promising. Further work is needed to improve allocation of unique patient identification numbers and the safety of laboratory blood grouping and cross-match procedures.Challenges included short-staffing and government hospital strikes;subsequently the Covid-19 pandemic has limited ongoing QI work since February 2020.This collaborative system-strengthening project provided varied, reciprocal learning experiences for individuals from both organisations, including skills in leadership, teamwork, teaching, QI methodology, communication and IT. We believe that active reflection is a vital tool in the evaluation of QI work carried out in resource-limited settings in partnership with overseas organisations. Our experiences will help to inform ongoing work at MAH and may be of interest to others conducting QI work in similar settings.","Snead, Charlotte Upton Rebecca Niaina Simon Luthango Ellen",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.209,642

To make the result of this study more applicable, this paper aims to train and test the model using photographs taken in profile and partially covered faces to simulate the situation in which the object needs to be identified does not face the camera at a right angle or wears masks. The experimental results demonstrate that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved superior performance in recognizing uncovered frontal faces, with a success probability of 95.0%. Nevertheless, the model has a less satisfactory result when classifying profile or masked faces, and the corresponding success probability for the former is 22.2%, the latter 2.22%.

It was found out that the emergent transition to online education was mostly fruitfull for the development of new learning technologies, but at same time many students experienced frustration and uncertainty, studying independently;some lecturers were not ready to refuse from traditional frontal teaching methods. Theoretical analysis was applied to study classic and modern scientific works on the nature of the phenomenon of knowledge and its formation. Comparative analysis of the latest publications on this topic revealed that actual pedagogical approaches stated the importance of learners’ active participation in the interactions and interrelations within the system of the learning process and the relevance of the socio-cultural context of new knowledge presentation. Pedagogical observation and expert evaluation enabled authors’ exploring Generation Z students’ cognitive modes and psychological background, featured by practically oriented motivation, clip thinking, ability for multitasking, prevailing unvoluntary attention and weak memorization, preference for visual presentation of information. Theoretical synthesis and compilation implementation enabled working out practical recommendations for intensifying the process of knowledge formation of Generation Z students.

There is enough statistics to show that exercise prevents severe forms of COVID-19, but current recommendations do not set an upper limit for exercise intensity. The hypothesis presented in the paper states that intense exercise, through blood hypoxia, increases the expression of transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (tACE2) in the vascular endothelium, increasing the risk of developing serious forms of disease, especially in the untrained. On the other hand, moderate-intensity exercise increases the blood concentration of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which has a protective role for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may prevent complications.

A straightforward decision tree with three variables, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and lymphocyte percentage, has been proposed previously, with more than 90% accuracy. In this work, we highlight the importance of the cohort made publicly available, especially at the beginning of the pandemic where open data were still limited, and complement the findings by incorporating further evaluation. Results confirmed poor short-term prognosis to abnormal levels of some laboratorial indicators, such as LDH, CRP, lymphocytes, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. Our findings could also provide insights into COVID-19 research, such as key levels of fibrin degradation products, which are directly associated with the Dimerized plasmin fragment D and could indicate active coagulation and thrombosis. Still, we highlight here the prognostic value of interleukin-6, a cytokine that induces inflammatory response.","Ferreira, J. R.; Ribeiro, V. H. A.; Cossetin, M.; Figueredo, M. V. M.; Cardoso, C.

175701,Multi-objective Classification and Feature Selection of Covid-19 Proteins Sequences using NSGA-II and MAP-Elites,2021,"Introduction In January 2021, the UK decided to prioritise the delivery of the first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca) vaccines by extending the interval until the second dose up to 12 weeks. Methods Serological responses were compared after BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccination with varying intervals in uninfected and previously-infected adults aged 50-89 years. These findings are evaluated against real-world national vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against COVID-19 in England. Results We recruited 750 participants aged 50-89 years, including 126 (16.8%) with evidence of previous infection; 421 received BNT162b2 and 329 and AZD1222. For both vaccines, over 95% had seroconverted 35-55 days after dose one, and 100% seroconverted 7+ days after dose 2. Following a 65-84 day interval between two doses, geometric mean titres (GMTs) at 14-34 days were 6-fold higher for BNT162b2 (6703; 95%CI, 5887-7633) than AZD1222 (1093; 806-1483), which in turn were higher than those receiving BNT162b2 19-29 days apart (694; 540 - 893). For both vaccines, VE was higher across all age-groups from 14 days after dose two compared to one dose, but the magnitude varied with interval between doses. Higher two-dose VE was observed with >6 week intervals between BNT162b2 doses compared to the authorised 3-week schedule, including [≥]80 year-olds. Conclusion Our findings support the UK approach of prioritising the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines, with evidence of higher protection following extended schedules. Given global vaccine constraints, these results are relevant to policymakers, especially with highly transmissible variants and rising incidence in many countries.","Amirthalingam, G.; Lopez Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.

175998,Deep Learning for COVID-19: COVID-19 Detection Based on Chest X-Ray Images by the Fusion of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Techniques,2022,"Background: Seroprevalence studies are important tools to estimate the prevalence of prior or recent SARS-CoV-2 infections, identifying hotspots and high-risk groups and informing public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a city-level seroprevalence study in Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and risk factors for seropositivity. Methods: We invited inhabitants of 2,000 randomly sampled addresses between November 5 and December 31, 2020. Participants completed questionnaires measuring sociodemographic and health characteristics, and COVID-19 exposure history, and provided dried blood spots for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. We calculate total and subgroup seroprevalence estimates based on presence of IgG antibodies using a Bayesian procedure that incorporates uncertainty in antibody test sensitivity and specificity. We account for clustering by household and weighting based on demographic characteristics to ensure estimates represented the citys population. Findings: We enrolled 280 households including 472 individuals. 328 underwent antibody testing. The citywide seroprevalence estimate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 13.1% (95%CI 6.9-22.3) compared to 9.8% based on publicly reported case counts. Seroprevalence was 16.1% (95%CI 6.2-31.8) among individuals identifying as Hispanic compared to 9.4% (95%CI 4.6-16.4) among those identifying as non-Hispanic white. Seroprevalence was higher among Spanish speaking households (21.9%; 95% CI 8.3-43.9) compared to English speaking households (10.2%; 95% CI 5.2-18.0) and among individuals living in high vulnerability areas (14.4%; 95% CI 7.1-25.5) compared to low vulnerability areas (8.2%; 95% CI 3.1-16.9). Interpretation: The measured SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of IgG antibodies in Holyoke was only 13.1% during the second surge of SARS-CoV-2 in this region, far from accepted thresholds for herd immunity. Already vulnerable communities were at highest risk of prior infection. Implementation of local serosurveys in tandem with proactive public health interventions that address disparities in SARS-CoV-2 exposure are crucial to ensure at-risk communities have appropriate educational materials and access to vaccines, testing, and timely treatment.","Matias, W.

176258,Sssnake: A remote multiplayer toy for children,2021,"Context: With relatively high transmission rate and fatal potential, the COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for widespread fear and psychological distress all over the world, including India. Aim: Assessment of these problems in the general population is the first step to address this problem. Settings and Design: We did an online survey using snowball sampling strategy through various social media communication platforms. Materials and Methods: Semi-structured format was used to collect sociodemographic data and COVID-19-related information. The Kessler's Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used for assessment psychological distress and fear, respectively. Results: A total of 530 study respondents had adequate participation from all socioeconomic strata, diverse educational and professional backgrounds, and from all parts of the country. Majority of the participants were from red zone districts of lockdown (72.8%) and considered the imposed lockdown as essential (98.7%), although many of them reported negative impact on their psychological state (38.9%). A substantial number (38%) of people reported psychological distress significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with females, unmarried, students, lower socioeconomic status (SES), caretakers of COVID-19 patients, poor perceived physical health, and higher score on the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Female participants and those belonging to lower SES and a red zone district also reported significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher degree of fear of COVID-19. Despite this, only about 10.9% of the respondents sought help through telephonic or online counseling and most (91.4%) of them found it helpful. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psychological health is catastrophic. Planned measures at local as well as national level are essential to avert this crisis.","Sathe, H.

177018,Genetic Predisposition – Impact on the COVID-19 Infection Severity,2021,"Infectious disease outbreaks are recurring events which can lead to a large number of fatalities every year. Infectious disease outbreaks occur infrequently and the role of global warming and modes of climate variability for those outbreaks is not clear. Here we use an extreme value statistics approach to examine annual spatially aggregated infectious disease fatality data to compute their probability to occur using generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) models. The GPD provides a good model for modeling the fatality data and reveals that the number of fatalities follows a power-law. We find that the magnitude of Covid-19 is of an expected level given previous fatality data over the period 1900–2020. We also examined whether including co-variates in the GPD models provide better model fits. We find evidence that a pure linear trend is the best co-variate and, thus, has increased the propensity of large outbreaks to occur for most continents and world-wide. This suggests that mainly non-climate factors affect the likelihood of outbreaks. This linear trend function provides a crude representation of socio-economic trends such as improved public health. However, for South America the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation modulates the outbreak propensity as the best co-variate, showing that climate can play some role in infectious disease outbreaks in some regions.","Franzke, Christian L.

Herein, data from a high-volume cancer center is presented highlighting risk factors associated with hospitalization with COVID-19 disease. Methods: Cancer patients in the Levine Cancer Institute COVID19 database who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 due to clinical illness from March 1, 2020 to October 29, 2020 with 90 days follow-up are described here. Patients' demographic and clinical information were retrospectively entered into a REDCap database from chart reviews. Differences in distributions were identified between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients using the chi-squared test with uni- and multivariable logistic regression models. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results: 228 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, of whom 103 (45%) were hospitalized. Median age was 63 years (range 28-95). Race distribution for infection showed White 65%, followed by Black 26.8% and Hispanic ethnicity 16.7% , with a similar distribution for hospital admission. Median length of stay was 10 days (range 1-91) with no readmissions within 90 days. The most common underlying malignancies were breast (29.8%), hematologic (21.1%) and genitourinary (12.3%). The most common preexisting conditions included hypertension (55.7%), diabetes (27.2%) and cardiac disease (3.9%). The most common presenting symptoms were cough (50.2%), fever (38.4%), fatigue (37.8%) and shortness of breath (36.4%). Maximum oxygen requirements for hospitalized patients were ambient air (34%), nasal canula (34%), high/medium flow nasal canula (10%), non-invasive ventilation (13%) and mechanical ventilation (10%). Case fatality rate was 10% with diagnosis of COVID-19, including 21.4% of those admitted to the hospital and 51.7% of those admitted to the ICU. Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, prior chemotherapy, upper gastrointestinal cancers, hematologic cancers, number of medical conditions, cardiac disease, chronic lung diseases, hypertension, and diabetes increased risk of hospitalization. Table shows results of multivariate analysis. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high case fatality rates in our cancer patients. We identified age, cardiac disease, hematologic malignancy and receipt of chemotherapy within 4 weeks of diagnosis as risk factors for hospitalization.

177773,Mathematical Model for Controlling the Spreading of COVID-19 in the Context of Hospital Environment,2021,"Current surveillance methods may not capture the full extent of COVID-19 spread in high-risk settings like food establishments. Thus, we propose a new method for surveillance that identifies COVID-19 cases among food establishment workers from news reports via web-scraping and natural language processing (NLP). First, we used web-scraping to identify a broader set of articles (n = 67,078) related to COVID-19 based on keyword mentions. In this dataset, we used an open-source NLP platform (ClarityNLP) to extract location, industry, case, and death counts automatically. These articles were vetted and validated by CDC subject matter experts (SMEs) to identify those containing COVID-19 outbreaks in food establishments. CDC and Georgia Tech Research Institute SMEs provided a human-labeled test dataset containing 388 articles to validate our algorithms. Then, to improve quality, we fine-tuned a pretrained RoBERTa instance, a bidirectional transformer language model, to classify articles containing ≥ 1 positive COVID-19 cases in food establishments. The application of RoBERTa decreased the number of articles from 67,078 to 1,112 and classified (≥ 1 positive COVID-19 cases in food establishments) articles with 88% accuracy in the human-labeled test dataset. Therefore, by automating the pipeline of web-scraping and COVID-19 case prediction using RoBERTa, we enable an efficient human in-the-loop process by which COVID-19 data could be manually collected from articles flagged by our model, thus reducing the human labor requirements. Furthermore, our approach could be used to predict and monitor locations of COVID-19 development by geography and could also be extended to other industries and news article datasets of interest. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Miano, J.; Hilton, C.; Gangrade, V.; Pomeroy, M.; Siven, J.; Flynn, M.; Tilashalski, F.","19th International Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Medicine, AIME 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77211-6_21,642
177786,NON-LINEAR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INTERFERENCES IN DECLARATIVE MEMORY FORMATION,2021-06-29,"Abstract Importance: Racial and ethnic minority populations have been disproportionately affected in terms of hospitalizations and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine uptake remains a barrier to full population inoculation against this highly infectious disease. Objective: The purpose of this report is to describe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine interest rates in a racially, geographically, and ethnically diverse study cohort and characterize vaccine interest across a racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse study population. Design: This report describes responses to a survey administered between November 2020 and May 2021 using a community convenience sample through a partnership between the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) as part of the Minority and Rural Coronavirus Insights Study (MRCIS). Analysis of survey responses from 3,624 participants are provided. Results: Early data from the MRCIS cohort suggest that [SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy] is more prevalent in Black versus Non-Hispanic Whites survey respondents, and the Hispanic community has positive interest in the vaccine, to a similar degree as Whites. The persistent presence of [vaccine undecided] across different sites and racial/ethnic groups uncovers the need for more public health efforts to influence positive views about vaccination. Conclusion: These findings highlights the urgent need for interventional educational campaigns targeted at populations at risk of low vaccine interest. Focused efforts are needed to combat misinformation and explain vaccine safety and effectiveness to promote its uptake and avoid low inoculation rates. Public health communication must consider differences in population groups, regions, and social determinants of health to fully address vaccine uptake disparities and overcome alleged hesitancy. Key Points -Willingness to receive the SARS CoV-2 varies among minority populations. -[SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy] is more prevalent in the non-Hispanic Black population than the non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations. -Public health infrastructure is needed in underserved communities for efficient assessment and targeted communication of public health priorities such as the SARS CoV-2 vaccination.","Landry, L.; Lee, L.; Meyer, W.; Puckrein, G.; Chalasani, N.; Xu, L.; Stair, T.; Wiltz, G.; Sampson, M.; Gregerson, P.; Barron, C.; Marable, J.; Akinboboye, O.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.06.21264407v1?rss=1,642
177854,Machine learning based solution for predicting voluntary employee turnover in organization,2021,"This study represents a detailed investigation of induced stress detection in humans using Support Vector Machine algorithms. Proper detection of stress can prevent many psychological and physiological problems like the occurrence of major depression disorder (MDD), stress-induced cardiac rhythm abnormalities, or arrhythmia. Stress induced due to COVID -19 pandemic can make the situation worse for the cardiac patients and cause different abnormalities in the normal people due to lockdown condition. Therefore, an ECG based technique is proposed in this paper where the ECG can be recorded for the available handheld/portable devices which are now common to many countries where people can take ECG by their own in their houses and get preliminary information about their cardiac health. From ECG, we can derive RR interval, QT interval, and EDR (ECG derived Respiration) for developing the model for stress detection also. To validate the proposed model, an open-access database named ""drivedb” available at Physionet (physionet.org) was used as the training dataset. After verifying several SVM models by changing the ECG length, features, and SVM Kernel type, the results showed an acceptable level of accuracy for Fine Gaussian SVM (i.e. 98.3% for 1 min ECG and 93.6 % for 5 min long ECG) with Gaussian Kernel while using all available features (RR, QT, and EDR). This finding emphasizes the importance of including ventricular polarization and respiratory information in stress detection and the possibility of stress detection from short length data (i.e. from 1 min ECG data), which will be very useful to detect stress through portable ECG devices in locked down condition to analyze mental health condition without visiting the specialist doctor at hospital. This technique also alarms the cardiac patients from being stressed too much which might cause severe arrhythmogenesis. © 2021 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

In September 2019, a nest of Asian giant hornets was detected outside of Vancouver, British Columbia and in May 2020 an individual was detected nearby in Washington state, indicating that the AGH successfully overwintered in North America. Because hornets tend to spread rapidly and become pests, reliable estimates of the potential invasive range of V. mandarinia in North America are needed to assess likely human and economic impacts, and to guide future eradication attempts. Here, we assess climatic suitability for AGH in North America, and suggest that, without control, this species could establish populations across the Pacific Northwest and much of eastern North America.

In these times of COVID‐19, we have kept a community group for men with learning disabilities going online. In the gaps between lockdowns, we have met in a mixed online and face‐to‐face group—with the face‐to‐face part happening in a library. The men say that they have been helped by both kinds of meeting, but that they liked the mixed or “hybrid” one the best. This article shows what we have learned from running the group in these ways, and it gives advice for anyone who might want to have a go themselves. Social contact and belonging are among the most important keys to health and wellbeing, especially for the most vulnerable during the current global pandemic.This reflective paper describes the authors' efforts to sustain an online version of a well‐established community psychology‐oriented group for men with learning disabilities, in challenging times. Drawing upon the learning disability literature and upon theories from community and embodied‐dialogical psychology, it explores the most salient shared issues, our joint efforts to address them and possible implications for future clinical practice.To take advantage of the discovered benefits of online working, we envisage that, post‐lockdown, the group will continue to meet in a “hybrid” (combined face‐to‐face and online form) as described herein: and with some pointers for anyone who might wish to create a similar group.

178173,Tracking Pandemic-Driven Internet Traffic,2021,"Dendritic cells (DCs) regulate processes ranging from antitumor and antiviral immunity to host-microbe communication at mucosal surfaces. It remains difficult, however, to genetically manipulate human DCs, limiting our ability to probe how DCs elicit specific immune responses. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method for human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that mediates knockouts with a median efficiency of >93% across >300 genes. Using this method, we perform genetic screens in moDCs, identifying mechanisms by which DCs tune responses to lipopolysaccharides from the human microbiome. In addition, we reveal donor-specific responses to lipopolysaccharides, underscoring the importance of assessing immune phenotypes in donor-derived cells, and identify genes that control this specificity, highlighting the potential of our method to pinpoint determinants of inter-individual variation in immune responses. Our work sets the stage for a systematic dissection of the immune signaling at the host-microbiome interface and for targeted engineering of DCs for neoantigen vaccination.","Jost, Marco; Jacobson, Amy N.; Hussmann, Jeffrey A.; Cirolia, Giana; Fischbach, Michael A.; Weissman, Jonathan S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423985,642
178206,Noisy Medical Images Aggregation for Pulmonary Tissue Damage Detection,2021,"Repeating structures forming regular patterns are common in sounds. Learning such patterns may enable accurate perceptual organization. In five experiments, we investigated the behavioral and neural signatures of rapid perceptual learning of regular sound patterns. We show that recurring (compared to novel) patterns are detected more quickly and increase sensitivity to pattern deviations and to the temporal order of pattern onset relative to a visual stimulus. Sustained neural activity reflected perceptual learning in two ways. Firstly, sustained activity increased earlier for recurring than novel patterns when participants attended to sounds, but not when they ignored them; this earlier increase mirrored the rapid perceptual learning we observed behaviorally. Secondly, the magnitude of sustained activity was generally lower for recurring than novel patterns, but only for trials later in the experiment, and independent of whether participants attended to or ignored sounds. The late manifestation of sustained activity reduction suggests that it is not directly related to rapid perceptual learning, but to a mechanism that does not require attention to sound. In sum, we demonstrate that the latency of sustained activity reflects rapid perceptual learning of auditory patterns, while the magnitude may reflect a result of learning, such as better prediction of learned auditory patterns.","Herrmann, Björn; Araz, Kurdo; Johnsrude, Ingrid S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.295568,642

This study aims to determine patients satisfaction with different types of telemedicine services (937 Call Center and Sehha Application) provided by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-section study was conducted to evaluate consumers satisfaction toward telemedicine services in Saudi Arabia. A systematic random sampling method was used to collect consumers from each of the two telemedicine services including 937 medical call center and the Sehha application. Results Two hundred and forty-nine (249) randomly chosen consumers of 937 medical call center and the Sehha application have been answered the predesigned questionnaire about satisfaction towards different items of the two medical services. Among 249 consumers of telemedicine services, 83.14% of them were satisfied in general with medical services compared to 8.03% of consumers who were not satisfied. The satisfaction percentages toward physicians recommendations, communication skills, listening skills, and waiting time were 77.29%, 83.53%, 85.14%, and 67.87% respectively. Conclusion Telemedicine applications are commonly used nowadays in most developed countries and some developing countries in order to maximize the delivery of healthcare to patients with different medical conditions. The overall satisfaction rates toward different telemedicine services in Saudi Arabia were high, and there was no significant difference in concern to the satisfaction rates between 937 medical call center and Sehha application. In general, consumers of telemedicine services were satisfied, and most of them considered advising other people to use them.","Alfaleh, A.; Alkattan, A.; Salah, M.; Almutairi, M.; Sagor, K.; Alageel, A.; Alabdulkareem, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.21259347v1?rss=1,642
178511,Research on the Products That Digitally Popularize and Propagandize,2020,"It has been estimated that more than 390 million people are infected with Dengue virus every year; around 96 millions of these infections result in clinical pathologies. To date, there is only one licensed viral vector-based Dengue virus vaccine CYD-TDV approved for use in dengue endemic areas. While initially approved for administration independent of serostatus, the current guidance only recommends the use of this vaccine for seropositive individuals. Therefore, there is a critical need for investigating the influence of Dengue virus serostatus and immunological mechanisms that influence vaccine outcome. Here, we provide comprehensive evaluation of sero-status and host immune factors that correlate with robust immune responses to a Dengue virus vector based tetravalent vaccine (TV003) in a Phase II clinical cohort of human participants. We observed that sero-positive individuals demonstrate a much stronger immune response to the TV003 vaccine. Our multi-layered immune profiling revealed that sero-positive subjects have increased baseline/pre-vaccination frequencies of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC. Importantly, this baseline/pre-vaccination cTfh profile correlated with the vaccinees’ ability to launch neutralizing antibody response against all four sero-types of Dengue virus, an important endpoint for Dengue vaccine clinical trials. Overall, we provide novel insights into the favorable cTfh related immune status that persists in Dengue virus sero-positive individuals that correlate with their ability to mount robust vaccine specific immune responses. Such detailed interrogation of cTfh cell biology in the context of clinical vaccinology will help uncover mechanisms and targets for favorable immuno-modulatory agents. Author summary Dengue virus (DENV) is a worldwide threat that causes significant health and economic burden. Currently, there are several challenges in the development of a DENV vaccine including the existence of four different serotypes all; capable of causing disease and antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). For complete protection, a vaccine must be able to generate neutralizing antibodies against all 4 serotypes to avoid ADE. Currently, there is one licensed DENV vaccine, CYD-TDV (DENGVAXIATM). However, this vaccine is only efficacious in protecting against severe disease in DENV seropositive individuals therefore serostatus effect must be further studied for optimal vaccine design. A subset of CD4+ T cells called T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been well known to play a major role in aiding high affinity antibody production. Therefore, we chose to look at subsets of Tfh and the cytokines they produce in human blood that can serve as biomarkers for effective vaccine design. We found that DENV sero-positive participants had increased pre-vaccination frequencies of Tfh cells and higher levels of the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC that plays a role in directing antigen-specific responses. This pre-vaccination Tfh profile and CXCL13/BLC are then correlated positively with the vaccinees’ ability to produce neutralizing antibody against all four sero-types (breadth of the Response) of DENV, an important goal for all DENV vaccine trials.","Izmirly, Abdullah M; Pelletier, Adam-Nicolas; Connors, Jennifer; Taramangalam, Bhavani; Alturki, Sawsan O.; Gordon, Emma A.; Alturki, Sana O.; Mell, Joshua C.; Swaminathan, Gokul; Karthik, Vivin; Kutzler, Michele A.; Kallas, Esper G.; Sekaly, Rafick-Pierre; Haddad, Elias K",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.19.456926,642

Methods: In line with recent recommendations, a third dose of either heterologous ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) or homologous BNT162b2 (BioNTech) was administered to 25 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without humoral response after 2 doses of BNT162b2, followed by analysis of serological responses and vaccine-specific B- and T-cell immunity. Results: 9/25 (36%) KTR under standard immunosuppressive treatment seroconverted until day 27 after the third vaccination, while one patient developed severe COVID-19 infection immediately after vaccination. Cellular analysis seven days after the third dose showed significantly elevated frequencies of viral spike protein receptor binding domain specific B cells in humoral responders as compared to non-responders. Likewise, portions of spike-reactive CD4+ T helper cells were significantly elevated in seroconverting patients. Furthermore, overall frequencies of IL-2+, IL-4+ and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells significantly increased after the third dose, whereas memory/effector differentiation remained unaffected. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a fraction of transplant recipients benefits from triple vaccination, where seroconversion is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes of cellular immunity. At the same time, the study highlights that modified vaccination approaches for immunosuppressed patients still remain an urgent medical need.","Schrezenmeier, E.; Rincon-Arevalo, H.; Stefanski, A.-L.; Potekhin, A.; Staub-Hohenbleicher, H.; Choi, M.; Bachmann, F.; Pross, V.; Hammett, C.; Schrezenmeier, H.; Ludwig, C.; Jahrsdoerfer, B.; Lino, A.

Most antiviral treatments used for IAV are only effective if administered during the first 48 hours of infection and antiviral resistance is possible. Therapies that can be initiated later during IAV infection and that are less likely to elicit resistance will significantly improve treatment options. Pyruvate, a key metabolite, and end product of glycolysis, has been studied for many uses, including its anti-inflammatory capabilities. Sodium pyruvate was recently shown by us to decrease inflammasome activation during IAV infection. Here, we investigated sodium pyruvate’s effects on IAV in vivo. We found that nebulizing mice with sodium pyruvate decreased morbidity and weight loss during infection. Additionally, treated mice consumed more chow during infection indicating improved symptoms. There were notable improvements in pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1β) and lower virus titers on days 7 post-infection in mice treated with sodium pyruvate compared to control animals. As pyruvate acts on the host immune response and metabolic pathways and not directly on the virus, our data demonstrate that sodium pyruvate is a promising treatment option that is safe, effective, and unlikely to elicit antiviral resistance.","Reel, Jessica M.; Lupfer, Christopher R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.396978,642

While transfer learning has garnered considerable attention in medical image analysis, its use for clinical non-image data is not well studied. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to explore the use of transfer learning for non-image data in the clinical literature. Methods and Findings We systematically searched medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL) for peer-reviewed clinical studies that used transfer learning on human non-image data. We included 83 studies in the review. More than half of the studies (63%) were published within 12 months of the search. Transfer learning was most often applied to time series data (61%), followed by tabular data (18%), audio (12%) and text (8%). Thirty-three (40%) studies applied an image-based model to non-image data after transforming data into images (e.g. spectrograms). Twenty-nine (35%) studies did not have any authors with a health-related affiliation. Many studies used publicly available datasets (66%) and models (49%), but fewer shared their code (27%). Conclusions In this scoping review, we have described current trends in the use of transfer learning for non-image data in the clinical literature. We found that the use of transfer learning has grown rapidly within the last few years. We have identified studies and demonstrated the potential of transfer learning in clinical research in a wide range of medical specialties. More interdisciplinary collaborations and the wider adaption of reproducible research principles are needed to increase the impact of transfer learning in clinical research.","Ebbehoj, A.; Thunbo, M.; Andersen, O.

179366,Design and implementation of intelligent inspection and alarm flight system for epidemic prevention,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems and research worldwide. Data is collected all over the world and needs to be integrated and made available to other researchers quickly. However, the various heterogeneous information systems that are used in hospitals can result in fragmentation of health data over multiple data 'silos' that are not interoperable for analysis. Consequently, clinical observations in hospitalised patients are not prepared to be reused efficiently and timely. There is a need to adapt the research data management in hospitals to make COVID-19 observational patient data machine actionable, i.e. more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for humans and machines. We therefore applied the FAIR principles in the hospital to make patient data more FAIR. In this paper, we present our FAIR approach to transform COVID-19 observational patient data collected in the hospital into machine actionable digital objects to answer medical doctors' research questions. With this objective, we conducted a coordinated FAIRification among stakeholders based on ontological models for data and metadata, and a FAIR based architecture that complements the existing data management. We applied FAIR Data Points for metadata exposure, turning investigational parameters into a FAIR dataset. We demonstrated that this dataset is machine actionable by means of three different computational activities: federated query of patient data along open existing knowledge sources across the world through the Semantic Web, implementing Web APIs for data query interoperability, and building applications on top of these FAIR patient data for FAIR data analytics in the hospital. Our work demonstrates that a FAIR research data management plan based on ontological models for data and metadata, open Science, Semantic Web technologies, and FAIR Data Points is providing data infrastructure in the hospital for machine actionable FAIR digital objects. This FAIR data is prepared to be reused for federated analysis, linkable to other FAIR data such as Linked Open Data, and reusable to develop software applications on top of them for hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery.","Queralt-Rosinach, N.; Kaliyaperumal, R.; Bernabe, C.

Design: Prospective longitudinal observation. Methods: Twenty adults (median 71 years) with an established diagnosis of glaucoma were issued a tablet-perimeter (Eyecatcher), and were asked to perform one VF home-assessment per eye, per month, for 6 months (12 tests total). Before and after home-monitoring, two VF assessments were performed in-clinic using Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP; 4 tests total, per eye). Results: All 20 participants could perform monthly home-monitoring, though one participant stopped after 4 months (Adherence: 98%). There was good concordance between VFs measured at home and in the clinic (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). In 21 of 236 tests (9%) Mean Deviation deviated by more than {+/-}3 dB from the median. Many of these anomalous tests could be identified by applying machine learning techniques to recordings from the tablets' front-facing camera (Area Under the ROC Curve = 0.78). Adding home-monitoring data to 2 SAP tests made 6 months apart reduced measurement error (between-test measurement variability) in 97% of eyes, with mean absolute error more than halving in 90% of eyes. Median test duration was 4.5 mins (Quartiles: 3.9 - 5.2 mins). Substantial variations in ambient illumination had no observable effect on VF measurements (r = 0.07, P = 0.320).

181191,Automatic Login System for Forehead Temperature Measurement,2021,"Invasive aspergillosis is a fungal respiratory infection that poses an increasingly serious health risk with the rise in the number of immunocompromised patients and the emergence of fungal strains resistant to first-line anti-fungal drugs. Consequently, there is a pressing need for host-centric therapeutics for this infection, which motivated the work presented in this paper. Given the multi-scale nature of the immune response, computational models are a key technology for capturing the dynamics of the battle between the pathogen and the immune system. We describe such a multi-scale computational model, focused on the mechanisms for iron regulation, a key element for fungal virulence in the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. A key feature of the model is that its parameters have been derived from an extensive literature search rather than data fitting. The model is shown to reproduce a wide range of published time course data, as well as custom validation data generated for this purpose. It also accurately reproduces many qualitative features of the initial course of infection. Author summary The battle between the immune system and invading pathogens is highly dynamic, involving mechanisms from the intracellular and tissue scales to the whole-body scale. Medical interventions aim to change the dynamic trajectory of the infection in the patient’s favor. Computational models that capture the system dynamics can play an important role in understanding the mechanisms determining the course of infection and discovering possible interventions. The model described here focuses on a well-defined and complex mechanism, the “battle over iron” between the host and a respiratory fungal pathogen, a crucial virulence factor. It includes several cell types, cytokines, and other molecules involved in the immune response. A key feature of the model is its broad validity, resulting from efforts to find information about numerical values for all of the many model parameters in the literature, rather than determining them by fitting the model to one or more time courses of experimental data. Consequently, the model can form the basis for investigating host-centric interventions in the course of the disease, as well as for expanding it to study other pathogens and inflammatory lung diseases.","Ribeiro, Henrique AL; Vieira, Luis Sordo; Scindia, Yogesh; Adhikari, Bandita; Wheeler, Matthew; Knapp, Adam; Schroeder, William; Mehrad, Borna; Laubenbacher, Reinhard",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447590,642
181215,Development of a Virtual Reality Environment Based on the CoAP Protocol for Teaching Pneumatic Systems,2021,"Online learning is a new trend in Education 4.0. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities to adopt e-learning. As such, entrepreneurship course has turned to use online learning platform in many learning institutions. Student engagement remains as an issue in online learning because the setting in online learning is different from traditional classroom learning. However, online student engagement (OSE) is still considered a relatively new concept and studies are scarcely available. As such, this study aimed to analyze the level of OSE in terms of skills, emotion and participation in entrepreneurship course. It carried out a questionnaire survey to collect the desired information. A total of 290 students from a public university in Malaysia have participated in the survey. Analysis revealed that students demonstrated high level of skill in listening and reading carefully, high level of emotion in putting forth effort in learning and high level of participation in helping fellow students. Overall, participation was rated as the top component in OSE. It can be concluded that student participation played a crucial role in ensuring student engagement in online learning environment. Therefore, building a good rapport and getting to know each other among learners and, designing enjoyable course outline are important in online learning environment. This study enriches the knowledge of important component of OSE and provides suggestions to enhance learners OSE in university. © 2021 Author(s).","Koe, W. L.; Mahphoth, M. H.; Dirgantari, P.

This paper focuses on the shift of a third-year biological and agricultural engineering thermodynamics course that in the past was taught in-person with two lectures and one lab/recitation session per week. In response to the pandemic, the course was delivered via two asynchronous lectures and one required synchronous lab/recitation each week. Both pre- and post-COVID courses consisted of online homework, weekly worksheet assignments, four total exams, and a semester-long humanitarian engineering team project. Student perceptions were evaluated using end-of-semester course evaluation comments and a Likert-style survey based on the Survey of Attitudes Towards Statistics that was modified by replacing “statistics” with “thermodynamics” in the survey’s questions. The results from these different methods were triangulated in order to better understand the effect of transitioning this thermodynamics course to a wholly online delivery mode and to inform future curricular innovations with the goal of enhancing student success. © American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting, ASABE 2021.

181940,An Optimized CNN Model Architecture for Detecting Coronavirus (COVID-19) with X-Ray Images,2022,"The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus has led to more than a pandemic—indeed, COVID-19 is spawning myriad other concerns as it rapidly marches around the globe. One of these concerns is a surge of misinformation, which we argue should be viewed as a risk in its own right, and to which insights from decades of risk communication research must be applied. Further, when the subject of misinformation is itself a risk, as in the case of COVID-19, we argue for the utility of viewing the problem as a multi-layered risk communication problem. In such circumstances, misinformation functions as a meta-risk that interacts with and complicates publics’ perceptions of the original risk. Therefore, as the COVID-19 “misinfodemic” intensifies, risk communication research should inform the efforts of key risk communicators. To this end, we discuss the implications of risk research for efforts to fact-check COVID-19 misinformation and offer practical recommendations.","Krause, Nicole M.; Freiling, Isabelle; Beets, Becca; Brossard, Dominique",J.

181978,Potential of Deep Learning Algorithms in Mitigating the Spread of COVID-19,2022,"After it's inception, COVID-19 has spread rapidly all across the globe. Considering this outbreak, by far, it is the most decisive task to detect early and isolate the patients quickly to contain the spread of this virus. In such cases, artificial intelligence and machine learning or deep learning methods can come to aid. For that purpose, we have conducted a qualitative investigation to inspect 12 off-the-shelf Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures in classifying COVID-19 from CT scan images. Furthermore, a segmentation algorithm for biomedical images - U-Net, is analyzed to evaluate the performance of the CNN models. A publicly available dataset (SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan) containing a total of 2481 CT scan images is employed for the performance evaluation. In terms of feature extraction by excluding the segmentation technique, a performance of 88.60% as the F1 Score and 89.31% as accuracy is achieved by training DenseNet169 architecture. Adopting the U-Net segmentation method, we accomplished the most optimal accuracy and F1 Scores as 89.92% and 89.67% respectively on DenseNet201 model. Furthermore, evaluating the performances, we can affirm that a combination of a Transfer Learning architecture with a segmentation technique (U-Net) enhances the performance of the classification model.","Seum, A.; Raj, A.

182112,Comparative Study and Detection of COVID-19 and Related Viral Pneumonia Using Fine-Tuned Deep Transfer Learning,2022,"COVID-19 pandemic has bought a lot of change in our daily routine. To protect ourselves from getting infected, we need to follow certain precautions. One such safety measures are wearing a face mask. Viruses spread from one person to other respiratory droplets. When an infected person talks, shouts, sneezes or coughs, the droplets land in the mouth or nose of other people who are nearby. So, wearing a face mask over nose and mouth acts as a barrier for preventing the transmission of respiratory droplets. But many people ignore wearing a mask in public areas. It is good to have a system to identify people without masks in public places. This system, when integrated with embedded systems ensures the public safely. Our project aims to detect the people without masks on a video by developing a machine learning algorithm which identifies the person without a face mask. Machine learning is one of the techniques of Artificial Intelligence which is used for extracting valuable knowledge from large databases[1]. We collected the training sets from Kaggle, few open-source libraries and Google consisting of faces with and without a face mask. There are around 1500 images of with and without a face mask. © 2021 IEEE.","Reddy, P. S.; Nandini, M.; Mamatha, E.; Reddy, K.

182231,Deep Learning Based Sentiment Analysis On COVID-19 Public Reviews,2021,"We consider a k-nearest neighbor-based nonparametric lack-of-fit test of constant regression in presence of heteroscedastic variances. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived under the null and local alternatives for a fixed number of nearest neighbors. Advantages of our test compared to classical methods include: (1) The response variable can be discrete or continuous regardless of whether the conditional distribution is symmetric or not and can have variations depending on the predictor. This allows our test to have broad applicability to data from many practical fields;(2) this approach does not need nonlinear regression function estimation that often affects the power for moderate sample sizes;(3) our test statistic achieves the parametric standardizing rate, which gives more power than smoothing-based nonparametric methods for moderate sample sizes. Our numerical simulation shows that the proposed test is powerful and has noticeably better performance than some well known tests when the data were generated from high frequency alternatives or binary data. The test is illustrated with an application to gene expression data and an assessment of Richards growth curve fit to COVID-19 data.

182645,A Cautionary Tale on Using Covid-19 Data for Machine Learning,2021,"Objectives: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been the current global pandemic concern. With a high transmission rate, especially through direct contact, this disease spreads from person to person, and this has in turn led to a huge number of infections on a global scale. Methods: In present study, comparative genomic analysis was performed using 151 gene sequences of the viral spike protein retrieved from NCBI and along with its translated nucleotide sequences using MEGAX software. Variation in the nucleotide and amino acid positions were identified. Results: Our analysis revealed that 22 nucleotide variations observed in positions 13, 141, 162, 233, 284, 328, 455, 459, 716, 773, 784, 882, 1686, 1715, 1749, 1841, 2031, 2076, 2383, 2520, 2533, 3300 and 17 amino acid variations observed in position 5, 54, 78, 90, 95, 152, 153, 239, 258, 262, 572, 583, 614, 684, 677, 795 and 845. Further, phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover the patterns of spread of the virus across the affected countries. Although, certain strains showed patterns of transmission within communities, a vast majority revealed an evident mosaic pattern. Conclusion: The data obtained provides a clear understanding of variations in the nucleotide and translated nucleotide sequences, which can be targeted towards drug designing and to study evolutionary analysis.","Warghane, A.; Petkar, T.; Preeyaa, S.

188569,Turning over a new leaf.,2000,"A novel coronavirus (SCoV) is the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Site-specific proteolysis plays a critical role in regulating a number of cellular and viral processes. Since the main protease of SCoV, also termed 3C-like protease, is an attractive target for drug therapy, we have developed a safe, simple, and rapid genetic screen assay to monitor the activity of the SCoV 3C-like protease. This genetic system is based on the bacteriophage lambda regulatory circuit, in which the viral repressor cI is specifically cleaved to initiate the lysogenic-to-lytic switch. A specific target for the SCoV 3C-like protease, P1/P2 (SAVLQ/SGFRK), was inserted into the lambda phage cI repressor. The target specificity of the SCoV P1/P2 repressor was evaluated by coexpression of this repressor with a chemically synthesized SCoV 3C-like protease gene construct. Upon infection of Escherichia coli cells containing the two plasmids encoding the cI. SCoV P1/P2-cro and the beta-galactosidase-SCoV 3C-like protease constructs, lambda phage replicated up to 2,000-fold more efficiently than in cells that did not express the SCoV 3C-like protease. This simple and highly specific assay can be used to monitor the activity of the SCoV 3C-like protease, and it has the potential to be used for screening specific inhibitors.","Parera, Mariona; Clotet, Bonaventura; Martinez, Miguel Angel",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564515/,642

Participants (N = 268) were current U.S. residents over the age of 18 who completed an online survey about their perceptions of COVID-19 messaging in general as well as toward a specific COVID-19 message they recalled. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that perceived freedom threat toward a COVID-19 message was predicted positively by message fatigue and negatively by issue importance. Greater perceived freedom threat was linked to greater reactance, which in turn was associated with lower levels of adherence to hygiene- and social-related COVID-19 preventive behavior. Notably, the negative association between reactance and social-related adherence was stronger than that between reactance and hygiene-related adherence.

Objective: To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. Exposures: COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity. Results: A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared. The findings should alert pregnant individuals and clinicians to implement strictly all the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures.","Villar, José; Ariff, Shabina; Gunier, Robert B; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Rauch, Stephen; Kholin, Alexey; Roggero, Paola; Prefumo, Federico; do Vale, Marynéa Silva; Cardona-Perez, Jorge Arturo; Maiz, Nerea; Cetin, Irene; Savasi, Valeria; Deruelle, Philippe; Easter, Sarah Rae; Sichitiu, Joanna; Soto Conti, Constanza P; Ernawati, Ernawati; Mhatre, Mohak; Teji, Jagjit Singh; Liu, Becky; Capelli, Carola; Oberto, Manuela; Salazar, Laura; Gravett, Michael G; Cavoretto, Paolo Ivo; Nachinab, Vincent Bizor; Galadanci, Hadiza; Oros, Daniel; Ayede, Adejumoke Idowu; Sentilhes, Loïc; Bako, Babagana; Savorani, Mónica; Cena, Hellas; García-May, Perla K; Etuk, Saturday; Casale, Roberto; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Ikenoue, Satoru; Aminu, Muhammad Baffah; Vecciarelli, Carmen; Duro, Eduardo A; Usman, Mustapha Ado; John-Akinola, Yetunde; Nieto, Ricardo; Ferrazi, Enrico; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A; Langer, Ana; Kennedy, Stephen H; Papageorghiou, Aris T",JAMA pediatr.

While time-for-adaptation theory defines whether or not water scarcity can be considered as disturbance, the stress-dominance theory predicts an increase in importance of environmental filtering and a decrease in the role of biotic interactions in communities with increasing environmental stress. Here, we tested whether environmental filtering (leading to trait convergence) or limiting similarity (leading to trait divergence) is the main assembly rule shaping the structure and trait composition of benthic diatom assemblages in Mediterranean (Portuguese) and continental (Hungarian) temporary and perennial streams. We assumed that the trait composition of diatom assemblages in the two stream types would be less different in the Mediterranean than in the continental region (addressed to time-for-adaptation theory). We also hypothesized that trait composition would be shaped by environmental filtering in the Hungarian streams while by biotic interactions in Portuguese streams (addressed to stress-dominance theory). Our results supported our first hypothesis since traits, which associated primarily to temporary streams were found only in the continental region. Our findings, however, only partially proved the stress-dominance hypothesis. In the continental region, where drying up of streams were induced by unpredictable droughts, biotic interactions were the main assembly rules shaping community structure. In contrast, environmental filtering was nearly as important as limiting similarity in structuring trait composition in the Mediterranean region during the predictable dry phase with no superficial flow. These analyses also highlighted that drought events (both predictable and unpredictable ones) have a complex and strong influence on benthic diatom assemblages resulting even in irreversible changes in trait composition and thereby in ecosystem functioning.","Várbíró, Gábor; Borics, Gábor; Novais, Maria Helena; Morais, Maria Manuela; Rimet, Frédéric; Bouchez, Agnès; Tapolczai, Kálmán; Bácsi, István; Usseglio-Polatera, Philippe; B-Béres, Viktória",Sci Total Environ,,642

211012,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) X-Ray Film Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network,2021,"AIM: To analyze the prevalence of Burnout defined by the MBI-GS among Italian nursing staff during the COVID-19 emergency. INTRODUCTION: The recent health emergency which in the first half of 2020 has seen Italy involved in the management of patients with COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19), has led to further stress for hospitals both in terms of beds and in terms of workload for healthcare workers. METHOD: A multicenter study was conducted. A convenience sample of 208 nurses participated in the study. Between March 20 and July 20, 2020, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) questionnaire was made available online by using the Google Forms platform in order to detect and measure the severity of Burnout Syndrome (BOS). RESULTS: BOS-related symptoms (medium or high score) for individual MBI-GS domains were identified in at least 68% of nurses. One hundred and sixty-one nurses (77.4%) had a risk of emotional exhaustion, 143 (68.7%) of depersonalization, and 162 (77.9%) of reduced professional accomplishment. High risk was observed among nurses who managed COVID patients at their own operating unit (RR = 1.27, p = 0.016). Severe BOS risk was observed in 146 nurses analyzed (70.2%) with an increased risk among Intensive Care nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the nurses during the coronavirus pandemic, had high levels of work-related suffering and were at risk of physical and emotional exhaustion. Further research should be undertaken to establish causal relationships between BOS and personal and environmental risk factors among healthcare professionals in relation to the COVID-19.","Damico, Vincenzo; Murano, Liana; Demoro, Giuseppe; Russello, Giuseppe; Cataldi, Giusy; D039,; Alessandro, Antonella",Prof Inferm,,642

213601,Research on Computer Integrated Manufacturing Plate Development Based on Factor Analysis,2020,"Near real-time monitoring of outbreak transmission dynamics and evaluation of public health interventions are critical for interrupting the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and mitigating morbidity and mortality caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Formulating a regional mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and frequently estimating parameters of this model using streaming surveillance data offers one way to accomplish data-driven decision making. For example, to detect an increase in new SARS-CoV-2 infections due to relaxation of previously implemented mitigation measures one can monitor estimates of the basic and effective reproductive numbers. However, parameter estimation can be imprecise, and sometimes even impossible, because surveillance data are noisy and not informative about all aspects of the mechanistic model, even for reasonably parsimonious epidemic models. To overcome this obstacle, at least partially, we propose a Bayesian modeling framework that integrates multiple surveillance data streams. Our model uses both COVID-19 incidence and mortality time series to estimate our model parameters. Importantly, our data generating model for incidence data takes into account changes in the total number of tests performed. We apply our Bayesian data integration method to COVID-19 surveillance data collected in Orange County, California. Our results suggest that California Department of Public Health stay-at-home order, issued on March 19, 2020, lowered the SARS-CoV-2 effective reproductive number $R_{e}$ in Orange County below 1.0, which means that the order was successful in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, subsequent""re-opening""steps took place when thousands of infectious individuals remained in Orange County, so $R_{e}$ increased to approximately 1.0 by mid-June and above 1.0 by mid-July.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Bayer, Damon; Goldstein, Isaac; Lumbard, Keith; Ricotta, Emily; Warner, Sarah; Busch, Lindsay M.; Strich, Jeffrey R.; Chertow, Daniel S.; Parker, Daniel M.; Boden-Albala, Bernadette; Dratch, Alissa; Chhuon, Richard; Quick, Nichole; Zahn, Matthew; Minin, Vladimir N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02654v1.pdf,642
214403,"TruthBot: An Automated Conversational Tool for Intent Learning, Curated Information Presenting, and Fake News Alerting",2021-01-31,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, including Canada, have made use of public health measures such as COVID-19 quarantine to reduce the transmission of the virus. To examine associations between these periods of quarantine and mental health, including suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm, we examined data from a national survey of 3000 Canadian adults distributed between May 14-29, 2020. Notably, participants provided the reason(s) for quarantine. When pooling all reasons for quarantine together, this experience was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm in the two weeks preceding the survey. These associations remained even after controlling for age, household income, having a pre-existing mental health condition, being unemployed due to the pandemic, and living alone. However, the associations with mental health differed across reasons for quarantine; those who were self-isolating specifically due to recent travel were not found to have higher odds of suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm. Our research suggests the importance of accounting for the reason(s) for quarantine in the implementation of this critical public health measure to reduce the mental health impacts of this experience.","Daly, Zachary; Slemon, Allie; Richardson, Chris G; Salway, Travis; McAuliffe, Corey; Gadermann, Anne M; Thomson, Kimberly C; Hirani, Saima; Jenkins, Emily K",Psychiatry Res,,642

Methods: The main active ingredients of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction (Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Amomun kravanh Pierre ex Gagnep, and Coicis Semen) were obtained and screened from by TCMSP and TCMID V2.0, combined with related research. Using UniPort database to query the target proteins corresponding to the active ingredients, then a component-target network was constructed by Cytoscape 3.7.2. PPI network was constructed through the STRING website, and cytoHubba was used to analysis the key subnetworks. CTD database was used to analyze GO and KEGG enrichment of the active ingredient target proteins of Sanren Decoction. Using the active ingredients of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction and related chemical drugs such as lopinavir as ligands, molecular docking with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase was performed through the CB-Dock website. Results: Sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction had 39 active ingredients, corresponding to 168 target proteins. The GO enrichment analysis obtained 25 biological processes (BP) items, 14 related items of cell composition (CC), and two molecular function (MF) item, respectively. KEGG enrichment screened 36 signaling pathways such as innate immune system, cytokine signaling in immune system, signaling by interleukins. The molecular docking results suggested that the active ingredients of mairin, ziziphin_qt, and oleanolic acid of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction had good binding energy with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase, and the Vina score of them were similar to those of lopinavir (the 3CLpro inhibitor) and remdesivir (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor). Conclusion: Sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction may participate in inflammation-related signaling pathways by regulating inflammatory factors, regulating multiple physiological processes of the disease with multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-pathways.

217715,Secure and Provenance Enhanced Internet of Health Things Framework: A Blockchain Managed Federated Learning Approach,2020,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is an extremely common hospital complication. No study to date has assessed whether a priori defined covariates; type of hospital setting and year of study publication, influence the relationship between delirium and mortality. This is also the first study to examine the longitudinal trend of delirium-associated mortality over recent decades, to analyse the trajectory of our efforts in combating this disease. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, were searched from January 1981 to May 2018 for English-language primary articles. Rigorous title and abstract screen and full-text screen were conducted independently by two reviewers. This paper adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data was extracted independently by one reviewer using standardised data-collection sheets, with a separate reviewer verifying for accuracy. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Unadjusted effect sizes and event counts were analysed with a random effects model in primary meta-analysis and meta-regression, whereas a mixed effect model was used in secondary sub-group analysis. Mortality data at longest follow-up and cumulative mortality (hospital mortality combined with mortality at longest follow-up) data were analysed. RESULTS: As part of a larger project, 446 of 6790 articles were retrieved, including 71 studies that measured mortality. Our results demonstrate that elderly inpatients with delirium had significantly greater odds of mortality (OR 3.18 [95%CI: 2.73, 3.70]) compared to non-delirious controls. Patients with delirium in the ICU had the highest odds for mortality (OR: 7.09 [95%CI: 3.60, 14.0]); double the risk compared to the average. Curiously, despite advancements in delirium research, delirium associated in-hospital odds of mortality has not changed in 30 years. CONCLUSION: This is the largest meta-analysis to confirm the association between delirium and mortality, in older (age &#8805; 65) hospital inpatients. The current meta-analysis highlights the significant odds of mortality after an episode of delirium, and these odds are much higher for ICU patients. However, in contrast to other medical conditions that have seen a decrease in associated mortality over the past few decades, delirium associated mortality remains unchanged. These findings underscore the urgent need for better delirium treatments.

Demographic information collected and analysed were patient age, gender, referral source and presenting complaint.Results In total, 220 photographic referrals were received, with swelling (30%) and dental trauma (27%) being the most common presenting complaints. Fifty-seven percent of the referrals were not seen, 23% were seen semi-urgently and 20% booked for outpatient review. Of those seen, seven children were examined elsewhere, with 44 receiving face-to-face consultations at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, with eight being admitted.Conclusions Photographic triage has potential to be a useful adjunctive assessment tool for new patient referrals, with secondary benefits for training junior staff and for populations who already find access to dental services challenging. Feasibility studies on the application should be seriously considered. However, the unique circumstances which resulted in the development of a photographic triage method need to be considered when generalising its use to normal working conditions.","Thomas, Nicole",Evid Based Dent,,642

219542,Federated Learning from Small Datasets,2021-10-07,"OBJECTIVES: This paper seeks to provide a brief overview of epidemics and pandemics in Irish history and to identify any lessons that might be useful in relation to psychiatry in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A review of selected key reports, papers and publications related to epidemics and pandemics in Irish history was conducted. RESULTS: Viruses, epidemics and pandemics are recurring features of human history. Early Irish sources record a broad array of plagues, pandemics and epidemics including bubonic plague, typhus, cholera, dysentery and smallpox, as well as an alleged epidemic of insanity in the 19th century (that never truly occurred). Like the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-20), COVID-19 (a new coronavirus) presents both the challenge of the illness itself and the problems caused by the anxiety that the virus triggers. Managing this anxiety has always been a challenge, especially with the Spanish flu. People with mental illness had particularly poor outcomes with the Spanish flu, often related to the large, unhygienic mental hospitals in which so many were housed. CONCLUSIONS: Even today, a full century after the Spanish flu pandemic, people with mental illness remain at increased risk of poor physical health, so it is imperative that multi-disciplinary care continues during the current outbreak of COVID-19, despite the manifest difficulties involved. The histories of previous epidemics and pandemics clearly demonstrate that good communication and solidarity matter, now more than ever, especially for people with mental illness.","Kelly, B D",Ir J Psychol Med,,642

RESULTS: Significant decreases in seizures involving marijuana (ß = -0.03, P = 0.005) and methamphetamine (ß = -0.02, P = 0.026) were detected through April 2020, and then seizures of marijuana (ß = 0.10, P = 0.028) and methamphetamine (ß = 0.11, P = 0.010) significantly increased through September 2020. The number of seizures involving marijuana and methamphetamine peaked in August 2020, exceeding the highest pre-COVID-19 number of seizures. Fentanyl seizures increased overall (ß = 0.05, P < .001), but did not significantly drop during the start of COVID-19, and significant changes were not detected for cocaine or heroin. We also detected a significant increase in weight of marijuana seized from April through September 2020 (ß = 0.40, P = .001). The weight of marijuana seized in August 2020 exceeded the highest pre-COVID-19 weight. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an immediate decrease in marijuana and methamphetamine seizures, and then increases throughout 2020 with some months exceeding the number (and weights) of seizures from the previous year. More research is warranted to determine the extent to which these seizures reflect changes in drug use.","Palamar, Joseph J; Le, Austin; Carr, Thomas H; Cottler, Linda B",Drug Alcohol Depend,,642
221297,Investigating the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India under lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: The adoption of health care restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of elective surgical care. However, the impact on patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychological and economic impact of the cancellation of scheduled spinal operations. METHODS: We identified 50 patients with cancelled surgeries between 16 March 2020 and 24 April 2020. Forty-nine (98%) participants were contacted, with whom the modified WES-Pi questionnaire was filled in during a telephone interview. RESULTS: Of the 49 respondents, 28 (57.2%) were aged <65 years. The most often reported problem (85.7%) was an ongoing limitation in basic daily activities. At least moderate sadness was experienced by 65.3% and disappointment by 73.5% of the patients. More than 80% reported concerns about the continuation and 73.5% about the progression of their symptoms. Out of 27 employees (55.1%), 63% could not work due to severe pain or movement limitation (p < .001). The inability to work was associated with anger (p = .037). The work-related impact of the cancellation was associated with stress (p < .0001) and concerns about continuing the symptoms (p = .004). Two-third of patients would undergo immediate surgery despite the current epidemic situation. CONCLUSIONS: The cancellations of elective spinal surgeries have a serious psychological impact on patients. This together with potential economic consequences is especially evident in employees unable to work due to pain or movement disability. The information is beneficial for health management. Every effort should be made to resume planned surgical treatment if the epidemiological situation allows it.","Kaiser, Radek; Svoboda, Norbert; Waldauf, Petr; Netuka, David",Br J Neurosurg,,642

223909,A possible conceptualization of the information systems (IS) artifact: A general systems theory perspective1,2020,"Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized for emergency use. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.","Goel, Rishi R; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Painter, Mark M; Mathew, Divij; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kuthuru, Oliva; Gouma, Sigrid; Hicks, Philip; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Dysinger, Sarah; Lundgreen, Kendall A; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Adamski, Sharon; Hicks, Amanda; Korte, Scott; Oldridge, Derek A; Baxter, Amy E; Giles, Josephine R; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D039,; Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T; Betts, Michael R; Luning Prak, Eline T; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E; Greenplate, Allison R; Wherry, E John",Sci. immunol,,642

This behavior is difficult to model analytically and is most often modeled numerically. Such networks form an important part of the structure of society, including transportation networks. As society fights to control the COVID-19 pandemic, an important question is to choose the optimum balance between the full opening of transport networks and the control of epidemic spread. In this paper we investigate how recent advances in analyzing network structure using information theory could inform decisions regarding the opening of such networks. By virtue of the richness of data available we focus upon the worldwide airline network, but these methods are in principle applicable to any transport network. We are able to demonstrate that it is possible to substantially open the airline network and have some degree of control on the spread of the virus.","Harper, Robert; Tee, Philip",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15036v1.pdf,642

226441,The expanding role of immersive media in education,2020,"Surface chemistry is known to influence the formation, composition, and electroactivity of electron-conducting biofilms. However, understanding of the evolution of microbial composition during biofilm development and its impact on the electrochemical response is limited. Here we present voltammetric, microscopic and microbial community analysis of biofilms formed under fixed applied potential for modified graphite electrodes during early (90 h) and mature (340 h) growth phases. Electrodes modified to introduce hydrophilic groups (-NH2, -COOH and -OH) enhance early-stage biofilm formation compared to unmodified or electrodes modified with hydrophobic groups (-C2H5). In addition, early-stage films formed on hydrophilic electrodes are dominated by the gram-negative sulfur-reducing bacterium Desulfuromonas acetexigens while Geobacter sp. dominates on -C2H5 and unmodified electrodes. As biofilms mature, current generation becomes similar, and D. acetexigens dominates in all biofilms irrespective of surface chemistry. Electrochemistry of pure culture D. acetexigens biofilms reveal that this microbe is capable of forming electroactive biofilms producing considerable current density of > 9 A/m2 in a short period of potential-induced growth (~19 h following inoculation) using acetate as an electron donor. The inability of D. acetexigens biofilms to use H2 as a sole source electron donor for current generation shows promise for maximizing H2 recovery in single-chambered microbial electrolysis cell systems treating wastewaters.","Katuri, Krishna P; Kamireddy, Sirisha; Kavanagh, Paul; Muhammad, Ali; Conghaile, Peter Ó; Kumar, Amit; Saikaly, Pascal E; Leech, Dónal",Water Res,,642

The speed of reaction for the completion of the transformation adds an extra element that burdens even more, this huge task. This process starts with the conjointly work of the hospital authorities and involves as well all the medical staff and health personnel trained in the diagnostic and treatment of the infected patients, which can reach a critical point in the developing of the disease. The launching of this process begins with the recount of the available resources, continuing with de transformation of hospital beds that were intended for other purposes to function as Intensive Therapy beds along with ventilatory support, besides making sure the participation of prepared health staff and enough medical supplies. In the pandemic development nowadays in our country the detection of the issues and the decision making should be made accordingly to the constant changes of this huge threat.","Mendoza-Popoca, Cecilia Úrsula; Suárez-Morales, Mario",Rev.

228768,Nurse's Achilles Heel: Using Big Data to Determine Workload Factors That Impact Near Misses,2021,"Medical practice has changed profoundly over the past 60 years. Many changes have also been made in medical education, often with a view to countering adverse aspects of highly specialised, commercialised and bureaucratised modern medical practice. Regardless of the state of the world today and of the variety of changes that may occur in the years ahead, excellence in the application of bedside skills and technological advances, accompanied by excellence in humanistic aspects of caring for patients as people, will remain preeminent goals at the heart of medical practice. Powerful social forces that negatively influence practice cannot be counteracted through changes in medical education alone and need to be addressed directly within health systems. Shifting healthcare towards a valued social service is arguably essential for improving both public and individual health through more widespread universal access to high quality and effectively integrated health care.","Benatar, Solomon; Daneman, Denis",Glob Public Health,,642

METHODS: A cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients at the Ilam University of Medical Sciences was analyzed. Logistic regression models were performed to identify the potential role of NLR in determining the prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The total number of in-hospital mortality was 43/328 (13.1%). Multivariate analysis identified that there was a 26% higher risk of in-hospital death for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; p = 0.0147).

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6 patients (age ≤18 years) with laboratory confirmed 19 coronavirus infection in cancer patients. All diagnosed with acute leukemia (5 myeloid and 1 lymphoid recurrence) and 5 patients (83,3%) with oncological diagnosis and COVID-19 performed concomitantly. The diagnosis was made by realtime reverse transcription polymerase tests for SARS-CoV-2 in 6 children and serology in only 1 child. All presented hypoxemia with indication for oxygen therapy and 3 (50%) required mechanical ventilation. The association between the reduction in respiratory support and negative water balance was evident in 100% of cases. RESULTS: Patients who were already undergoing chemotherapy, maintained their treatment and those newly diagnosed were included in cancer protocols established worldwide. All patients had elevated CRP, D-Dimer and Ferritin, in addition to chest CT with ground glass;5 collected Il6 and all showed high values. Noted that children who used only oxygen therapy tolerated its supply and suspension after about 1-2 days of negative water balance while patients who used mechanical ventilation tolerated its withdrawal after 3-4 days of negative water balance.

The present study aimed to examine the effects of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions and OCD severity on suicidal ideation by considering the role of stress responses in reaction to COVID-19 in a clinical sample of patients with OCD. In a cross-sectional study, 304 patients with OCD completed measures of OC symptom dimensions, OCD severity, general mental health (depression and anxiety), and COVID-19-related stress. Results showed that after controlling for depression, anxiety, comorbidity, and lifetime suicide attempts, the OC symptom dimensions of responsibility for harm and unacceptable obsessional thoughts as well as general severity had indirect effects on suicidal ideation through the specific stress responses to COVID-19, including traumatic stress and compulsive checking. The study shows that OCD patients with specific OC symptom dimensions and severe OCD are more likely to have suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Further, the specific stress responses to COVID-19 may be an underlying mechanism. Clinicians should carefully assess suicidal ideation in patients with OCD who experience responsibility for harm and unacceptable thoughts, particularly during the pandemic.","Khosravani, Vahid; Samimi Ardestani, Seyed Mehdi; Sharifi Bastan, Farangis; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G",Clin. psychol. psychother,,642
236256,Digital and distributed project management in mechanical engineering studies - A case study,2021,"Successful emergency vaccination campaigns rely on effective deployment and vaccination plans. This applies to localised outbreaks as well as for pandemics. In the wake of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, analysis of the global Vaccine Deployment Initiative, through which the World Health Organization (WHO) donated pandemic influenza vaccines to countries in need, revealed that an absence of vaccine deployment plans in many countries significantly hindered vaccine deployment. Through the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2011, WHO is engaging in several capacity building activities to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and response and make provisions for access to vaccines and sharing of other benefits. The Framework calls for the development and exercise of operational plans for deployment of influenza vaccines to enhance pandemic preparedness. To this end, WHO has supported the development of PIPDeploy, an interactive, in-person table top simulation exercise to facilitate learning for emergency preparedness. It employs various game design elements including a game board, time pressure, leaderboards and teams to enhance participants' motivation. PIPDeploy formed part of five WHO Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Deployment Workshops attended by national-level managers responsible for pandemic influenza vaccine response predominantly in non-producing countries. The purpose of this study was to describe the features and application of PIPDeploy, and present findings of the evaluation of participants' experiences during the simulation involving a ""hot wash"" discussion and collection of quantitative data. The simulation's instructional approach was widely accepted by participants, who reported that the format was novel and engaging. They reflected on its utility for identifying gaps in their own vaccine deployment plans and regulatory frameworks for importation of vaccine products. All participants found the simulation relevant to their professional objectives. A range of other potential applications were suggested, including PIPDeploy's adaptation to sub-national contexts and to other epidemic diseases.","Ghiga, Ioana; Richardson, Sol; Álvarez, Alba Maria Ropero; Kato, Masaya; Naidoo, Dhamari; Otsu, Satoko; Nguyen, Phuc Thi; Nguyen, Phuong Nam; Nguyen, Tim",Vaccine,,642

INTRODUCTION: According to data collected by the World Health Organization, by the autumn of 2020, all regions of the world were affected by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. In Hungary, the first cases were detected in March 2020, and the epidemic, among several other patient rights issues, drew attention to the paramount importance of patient information, its compliance with the law, and the difficulties encountered in its application. During the last decades, the possibility of male partner involvement in birth has become increasingly popular in the process of family planning and starting a life together. Preparing fathers for childbirth and coordinating information restrictions that have changed due to the epidemic is a priority for obstetric departments. The full application of patient information requires a number of considerations to ensure that childbirth remains a positive memory for mother and father, even in a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to analyze how the obstetric wards in Hungary were able to comply with the laws and procedures in force at the time of the pandemic, what measures became necessary for creating male partner involvement in births, and at the same time to ensure that the rights of the mother and the father are not violated. METHOD: We sent an online questionnaire to the head of the obstetrics department of all Hungarian state hospitals and clinics, using 14 multiple-choice questions. The data of the received questionnaires were also compared with the information related to male partner involvement in births published on the websites of the institutions. RESULTS: In the period from 20 March to 20 September 2020, in terms of informing pregnant couples, the service providers always followed the procedures in force, but in several cases this meant more financial expenditure and organization for them. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that those who give birth insist on the best possible information about conditions of male partner involvement in births, have the same expectations about the conditions of childbirth as during the epidemic-free period. If the information is satisfactory and detailed for them, they are more tolerant of adverse changes. In view of the epidemic, the possibility of father involvement in birth remained in all departments available, while maintaining appropriate epidemiological measures.

Eighty percent of this highly marginalized population is concentrated in Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. Health care services for these ethnic groups face distinct challenges in view of their high levels of marginalization and cultural differences from the majority. Drawing on 30 years of work on the responses of health systems in the indigenous communities of Latin America, our group of researchers believes that countries in the region must be prepared to combat the epidemic in indigenous settings marked by deprivation and social disparity. We discuss four main challenges that need to be addressed by governments to guarantee the health and lives of those at the bottom of the social structure: the indigenous peoples in the region. More than an analysis, our work provides a practical guide for designing and implementing a response to COVID-19 in indigenous communities.","Meneses-Navarro, Sergio; Freyermuth-Enciso, María Graciela; Pelcastre-Villafuerte, Blanca Estela; Campos-Navarro, Roberto; Meléndez-Navarro, David Mariano; Gómez-Flores-Ramos, Liliana",Int J Equity Health,,642

One of the most frequent causes of death from SARS-CoV-2 is fatal pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date (as of April 2, 2020), other than supportive measures, there are no efficient therapeutic options for COVID-19-related ARDS, although the US Food and Drug Administration recently granted emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychoroquine/chloroquine for this indication (which is usually given with azithromycin). Although the pathogenesis for ARDS is under investigation, one of the major culprits is considered to be cytokine storm, especially from interleukin 6 (IL-6) release. Herein, we review potential use of IL-6 inhibitors, several of which are approved for other disease conditions, as potential novel treatment for the management of COVID-19-related ARDS.","Kato, S.; Kurzrock, R.",Journal Of Immunotherapy And Precision Oncology,,642

These shortages catalyzed local efforts to use nontraditional, rapid manufacturing to meet urgent healthcare needs. Here we present a crisis-responsive design framework designed to assist with product development under pandemic conditions. The framework emphasizes stakeholder engagement, comprehensive but efficient needs assessment, rapid manufacturing, and modified product testing to enable accelerated development of healthcare products. We contrast this framework with traditional medical device manufacturing that proceeds at a more deliberate pace, discuss strengths and weakness of pandemic-responsive fabrication, and consider relevant regulatory policies. We highlight the use of the crisis-responsive framework in a case study of face shield design and production for a large US academic hospital. Finally, we make recommendations aimed at improving future resilience to pandemics and healthcare emergencies. These include continued development of open source designs suitable for rapid manufacturing, education of maker communities and hospital administrators about rapidly-manufactured medical devices, and changes in regulatory policy that help strike a balance between quality and innovation.","Antonini, M.

241921,An application of deep-learning techniques to face mask detection during the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Recent evidence shows that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sensitive to interferons (IFNs). However, the most effective types of IFNs and the underlying antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which preferentially targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences, restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further demonstrate that ZAP and its cofactors KHNYN and TRIM25 are expressed in human lung cells. Type I, II, and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Comprehensive sequence analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from horseshoe bats showed the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Nevertheless, endogenous ZAP expression restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells, particularly upon treatment with IFN-&#945; or IFN-Î³. Both the long and the short isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression levels, but the former did so with greater efficiency. Finally, we show that the ability to restrict SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in ZAP orthologues of the reservoir bat and potential intermediate pangolin hosts of human coronaviruses. Altogether, our results show that ZAP is an important effector of the innate response against SARS-CoV-2, although this pandemic pathogen emerged from zoonosis of a coronavirus that was preadapted to the low-CpG environment in humans.IMPORTANCE Although interferons inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and have been evaluated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most effective types and antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that IFN-Î³ is particularly potent in restricting SARS-CoV-2 and in inducing expression of the antiviral factor ZAP in human lung cells. Knockdown experiments revealed that endogenous ZAP significantly restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further show that CpG dinucleotides which are specifically targeted by ZAP are strongly suppressed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and that the two closest horseshoe bat relatives of SARS-CoV-2 show the lowest genomic CpG content of all coronavirus sequences available from this reservoir host. Nonetheless, both the short and long isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, and this activity was conserved in horseshoe bat and pangolin ZAP orthologues. Our findings indicating that type II interferon is particularly efficient against SARS-CoV-2 and that ZAP restricts this pandemic viral pathogen might promote the development of effective immune therapies against COVID-19.","Nchioua, Rayhane; Kmiec, Dorota; Müller, Janis A; Conzelmann, Carina; Groß, Rüdiger; Swanson, Chad M; Neil, Stuart J D; Stenger, Steffen; Sauter, Daniel; Münch, Jan; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Kirchhoff, Frank",mBio (Online),,642

In the United States and Europe the mortality rate of elderly patients with COVID-19 is greater than 30%. Our aim is to determine predictors of COVID-19 related hospitalization and severity of disease among elderly Medicare patients in the United States. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including elderly Medicare COVID-19 patients across eight states. We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health record, demographic, clinical and echocardiographic predictors. Our primary outcomes were hospitalization and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our secondary outcome was mortality. Results: We identified 400 COVID-19 positive patients (incidence 5.2; (95% CI 4.7-5.7) per 1000 patients). The mean age of our patients was 72+/-8, 60% were female, 82% were minorities and had a mean Charlson score of 2.9+/-1.4. Two-hundred and forty-four patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (63%) and the mortality rate was 18%; 95% CI 14-22 with 1 patient still in the hospital. Age, socioeconomic status, Charlson score, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction, moderate or severe left ventricular hypertrophy were significant predictors of hospitalization and ARDS (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our study reports a lower incidence on a COVID-19 cohort than previously reported. Predictors of poor outcomes included socio-economic, cardiovascular risk and echocardiographic measures. High touch care with early cardiovascular risk factor modification could explain the low risk of events in our population.","Ghany, Reyan; Palacio, Ana; Chen, Gordon; Dawkins, Elissa; McCarter, Daniel; Forbes, Emancia; Chung, Brian; Tamariz, Leonardo",Am J Prev Cardiol,,642

Storing the carefully optimised positions of known data creates a lossless compression problem on sparse and often scattered binary images. This central issue is crucial for the performance of such codecs. Since it has only received little attention in the literature, we conduct the first systematic investigation of this problem so far. To this end, we first review and compare a wide range of existing methods from image compression and general purpose coding in terms of their coding efficiency and runtime. Afterwards, an ablation study enables us to identify and isolate the most useful components of existing methods. With context mixing, we combine those ingredients into new codecs that offer either better compression ratios or a more favourable trade-off between speed and performance.","Mohideen, Rahul Mohideen Kaja; Peter, Pascal; Weickert, Joachim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13634v3.pdf,642

The present work introduces an innovative and high-yield microrecycling strategy to simultaneous synthesis of TM alloy (i.e., Ni-based superalloy) and RE oxide (REO) nanostructures from obsolete Ni-MH batteries mixed with zinc-rich electric arc furnace dust (EAFD). This strategy involves integration of high-temperature thermal isolation followed by thermal nanowiring techniques. The impure thermally-isolated REOs were purified and transformed into one dimensional (1D) nanorods of hybrid REOs. Besides, during high-temperature thermal isolation, defect-rich ZnO with tailored structures of nanorods and nanoribbons were fabricated using controllable vapour deposition. The electrochemical performance of ZnO nanoribbons for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) revealed a considerable overpotential reduction of 131 mV (18%) compared to pure commercial nano-ZnO. This approach is transformational in providing a scalable and cost-effective pathway to facilitate recycling of the challenging, yet critical, waste materials into functional nanostructures for energy and environmental applications.","Maroufi, Samane; Nekouei, Rasoul Khayyam; Mofarah, Sajjad S; Sahajwalla, Veena",J Hazard Mater,,642

The number of kidney transplants has declined during the pandemic. We describe our deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) experience during the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the safety of DDKT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple preventive measures were implemented. Adult patients that underwent DDKT from 3/1/20 to 4/30/20 were included. COVID-19 clinical manifestations from donors and recipients, and post-transplant outcomes (COVID-19 infections, readmissions, allograft rejection, and mortality) were obtained. The kidney transplant (KT) recipients were followed until 5/31/20. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients received kidneys from 57 donors. Fever, dyspnea, and cough were reported in 1, 2, and 1 donor, respectively. Thirty-eight (66.6%) donors were tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) prior to donation (mainly by nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and 36 (47.3%) KT recipients were tested at the time of DDKT by nasopharyngeal PCR; all of these were negative. Our recipients were followed for a median of 63 (range: 33-91) days. A total of 42 (55.3%) recipients were tested post-transplant for SARS-CoV2 by nasopharyngeal PCR including 12 patients that became symptomatic; all tests were negative except for one that was inconclusive, but it was repeated and came back negative. Forty (52.6%) KT recipients were readmitted, and 7 (9.2%) had biopsy-proven rejection during the follow-up. None of the KT recipients transplanted during this period died. CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort demonstrated that DDKT can be safely performed during the COVID-19 pandemic when preventive measures are implemented.","Chandorkar, Aditya; Coro, Ana; Natori, Yoichiro; Anjan, Shweta; Abbo, Lilian M; Guerra, Giselle; Mattiazzi, Adela D; Mendez-Castaner, Lumen A; Morris, Michele I; Camargo, Jose F; Vianna, Rodrigo; Simkins, Jacques",Transpl Infect Dis,,642

The first two vaccines approved in the United States, mRNA-1273, and BNT162b2, are both messenger RNA (mRNA) based and highly effective in immunocompetent persons, but efficacy in patients on immunosuppressants has not been established. Additionally, data suggests these patients are less likely than immunocompetent people to develop neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19 infection. Given the high risk of poor outcomes in organ transplant and immunosuppressed patients, effective vaccination is paramount in this group. We present the first reported case of a solid organ transplant patient who failed to achieve seroconversion after two doses of mRNA vaccine. This case has significant implications about how immunosuppressed patients should be counseled about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and the protection provided. Physicians should remain clinically suspicious for infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite vaccination status in solid organ transplant patients.","Rusk, Debra S; Strachan, Christian C; Hunter, Benton R",J. med. virol,,642

Here we summarise data that support the use of megadose vitamin C as a treatment for sepsis and COVID-19. Mega-dose intravenous sodium ascorbate (150 g/40 kg over 7-h) dramatically improved the clinical state and cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic and renal function and decreased body temperature, in a clinically relevant ovine model of gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis. In a critically ill COVID-19 patient, intravenous sodium ascorbate (60 g) restored arterial pressure, improved renal function and increased arterial blood oxygen levels. These findings suggest that megadose vitamin C should be trialled as a treatment for sepsis and COVID-19.","May, Clive N; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Lankadeva, Yugeesh R",Br. j. pharmacol,,642

258670,A Bi-fold Approach to Detect and Classify COVID-19 X-Ray Images and Symptom Auditor,2021,"The role of occupational stress on male fertility is understudied. We examined associations between male occupational stress and fecundability. We used data from Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a North American preconception cohort study. At baseline (2013-2019), male participants aged &#8805; 21 years completed a baseline questionnaire on employment status, hours worked per week, time of day worked (daytime, evening, nights, and changing or rotating shifts), and job title. We used the O*NET occupational database to rate independence by job title. Female partners were followed via bimonthly follow-up questionnaires for 12 months or until pregnancy. We restricted analyses to 1,818 couples attempting conception for &#8804; 6 cycles at enrollment. We used proportional probabilities regression to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The FR comparing unemployed with employed men was0.84 (95% CI: 0.62-1.14). Among employed men, FRs and 95% CIs for evening shift work, night shift work, and rotating shift work were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.68-1.17), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.66-1.33), and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.75-1.11) relative to daytime shift work. The FR for any nondaytime shift work was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78-1.07). Total work hours (long or short) and job independence scores were not appreciably associated with fecundability. Total hours worked was not associated with time to pregnancy. Working nondaytime shifts and being unemployed were associated with slightly decreased fecundability. However, the variability in these estimates was substantial and the results were reasonably consistent with chance. Little association was observed for other occupation measures.

258868,The Role of Big Data and Machine Learning in COVID-19,2020,"The acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 disease, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, has infected many people over a short time and caused the death of more than 2 million people. The gold standard in detecting COVID-19 is to apply the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. This test has low sensitivity and produces false results of approximately 15%-20%. Computer tomography (CT) images were checked as a result of suspicious RT-PCR tests. If the virus is not infected in the lung, the virus is not observed on CT lung images. To overcome this problem, we propose a 25-depth convolutional neural network (CNN) model that uses scattergram images, which we call Scat-NET. Scattergram images are frequently used to reveal the numbers of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, which are measurements used in evaluating disease symptoms, and the relationships between them. To the best of our knowledge, using the CNN together with scattergram images in the detection of COVID-19 is the first study on this subject. Scattergram images obtained from 335 patients in total were classified using the Scat-NET architecture. The overall accuracy was 92.4%. The most striking finding in the results obtained was that COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR tests but positive CT test results were positive. As a result, we emphasize that the Scat-NET model will be an alternative to CT scans and could be applied as a secondary test for patients with negative RT-PCR tests.","Tuncer, Seda Arslan; Ayyildiz, Hakan; Kalayci, Mehmet; Tuncer, Taner",Comput Biol Med,,642

260542,"The energy crises revealed by COVID: Intersections of Indigeneity, inequity, and health",2020,"Itolizumab is a first-in-class anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody that was initially developed for various cancers and was later developed and approved in India for treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. This drug is now being re-purposed for COVID-19. The potential utility of itolizumab in COVID-19, based on its unique mechanism of action in ameliorating cytokine release syndrome (CRS), was proposed first in Cuba with approval of a single-arm clinical trial and expanded access use. Subsequently, a phase II, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has been conducted in 30 COVID-19 patients in India after receiving regulatory permission. Based on the results, the Indian drug regulatory agency recently approved itolizumab in July 2020 for 'restricted emergency use' for the treatment of CRS in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19. This has drawn sharp criticism within the scientific community, with the approval being granted on the basis of a relatively small phase II trial, without conduct of a conventional phase III trial, and lacking availability of the claimed supportive real-world evidence in the public domain to date. In a global scenario where finding a successful treatment for COVID-19 is of utmost priority, a biologic agent has been re-purposed and approved with a successfully completed RCT, in a country where cases and mortality due to COVID-19 are growing exponentially. However, instead of welcoming the approval with open arms, many doubts are being raised. This is an issue that needs to be considered and dealt with sensitively, as well as scientifically.","Atal, Shubham; Fatima, Zeenat; Balakrishnan, Sadasivam",BioDrugs,,642
260906,Linear Parametric Identification for a Servomechanism in a Mechanical Ventilator System,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Describe and evaluate the outcome of a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patient without shortness of breath. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed and cared for in Marseille, France. We selected data from patients who at admission, had a low dose CT scanner, dyspnea status, and oxygen saturation available. Blood gas was analyzed in a sample subset of patients. RESULTS: Among 1712 patients with COVID-19, we report that 1107 (64.7%) do not complain of shortness of breath at admission. The low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan showed signs compatible with pneumonia in 757/1,107 (68.4%) of patients without dyspnea. In a subset of patients who had underwent at least one blood gas analysis (n = 161) and presented without dyspnea at admission, 28.1% (27/96) presented with a hypoxemia/hypocapnia syndrome. Asymptomatic hypoxia was associated with a very poor outcome (33.3% were transferred to the ICU and 25.9% died). CONCLUSION: The absence of shortness of breath in an old patient with comorbidity merit medical attention and should not be considered as a good sign of well-being. The poor prognosis of asymptomatic hypoxia, highlight the severity of this mild clinical presentation. In these patients, pulse oximetry is an important mean to predict the outcome along with news score and LDCT scanner.","Brouqui, Philippe; Amrane, Sophie; Million, Matthieu; Cortaredona, Sébastien; Parola, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,,642

Here, we describe a high-throughput approach - Concept-Wide Association Study (ConceptWAS) - that systematically scans a disease's clinical manifestations from clinical notes. We used this method to identify symptoms specific to COVID-19 early in the course of the pandemic. METHODS: We created a natural language processing pipeline to extract concepts from clinical notes in a local ER corresponding to the PCR testing date for patients who had a COVID-19 test and evaluated these concepts as predictors for developing COVID-19. We identified predictors from Firth's logistic regression adjusted by age, gender, and race. We also performed ConceptWAS using cumulative data every two weeks to identify the timeline for recognition of early COVID-19-specific symptoms. RESULTS: We processed 87,753 notes from 19,692 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing between March 8, 2020, and May 27, 2020 (1,483 COVID-19-positive). We found 68 concepts significantly associated with a positive COVID-19 test. We identified symptoms associated with increasing risk of COVID-19, including ""anosmia"" (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.21-7.50), ""fever"" (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.28-1.59), ""cough with fever"" (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.75-2.96), and ""ageusia"" (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.02-8.58). Using ConceptWAS, we were able to detect loss of smell and loss of taste three weeks prior to their inclusion as symptoms of the disease by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CONCLUSION: ConceptWAS, a high-throughput approach for exploring specific symptoms and characteristics of a disease like COVID-19, offers a promise for enabling EHR-powered early disease manifestations identification.","Zhao, Juan; Grabowska, Monika E; Kerchberger, Vern Eric; Smith, Joshua C; Eken, H Nur; Feng, QiPing; Peterson, Josh F; Trent Rosenbloom, S; Johnson, Kevin B; Wei, Wei-Qi",J Biomed Inform,,642
262167,Understanding automatic COVID-19 classification using chest X-ray images,2020,"Plasma provided by COVID-19 convalescent patients may provide therapeutic relief as the number of COVID-19 cases escalates steeply worldwide. Prior findings in various viral respiratory diseases including SARS-CoV-related pneumonia suggest that convalescent plasma can reduce mortality, although formal proof of efficacy is still lacking. By reducing viral spread early on, such an approach may possibly downplay subsequent immunopathology. Identifying, collecting, qualifying and preparing plasma from convalescent patients with adequate SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Ab titres in an acute crisis setting may be challenging, although well within the remit of most blood establishments. Careful clinical evaluation should allow to quickly establish whether such passive immunotherapy, administered at early phases of the disease in patients at high risk of deleterious evolution, may reduce the frequency of patient deterioration, and thereby COVID-19 mortality.","Tiberghien, Pierre; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Morel, Pascal; Gallian, Pierre; Lacombe, Karine; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan",Vox Sang,,642
263191,Is There a Place for Responsible Artificial Intelligence in Pandemics? A Tale of Two Countries,2021,"'Keep calm and carry on' was a wartime message to the British public that has achieved renewed fame in the last few years. The strategy was simple: in times of extreme difficulty a cool head combined with stoicism is an appropriate response to ensure a successful outcome. The latest major challenge to society (COVID-19) met with a very different response, and only history will reveal whether 'Stay home and worry' will be equally effective. In devising blueprints or strategies it is extremely important to have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, whether it be maintaining world freedom or stopping a pandemic. In the case of livestock agriculture, it is helping to feed a rapidly growing global population in harmony with the needs of current and future generations. I hope that I have stated this clearly, and calmly. If so, I ask you to picture a scene. We are on a Calm Farm. Dairy animals go about their daily lives contented, unhurried and focused on the simple feeding and socialising activities that are so important to them. Unstressed, their productive capacities and abilities to avoid and, when necessary, cope with physiological and pathological challenges are maximised. They are not alone: the exact same characteristics also apply to the farmer and husbandry staff that we meet. How is this calm farming approach relevant to the aspirations we had when we established the EU COST Action DairyCare? Our objective was to harness the power of computing technologies to assist our management of dairy livestock. A simple rearrangement leads us to Computing Assisted Livestock Management, CALM. In this short Research Reflection I shall assess how far we have come towards the achievement of sensible goals related to technological assessment of dairy animal wellbeing, and speculate on what more things both can and need to be done to finish the job. It is a personal account. DairyCare was a major collaboration involving several hundred active researchers. To involve them all would be impossible, and I do not pretend to speak for them all. As will become evident, the wide skills base that was assembled was so successful in its primary objectives that different skills, chiefly in economics, are now needed to exploit all of the technological advance that has been achieved. DairyCare succeeded in a second direction. Whilst the focus was technology development, by assembling a large cohort of biologists with animal welfare interests, it soon became apparent that technology should run alongside and help to enable improved management practices. This Special Issue is, therefore, in two sections. The first is dedicated to technology development and the second to a novel management practice that has the potential to significantly improve the wellbeing of cows and calves: cow-calf contact rearing. That section is introduced by my DairyCare colleague, Sigrid Agenäs.","Knight, Christopher H",J Dairy Res,,642

Despite being still in the middle of the outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19. The objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in unprecedented fashion. This paper represents a first initiative to achieve this goal, and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus. The contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive models that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at answering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world? What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent, region, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a comprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions mentioned above.

The LaMB WG has interest in conceptual characteristics, transparency, comparability, and reusability of medical information, both in science and practice. METHODS: A set of methods were used (i) investigating the overall speed and dynamics of COVID-19 publications; (ii) characterizing the concepts of COVID-19 (text mining, visualizing a semantic map of related concepts); (iii) assessing (re)usability and combinability of data sets and paper collections (as textual data sets), and checking if information is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A further method tested practical usability of FAIR requirements by setting up a common data space of epidemiological, virus genetics and governmental public health measures' stringency data of various origin, where complex data points were visualized as scatter plots. RESULTS: Never before were that many papers and data sources dedicated to one pandemic. Worldwide research shows a plateau at â¼ 2,200 papers per week - the dynamics of areas of studies being slightly different. Ratio of epidemic modelling is rather low (â¼1%). A few 'language and meaning' methods, such as using integrated terminologies, applying data and metadata standards for processing epidemiological and case-related clinical information and in general, principles of FAIR data handling could contribute to better results, such as improved interoperability and meaningful knowledge sharing in a virtuous cycle of continuous improvements.","Balkányi, László; Lukács, Lajos; Cornet, Ronald",Yearb. med. inform.

ML is a significant tool that can be applied across many disciplines, but its direct application to civil engineering problems can be challenging. ML for civil engineering applications that are simulated in the lab often fail in real-world tests. This is usually attributed to a data mismatch between the data used to train and test the ML model and the data it encounters in the real world, a phenomenon known as data shift. However, a physics-based ML model integrates data, partial differential equations (PDEs), and mathematical models to solve data shift problems. Physics-based ML models are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear equations. Physics-based ML, which takes center stage across many science disciplines, plays an important role in fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, computational resources, and data storage.

277984,An Intelligent VegeCareAI Tool for Next Generation Plant Growth Management,2021,"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) emerged as an epidemic from China, with quick spread globally. The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes. Medical nutritional therapy is thus among the mainstay of core components of comprehensive treatment measures for patients with COVID-19. This manuscript therefore aims to highlight the role of nutritional management and support in covid-19 disease.","Gupta, Lovely; Jalang039,; o, Grace Atieno; Gupta, Piyush",J Pak Med Assoc,,642

This study aims to examine the histopathological changes in reproductive organs of goats immunized with killed vaccine of C. pseudotuberculosis. In this study, twenty four (24) clinically healthy bucks and does were divided into four groups A, B, C and D. Animals in groups A and B were immunized with 0.5 and 1% formalin killed vaccine, respectively; followed by a booster dose. After the booster dose of immunization, groups A, B and C were challenged with C. pseudotuberculosis at 106 cfu/ml. Goats in group D were immunize and unchallenged and left as control group. All C. pseudotuberculosis infected animals were euthanized humanely 12 weeks post-challenged. Tissue samples such as testes, epididymis, spermatic cord, penis, pituitary gland, mammary gland, vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tube and ovaries were collected for histopathology study. Microscopic examination of all tissues (testes, seminiferous tubules, spermatic cord, penile tissues and the pituitary gland) in the male reproductive organs of the bucks that were inoculated with 2 ml of 0.5% and 1.0% of C. pseudotuberculosis killed vaccine showed normal (animals inoculated with 1.0%) to mild (animals inoculated with 0.5%) histopathological changes when compared with those from group C which showed varying degrees of histopathological changes (p < 0.01) in their various tissues. For the female does, similar histopathological changes were observed for the various tissues examined (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterine horns, uterine tissues, cervix, vaginal, vulva, mammary glands and the pituitary glands) in which the vaccinated groups A &B showed a significantly (p < 0.001) less histopathological changes when compared with those in group C that showed varying degrees of histopathological changes in the reproductive organs investigated.

285785,Using Machine Learning to Predict Young People's Internet Health and Social Service Information Seeking,2021,"Effective systems for the analysis of molecular data are fundamental for monitoring the spread of infectious diseases and studying pathogen evolution. The rapid identification of emerging viral strains, and/or genetic variants potentially associated with novel phenotypic features is one of the most important objectives of genomic surveillance of human pathogens and represents one of the first lines of defense for the control of their spread. During the COVID 19 pandemic, several taxonomic frameworks have been proposed for the classification of SARS-Cov-2 isolates. These systems, which are typically based on phylogenetic approaches, represent essential tools for epidemiological studies as well as contributing to the study of the origin of the outbreak. Here, we propose an alternative, reproducible, and transparent phenetic method to study changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity over time. We suggest that our approach can complement other systems and facilitate the identification of biologically relevant variants in the viral genome. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we present comparative genomic analyses of more than 175,000 genomes. Our method delineates 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, which, based on the distribution of high-frequency genetic variants, fall into four major macrohaplogroups. We highlight biased spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic profiles and show that seven of the 22 haplogroups (and of all of the four haplogroup clusters) showed a broad geographic distribution within China by the time the outbreak was widely recognized-suggesting early emergence and widespread cryptic circulation of the virus well before its isolation in January 2020. General patterns of genomic variability are remarkably similar within all major SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, with UTRs consistently exhibiting the greatest variability, with s2m, a conserved secondary structure element of unknown function in the 3'-UTR of the viral genome showing evidence of a functional shift. Although several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more haplogroups were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall our analyses suggest that the emergence of novel types is unlikely to be driven by convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions, or by selection of recombined strains. In the absence of extensive clinical metadata for most available genome sequences, and in the context of extensive geographic and temporal biases in the sampling, many questions regarding the evolution and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates remain open. However, our data indicate that the approach outlined here can be usefully employed in the identification of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of clinical and epidemiological importance.","Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S; Gissi, Carmela; Pesole, Graziano",Mol Biol Evol,,642

To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84/151). Coronaviruses were also detected in rodents on the majority of wildlife farms sampled (60.7%, 17/28). These coronaviruses were found in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6/96) that are raised on wildlife farms for human consumption as food. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces on wildlife farms. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people.","Huong, Nguyen Quynh; Nga, Nguyen Thi Thanh; Long, Nguyen Van; Luu, Bach Duc; Latinne, Alice; Pruvot, Mathieu; Phuong, Nguyen Thanh; Quang, Le Tin Vinh; Hung, Vo Van; Lan, Nguyen Thi; Hoa, Nguyen Thi; Minh, Phan Quang; Diep, Nguyen Thi; Tung, Nguyen; Ky, Van Dang; Roberton, Scott I; Thuy, Hoang Bich; Gilbert, Martin; Wicker, Leanne; Mazet, Jonna A K; Johnson, Christine Kreuder; Goldstein, Tracey; Tremeau-Bravard, Alex; Ontiveros, Victoria; Joly, Damien O; Walzer, Chris; Fine, Amanda E; Olson, Sarah H",PLoS One,,642

The ability to predict cardiac injury and analyze lymphocyte immunity and inflammation of cardiac damage in patients with COVID-19 is limited. We aimed to determine the risk factors and predictive markers of cardiac injury in these patients. METHODS: Data from 124 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were collected. We compared the proportion of cardiovascular disease history in moderate, severe, and critical cases. We obtained high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTn I) results from 68 patients. Patients were divided into two groups based on positive hs-cTn I result: those with cardiac injury (n = 19) and those without cardiac injury (n = 49). RESULTS: Compared with the group with moderate disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and smoking were more common in severe and critical cases. Diabetes mellitus was most common in the critical group. Age older than 65 years, presence of chronic kidney disease, and lower blood lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors of cardiac injury. The total T- and B-lymphocyte counts and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were significantly lower in those with cardiac injury. A minimal lymphocyte percentage < 7.8% may predict cardiac injury. The interleukin (IL) 6 level in plasma was elevated in the group with cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: The lymphocyte percentage in blood may become a predictive marker of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. The total T and B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts decreased and the IL-6 level increased in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury.","Zhou, Wenqian; Song, Ling; Wang, Xiang; Xu, Zheng; Wang, Shudong; Wang, Jiqun; Xu, He; Zheng, Yang; Wang, Yushi",Int. j. cardiol,,642
289452,Internet of Things and Robotics in Transforming Current-Day Healthcare Services,2021,"CONTEXT: Point-of-care testing (POCT) is inherently spatial, that is, performed where needed, and intrinsically temporal, because it accelerates decision making. POCT efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to facilitate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, decrease risks of co-infections for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To assess AMR identification using POCT, describe the United States AMR Diagnostic Challenge, and improve global standards of care for infectious diseases. Data Sources PubMed, WWW, and other sources were searched for papers focusing on AMR and POCT. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated abstracts, URLs, and PDFs representing ~500 articles assessed for relevance. Panelist insights at Triâ¢Con 2020 in San Francisco and finalist POC technologies competing for a US $20,000,000 AMR prize are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infections represent high risks for COVID-19 patients. POCT potentially will help target specific pathogens, refine choices for antimicrobial drugs, and prevent excess morbidity and mortality. POC assays that identify patterns of pathogen resistance can help tell us how infected individuals spread AMR, where geospatial hotspots are located, when delays cause death, and how to deploy preventative resources. Shared AMR data ""clouds"" could help reduce critical care burden during pandemics and optimize therapeutic options, similar to use of antibiograms in individual hospitals. Multidisciplinary healthcare personnel should learn the principles and practice of POCT, so they can meet needs with rapid diagnostic testing. The stakes are high. AMR is projected to cause millions of deaths annually and cumulative financial loses in the trillions by 2050.","Kost, Gerald J",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),,642

This online, cross-sectional survey recruited 399 participants from two university hospitals, and they were administered a self-reported questionnaire on demographic, personal, and clinical characteristics, as well as COVID-19-related stressors and coping. In addition, they completed the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure perceived social support, as well as the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.8%, 31.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Participants with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress made up 13.3%, 25.8%, and 8.1% of the sample, respectively. Being single or divorced, fear of frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients, agreeing that the area of living had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the area of living, and a history of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses were associated with higher odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conversely, having more than three children and greater perceived friend support were associated with lower odds of depression, anxiety, and stress.

METHOD: In this prospective case-series including consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 27 March 2020 and 24 January 2021, we have collected information regarding deep throat saliva or nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) RT-PCR results, serial cycle threshold (Ct) values at and after diagnosis, demographic, clinical and outcome data and neonatal NPS RT-PCR results. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Correlation of maternal Ct values, infection-to-delivery interval, infection duration and viral load area under the curve (AUC) with gestation age (GA) at diagnosis, maternal and cord sera IgG concentrations and transfer ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty consented pregnant women had delivered their babies by 31 January 2021, including 14 women having recovered from COVID-19 and six with active infection. The median GA at clinical manifestation was 32.7 weeks (range 11.9-39.4). The median infection-to-delivery interval and infection duration were 41.5 days (range 2-187) and 10.0 days (range=1-48), respectively. The median GA at delivery was 39.1 weeks (range=32.4-40.7) and the median seroconversion interval was 14 days (range=1-19). Twelve of 13 neonates born to mothers with recovered infection tested positive for IgG. All neonatal NPS samples were reported to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 and all cord sera tested negative for IgM. There was a negative correlation between IgG concentrations in cord and maternal sera with infection-to-delivery interval and a positive correlation between IgG concentrations in maternal sera with viral load AUC. There was also a significant correlation between transfer ratio with viral load AUC. CONCLUSIONS: In recovered pregnant women with COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations at delivery increased with viral load during infection and decreased with infection-to-delivery interval. The median transplacental transfer ratio of IgG was 1.3 and this transfer was reduced by high viral load during infection. This article is protected by copyright.

297620,Viewpoint: Information systems research strategy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate small-particle aerosolization from mastoidectomy relevant to potential viral transmission and to test source-control mitigation strategies. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric simulation. SETTING: Surgical simulation laboratory. METHODS: An optical particle size spectrometer was used to quantify 1- to 10-µm aerosols 30 cm from mastoid cortex drilling. Two barrier drapes were evaluated: OtoTent1, a drape sheet affixed to the microscope; OtoTent2, a custom-structured drape that enclosed the surgical field with specialized ports. RESULTS: Mastoid drilling without a barrier drape, with or without an aerosol-scavenging second suction, generated large amounts of 1- to 10-µm particulate. Drilling under OtoTent1 generated a high density of particles when compared with baseline environmental levels (P < .001, U = 107). By contrast, when drilling was conducted under OtoTent2, mean particle density remained at baseline. Adding a second suction inside OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 kept particle density at baseline levels. Significant aerosols were released upon removal of OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 despite a 60-second pause before drape removal after drilling (P < .001, U = 0, n = 10, 12; P < .001, U = 2, n = 12, 12, respectively). However, particle density did not increase above baseline when a second suction and a pause before removal were both employed. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy without a barrier, even when a second suction was added, generated substantial 1- to 10-µm aerosols. During drilling, large amounts of aerosols above baseline levels were detected with OtoTent1 but not OtoTent2. For both drapes, a second suction was an effective mitigation strategy during drilling. Last, the combination of a second suction and a pause before removal prevented aerosol escape during the removal of either drape.","Chari, Divya A; Workman, Alan D; Chen, Jenny X; Jung, David H; Abdul-Aziz, Dunia; Kozin, Elliott D; Remenschneider, Aaron K; Lee, Daniel J; Welling, D Bradley; Bleier, Benjamin S; Quesnel, Alicia M",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,642

Similar events are likely to be recurring with more frequency in the future. The inability to control the virus' impact is caused by many factors, but the lack of a technology infrastructure to detect and impede the virus at an early stage are principal shortcomings. Using phage display mutagenesis, we have generated a cohort of high performance antibody fragments (Fabs) that can be used in a sensitive point of care (POC) assay and are potent inhibitors (IC50-0.5 nM) to viral entry into cells. The POC assay is based on a split-enzyme (ß-lactamase) complementation strategy that detects virus particles at low nM levels. We have shown that this assay is equally effective for detecting other viruses like Ebola and Zika.

METHODS: A longitudinal study of 20 consecutive critically ill, delirious COVID-19 inpatients, assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index-Short Form (CCI-SF), COVID-19 Clinical Severity Scale (CCSS), Delirium Etiology Checklist, Delirium Motor Subtype Scale-4, and Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), was conducted. Correlational analysis of delirium severity (DDT-Pro) with each measure of clinical severity (CCI-SF and CCSS) and comparison of baseline DDT-Pro scores between patients who were living and those who were deceased at follow-up were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were 50-90 years old (male, 75%; hypertension, 60%). The prevalence of preexisting medical comorbidities (CCI-SF) was low and not correlated with delirium severity (p=0.193). Eighteen patients were on mechanical or high-flow noninvasive ventilation at baseline in the intensive care unit (ICU; CCSS scores 2-4). Delirium severity (DDT-Pro scores 0-6) correlated with COVID-19 severity (0.459, p=0.021). Delirium motor subtype was hyperactive in 75% of patients. There were three to four etiologies for delirium in each patient, most commonly organ insufficiency (100%), systemic infection (100%), and metabolic and endocrine disturbances (95%). The baseline DDT-Pro score was &#8804;4 for five (25%) patients who died before the final assessment, with a trend of being lower than that for survivors (&#967;2=3.398, p=0.065). CONCLUSIONS: Among inpatients with COVID-19, at least three different etiological categories were identified for delirium. ICU staff treating patients with severe cases of COVID-19 should anticipate a greater severity of delirium. Although multivariate analyses with larger study samples are needed, more severe delirium may herald greater risk of death among COVID-19 patients.","Velásquez-Tirado, Juan D; Trzepacz, Paula T; Franco, José G",J. neuropsychiatry clin. neurosci,,642

The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofenââââââ and worsening of infections. Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.","Capuano, Annalisa; Scavone, Cristina; Racagni, Giorgio; Scaglione, Francesco",Pharmacol Res,,642
305990,How to Handle Health-Related Small Imbalanced Data in Machine Learning?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has collapsed health systems worldwide. In adults, the virus causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while in children the disease seems to be milder, although a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) has been described. The aim was to describe and compare the characteristics of the severe COVID-19 disease in adults and children. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included the young adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March-June 2020 and admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. The two populations were analysed and compared focusing on their clinical and analytical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. There were 16 adults (80%) and 4 children (20%). No mortality was recorded. All the adults were admitted due to ARDS. The median age was 32 years (IQR 23.3-41.5) and the most relevant previous pathology was obesity (n = 7, 43.7%). Thirteen (81.3%) needed mechanical ventilation, with a median PEEP of 13 (IQR 10.5-14.5). Six (37.5%) needed inotropic support due to the sedation. Eight (50%) developed a healthcare-associated infection, the most frequent of which was central line-associated bloodstream infection (n = 7, 71.4%). One patient developed a partial pulmonary thromboembolism, despite him being treated with heparin. All the children were admitted due to MIS-C. Two (50%) required mechanical ventilation. All needed inotropic support, with a median vasoactive-inotropic score of 27.5 (IQR 17.5-30). The difference in the inotropic requirements between the two populations was statistically significant (37.5% vs. 100%, p < 0.001). The biomarker values were higher in children than in adults: mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin 1.72 vs. 0.78 nmol/L (p = 0.017), procalcitonin 5.7 vs. 0.19 ng/mL (p = 0.023), and C-reactive protein 328.2 vs. 146.9 mg/L (p = 0.005). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponins were higher in children than in adults (p = 0.034 and p = 0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adults and children had different clinical manifestations. Adults developed severe ARDS requiring increased respiratory support, whereas children presented MIS-C with greater inotropic requirements. Biomarkers could be helpful in identifying susceptible patients, since they might change depending on the clinical features.","Girona-Alarcon, Mònica; Bobillo-Perez, Sara; Sole-Ribalta, Anna; Hernandez, Lluisa; Guitart, Carmina; Suarez, Ricardo; Balaguer, Mònica; Cambra, Francisco-Jose; Jordan, Iolanda",BMC Infect Dis,,642

It is of paramount importance for understanding the information diffusion process such as the spread of rumors and the propagation of new technologies in social networks. Recently, instead of extracting hand-crafted features or embedding cascade sequences into feature vectors for cascade prediction, graph neural networks (GNNs) are introduced to utilize the network structure which governs the cascade effect. However, these models do not take into account social factors such as personality traits which drive human's participation in the information diffusion process. In this work, we propose a novel multitask framework for enhancing cascade prediction with a personality recognition task. Specially, we design a general plug-and-play GNN gate, named PersonalityGate, to couple into existing GNN-based cascade prediction models to enhance their effectiveness and extract individuals' personality traits jointly. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing GNN-based cascade prediction models and in predicting individuals' personality traits as well.","Yan, Dengcheng; Cao, Jie; Zhang, Yiwen; Zhong, Hong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14327v1.pdf,642
307698,From Pixels to Legs: Hierarchical Learning of Quadruped Locomotion,2020-11-23,"INTRODUCTION: Although transgender women (trans women) often are conflated with men who have sex with men (MSM) in HIV research and services, there are distinct population differences that are important for implementing effective HIV prevention. Our objective was to examine pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) disparities between the two populations and compare individual, social and structural factors that influence differences between MSM and trans women along the PrEP continuum. METHODS: We analysed data from two population-based studies, one with trans women (Trans*National Study, 2016 - 18) and the other with MSM (National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, 2017). Trans women were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and MSM using time location sampling. Key indicators of the PrEP continuum were evaluated, including awareness, health insurance, provider discussions, recent use and adherence. Associations were also examined for PrEP continuum indicators and structural barriers (e.g. employment, homelessness). RESULTS: Transwomen were more likely than MSM to be Latino/a (30.4% vs. 25.8%; prevalence ratio (PR)=1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14) or African American (7.1% vs. 4.5%; PR = 1.12, 1.02 to 1.24), live at or below the poverty limit (70.7% vs. 15.8%; PR = 1.47; 1.41 to 1.53), be unemployed (50.1% vs. 26.3%; PR = 1.18, 1.13 to 1.24), be homeless (8.4% vs. 3.5%; PR = 1.15, 1.06 to 1.25) and to have less than a college degree (PR = 1.41, 1.34 to 1.48). Trans women were more likely than MSM to have health insurance (95.7% vs. 89.7%, PR = 1.17, 1.06 to 1.28), but less likely than MSM to have heard of PrEP (79.1% vs. 96.7%; PR = 0.77, 0.73 to 0.81), talked with a provider about PrEP (35.5% vs. 54.9%; PR = 0.87, 0.83 to 0.91) and less likely than MSM to have used PrEP in the past six months (14.6% vs. 39.8%; PR = 0.80, 0.76 to 0.84). Among PrEP users, trans women were less likely to report being adherent to PrEP than MSM (70.4% vs. 87.4%; PR = 0.80, 0.70 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: We found PrEP disparities for trans women compared to MSM and the need for differentiated implementation strategies to meet the specific PrEP barriers trans women face. Inclusion of trans women's HIV risks is needed in CDC guidance for PrEP. Interventions to increase trans women's awareness of PrEP including at the provider and community level are also needed. Finally, programming that addresses trans women's barriers to housing and income is also needed to reduce PrEP disparities.","Wilson, Erin C; Turner, Caitlin M; Arayasirikul, Sean; Lightfoot, Marguerita; Scheer, Susan; Raymond, Henry F; Liu, Albert",J Int AIDS Soc,,642

308127,An Unsupervised Misinformation Detection Framework to Analyze the Users using COVID-19 Twitter Data,2020,"The secretin receptor (SCTR), a prototypical class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), exerts its effects mainly by activating G&#945;s proteins upon binding of its endogenous peptide ligand secretin. SCTRs can be found in a variety of tissues and organs across species, including the pancreas, stomach, liver, heart, lung, colon, kidney, and brain. Beyond that, modulation of SCTR-mediated signaling has therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple diseases, such as heart failure, obesity, and diabetes. However, no ligands other than secretin and its peptide analogs have been described to regulate SCTRs, probably due to inherent challenges in family B GPCR drug discovery. Here we report creation of a testing funnel that allowed targeted detection of SCTR small-molecule activators. Pursuing the strategy to identify positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), we established a unique primary screening assay employing a mixture of three orthosteric stimulators that was compared in a screening campaign testing 12,000 small-molecule compounds. Beyond that, we developed a comprehensive set of secondary assays, such as a radiolabel-free target engagement assay and a NanoBiT (NanoLuc Binary Technology)-based approach to detect ß-arrestin-2 recruitment, all feasible in a high-throughput environment as well as capable of profiling ligands and hits regarding their effect on binding and receptor function. This combination of methods enabled the discovery of five promising scaffolds, four of which have been validated and further characterized with respect to their allosteric activities. We propose that our results may serve as starting points for developing the first in vivo active small molecules targeting SCTRs.","Dengler, Daniela G; Sun, Qing; Holleran, John; Pollari, Sirkku; Beutel, Jannis; Brown, Brock T; Shinoki Iwaya, Aki; Ardecky, Robert; Harikumar, Kaleeckal G; Miller, Laurence J; Sergienko, Eduard A",SLAS Discov,,642

By extending conventional histopatholocigal examination by a third dimension, the delicate pathological changes of the vascular system of severe Covid-19 progressions can be analyzed, fully quantified and compared to other types of viral myocarditis and controls. To this end, cardiac samples with a cross section of 3.5mm were scanned at the synchrotron in a parallel beam configuration. The vascular network was segmented by a deep learning architecture suitable for 3d datasets (V-net), trained by sparse manual annotations. Pathological alterations of vessels, concerning the variation of diameters and the amount of small holes, were observed, indicative of elevated occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis, also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Further, we implemented a fully automated analysis of the tissue structure in form of shape measures based on the structure tensor.

308266,Res-CovNet: an internet of medical health things driven COVID-19 framework using transfer learning,2021,"PURPOSE: With the current COVID-19 outbreak, otolaryngologists are most exposed to the risk of infection due to the nature of the specialty.This is why they are required to find safer diagnostic alternatives minimizing aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this study is to explore the accuracy of transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography (TLUSG) in order to assess vocal fold movement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed blindly both TLUSG and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy(FFL) on 38 patients, from March to June 2020. Patients were divided into two groups:the former with normally mobile vocal folds and the latter with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. RESULTS: On FFL findings, 10/38 patients (26,31%) had unilateral vocal fold paralysis; on TLUSG results, 9/38 patients (23.68%) presented impaired vocal fold motion. In comparison to laryngoscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TLUSG for assessment of vocal fold mobility was 80%, 96.42%, 88.88%, 93.10% respectively. A significant association between the two techniques was found on the Chi-square test: X2 = 19.7722 (p value <0.00001). Cohen's K value showed a substantial agreement: K = 0,79. CONCLUSION: Although TLUSG could undoubtedly not replace laringoscopy, it represents a noninvasive and useful diagnostic tool for otolaryngologists especially during covid-19 pandemic.Data collected about its high sensitivity and specificity suggest that TLUSG could be a reliable method to screen vocal fold paralysis without performing aerosol-generating procedures, thus providing clear visualization of laryngeal real-time movements, even in non-compliant or high-risk infection patients. Our results allow us to consider TLUSG as part of the preoperative assessment of vocal folds in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.","Sciancalepore, Pasqua Irene; Anzivino, Roberta; Petrone, Paolo; Petrone, Domenico; Quaranta, Nicola",Am J Otolaryngol,,642

The current COVID-19 pandemic demands an effective vaccine to acquire protection against the infection. Therefore, the present study was aimed to design a multiepitope-based subunit vaccine (MESV) against COVID-19. METHODS: Structural proteins (Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, and Membrane glycoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2 are responsible for its prime functions. Sequences of proteins were downloaded from GenBank and several immunoinformatics coupled with computational approaches were employed to forecast B- and T- cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 highly antigenic structural proteins to design an effective MESV. RESULTS: Predicted epitopes suggested high antigenicity, conserveness, substantial interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding alleles, and collective global population coverage of 88.40%. Taken together, 276 amino acids long MESV was designed by connecting 3 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), 6 helper T lymphocyte (HTL) and 4 B-cell epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers. The MESV construct was non-allergenic, stable, and highly antigenic. Molecular docking showed a stable and high binding affinity of MESV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors-3 (TLR3). Furthermore, in silico immune simulation revealed significant immunogenic response of MESV. Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into the Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression. CONCLUSION: The MESV developed in this study is capable of generating immune response against COVID-19. Therefore, if designed MESV further investigated experimentally, it would be an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 to control and prevent COVID-19.","Tahir Ul Qamar, Muhammad; Shahid, Farah; Aslam, Sadia; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Aslam, Sidra; Fatima, Israr; Fareed, Muhammad Mazhar; Zohaib, Ali; Chen, Ling-Ling",Infect Dis Poverty,,642

Despite adaptations in critical care personnel staffing, bed availability and supply provision, many inpatient ICUs have become acutely crowded, leading to boarding of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and other diseases in the ED. To address this scenario at our urban, safety net, tertiary care institution in the spring of 2020, we designed and implemented a temporary ""emergency department-intensive care unit"" (ED-ICU) patient care service. Critical care-trained emergency physicians took call and came into the hospital overnight/on weekends to provide bedside treatment to admitted ICU patients boarding for prolonged periods in our ED. In this manuscript, we describe the creation and execution of the ED-ICU service and the characteristics and management of the patients who received care under this model.","Drumheller, Byron C; Mareiniss, Darren P; Overberger, Ryan C; Sabolick, Erin E",,,642

Bats have arisen the attention of the scientific community as reservoir of emerging viruses, given their wide geographical distribution, their biological diversity (around 1400 species, 21 different families and over 200 genera), and their peculiar ecological and physiological characteristics which seem to facilitate them in harbouring a high viral diversity. Several human activities may enable the viral spill-over from bats to humans, such as deforestation, land-use changes, increased livestock grazing or intensive production of vegetal cultures. In addition, the globalization of trade and high global human mobility allow these viruses to be disseminated in few hours in many parts of the World. In order to avoid the emergence of new pandemic threats in the future we need to substantially change our global models of social and economic development, posing the conservation of biodiversity and the preservation of natural ecosystems as a pillar for the protection of global human health.","Calistri, Paolo; Decaro, Nicola; Lorusso, Alessio",,,642

In this multicentric, retrospective, observational research the aim was to evaluate the impact of teicoplanin on the course of COVID-19 in critically ill patients. Fifty-five patients with severe COVID-19, hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICUs) and treated with best available therapy were retrospectively analysed. Among them 34 patients were also treated with teicoplanin (Tei-COVID group), while 21 without teicoplanin (control group). Crude in-hospital Day-30 mortality was lower in Tei-COVID group (35.2%) than in control group (42.8%), however not reaching statistical significance (p = .654). No statistically significant differences in length of stay in the ICU were observed between Tei-COVID group and control group (p = .248). On Day 14 from the ICU hospitalization, viral clearance was achieved in 64.7% patients of Tei-COVID group and 57.1% of control group, without statistical difference. Serum C-reactive protein level was significantly reduced in Tei-COVID group compared to control group, but not other biochemical parameters. Finally, Gram-positive were the causative pathogens for 25% of BSIs in Tei-COVID group and for 70.6% in controls. No side effects related to teicoplanin use were observed. Despite several limitations require further research, in this study the use of teicoplanin is not associated with a significant improvement in outcomes analysed. The antiviral activity of teicoplanin against SARS-CoV-2, previously documented, is probably more effective at early clinical stages.","Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Alessandri, Francesco; Oliva, Alessandra; Borrazzo, Cristian; Dell039,; Isola, Serena; Ialungo, Anna Maria; Rastrelli, Elena; Pelli, Massimiliano; Raponi, Giammarco; Turriziani, Ombretta; Ruberto, Franco; Rocco, Monica; Pugliese, Francesco; Russo, Alessandro; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella; Venditti, Mario",J Med Virol,,642

The non standard part of our approach resides in the fact that we considered as model parameters also the initial number of susceptible individuals, as well as the proportionality factor relating the detected number of positives with the actual (and unknown) number of infected individuals. Identifying the contagion, recovery and death rates as well as the mentioned parameters amounts to a non-convex identification problem that we solved by means of a two-dimensional grid search in the outer loop, with a standard weighted least-squares optimization problem as the inner step.","Calafiore, Giuseppe C.; Novara, Carlo; Possieri, Corrado",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14391v1.pdf,642

330443,MaskNet: Detecting Different Kinds of Face Mask for Indian Ethnicity,2021,"Urban expansion compounded by climate change appears to exacerbate the temperature difference between urban and rural areas. This temperature difference, known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, results from lack of vegetation, increased impervious surfaces, excess heat released from human activities, and changing radiation and wind dynamics due to urban morphology. UHI has been found to increase heat-related illnesses, and in some instances, mortalities among vulnerable populations. Heat exposure is particularly pertinent in 2020, as stay-at-home orders and higher unemployment rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic have further exposed urban residents to local temperatures. Certain socio-economic groups that are more affected by COVID-19 are disproportionately exposed to high urban temperatures. We investigated the relationships between urban heat island intensity (UHII), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and selected socio-economic factors for Dallas, TX and Phoenix, AZ for June 2020. We used an equal-weighting approach to combine socio-economic factors obtained from 2018 US Census Bureau data to determine socio-economic vulnerability, and used Landsat 8 imagery to derive NDVI and land surface temperature. Pearson's correlation, hot spot analysis, and Moran's I tests revealed that socio-economic vulnerability was higher in areas with high urban temperatures and decreased vegetation. © 2020 ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences.

This study aimed at screening a convenience sample in Germany during lockdown for perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge about COVID-19, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and behavioral responses. In an online survey, 1358 participants completed the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVD), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and questionnaires on knowledge about COVID-19 and self-perceived change in behaviors in response to COVID-19. Lower and upper quartiles of the PVD were used to classify individuals into low and high PVD. A confirmatory factor analysis supported three factors representing risk, preventive and adaptive behavior as behavioral responses to COVID-19 lockdown. A structural equation model showed that the score of the knowledge scale significantly predicted the self-reported increase in adaptive and preventive behavior. The score in the PVD-subscale Perceived Infectability predicted a self-reported increase in preventive behavior, whereas the Germ Aversion score predicted a self-reported increase in preventive and a decrease in risk behavior. The score in PHQ-4 predicted a higher score in the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales, and a self-reported decrease in adaptive behavior. Low-, medium- and high-PVD groups reported distinct patterns of behavior, knowledge, and mental health symptoms. This study shows that perceived vulnerability to disease is closely linked to preventive behaviors and may enhance adaptation to COVID-19 pandemic.","Stangier, Ulrich; Kananian, Schahryar; Schüller, Johanna",Curr Psychol,,642

An in-depth analysis of symptoms and clinical parameters, as well as molecular changes, is necessary to comprehend COVID-19 and propose a remedy for affected people to fight that disease. The analysis of available clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 infection markers underlined the main pathogenic process in COVID-19 is cytokine storm and inflammation. That led us to suggest that the most important pathogenic feature of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 is oxidative stress and cellular damage stimulated by iron, a source of Fenton reaction and its product hydroxyl radical (â¢OH), the most reactive ROS with t1/2-10-9s. Therefore we suggest some scavenging agents are a reasonable choice for overcoming its toxic effect and can be regarded as a treatment for the disease on the molecular level.","Barciszewska, Anna-Maria",Chem Biol Interact,,642

334698,Optimum Location of Field Hospitals for COVID-19: A Nonlinear Binary Metaheuristic Algorithm,2021,"This research proposes a new type of Grey Wolf optimizer named Gradient-based Grey Wolf Optimizer (GGWO). Using gradient information, we accelerated the convergence of the algorithm that enables us to solve well-known complex benchmark functions optimally for the first time in this field. We also used the Gaussian walk and Lévy flight to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the GGWO to avoid trapping in local optima. We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Since the prediction of the epidemic is a complicated task due to its stochastic nature, presenting efficient methods to solve the problem is vital. Since the healthcare system has a limited capacity, it is essential to predict the pandemic's future trend to avoid overload. Our results predict that the US will have almost 16 million cases by the end of November. The upcoming peak in the number of infected, ICU admitted cases would be mid-to-end November. In the end, we proposed several managerial insights that will help the policymakers have a clearer vision about the growth of COVID-19 and avoid equipment shortages in healthcare systems.","Khalilpourazari, Soheyl; Hashemi Doulabi, Hossein; Özyüksel Çiftçioglu, Aybike; Weber, Gerhard-Wilhelm",Expert Syst Appl,,642

336318,Disaster and Pandemic Management Using Machine Learning: A Survey,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Traditional in-person Mock Oral Examinations (IP-MOEs) are utilized by surgery residency programs to prepare trainees for the American Board of Surgery Certifying Exam (ABS-CE). However, the COVID-19 Pandemic has led to a profound disruption of on-campus and in-person educational activities, with subsequent instantaneous revolutionization of educational systems all over the world, including a massive switch to virtual platforms. Many in-person didactics and examinations were canceled or rescheduled, including the ABS-CE. The study aims to evaluate Virtual MOEs' (V-MOEs) feasibility as a potential alternative to in-person MOEs in residency programs. METHODS: Twenty-five participants-16 general surgery residents (7 females, 9 males) and 9 faculty - in the inaugural Department of Surgery Virtual Mock Oral Examination completed an anonymous, voluntary online survey via Microsoft Forms. Faculty was given 24 questions, and residents 28, with 9 questions common between both residents and faculty. Participants were asked about the accessibility to virtual examination rooms, V-MOE effectiveness, resident's preparation for the exam, resident's stress, diversity, and number of clinical scenarios, and possible future implementation of, and barriers to, V-MOEs. RESULTS: All participants have participated in IP-MOEs in the past. All faculties were very satisfied or satisfied with IP-MOE, compared to 93.8% of residents. All participants were very satisfied or satisfied with the orientation and instructions before V-MOE. Only 66.6% of faculty, compared to all residents, was satisfied with time allocation for sessions. While 88.9% of faculty felt the V-MOE was less stressful on residents, only 68.8% of residents felt so. Additionally, 87.5% of residents said they prepared for the V-MOE similarly to the IP-MOE. As a future platform, only 22.2% of faculty compared to 43.8% of residents preferred V-MOE over the IP-MOE. Both faculty (88.9%), and residents (81.3%) preferred immediate feedback at the end of sessions. All faculty recommend collaboration with other programs to enhance the resident's preparation. Time constraints, lack of experience with the format, and availability were the top 3 barriers.

However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face contacts on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are especially relevant for older people's mental health. Our analyses rely on an online quota sampling survey conducted in France, Italy and Spain during April 14-24, 2020. We considered the subsample of individuals aged 50 + (N = 4207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyze how changes in intergenerational contacts differed by socioeconomic factors and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in face-to-face contacts. Finally, the change in digital devices' use has been explored as a consequence of both decreased physical intergenerational contacts (PIC) and increased non-physical intergenerational contacts (NPIC). We found that about 50% of older people have increased their NPIC during the first lockdown. Younger individuals, those with medium level of education, and those economically better off displayed higher probabilities of increased NPIC as compared to their counterparts. NPIC increased especially for individuals whose face-to-face contacts decreased, particularly so if this happened with respect to contacts with children. A large share of older people has increased their use of video calls and instant messages, while only some increased the use of social media. These findings are relevant to understand how intergenerational contacts changed during the pandemic and may be central to better plan future outbreak responses.

While such data are essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a guilt-free strategy recently proposed to lessen this constraint are generalizable across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our findings show that the guilt-free strategy is a useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents' proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims to provide crucial data on the current pandemic.","Daoust, Jean-François; Bélanger, Éric; Dassonneville, Ruth; Lachapelle, Erick; Nadeau, Richard; Becher, Michael; Brouard, Sylvain; Foucault, Martial; Hönnige, Christoph; Stegmueller, Daniel",PLoS One,,642

346937,A blockchain-based secure PHR data storage and sharing framework,2020,"Scaffold material is essential in providing mechanical support to tissue, allowing stem cells to improve their function in the healing and repair of trauma sites and tissue regeneration. The scaffold aids cell organization in the damaged tissue. It serves and allows bio mimicking the mechanical and biological properties of the target tissue and facilitates cell proliferation and differentiation at the regeneration site. In this study, the developed and assayed bio-composite made of unique collagen fibers and alginate hydrogel supports the function of cells around the implanted material. We used an in vivo rat model to study the scaffold effects when transplanted subcutaneously and as an augment for tendon repair. Animals' well-being was measured by their weight and daily activity post scaffold transplantation during their recovery. At the end of the experiment, the bio-composite was histologically examined, and the surrounding tissues around the implant were evaluated for inflammation reaction and scarring tissue. In the histology, the formation of granulation tissue and fibroblasts that were part of the inclusion process of the implanted material were noted. At the transplanted sites, inflammatory cells, such as plasma cells, macrophages, and giant cells, were also observed as expected at this time point post transplantation. This study demonstrated not only the collagen-alginate device biocompatibility, with no cytotoxic effects on the analyzed rats, but also that the 3D structure enables cell migration and new blood vessel formation needed for tissue repair. Overall, the results of the current study proved for the first time that the implantable scaffold for long-term confirms the well-being of these rats and is correspondence to biocompatibility ISO standards and can be further developed for medical devices application.","Benayahu, Dafna; Pomeraniec, Leslie; Shemesh, Shai; Heller, Snir; Rosenthal, Yoav; Rath-Wolfson, Lea; Benayahu, Yehuda",,,642

It affected the mental health of people in various ways. This web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the general population of India with an aim to evaluate the mental health of the healthy individuals in the later stage of the lockdown period. Data on socio-demographic factors, anxiety, depression (HADS scale), perceived stress (PSS scale), insomnia (insomnia severity index), subjective psychological feeling of well-being (WHO-5 well-being Index), and attitude towards covid-19 (7-point Likert scale) was collected. Univariate regression analysis and Karl Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the correlation of mental health abnormalities with socio-demographic factors. 119 subjects of mean age of 36.03 +/- 18.04 years took part in the study. Their average number of days of stay at home during the lockdown and the average number of days of the lifestyle changes was 49.07 +/- 31.92 and 61.39 +/- 20.03 days, respectively. Depression, anxiety, stress, and clinical insomnia due to covid-19 were reported in 13.45%, 10.92%, 14.29%, and 11.76% subjects, respectively. There was a significant correlation of depression, anxiety, stress, and WHO-5 well-being score with age, socio-economic status, and the average number of days of the change in lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic (P < 0.05).

349680,A Qualitative Evaluation of Language Models on Automatic Question-Answering for COVID-19,2020,"Parkin is a crucial protein that promotes the clearance of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy in neuron, and parkin mutations result in autosomal-recessive Parkinson's disease (AR-PD). However, the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of Parkin-mediated mitophagy in PD remain unclear. In this study, PD models were generated through incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+, 1.5 mM for 24 h) and intraperitoneal injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 30 mg/kg for five consecutive days) in mice. A Bioinformatics database was used to identify Parkin-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs). Then, miR-103a-3p agomir, miR-103a-3p antagomir and Parkin siRNA were used to assess the effects of miR-103a-3p/Parkin/Ambra1 signaling-mediated mitophagy in PD in vitro and in vivo. The protein and mRNA levels of Parkin and Ambra1 were significantly decreased, while miR-103a-3p, which is a highly expressed miRNA in the human brain, was obviously increased in PD mouse and SH-SY5Y cell models. Moreover, miR-103a-3p suppressed Parkin expression by targeting a conserved binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Parkin mRNA. Importantly, miR-103a-3p inhibition resulted in neuroprotective effects and improved mitophagy in vitro and in vivo, whereas Parkin siRNA strongly abolished these effects. These findings suggested that miR-103a-3p inhibition has neuroprotective effects in PD, which may be involved in regulating mitophagy through the Parkin/Ambra1 pathway. Modulating miR-103a-3p levels may be an applicable therapeutic strategy for PD.","Zhou, Junjun; Zhao, Yan; Li, Zhenlu; Zhu, Meiyang; Wang, Zhecheng; Li, Yang; Xu, Ting; Feng, Dongcheng; Zhang, Su; Tang, Fan; Yao, Jihong",Pharmacol Res,,642

We specifically examine violent conflict events (e.g., battles, remote violence and bombings, and violence against civilians) as well as civil demonstrations (e.g., protests and riots) using data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project. Globally we see a relatively short-term decline in conflict, mostly driven by a sharp decrease in protest events, that has since recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic medical record data. SETTING: Five member hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC). PARTICIPANTS: 28 336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 24 February 2020 to 15 April 2020, including 6158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Positive test rates and in-hospital mortality were assessed for different racial groups. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N=3273), we estimated HR for both discharge and death across various explanatory variables, including patient demographics, hospital site and unit, smoking status, vital signs, lab results and comorbidities. RESULTS: Hispanics (29%) and African Americans (25%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to their representation in the overall NYC population (p<0.05); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in hospitalised patients based on race. Outcomes differed significantly between hospitals (Gray's T=248.9; p<0.05), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR 0.985, 95% CI 0.982 to 0.988; p=1.57e-17), care in intensive care unit areas (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.92; p=7.81e-6) and elevated creatinine (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.10; p=7.48e-10), white cell count (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p=8.4e-3) and body mass index (BMI) (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03; p=1.09e-2). Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find racial disparities in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. In addition, we identified key clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk of a severe infection response and predict survival.","Wang, Zichen; Zheutlin, Amanda; Kao, Yu-Han; Ayers, Kristin; Gross, Susan; Kovatch, Patricia; Nirenberg, Sharon; Charney, Alexander; Nadkarni, Girish; De Freitas, Jessica K; O039,; Reilly, Paul; Just, Allan; Horowitz, Carol; Martin, Glenn; Branch, Andrea; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Charney, Dennis; Reich, David; Oh, William K; Schadt, Eric; Chen, Rong; Li, Li",BMJ Open,,642

The researchers also aim at exploring the construct validity further through examining the relationship between FCV-19S, wellbeing and life satisfaction in Egyptian universities context. The current study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale among Egyptian population. METHODS: The FCV-19S is translated and validated in Egyptian context. The forward backward translation method is used to translate the English version of the survey into Arabic. The sample is comprised of 1832 Egyptian participants, who have conducted an online survey based on the Arabic versions of FCV-19S. RESULTS: The Cronbach &#945; value for the Egyptian FCV-19S is 0.87, indicating a good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that the unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S has fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S is significantly correlated with the seven-item survey. Moreover, the results show a significant negative relationship between Fear of COVID-19 and both wellbeing and life satisfaction (r = -0.42, p < 0.001; r = -0.24, p < 0.01.), respectively. CONCLUSION: The study supports the one factor model of FCV-19S scale in Egyptian context. The Arabic scale version in the Egyptian context shows excellent reliability and validity. This ensures a good measure that can be accepted for both academia and practitioners for analyzing ill-effects of pandemic impacts and, thereby, reducing them.","Fawzy El-Bardan, Mohamed; Lathabhavan, Remya",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,642

366267,Using Simple Dynamic Analytic Framework to Characterize and Forecast Epidemics,2020,"Inflammation contributes to the development of various pathologies, e.g. asthma, cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer, and metabolic disorders. Leukotrienes (LT), biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), constitute a potent family of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. Î´-Garcinoic acid (Î´-GA) (1), a natural vitamin E analogue, was chosen for further structural optimization as it selectively inhibited 5-LO activity in cell-free and cell-based assays without impairing the production of specialized pro-resolving mediators by 15-LO. A model of semi-quantitative prediction of 5-LO inhibitory potential developed during the current study allowed the design of 24 garcinamides that were semi-synthesized. In accordance with the prediction model, biological evaluations showed that eight compounds potently inhibited human recombinant 5-LO (IC50 < 100 nM). Interestingly, four compounds were substantially more potent than 1 in activated primary human neutrophils assays. Structure - activity relationships shed light on a supplementary hydrophobic pocket in the allosteric binding site that could be fitted with an aromatic ring.","Dinh, Chau Phi; Ville, Alexia; Neukirch, Konstantin; Viault, Guillaume; Temml, Veronika; Koeberle, Andreas; Werz, Oliver; Schuster, Daniela; Stuppner, Hermann; Richomme, Pascal; Helesbeux, Jean-Jacques; Séraphin, Denis",Eur J Med Chem,,642

370355,Preliminary detection of covid-19 using deep learning and machine learning techniques on radiological data,2021,"The magnitude of future waves of Covid19 in a population will depend, in part, on the percentage of that population already infected, recovered, and presumably immune. Sero-epidemiological surveys can define the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in various populations. However, sero-surveys are resource-intensive and methodologically challenging, limiting widespread use. We propose a relatively simple method for calculating the percentage of a population infected, which depends on the number of reported Covid19 deaths, a figure usually more reliable and less dependent on variable testing practices than the total number of reported Covid19 cases, and the infection fatality rate, a figure that is relatively stable in similar populations. The method can be applied in different sized areas, such as states, districts, or cities. Such an approach can provide useful, real-time estimates of probable population immunity in settings unable to undertake multiple sero-surveys. This method is applicable to low- and lower-middle-income country (LMIC) settings where sero-survey data will likely be limited; however, better estimates of infection fatality rates and Covid19 death counts in LMICs are needed to improve the method's accuracy. Information on the percentage of a population infected will help public health authorities in planning for future waves of Covid19, including where to most effectively deploy vaccines.","Feikin, Daniel R; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Mulholland, Kim",,,642

374550,Impact of lockdown measures to combat Covid-19 on air quality over western Europe,2020,"The pandemic of COVID-19 has posed an urgent need to learn the dynamics of the virus and the mechanism of its contagion of host cells. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, this work addressed the behavior of 2019-nCoV in two aspects: the binding affinity of its receptor binding domain (RBD) with ACE2, and its potential conformation preferences in its unbound state. The results showed that the RBD of 2019-nCov bound much stronger with ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV due to a better organized hydrogen bond network between the former pair with most of the residues at the contact interface sharing the responsibility to hold the pair tightly. This is in contrast to the case of SARS-CoV, which strongly relied on the residues at the ends of the cleft. In its unbound state, the RBD of 2019-nCoV was found to fold part of its receptor binding motif (RBM) into a helical conformation and flip into a concave to minimize its contact with the external environment. This has the biological implication that the virus may achieve higher translational motion in the condensed phase and have a higher chance of survival by avoiding capture by the immune system before reaching its target receptor.","Liu, Ziyi; Xia, Miaoren; Chai, Zhifang; Wang, Dongqi",PCCP.

METHODS: A case series of adult patients hospitalized for 2 or more nights from May 15 to June 15, 2020 at large tertiary-care hospital in the midwestern United States was reviewed. All patients were screened at admission with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Selected adult patients were also tested by IgG serology. After dismissal, patients with negative serology and PCR at admission were asked to undergo repeat serologic testing at 14-21 days after discharge. The primary outcome was healthcare-associated COVID-19 defined as a new positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on or after day 4 of hospital stay or within 7 days of hospital dismissal, or seroconversion in patients previously established as seronegative. RESULTS: Of the 2,068 eligible adult patients, 1,778 (86.0%) completed admission PCR testing, while 1,339 (64.7%) also completed admission serology testing. Of the 1,310 (97.8%) who were both PCR and seronegative, 445 (34.0%) repeated postdischarge serology testing. No healthcare-associated COVID-19 cases were detected during the study period. Of 1,310 eligible PCR and seronegative adults, no patients tested PCR positive during hospital admission (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0%-0.3%). Of the 445 (34.0%) who completed postdischarge serology testing, no patients seroconverted (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.9%). CONCLUSION: We found low likelihood of hospital-associated COVID-19 with strict adherence to universal masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene along with limited visitors and screening of admissions with PCR.","Habermann, Elizabeth B; Tande, Aaron J; Pollock, Benjamin D; Neville, Matthew R; Ting, Henry H; Sampathkumar, Priya",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,642

380150,Machine Learning Algorithms for Forecasting COVID 19 Confirmed Cases in America,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand had almost depleted its critical care resources, particularly intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. This prompted the necessity to develop a national guideline for resource allocation. This paper describes the development process of a national guideline for critical resource allocation in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The guideline development process consisted of three steps: (1) rapid review of existing rationing guidelines and literature; (2) interviews of Thai clinicians experienced in caring for COVID-19 cases; and (3) multi-stakeholder consultations. At steps 1 and 2, data was synthesized and categorized using a thematic and content analysis approach, and this guided the formulation of the draft guideline. Within step 3, the draft Thai critical care allocation guideline was debated and finalized before entering the policy-decision stage. RESULTS: Three-order prioritization criteria consisting of (1) clinical prognosis using four tools (Charlson Comorbidity Index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, frailty assessment and cognitive impairment assessment), (2) number of life-years saved and (3) social usefulness were proposed by the research team based on literature reviews and interviews. At consultations, stakeholders rejected using life-years as a criterion due to potential age and gender discrimination, as well as social utility due to a concern it would foster public distrust, as this judgement can be arbitrary. It was agreed that the attending physician is required to be the decision-maker in the Thai medico-legal context, while a patient review committee would play an advisory role. Allocation decisions are to be documented for transparency, and no appealing mechanism is to be applied. This guideline will be triggered only when demand exceeds supply after the utmost efforts to mobilize surge capacity. Once implemented, it is applicable to all patients, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, requiring critical care resources prior to ICU admission and during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The guideline development process for the allocation of critical care resources in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand was informed by scientific evidence, medico-legal context, existing norms and societal values to reduce risk of public distrust given the sensitive nature of the issue and ethical dilemmas of the guiding principle, though it was conducted at record speed. Our lessons can provide an insight for the development of similar prioritization guidelines, especially in other low- and middle-income countries.","Marshall, Aniqa Islam; Archer, Rachel; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan; Sirison, Kanchanok; Chotchoungchatchai, Somtanuek; Sriakkpokin, Pisit; Srisookwatana, Orapan; Teerawattananon, Yot; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",Health Res Policy Syst,,642

Though suspended 2D channel material has the potential to overcome scattering effects from the substrates but achieving reliability and selectivity, have been limiting the using of this biosensor technology. Here, we have demonstrated nanogap electrodes fabrication by using the self-assembly technique, which provides suspension to the 2D-MoS2. These nano-spacing electrodes not only give suspension but also provide robustness strength to the atomic layer, which remains freestanding after coating of the Hafnium oxide (HfO2) as well as linkers and antibodies. For evaluating the electrical characteristics of suspended MoS2 FET, gating potential was applied through an electrolyte on the suspended MoS2 transistor. This helped in achieved a lower subthreshold swing 70 mV/dec and ON/OFF ratio 107. Later, pH detection was conducted at room temperature, which showed an impressive sensitivity of ~880 by changing 1 unit of pH. We have also successfully shown Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria sensing from the suspended MoS2 transistor by functionalizing dielectric layer with E. coli antibodies. The reported biosensor has shown the ~9% of conductance changes with a lower concentration of E. coli (10 CFU/mL; colony-forming unit per mL) as well as maintain the constant sensitivity in three fabricated devices. The obtained enhancement in the sensitivity of devices and its effect on biomolecules detection can be extened to other biomolecules and this type of architecture has the potential to detect COVID-19 viruses based biomolecules.","Masurkar, Nirul; Thangavel, Naresh Kumar; Yurgelevic, Sally; Varma, Sundeep; Auner, Gregory W; Reddy Arava, Leela Mohana",Biosens Bioelectron,,642

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Iceland. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between 17 March and 30 April 2020. Cases were identified by three testing strategies: targeted testing guided by clinical suspicion, open invitation population screening based on self referral, and random population screening. All identified cases were enrolled in a telehealth monitoring service, and symptoms were systematically monitored from diagnosis to recovery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of one or more of 19 predefined symptoms during follow-up. RESULTS: Among 1564 people positive for SARS-CoV-2, the most common presenting symptoms were myalgia (55%), headache (51%), and non-productive cough (49%). At the time of diagnosis, 83 (5.3%) individuals reported no symptoms, of whom 49 (59%) remained asymptomatic during follow-up. At diagnosis, 216 (14%) and 349 (22%) people did not meet the case definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, respectively. Most (67%) of the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had mild symptoms throughout the course of their disease. CONCLUSION: In the setting of broad access to RT-PCR testing, most SARS-CoV-2-positive people were found to have mild symptoms. Fever and dyspnoea were less common than previously reported. A substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive people did not meet recommended case definitions at the time of diagnosis.","Eythorsson, Elias; Helgason, Dadi; Ingvarsson, Ragnar Freyr; Bjornsson, Helgi K; Olafsdottir, Lovisa Bjork; Bjarnadottir, Valgerdur; Runolfsdottir, Hrafnhildur Linnet; Bjarnadottir, Solveig; Agustsson, Arnar Snaer; Oskarsdottir, Kristin; Thorvaldsson, Hrafn Hliddal; Kristjansdottir, Gudrun; Armannsdottir, Brynja; Bjarnason, Agnar; Johannsson, Birgir; Gudlaugsson, Olafur; Gottfredsson, Magnus; Sigurdsson, Martin I; Indridason, Olafur S; Palsson, Runolfur",BMJ,,642

391270,Predicting Stress in Remote Learning via Advanced Deep Learning Technologies,2021-09-22,"Since the outset of COVID-19, the pandemic has prompted immediate global efforts to sequence SARS-CoV-2, and over 450â¯000 complete genomes have been publicly deposited over the course of 12 months. Despite this, comparative nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses often fall short in answering key questions in vaccine design. For example, the binding affinity between different ACE2 receptors and SARS-COV-2 spike protein cannot be fully explained by amino acid similarity at ACE2 contact sites because protein structure similarities are not fully reflected by amino acid sequence similarities. To comprehensively compare protein homology, secondary structure (SS) analysis is required. While protein structure is slow and difficult to obtain, SS predictions can be made rapidly, and a well-predicted SS structure may serve as a viable proxy to gain biological insight. Here we review algorithms and information used in predicting protein SS to highlight its potential application in pandemics research. We also showed examples of how SS predictions can be used to compare ACE2 proteins and to evaluate the zoonotic origins of viruses. As computational tools are much faster than wet-lab experiments, these applications can be important for research especially in times when quickly obtained biological insights can help in speeding up response to pandemics.","Kruglikov, Alibek; Rakesh, Mohan; Wei, Yulong; Xia, Xuhua",J Proteome Res,,642

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","Kruse, Robert L",F1000Res,,642

Physicians need to correctly approach this new disease, often representing a challenge in terms of differential diagnosis. Although COVID-19 lacks specific signs and symptoms, we believe internists should develop specific skills to recognize the disease, learning its 'semeiotic'. In this review article, we summarize the key clinical features that may guide in differentiating a COVID-19 case, requiring specific testing, from upper respiratory and/or influenza-like illnesses of other aetiology. We consider two different clinical settings, where availability of the different diagnostic strategies differs widely: outpatient and inpatient. Our reasoning highlights how challenging a balanced approach to a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms can be. At present, clinical workup of COVID-19 remains a hard task to accomplish.

However, many data sets that could inform science and policy during an emerging event do not exist or are only released months or years later. Here, we synthesize multiple data sources from across the seafood supply chain, including unconventional real-time data sets, to show the relative initial responses and indicators of recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. We synthesized news articles from January to September 2020 that reported effects of COVID-19 on the US seafood sector, including processor closures, shortened fishing seasons and loss of revenue. Concerning production and distribution, we assessed past and present landings and trade data and found substantial declines in fresh seafood catches (-40%), imports (-37%) and exports (-43%) relative to the previous year, while frozen seafood products were generally less affected. Google search trends and seafood market foot traffic data suggest consumer demand for seafood from restaurants dropped by upwards of 70% during lockdowns, with recovery varying by state. However, these declines were partially offset by an increase (270%) in delivery and takeout service searches. Our synthesis of open-access data sets and media reports shows widespread, but heterogeneous, ramifications of COVID-19 across the seafood sector, implying that policymakers should focus support on states and sub-sectors most affected by the pandemic: fishery-dependent communities, processors, and fisheries and aquaculture that focus on fresh products.","White, Easton R; Froehlich, Halley E; Gephart, Jessica A; Cottrell, Richard S; Branch, Trevor A; Agrawal Bejarano, Rahul; Baum, Julia K",,,642

The main reason why this disease spreads so many people in a short time is that the virus could be transmitted from an infected person to another by infected droplets. The new emergence of diseases usually may affect multiple organs; moreover, this disease is such an example. Numerous reported studies focus on acute or chronic organ damage caused by the virus. At this point, tissue engineering (TE) strategies can be used to treat the damages with its interdisciplinary approaches.

404142,Security Testing of Android Based Covid Tracer Applications,2020,"BACKGROUND: Long term care (LTC) facilities provide health services and assist residents with daily care. At times residents may require transfer to emergency departments (ED), depending on the severity of their change in health status, their goals of care, and the ability of the facility to care for medically unstable residents. However, many transfers from LTC to ED are unnecessary, and expose residents to discontinuity in care and iatrogenic harms. This knowledge translation project aims to implement a standardized LTC-ED care and referral pathway for LTC facilities seeking transfer to ED, which optimizes the use of resources both within the LTC facility and surrounding community. METHODS/DESIGN: We will use a quasi-experimental randomized stepped-wedge design in the implementation and evaluation of the pathway within the Calgary zone of Alberta Health Services (AHS), Canada. Specifically, the intervention will be implemented in 38 LTC facilities. The intervention will involve a standardized LTC-ED care and referral pathway, along with targeted INTERACT® tools. The implementation strategies will be adapted to the local context of each facility and to address potential implementation barriers identified through a staff completed barriers assessment tool. The evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach. The primary outcome will be any change in the rate of transfers to ED from LTC facilities adjusted by resident-days. Secondary outcomes will include a post-implementation qualitative assessment of the pathway. Comparative cost-analysis will be undertaken from the perspective of publicly funded health care. DISCUSSION: This study will integrate current resources in the LTC-ED pathway in a manner that will better coordinate and optimize the care for LTC residents experiencing an acute change in health status.","Munene, Abraham; Lang, Eddy; Ewa, Vivian; Hair, Heather; Cummings, Greta; McLane, Patrick; Spackman, Eldon; Faris, Peter; Zuzic, Nancy; Quail, Patrick B; George, Marian; Heinemeyer, Anne; Grigat, Daniel; McMillen, Mark; Reid, Shawna; Holroyd-Leduc, Jayna",BMC Health Serv Res,,642

Objective: To examine changes in health care use during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April of 2020 relative to March and April of 2019 and 2018, and to examine whether changes in use differ by patient's zip code-level race/ethnicity or income. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed health insurance claims for patients from all 50 US states who receive health insurance through their employers. Changes in use of preventive services, nonelective care, elective procedures, prescription drugs, in-person office visits, and telemedicine visits were examined during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 relative to existing trends in 2019 and 2018. Disparities in the association of the pandemic with health care use based on patient's zip code-level race and income were also examined. Results: Data from 5.6, 6.4, and 6.8 million US individuals with employer-sponsored insurance in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, were analyzed. Patient demographics were similar in all 3 years (mean [SD] age, 34.3 [18.6] years in 2018, 34.3 [18.5] years in 2019, and 34.5 [18.5] years in 2020); 50.0% women in 2018, 49.5% women in 2019, and 49.5% women in 2020). In March and April 2020, regression-adjusted use rate per 10â¯000 persons changed by -28.2 (95% CI, -30.5 to -25.9) and -64.5 (95% CI, -66.8 to -62.2) for colonoscopies; -149.1 (95% CI, -162.0 to -16.2) and -342.1 (95% CI, -355.0 to -329.2) for mammograms; -60.0 (95% CI, -63.3 to -54.7) and -118.1 (95% CI, -112.4 to -113.9) for hemoglobin A1c tests; -300.5 (95% CI, -346.5 to -254.5) and -369.0 (95% CI, -414.7 to -323.4) for child vaccines; -4.6 (95% CI, -5.3 to -3.9) and -10.9 (95% CI, -11.6 to -10.2) for musculoskeletal surgery; -1.1 (95% CI, -1.4 to -0.7) and -3.4 (95% CI, -3.8 to -3.0) for cataract surgery; -13.4 (95% CI, -14.6 to -12.2) and -31.4 (95% CI, -32.6 to -30.2) for magnetic resonance imaging; and -581.1 (95% CI, -612.9 to -549.3) and -1465 (95% CI, -1496 to -1433) for in-person office visits. Use of telemedicine services increased by 227.9 (95% CI, 221.7 to 234.1) per 10â¯000 persons and 641.6 (95% CI, 635.5 to 647.8) per 10â¯000 persons. Patients living in zip codes with lower-income or majority racial/ethnic minority populations experienced smaller reductions in in-person visits (&#8805;80% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 200.0 per 10â¯000 [95% CI, 128.9-270.1]; 79%-21% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 54.2 per 10â¯000 [95% CI, 33.6-74.9]) but also had lower rates of adoption of telemedicine (&#8805;80% racial/ethnic minority zip code: -71.6 per 10â¯000 [95% CI, -87.6 to -55.5]; 79%-21% racial/ethnic minority zip code: -15.1 per 10â¯000 [95% CI, -19.8 to -10.4]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of a large US population with employer-sponsored insurance, the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with dramatic reductions in the use of preventive and elective care. Use of telemedicine increased rapidly but not enough to account for reductions in in-person primary care visits. Race and income disparities at the zip code level exist in use of telemedicine.","Whaley, Christopher M; Pera, Megan F; Cantor, Jonathan; Chang, Jennie; Velasco, Julia; Hagg, Heather K; Sood, Neeraj; Bravata, Dena M",JAMA Netw Open,,642

We aimed to assess the association between prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation between February 12 and March 2, 2020. All patients were followed until death or March 28, and all survivors were followed for at least 30 days. RESULTS: For 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (±10.8) years, and 30 patients (83.3%) were men. Twenty-two (61.1%) patients received PIRRT (PIRRT group), and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed with conventional strategy (non-PIRRT group). There were no differences in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments, and most of the laboratory findings. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 (interquartile range 4.3-33.5) days, 13 of 22 (59.1%) patients in the PIRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in the non-PIRRT group died. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated prolonged survival in patients in the PIRRT group compared with that in the non-PIRRT group (p = 0.042). The association between PIRRT and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant in 3 different models, with adjusted hazard ratios varying from 0.332 to 0.398. Increased IL-2 receptor, TNF-&#945;, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, and NT-proBNP levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with PIRRT. CONCLUSION: PIRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.","Yang, Yi; Shi, Jia; Ge, Shuwang; Guo, Shuiming; Xing, Xue; Wang, Yanan; Cheng, Anying; Liu, Qingquan; Li, Junhua; Ning, Yong; He, Fan; Xu, Gang",Blood Purif,,642

We report the test results of three children with COVID-19 in a family cluster and assess the results of LAMP tests. The LAMP results of these children showed a sensitivity and specificity of 63.6% and 100%, respectively, that was relative to the RT-PCR results. LAMP tests using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were almost consistent throughout hospitalization in the school children, except in the very early stage of infection. The preliminary results suggest that salivary samples would be less sensitive than NPS for LAMP testing in the late stage of infection, and that LAMP would not provide accurate results in neonates.","Kubota, Kei; Nagakura, Ken-Ichi; Ebisawa, Motohiro; Kaneda, Goro; Yanagida, Noriyuki",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,642

409884,A brief discussion about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on teaching in colleges and universities of China,2020,"BACKGROUND: No published protocol to guide the withdrawal of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for patients with COVID-19 exists. CASE SERIES: Description of the introduction of a novel protocol, developed by consensus to guide the withdrawal of CPAP for patients diagnosed as dying with COVID-19 in an acute hospital. OUTCOME: 19 patients died on the high-dependency respiratory unit following treatment with CPAP. 89% died with CPAP withdrawn. The dying trajectory was difficult to predict. Symptoms were managed promptly and effectively with a combination of opioids, benzodiazepines and close medical supervision. No concerns were raised by families regarding the decision making or withdrawal process. DISCUSSION: The use of the protocol ensures a comfortable and dignified death and supports the delivery of individualised care at the end of life. Future research on this topic should focus on qualitative outcomes and consider the applicability of this protocol in other patient groups.","Webber, Natalie; Avari, Malcolm; Harridge, Georgina; Neerkin, Jane; Collis, Emily; Astin, Ronan",,,642

Sufficient testing for SARS-CoV-2 has remained essential for tracking and containing the virus. SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities are still limited in many countries. Here, we explore the use of conventional RNA purification as an alternative to automated systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. 87 clinical swab specimens were extracted by conventional phenol-chloroform RNA purification and compared to commercial platforms for RNA extraction and the fully integrated Cobas®6800 diagnostic system. Our results show that the conventional RNA extraction is fully comparable to modern automated systems regarding analytical sensitivity and specificity with respect to detection of SARS-CoV-2 as evaluated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, the method is easily scalable and implemented in conventional laboratories as a low cost and suitable alternative to automated systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Dimke, Henrik; Larsen, Sanne L; Skov, Marianne N; Larsen, Hanne; Hartmeyer, Gitte N; Moeller, Jesper B",PLoS One,,642

410832,Contact-Tracing based on Time-Varying Graphs Analysis,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, also known as COVID-19, has developed into an alarming situation around the world. Healthcare workers are playing the role of frontline defense to safeguard the lives of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate the anxiety levels and sleep quality among frontline and second-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, a validated, self-administered, electronic questionnaire was distributed through email to healthcare workers. The selection of 1678 healthcare workers was based on a convenience sampling technique. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument scales were used to assess healthcare workers' anxiety levels and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 1678 respondents, 1200 (71.5%) were frontline healthcare workers, while 478 (28.5%) were second-line healthcare workers. Among all the healthcare workers, 435 (25.92%) were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety. Among them, 713 (59.4%) frontline healthcare workers were experiencing anxiety in comparison with 277 (57.9%) second-line healthcare workers. Severe anxiety symptoms were seen in 137 (11.41%) frontline healthcare workers compared to 44 (9.20%) second-line healthcare workers. In total, 1376 (82.0%) healthcare workers were found to have poor sleep quality; 975 (58.10%) were frontline, and 407 (23.89%) were second-line healthcare workers. The highest poor sleep quality levels were found among 642 (84.6%) of the healthcare workers who work in frontline areas (emergency departments, intensive care units, and wards) compared to 734 (79.9%) of the healthcare workers who work in second-line areas. These findings provide a substantial contribution to the consolidation of evidence concerning the negative impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs). These results have established an association that the COVID-19 pandemic causes larger negative psychological symptoms in frontline healthcare workers, such as severe anxiety and poor sleep quality. Preventive measures to minimize anxiety levels and maintain sleep quality, addressing this issue nationally and globally, are essential to support the healthcare workers who are sacrificing their mental health for the future of our nations.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Alkhalifah, Joud Mohammed; Alshammari, Nouf Faisal; Alnufaie, Wejdan Saud",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,642
411562,Smart Technologies for COVID-19: The Strategic Approaches in Combating the Virus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite it is easily preventable; malaria is still remains to be a major public health problem in globally as well as in Ethiopia. The disease can be easily prevented through individual and societal combined efforts by keeping the environment safe, effective utilization of long lasting Insecticide Nets and early treatment. However, the factors for poor knowledge and practices of malaria prevention is not well studied in Ethiopia; particularly, in the study area. Hence, this study aimed to provide concrete evidence towards malaria prevention practices and associated factors among Households of Hawassa City Administration, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a randomly selected 598 households at Hawassa City Administration from April 1-15, 2020. Multistage sampling technique was employed to recruit the study households. Data were collected by trained data collectors through a face-to-face interview with pretested structured questionnaire, which was adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. Then the data were checked for the completeness and consistencies, then, coded and entered into Epi data 3.1 and it was exported to SPSS IBM version 23 for analysis. Descriptive mean with standard deviation was used to summarize the continuous variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess factors affecting prevention and control of Malaria. Finally, adjusted odds ratio together with 95% CI and p-value <0.05 was used to declare the statistical significances. RESULTS: The overall 317 (54.3%) of households practiced good measure of malaria prevention and control measures. Urban residence [AOR = 1.95 (95%CI: 1.17-3.24)], Secondary school completed [AOR = 5.02(95%CI 2.24-12.03)], Tertiary school completed [AOR = 7.27(95%CI: 2.84-18.55)], Positive Attitude [AOR = 8.20(95%CI: 5.31-12.68)] and Good knowledge about malaria [AOR = 2.81(95%CI: 1.78-4.44)] were significantly associated with malaria prevention practices. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the households were still practiced poor measure of malaria prevention and control measures. Hence, health officials and stake holders need attention by providing continuous health education and follow up to control malaria.","Fikrie, Anteneh; Kayamo, Mihiret; Bekele, Henok",PLoS One,,642

This expedited timetable for development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines is an unprecedented extraordinary, concerted achievement by the scientific community. With the pending global rollout of vaccines, each with different mechanisms of action, physicians of various specialties will need to identify vulnerable patient groups for special considerations or advice. In this commentary, we analyse the important considerations for COVID-19 vaccines in patients with inflammatory eye diseases. Scrutiny of immunogenicity and adverse effects, particularly antibody-dependent enhancement, would better help in counselling these patients undergoing vaccination.

411973,Extracurricular activities can play a central role in K-12 education,2021,"This article presents an empirical study on the institutional audiovisual mediatization of social sustainability made by the eighteen religious denominations officially recognized in Romania during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Research is undertaken based on the mediatization theories. Specifically, it highlights and discusses the conditions for producing the meaning of social sustainability as a result of religious mediatization during the months of March, April and May 2020, a period with strong religious connotations since it involved the dates of the major annual feasts celebrated by the three majority monotheistic religions, i.e., the Christian Easter, the Muslim Ramadan and the Jewish Passover. As a result, we noticed that the production of meaning in terms of social sustainability was simultaneously anchored in the accumulation of four contextual ""social worlds"": (a) that of social transformation induced by mediatization, (b) that of the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis that is neither social, economic, or environmental, but with consequences on the three levels of reality mentioned above, (c) that of spirituality during the time of the great monotheistic religious feasts and (d) that of the national culture of Romania, statistically the most religious country of the European Union.","Tudor, Mihaela Alexandra; Filimon Benea, Anamaria; Bratosin, Stefan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,642
412310,Artificial Neural Networks for Prediction of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia,2021,"INTRODUCTION: While chest x-rays (CXRs) represent a cost-effective imaging modality for developing countries like Pakistan, their utility for the prognostication of COVID-19 has been minimally explored. Thus, we describe the frequency and distribution of CXR findings, and their association with clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All adult (&#8805; 18 years) patients presenting between 28th February-31st May to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, who were COVID-19 positive on RT-PCR with CXR done on presentation, were included. A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0-8 was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being negative and 1-8 being positive. The patients' initial CXR-SS and their highest CXR-SS over the hospital course were used for analysis, with cut-offs of 0-4 and 5-8 being used to assess association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients, with 76.7% males and mean age 56.1 years, were included in this study. Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 5-8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136-1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143-1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5-8 (2.532 [1.109-5.782]) and highest CXR-SS 5-8 (3.386 [1.405-8.159]). Lastly, age (1.060 [1.009-1.113]), initial CXR-SS (1.278 [1.010-1.617]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731-14.710]), were found to be independent predictors of mortality in our patients. CONCLUSION: In a resource-constrained country like Pakistan, CXRs may have valuable prognostic utility in predicting ICU admission and mortality. Additional research with larger patient samples is needed to further explore the association of CXR findings with clinical outcomes.","Kaleemi, Raima; Hilal, Kiran; Arshad, Ainan; Martins, Russell Seth; Nankani, Avinash; Tu, Haq; Basharat, Sundas; Ansar, Zeeshan",PLoS One,,642

The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, since then several scientists are dedicated to its study. It has been observed that many human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on the host cell machinery for the replication and co-evolution. In this work, we analysed 91 molecular features and codon usage patterns for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677,873 codon positions. Hereby, we selected the highly expressed genes from human lung tissue to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with those of SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. The integrated analysis of all the features revealed that certain viral genes and overexpressed human genes have similar codon usage patterns. The main pattern was the A/T bias that together with other features could propitiate the viral infection, enhanced by a host dependant specialization of the translation machinery of only some of the overexpressed genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could be further benefited. This could be the key for a facilitated translation and viral replication conducting to different comorbidities depending on the genetic variability of population due to the host translation machinery. This is the first codon usage approach that reveals which human genes could be potentially deregulated due to the codon usage similarities between the host and the viral genes when the virus is already inside the human cells of the lung tissues. Our work leaded to the identification of additional highly expressed human genes which are not the usual suspects but might play a role in the viral infection and settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with new viral infections. To identify the genes that could be deregulated under a viral infection is important to predict the collateral effects and determine which individuals would be more susceptible based on their genetic features and comorbidities associated.","Maldonado, Lucas L; Bertelli, Andrea Mendoza; Kamenetzky, Laura",Sci Rep,,642
415108,An Event Correlation Filtering Method for Fake News Detection,2020-12-10,"Preliminary data suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with higher mortality among cancer patients, particularly in those on systemic therapy. It is unclear whether this applies to patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this case series, 74 patients from a single institution with genitourinary (GU) cancer on ICI were followed up during a 12-wk period. During this period, 11 patients (15%) developed symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and four (5%) tested positive. Two patients had metastatic urothelial cancer (treated with atezolizumab) and two had metastatic renal cancer (treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab). All had additional risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and two received steroids within 1 mo of infection. Two patients developed symptoms requiring hospitalisation. All four are alive 32-45 d after their first symptoms and 28-38 d after testing positive. These patients all had multiple risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. These data suggest that the higher risk of COVID-19 death associated with systemic therapy in cancer may not apply to patients on ICIs. Assessment of COVID-19 severity in these patients can be complicated by the underlying cancer and its treatment.","Szabados, Bernadett; Abu-Ghanem, Yasmin; Grant, Michael; Choy, Julia; Bex, Axel; Powles, Thomas",Eur Urol,,642

416479,Real vs Simulated Foveated Rendering to Reduce Visual Discomfort in Virtual Reality,2021-07-04,"Importance: Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) have been implicated in sinonasal innate immunity, and genetic variation conferred by allelic variants in T2R genes is associated with variation in upper respiratory tract pathogen susceptibility, symptoms, and outcomes. Bitter taste receptor phenotype appears to be associated with the clinical course and symptom duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Objective: To evaluate the association between T2R phenotype and patient clinical course after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study was performed from July 1 through September 30, 2020, at a tertiary outpatient clinical practice and inpatient hospital in the United States among 1935 participants (patients and health care workers) with occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Exposure: Exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants underwent T2R38 phenotype taste testing to determine whether they were supertasters (those who experienced greater intensity of bitter tastes), tasters, or nontasters (those who experienced low intensity of bitter tastes or no bitter tastes) and underwent evaluation for lack of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and IgM and IgG testing. A group of participants was randomly selected for genotype analysis to correlate phenotype. Participants were followed up until confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via PCR testing. Phenotype of T2R38 was retested after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The results were compared with clinical course. Results: A total of 1935 individuals (1101 women [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.5 [13.9] years) participated in the study. Results of phenotype taste testing showed that 508 (26.3%) were supertasters, 917 (47.4%) were tasters, and 510 (26.4%) were nontasters. A total of 266 participants (13.7%) had positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 55 (20.7%) required hospitalization. Symptom duration among patients with positive results ranged from 0 to 48 days. Nontasters were significantly more likely than tasters and supertasters to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 10.1 [95% CI, 5.8-17.8]; P < .001), to be hospitalized once infected (odds ratio, 3.9 [1.5-10.2]; P = .006), and to be symptomatic for a longer duration (mean [SE] duration, 23.7 [0.5] days vs 13.5 [0.4] days vs 5.0 [0.6] days; P < .001). A total of 47 of 55 patients (85.5%) with COVID-19 who required inpatient admission were nontasters. Conversely, 15 of 266 patients (5.6%) with positive PCR test results were supertasters. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests that T2R38 receptor allelic variants were associated with participants' innate immune response toward SARS-CoV-2. The T2R phenotype was associated with patients' clinical course after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nontasters were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the other 2 groups, suggesting enhanced innate immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Barham, Henry P; Taha, Mohamed A; Broyles, Stephanie T; Stevenson, Megan M; Zito, Brittany A; Hall, Christian A",JAMA Netw Open,,642

METHODS: Cases were collected from three paediatric surgical wards. Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed. RESULTS: All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis. Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation. Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs 11%, P-value .06). CONCLUSION: The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common paediatric medical conditions. We believe caregivers and healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.","Snapiri, Ori; Rosenberg Danziger, Chen; Krause, Irit; Kravarusic, Dragan; Yulevich, Alon; Balla, Uri; Bilavsky, Efraim",Acta Paediatr,,642
423055,Forecasting COVID-19 Pandemic Using Optimal Singular Spectrum Analysis,2020,"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain neglected in the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) (i.e. plasma collected from individuals after their recovery from COVID-19) has emerged as a leading medical treatment for COVID-19. Studies to date support the safety-and increasingly the efficacy-of CCP to treat COVID-19. This has motivated large-scale procurement and transfusion of CCP, notably in the United States (US), where inventories of CCP have been attained, and government-supported stockpiling of CCP is underway. CCP is a therapy that could be implemented in LMICs. However, systemic and transfusion-specific challenges (e.g. capacity for donor mobilization and collections) impede local procurement of this resource in sufficient volumes to meet clinical demand. This raises the question as to whether there are strategies to facilitate sharing of CCP with LMICs and/or bolstering local capacity for collection to contend with the health crisis. While compelling, there are cost-related, logistical and regulatory barriers to both approaches. For one, there is complexity in diverting national interest (e.g. in the US) away from an epidemic that displays few signs of abating. There are also concerns regarding equitable distribution of CCP in LMICs and how that might be overcome. Further, the barriers to blood donation in general apply to collection of CCP; these obstacles are longstanding, accounting for the inability of many LMICs to meet their blood transfusion needs. Nonetheless, CCP affords dual opportunity for humanitarian outreach while tackling a broader challenge of blood transfusion safety and availability.","Bloch, Evan M; Goel, Ruchika; Montemayor, Celina; Cohn, Claudia; Tobian, Aaron A R",Transfus Apher Sci,,642

METHODS: The throat swab samples from 40 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 16 hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients were recruited. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in throat swab samples with RT-PCR test kits from Sansure Biotech (""Sansure"" for short), Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies (""Bioperfectus"" for short) and BGI Genomics (""BGI"" for short). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Kappa value were analyzed. The viral nucleic acid was extracted from the throat swab samples by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods, and the efficacy of two extraction methods was also compared. The results of magnetic bead method for nucleic acid extraction by two different extractors (Sansure Natch CS S12C Fully Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System vs. Tianlong NP968-C Nucleic Acid Extractor) were also compared. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and kappa value were 95.00%, 87.50%, 95.00%, 87.50%and 0.825 for Sansure kit; 90.00%, 87.50%, 94.74%, 77.78%and 0.747 for the Bioperfectus kit, and 82.50%, 81.25%, 91.67%, 65.00%and 0.593 for the BGI kit, respectively. The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods were 95.24%, 100.00%, 96.43%and 0.909, respectively, but the one-step cleavage method took only 25 min, while the magnetic bead method required 180 min. The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by the two different nucleic acid extractors were 85.00%, 100.00%, 89.29% and 0.764, respectively.

Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method was used to assess the relationship between symptom onset and Ct-values. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to visualise the empirical probability of detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) over time and estimate the time until clearance of viral RNA among the repeatedly tested patients. Among 721 reported COVID-19 cases, the viral RNA was detected in specimens taken between three days before and up to 48 days after symptom onset. The mean Ct-value was 28.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 28.2-29.0) with the lowest mean Ct-value (26.2) observed two days after symptom onset. Up to 7 days after symptom onset, the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR among repeatedly sampled patients (n = 208) remained above 90% and decreased to 50% at day 12 (95% CI 10.5-21.5). Our data provide valuable estimates to optimise the timing of sampling of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A considerable proportion of specimens sampled before symptom onset had Ct-values comparable with Ct-values after symptom onset, suggesting the probability of presymptomatic transmission.","Woudenberg, Tom; Eberle, Ute; Marosevic, Durdica; Liebl, Bernhard; Ackermann, Nikolaus; Katz, Katharina; Sing, Andreas",Epidemiol Infect,,642

OBJECTIVE: To assess demographics, comorbid conditions, and clinical factors associated with critical illness and mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a public hospital in New York City (NYC) during the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to NYC Health + Hospitals / Bellevue Hospital from March 9th to April 8th, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Primary analyses were conducted among those requiring supplemental oxygen (n = 270); half of these patients (135) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A majority were male (67.4%) and the median age was 58 years. Approximately one-third (32.6%) of hypoxic patients managed outside the ICU required non-rebreather or non-invasive ventilation. Requirement of renal replacement therapy occurred in 42.3% of ICU patients without baseline end-stage renal disease. Overall, 30-day mortality among hypoxic patients was 28.9% (53.3% in the ICU, 4.4% outside the ICU). In adjusted analyses, risk factors associated with mortality included dementia (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.11 95%CI 1.50-2.96), age 65 or older (aRR 1.97, 95%CI 1.31-2.95), obesity (aRR 1.37, 95%CI 1.07-1.74), and male sex (aRR 1.32, 95%CI 1.04-1.70). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 demonstrated severe morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Modifications in care delivery outside the ICU allowed the hospital to effectively care for a surge of critically ill and severely hypoxic patients.","Filardo, Thomas D; Khan, Maria R; Krawczyk, Noa; Galitzer, Hayley; Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Coffee, Megan; Schaye, Verity E; Eckhardt, Benjamin J; Cohen, Gabriel M",PLoS One,,642
425140,A deep learning approach for improved segmentation of lesions related to covid-19 chest CT scans,2021,"Introduction. Teaching surgical skills has historically been a hands-on activity, with instructors and learners in close physical proximity. This paradigm was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring innovative solutions to surmount the challenges of teaching surgical skills remotely. In this work, we describe our institution's path and early results of developing an interactive remote surgical skills course for medical students in the surgical clerkship. Methods. 31 third-year medical students were distributed a set of surgical equipment and 3D printed phone dock. Each participant completed a baseline questionnaire and underwent 3 structured interactive remote sessions on surgical instruments, knot tying, and suturing techniques. Students were instructed on sharing their first-person viewpoint and received real-time feedback on their knot tying and suturing techniques from the course instructor. Pre- and post-session surveys were conducted and analyzed. Results. All students were able to complete the remote surgical skills course successfully, as defined by visually demonstrating successful two-handed knot and simple suture techniques. Students' aggregate confidence score in their knot tying ability (pretest mean 7.9, SD 0.7 vs posttest mean 9.7, SD 0.9, t-statistic -2.3, P = .03) and suturing ability (pretest mean 8.0, SD 1.3 vs posttest mean 13.8, SD 0.9 t-statistic -5.5, P < .001) significantly improved after the intervention. Qualitative feedback from the students underscored the utility of the first-person perspective for teaching surgical technique. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that remote teaching of knot tying and simple suturing to medical students can be effectively implemented using a remote learning curriculum that was well received by the learners.","Quaranto, Brian R; Lamb, Michael; Traversone, John; Hu, Jinwei; Lukan, James; Cooper, Clairice; Schwaitzberg, Steven",Surg Innov,,642
425182,COVID-19 and Learning Styles: GCET as Case Study,2021,"We examine the uneven social and spatial distributions of COVID-19 and their relationships with indicators of social vulnerability in the U.S. epicenter, New York City (NYC). As of July 17th, 2020, NYC, despite having only 2.5% of the U.S. population, has ∼6% of all confirmed cases, and ∼16% of all deaths, making it a key learning ground for the social dynamics of the disease. Our analysis focuses on the multiple potential social, economic, and demographic drivers of disproportionate impacts in COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as population rates of testing. Findings show that immediate impacts of COVID-19 largely fall along lines of race and class. Indicators of poverty, race, disability, language isolation, rent burden, unemployment, lack of health insurance, and housing crowding all significantly drive spatial patterns in prevalence of COVID-19 testing, confirmed cases, death rates, and severity. Income in particular has a consistent negative relationship with rates of death and disease severity. The largest differences in social vulnerability indicators are also driven by populations of people of color, poverty, housing crowding, and rates of disability. Results highlight the need for targeted responses to address injustice of COVID-19 cases and deaths, importance of recovery strategies that account for differential vulnerability, and provide an analytical approach for advancing research to examine potential similar injustice of COVID-19 in other U.S. cities.Significance Statement Communities around the world have variable success in mitigating the social impacts of COVID-19, with many urban areas being hit particularly hard. Analysis of social vulnerability to COVID-19 in the NYC, the U.S. national epicenter, shows strongly disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on low income populations and communities of color. Results highlight the class and racial inequities of the coronavirus pandemic in NYC, and the need to unpack the drivers of social vulnerability. To that aim, we provide a replicable framework for examining patterns of uneven social vulnerability to COVID-19- using publicly available data which can be readily applied in other study regions, especially within the U.S.A. This study is important to inform public and policy debate over strategies for short- and long-term responses that address the injustice of disproportionate impacts of COVID-19.

425233,Identifying Morality Frames in Political Tweets using Relational Learning,2021-09-09,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has similarities to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, as severe patients and non-survivors have frequently shown abnormal coagulation profiles. Immune-mediated pathology is a key player in this disease; hence, the role of the complement system needs assessment. The complement system and the coagulation cascade share an intricate network, where multiple mediators maintain a balance between both pathways. Coagulopathy in COVID-19, showing mixed features of complement-mediated and consumption coagulopathy, creates a dilemma in diagnosis and management. AREAS COVERED: Pathophysiology of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on D-dimer and its role in predicting the severity of COVID-19 has been discussed. A comprehensive search of the medical literature on PubMed was done till May 30th, 2020 with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Coronavirus', 'Coagulopathy', and 'D-dimer'. Twenty-two studies were taken for weighted pooled analysis of D-dimer. EXPERT OPINION: A tailored anticoagulant regimen, including intensification of standard prophylactic regimens with low-molecular-weight heparin is advisable for COVID-19 patients. Atypical manifestations and varying D-dimer levels seen in different populations bring forth the futility of uniform recommendations for anticoagulant therapy. Further, direct thrombin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors in a patient-specific manner should also be considered.","Tomo, Sojit; Kumar, Kiran Pvsn; Roy, Dipayan; Sankanagoudar, Shrimanjunath; Purohit, Purvi; Yadav, Dharamveer; Banerjee, Mithu; Sharma, Praveen; Misra, Sanjeev",Expert Rev Hematol,,642

Chronic stress impairs a myriad of prefrontal cortical functions, important for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, and has consequences on dyadic parent-child functioning. Informed by neuroscience and clinical evidence, sensitive parenting is a vital avenue of intervention that buffers against the toxic effects of COVID-19 on parent-child mental health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we first discuss the neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms behind exacerbated mental health risks in families. We then highlight the role of sensitive parenting as a buffer against stress-related mental health problems, and conclude with recommendations for systemic-, family-, and individual-interventions to most effectively address stress-related mental health problems and their impact on children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Clinical protocols of COVID-19 registered at the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry and clinicaltrials.gov before February 17, 2020 were collected and the type, distribution, design and interventions of the studies were analyzed.RESULTS:A total of 172 trials were retrieved, mainly distributed in Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Beijing. Among the 120 interventional studies, chemical drugs and biological products accounted for 45%, traditional Chinese medicine or integrative medicine therapy accounted for 40%, cell therapy accounted for 7%, and plasma therapy accounted for 2%. There were only 13 randomized, blinded and placebo controlled studies, accounting for 11%. Blank control reached 46% (control group with clinical routine treatment without placebo,test group with clinical routine treatment as the basic). HIV and antimalarial drugs were the most frequently used. CONCLUSION: Chinese clinical research capacity and awareness have been greatly improved, but it is somewhat disordered. It is necessary to pay attention to the necessity, scientific nature, ethics and quality management of clinical research. It is recommended to initiate clinical trials coordinated and unified demonstration and to collect the national case information for big data analysis by the state during an emergency outbreak.","Xiang, Yuxia; Zeng, Chan; Huang, Zhijun; Wang, Xiaomin; Zhang, Zeyu; Yang, Guoping",Chinese J.

434704,Machine learning framework for covid-19 diagnosis,2021,"The recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has posed formidable challenges for clinical laboratories seeking reliable laboratory diagnostic confirmation. The swift advance of the crisis in the United States has led to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) facilitating the availability of molecular diagnostic assays without the more rigorous examination to which tests are normally subjected prior to FDA approval. Our laboratory currently uses two real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. The two platforms demonstrate comparable performances; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 h and 45 min, respectively. In search for a platform with a shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID Now COVID-19 assay, which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 min. We present here the results of comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media and comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media for Cepheid and dry nasal swabs for Abbott ID Now. Regardless of method of collection and sample type, Abbott ID Now COVID-19 had negative results in a third of the samples that tested positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress when using nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media and 45% when using dry nasal swabs.","Basu, Atreyee; Zinger, Tatyana; Inglima, Kenneth; Woo, Kar-Mun; Atie, Onome; Yurasits, Lauren; See, Benjamin; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria E",J. clin. microbiol,,642
437930,Analysis of the mitigation strategies for COVID-19: From mathematical modelling perspective,2020,"The Vero cell line is the most used continuous cell line in viral vaccine manufacturing. This adherent cell culture platform requires the use of surfaces to support cell growth, typically roller bottles, or microcarriers. We have recently compared the production of rVSV-ZEBOV on Vero cells between microcarrier and fixed-bed bioreactors. However, suspension cultures are considered superior with regard to process scalability. Therefore, we further explore the Vero suspension system for recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-vectored vaccine production. Previously, this suspension cell line was only able to be cultivated in a proprietary medium. Here, we expand the adaptation and bioreactor cultivation to a serum-free commercial medium. Following small-scale optimization and screening studies, we demonstrate bioreactor productions of highly relevant vaccines and vaccine candidates against Ebola virus disease, HIV, and coronavirus disease 2019 in the Vero suspension system. rVSV-ZEBOV, rVSV-HIV, and rVSVInd -msp-SF -Gtc can replicate to high titers in the bioreactor, reaching 3.87 × 107 TCID50 /ml, 2.12 × 107 TCID50 /ml, and 3.59 × 109 TCID50 /ml, respectively. Furthermore, we compare cell-specific productivities, and the quality of the produced viruses by determining the ratio of total viral particles to infectious viral particles.","Kiesslich, Sascha; Kim, Gyoung N; Shen, Chun F; Kang, C Yong; Kamen, Amine A",Biotechnol. bioeng,,642

438917,"COVID-19 information retrieval with deep-learning based semantic search, question answering, and abstractive summarization",2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a threat to ongoing clinical trials necessitating regular face-to-face, in-person meetings, particularly in participants with a high risk of complications. Guidance on how to handle and safely continue such trials is lacking. Chronically ill elderly individuals require-in addition to protection from infection-regular physical exercise and social contact to remain healthy. Solutions on how to handle these conflicting necessities are needed. The ENTAIER-randomised controlled trial was investigating the influence of mindful movements on fall risk, fear of falling, mobility, balance, life quality, and other outcomes. The study population was planned to comprise of 550 chronically ill elderly individuals with a high risk of falling. The movements were regularly performed in coached groups over 6 months. After the trial began, COVID-19 lockdowns stopped all in-person meetings, and it was expected that the limitations of this pandemic would continue for a long term. Therefore, the exercise programme, which involved complex movements and was typically conducted face-to-face in groups, had to be substituted by a telemedicine programme within a short timeframe. The objectives, therefore, were to identify challenges and tasks that could to be resolved and steps that could to be taken to achieve high-quality, efficacy, safety, and enable human encounter and motivation. METHODS: We proceeded with four steps: 1) A literature review on the quality and feasibility issues of telemedicine in general, and specifically, in exercise training in elderly individuals. 2) Participation in two international telemedicine task forces on integrative medicine, particularly, mind-body medicine. 3) Interviews with study therapists, (for practical purposes, eurythmy therapists and Tai Chi teachers are summarized here as therapists) personnel, and international experts on providing mindful movement exercises and other physiotherapies via live telecommunication technology, and with scientists and patient representatives. 4) Final evaluation by the core trial team and subsequent planning and implementation of changes in the trial organisation. RESULTS: Various tasks and challenges were identified: for the technical equipment for therapists and patients; for the ability of therapists and trial participants to adequately manage the technology and telemedicine intervention; the reservations and concerns about the technology among therapists and participants; safety and data protection in using the technology; and study design. The two major options found on how to continue the trial in the COVID-19 situation were a complete switch to telemedicine and a partial switch in the form of risk management implemented into the former design. CONCLUSIONS: The management of an ongoing clinical trial in a national or international crisis with a minimum of available time and extra financial resources, alongside with two checklists on steps and procedures for trial continuation and telemedicine implementation, may be informative for other researchers or healthcare providers faced with similar challenges and making similar decisions in the current situation or similar future scenarios.

439598,Mobile Application for Registration and Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases: a Review of the Scientific Literature between 2010 and 2020,2020,"PURPOSE: Dyadic leadership models, in which two professionals jointly lead and share unit responsibilities, exemplifies a recent trend in health care. Nonetheless, much remains unknown about their benefits and drawbacks. In order to understand their potential impact, we conducted a review of literature evaluating dyad leadership models in health systems. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Our narrative review began with a search of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus using key terms related to dyads and leadership. The search yielded 307 articles. We screened titles/abstracts according to these criteria: (1) focus on dyadic leadership model, i.e. physician-nurse or clinician-administrator, (2) set in health care environment and (3) peer-reviewed with an evaluative component of dyadic model. This yielded 22 articles for full evaluation, of which six were relevant for this review. FINDINGS: These six articles contribute an assessment of (1) teamwork and communication perceptions and their changes through dyad implementation, (2) dyad model functionality within the health system, (3) lessons learned from dyad model implementation and (4) dyad model adoption and model fidelity. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Research in this area remains nascent, and most articles focused on implementation over evaluation. It is possible that some articles were excluded due to our methodology, which excluded nonEnglish articles. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Findings provide guidance for health care organizations seeking to implement dyadic leadership models. Rigorous studies are needed to establish the impact of dyadic leadership models on quality and patient outcomes. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This review consolidates evidence surrounding the implementation and evaluation of a leadership model gaining prominence in health care.","Clouser, Jessica Miller; Vundi, Nikita Leigh; Cowley, Amy Mitchell; Cook, Christopher; Williams, Mark Vincent; McIntosh, Megan; Li, Jing",J. health organ. manag,,642

Patients and Methods: A total of 90 patients undergoing elective unilateral knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia combined with femoral nerve block were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal saline group (group S), rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg group (group L), and rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg group (group H). The primary outcome was the expression of dystrophin in skeletal muscle at 60 min after ischemia. Secondary outcomes included the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in blood at 5 min and 30 min after reperfusion. In addition, thigh girth at 24 h and 48 h after operation, the leaving bed time, the incidence of tourniquet-related hypertension and short-term (3 days after operation) complications (nausea and vomiting, swelling, blister, wound infection) and long-term (3 months after operation) complications (joint instability, stiffness, nerve paralysis, pain) were recorded. Main Results: The expression of dystrophin in the rocuronium group was higher than that in group S after ischemia (P <0.05). The concentration of MDA in the rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg group was lower at 30 min after reperfusion (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in nNOS among groups at each time point (P > 0.05). The change of thigh girth was the smallest in the rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg group after operation (P<0.05). The leaving bed time was significantly earlier after operation in the rocuronium group than that in group S (P <0.05). Conclusion: Rocuronium can protect skeletal muscle from ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by tourniquet. The mechanism may be related to the fact that rocuronium can reduce the loss of dystrophin in skeletal muscle and have the effects of anti-oxidation and anti-stress.

Their relation to COVID-19, however, is still a novel research topic. Thus, we investigated if COVID-19 parameters are higher in cities with higher urbanization, worst socio-economic conditions, and less vegetation cover, considering 3,052 municipalities in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Brazil is the second country most affected by COVID-19, and the Atlantic Forest is its most urbanized, populous, and deforested region. Indexes were created through multivariate principal components analysis using secondary official data: population, demographic density, absolute built area, and relative built area as urbanization parameters; average per capita income, relative people vulnerable to poverty, illiteracy rate of the population aged 18 or over, and human development index (HDI) as socio-economic parameters; and absolute and relative vegetation cover, absolute and relative forest cover as eco-environmental parameters. These indexes were correlated with absolute and relative confirmed COVID-19 cases, absolute and relative confirmed deaths, and mortality rate via Spearman's and Kendall's coefficients. Strong correlations (>0.50) were found between COVID-19 and urbanization. Socio-economic and eco-environmental aspects, although weaker predictors of COVID-19, presented meaningful relations with the health parameters.

Currently, there is a lack of data on the short- and long-term impacts of this. Wesought to examine the effects of the interruption of care due to COVID-19 on sinus and skull base surgery patientoutcomes. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted examining outcomes and healthcare utilization of patients at our institutionwho underwent sinus or skull base surgery in February and March of 2020, and who experienced an interruption inpostoperative care due to the pandemic. We then compared these measures with those of patients from the same timeperiod in 2019, who did not experience an interruption in care. Patient characteristics including age, indication for surgery,extent of surgery, polyps, preoperative Lund-Mackay and sinonasal outcome (SNOT22) scores and history of prior sinus orskull base surgery were recorded. Study outcomes included 3 and 6 month postoperative SNOT22 and Modified Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores, antibiotic usage, sinonasal debridements performed, and number of telephone calls andtelehealth visits in the postoperative period. Results: A total of 107 patients were included. Of the SNOT22 scores available, the average change between preoperativeand 3 month postoperative SNOT22 scores for 2020 ( n = 15) compared to 2019 patients ( n = 30) was not significantlydifferent (a decrease of 17.27 and 19.93, respectively;p = 0.68). The average change between preoperative and 6-monthpostoperative SNOT22 scores for 2020 ( n = 13) compared to 2019 patients ( n = 26) was also not significantly different (adecrease of 18.69 and 20.77, respectively;p = 0.75). The average number of oral postoperative antibiotics received did notsignificantly differ between 2020 ( n = 52) and 2019 ( n = 55) cohorts (0.18 vs. 0.09, respectively;p = 0.53). The averagenumber of postoperative telephone calls did not significantly differ between 2020 and 2019 patients (1.51 vs. 1.19;p = 0.95). Patients in 2019 received an average of 2.35 postoperative sinonasal debridements compared to 1.90 in 2020 ( p =0.03). The average number of postoperative telehealth visits for 2020 patients was 0.72.

We check the validity of this comparison in terms of accuracy and definitions and suggest expanding its scope to include expanded financial data of the 2 Medicare systems. STUDY DESIGN: Using annual Medicare Boards of Trustees and National Health Expenditure Accounts data from CMS and health insurers' financial statement data, we compare the level and percentage of the administrative expenses of the Medicare systems and show incompatible and not reconcilable definitions of administrative expenses. We expand our analysis to income, benefits, gains and losses, and loss ratios of the programs. METHODS: Our methodology is a careful comparison of categories of expenses between public and private insurers using official data sources. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative. RESULTS: We validate the low administrative expenses of Medicare parts A, B, and D (1.35% of benefits in 2018) compared with Medicare Part C (10.86% of benefits without loss adjustment expenses [LAE] and 14.84% with LAE for 2018). Expanding the focus, the income and benefits per beneficiary grew faster and larger in Medicare parts A, B, and D than in Medicare Part C-a reversal of earlier trends. The public Medicare program suffered losses in 11 years during 2002-2018, whereas private insurers' Medicare remained solvent with about an 85% loss ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of the systems in the United States would benefit from expanding the focus beyond incomparable administrative expenses.

Current day experience with structural racism and research abuses like Tuskegee Study collectively influence our perception of biased healthcare system. We outline issues and propose solutions that must be addressed to achieve a successful vaccination agenda. Mishandling of public expectations at any point may lead to an avalanche of vaccine opposition which might be unrecoverable.","Kirksey, Lee; Sorour, Ahmed A; Modlin, Charles",J. natl. med. assoc,,642
451275,FTM-IoMT: Fuzzy-Based Trust Management for Preventing Sybil Attacks in Internet of Medical Things,2021,"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is an impaction of the autonomic nervous system initiating orthostatic tachycardia. There are numerous triggers for POTS including viruses, vaccines, and an autoimmune basis. This case report is clinically relevant to better understand the pathophysiology behind the messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the mechanism that triggers autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Furthermore, the overall goal of this case study is to report a unique side effect associated with the novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. A 42-year-old male, with no prior symptoms of sinus tachycardia and presyncope episodes, is diagnosed with POTS secondary to the first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Symptoms to this date include sinus tachycardia, dizziness, headaches, and fatigue that are often triggered after a large meal or standing for a longer duration. Numerous diagnostic tests and images failed to confirm any other diagnosis other than POTS. There was a sequential connection between the onset of symptoms approximately one week after taking the first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Currently, POTS in this patient is controlled by lifestyle modification. This case report has broader implications as it can help us understand how the mRNA vaccine works on the body relative to the immune system. Our theory is that the development of antibodies activates an autoimmune reaction that triggers POTS disease. The prevalence of the POTS dysautonomia post-vaccination will be clearer as more data and research are conducted on the side effects from the innovative mRNA vaccines created to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Reddy, S.; Arora, M.",Cureus,,642
452721,MaskIt: Masking for efficient utilization of incomplete public datasets for training deep learning models,2020-06-22,"Here we report a study of the polymer chain/nanocrystal ordering in thin films (nanolayers) of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and blends of P3HT with a soluble fullerene derivative. A detailed analysis has been made of two dimensional (2D) grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements with synchrotron radiation. P3HT samples with three different levels of regioregularity (RR) were synthesized and used to investigate the influence of RR on the chain ordering in thin films. Blend films were also prepared to investigate the influence of fullerene molecule addition on chain ordering. For the analysis, one dimensional (1D) GIXRD patterns were extracted from the 2D images for varying azimuthal angles, allowing information to be obtained for chain ordering in both the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions. These results show that the degree of P3HT chain ordering is strongly affected by RR, and that thermal annealing improves chain ordering in the OOP direction. This observation is in good agreement with high resolution transmission electron microscope measurements of film nanomorphology.","Kim, Youngkyoo; Nelson, Jenny; Durrant, James R; Bradley, Donal D C; Heo, Kyuyoung; Park, Jinwoo; Kim, Hwajeong; McCulloch, Iain; Heeney, Martin; Ree, Moonhor; Ha, Chang-Sik",Soft Matter,,642

Previous studies reported an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. This systematic review aims to describe the clinical features and etiological characteristics of ischemic stroke patients with CO-VID-19 infection. METHOD: A literature search was performed in principal databases for studies and case reports containing data concerning risk factors, clinical features, and etiological characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 and suffering from stroke. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 14 articles were included for a total of 93 patients. Median age was 65 (IQR: 55-75) years with prevalence in males. Stroke occurred after a median of 6 days from COVID-19 infection diagnosis. Median National of Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19. Cryptogenic (Cry) strokes were more frequent (51.8%), followed by cardioembolic etiology, and they occurred a long time after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with large-artery atherosclerosis strokes (ptrend: 0.03). The clinical severity of stroke was significantly associated with the severity grade of COVID-19 infection (ptrend: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19-infected patients were clinically severe, affecting younger patients mainly with Cry and cardioembolic etiologies. Further multicenter prospective registries are needed to better describe the causal association and the effect of COVID-19 infection on stroke.","Vidale, Simone",Cerebrovasc Dis,,642

Milk removal during breastfeeding can be impacted by infant and maternal factors other than NS use. The aim of this study was to control electric breast pump vacuum strength, pattern and duration across multiple study sessions to determine if NS use reduces milk removal from the breast. METHODS: A within-subject study with two groups of breastfeeding mothers (infants < 6 months) were recruited; Control Group (CG): no breastfeeding difficulties; Pain Group (PG) used NS for persistent nipple pain. Mothers completed three randomised 15 min pumping sessions using the Symphony vacuum curve (Medela AG); no NS, fitted NS, and a small NS. Sessions were considered valid where the applied vacuum was within 20 mmHg of the set vacuum. Milk removal was considered as pumped milk volume, and also percentage of available milk removed (PAMR), which is calculated as the pumped volume divided by the estimated milk volume stored in the breast immediately prior to pumping. RESULTS: Of 62 sessions (all: n = 31 paired sessions) a total of 11 paired sessions from both PG (n = 03) and CG (n = 08) were valid (subset) with and without a fitted NS. Only 2 small shield sessions were valid and so all small shield measurements were excluded. Both pumped volumes and PAMR were significantly lower with NS use for all data but not for subset data. (All: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 76.5 mL, 69%, Fitted NS: 32.1 mL, 41% respectively (volume p = 0.002, PAMR p = 0.002); Subset: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 83.8 mL, 72%; Fitted NS: 35.2 mL, 40% (volume p = 0.111 and PAMR p = 0.045). The difference in PAMR, but not volume, was statistically significant when analysed by linear mixed modelling. A decrease of 10 mmHg was associated with a 4.4% increase in PAMR (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental data suggests that nipple shield use may reduce milk removal. Close clinical monitoring of breastfeeding mothers using nipple shields is warranted.","Coentro, Viviane Silva; Perrella, Sharon Lisa; Lai, Ching Tat; Rea, Alethea; Murray, Kevin; Geddes, Donna Tracy",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,642

466787,A Social IoT-Driven Pedestrian Routing Approach during Epidemic Time,2020,"With rapid transmission, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to over 2 million deaths worldwide, posing significant societal challenges. Understanding the spatial patterns of patient visits and detecting the local spreading events are crucial to controlling disease outbreaks. We analyze highly detailed COVID-19 contact tracing data collected from Seoul, which provides a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism of patient visit occurrence. Analyzing contact tracing data is challenging because patient visits show strong clustering patterns while clusters of events may have complex interaction behavior. To account for such behaviors, we develop a novel interaction Neyman-Scott process that regards the observed patient visit events as offsprings generated from a parent spreading event. Inference for such models is complicated since the likelihood involves intractable normalizing functions. To address this issue, we embed an auxiliary variable algorithm into our Markov chain Monte Carlo. We fit our model to several simulated and real data examples under different outbreak scenarios and show that our method can describe spatial patterns of patient visits well. We also provide visualization tools that can inform public health interventions for infectious diseases such as social distancing.","Park, J.; Chang, W.; Choi, B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02999v1.pdf,642
469918,Spatial-Temporal Pattern of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) in Europe,2020,"The Eu2+/3+ mixed-valent complexes have aroused attention because of their potential application in the catalytic field endowed by the variable valence. Herein, we develop an ingenious green strategy to achieve the partial reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ ions in the complex of pyrenol-containing cyclen (H4(Pyr)4cyclen, H4[PC]) via a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect in air at room temperature. To reveal the inherent regulated capacity of the Eu2+/3+ complex in catalysis, we prepared the nanocomposites assembled by the lanthanide complexes encapsulated into ZIF-67 to successively realize the decomposition of H2O2, including europium, gadolinium, and terbium complexes. Among the nanocomposites, Eu2+/3+[PC]H@ZIF-67 exhibits the best catalytic performance due to the achievement of dual regulation of Co3+/Co2+ ratio by the mixed-valent complex. Because of extremely abundant Co2+ active sites, the Eu2+/3+[PC]H@ZIF-67 after catalyzing H2O2 sample was further utilized to degrade organic dye rhodamine B (RhB). The rather outstanding catalytic degradation efficiency was still present in Eu2+/3+[PC]H@ZIF-67.

470459,Mitigation of Diachronic Bias in Fake News Detection Dataset,2021-08-28,"In a rare neurologic disease known as IgM monoclonal gammopathy the immune system targets a sulfated trisaccharide known as the Human Natural Killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope that comprises a constituent of the myelin sheath known as MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein). This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo-ß-d-glucopyranuronate)-(1â3)-ß-d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic.","Steinman, Lawrence",J Neurochem,,642
471512,Negative Correlation between Virus-Related Content Popularity and Epidemic Spread,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research on the use of video-mediated technology for medical consultations is increasing rapidly. Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that have focused on physical examinations in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in postsurgery consultations has not yet been studied. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of face-to-face and video settings on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of video technology on the procedure of postsurgery wound assessment and its limits. METHODS: We recorded 22 postoperative video consultations and 17 postoperative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was to inform the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen, and the secondary purpose was to check on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of conversation analysis. RESULTS: The way that an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (n=15/17) involve wound showings in the context of surgeons reporting their observations formatted with evidentials (""looks neat"") and subsequently assessing what these observations imply or what could be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (n=3/22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments where diagnostic criteria such as redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (""I think,"" ""sounds...good"") and evidentials are absent. Even in cases of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may rely on questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of video technology on postoperative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way when compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians enquire and patients provide their own observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that, in video consultations, patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in cases of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial.","Stommel, Wyke J P; van Goor, Harry; Stommel, Martijn W J",J Med Internet Res,,642
471718,Modern Management Based on Big Data I - Proceedings of MMBD 2020,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great impact on orthopedic surgery with a significant curtailment in elective surgeries which is the major bread and butter for orthopedic surgeons. It was also observed that the spectrum of orthopedic trauma injuries has shifted from more severe and frequent road traffic accidents (high energy trauma) to general, low energy house-hold injuries like low energy fractures in the elderly, pediatric fractures, house-hold sharp cut injuries and nail bed lacerations. The aim of this study is to appraise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic surgical practice, both inpatient and outpatient facility. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective cross sectional study conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital. We collected data of patients admitted from February 1, 2020 to 30th April 2020 in the orthopedic service line using non-probability consecutive sampling. This study population was divided into pre-COVID and COVID eras (6 weeks each). The data included patient demographic parameters like age, gender and site of injury, mechanism of injury, diagnosis and procedure performed and carrying out of COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test in the COVID-era. Results: We observed that outpatient clinical volume decreased by 75% in COVID era. Fifty percent of surgical procedures decreased in COVID era as compared to pre-COVID era. Trauma procedures reduced by 40% in COVID era. Most common mechanism of injury was household injuries like low energy falls. A significant reduction in elective surgeries by 67% was observed in the COVID era. Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the spectrum of orthopedic injury. More household injuries have occurred and are anticipated due to the ongoing effects of lockdown.","Hashmi, Pervaiz Mahmood; Zahid, Marij; Ali, Arif; Naqi, Hammad; Pidani, Anum Sadruddin; Hashmi, Alizah Pervaiz; Noordin, Shahryar",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,642

473470,Simulate the number of confirmed COVID-19 Cases in 9 Countries from January to June 2020 based on 3 Models,2020,"The gold standard of molecular pathogen detection is the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Modern qPCR instruments are capable of detecting 4-6 analytes in a single sample: one per optical detection channel. However, many clinical applications require multiplexing beyond this traditional single-well capacity, including the task of simultaneously testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. This can be addressed by dividing a sample across multiple wells, or using technologies such as genomic sequencing and spatial arrays, but at the expense of significantly higher cost and lower throughput compared with single-well qPCR. These trade-offs represent unacceptable compromises in high-throughput screening scenarios such as SARS-CoV-2 testing. We demonstrate a novel method of detecting up to 20 targets per well with standard qPCR instrumentation: high-definition PCR (HDPCR). HDPCR combines TaqMan chemistry and familiar workflows with robust encoding to enable far higher levels of multiplexing on a traditional qPCR system without an increase in cost or reduction in throughput. We utilize HDPCR with a custom 20-Plex assay, an 8-Plex assay using unmodified predesigned single-plex assays from Integrated DNA Technologies and a 9-Plex pathogen panel inclusive of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. All three assays were successful when tested on a variety of samples, with overall sample accuracies of 98.8, 98.3, and 100%, respectively. The HDPCR technology enables the large install base of qPCR instrumentation to perform mid-density multiplex diagnostics without modification to instrumentation or workflow, meeting the urgent need for increased diagnostic yield at an affordable price without sacrificing assay performance.","Jacky, Lucien; Yurk, Dominic; Alvarado, John; Belitz, Paul; Fathe, Kristin; MacDonald, Chris; Fraser, Scott; Rajagopal, Aditya",Anal Chem,,642

474427,Surveillance System for Monitoring Social Distance,2021,"This report describes the development of a centrifugally controlled microfluidic dynamic solid-phase extraction (dSPE) platform to reliably obtain amplification-ready nucleic acids (NAs) directly from buccal swab cuttings. To our knowledge, this work represents the first centrifugal microdevice for comprehensive preparation of high-purity NAs from raw buccal swab samples. Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout. We describe an automatable, portable microfluidic platform for the nucleic acid preparation device that could permit practical, in situ use by nontechnical personnel.","Dignan, Leah M; Woolf, M Shane; Tomley, Christopher J; Nauman, Aeren Q; Landers, James P",Anal Chem,,642

We report a unique renal neoplasm in a 66 year-old woman that initially mimicked MITF family translocation RCC due to mixed clear and eosinophilic cells, extensive stromal hyalinization, and psammoma bodies, yet which was negative for TFE3 and TFEB fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a next generation sequencing (NGS) gene fusion assay. Cytoplasmic stippling triggered consideration of TSC-associated neoplasms, and a targeted next generation sequencing assay revealed a variant in exon 21 of TSC1 resulting in c.2626G > T p.(Glu876*) truncating mutation. This report adds to the morphologic spectrum of TSC-related renal neoplasms, including prominent stromal hyalinization as a potentially deceptive pattern. Due to the overlap in cytoplasmic stippling between eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC and HOT / RCC with eosinophilic and vacuolated cytoplasm, it is debatable which category this example would best fit. Further understanding of these entities and other renal neoplasms with alterations in the TSC genes will elucidate whether they should be considered a family of tumors.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted this survey to learn about the real impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire using a telephonic interview conducted by two rheumatologists. Rheumatic disease characteristics, knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19, and impacts of pandemic on rheumatology care and patient's compliance were assessed. RESULTS: We included 307 patients in the survey, and rheumatoid arthris was the main rheumatic disease. Patients had mostly moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19, and patients with higher level of education were more likely to have better knowledge. Participants respected mainly recommended preventive measures. The pandemic and sanitary containment impacted strongly the rheumatology care. Over quarter of patients noted worsening of their rheumatic disease, two-thirds reported postponed or canceled medical apointments and more than three quarters postponed their laboratory tests. Patients with higher disease activity were more likely to have lack of follow-up. Medication change was noted in more than third of cases. It was mostly stopped, and DMARDs were mainly affected. Patients living in rural area and who had canceled, or postponed their appointments were more likely to change their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are useful to better manage rheumatic patients.

The structures of the borates are described in terms of cation-centered and oxocentred polyhedra. There are different sequences of double chains and layers consisting of oxocentred [OM4]n+ tetrahedra and [OM5]n+ tetragonal pyramids forming a framework. Elemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Oxidation states and coordination sites of iron and tin in the oxoborates are determined using Mössbauer spectroscopy and compared with EDX and X-ray diffraction data (XRD). According to results obtained from high-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy, the Fe2+ to Fe3+ oxidation in vonsenite and hulsite occurs at approximately 500 and 600â K, respectively. According to the high-temperature XRD data, this process is accompanied by an assumed deformation of crystal structures and subsequent solid-phase decomposition to hematite and warwickite. It is seen as a monotonic decrease of volume thermal expansion coefficients with an increase in temperature. A partial magnetic ordering in hulsite is observed for the first time with Tc &#8771; 383â K. Near this temperature, an unusual change of thermal expansion coefficients is revealed. Vonsenite starts to melt at 1571â K and hulsite melts at 1504â K.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review a comprehensive literature search in Global Health, SCOPUS, Medline and EMBASE was performed using relevant keywords and medical descriptors (MeSH) related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and prisons. National and international recommendations and guides were examined as well as documents published by some countries. RESULTS: The key points of the guides are discussed. The vast majority of recommendations coincide with respect to the measures and procedures that should be used, except for some discrepancy regarding the population screening. Until now, most industrialized countries (except the US and some specific scenarios) have controlled successfully the epidemic in prisons. Less data is found as regards to socioeconomically more disadvantaged countries. CONCLUSIONS: Prisons are prone to a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to their space limitations and sometimes poor environmental and hygienic conditions. The recommendations of the control and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be the same as those outside the prison, but must be adapted to the peculiarities of the prison. The recommendations must be issued by the health administration in coordination with the prison administration. Finally, must be abide by the Mandela Rules or by the Standard Minimum Rules for the treatment of United Nations prisoners.","Marco, A; Guerrero, R A; Turu, E","SEMERGEN, Soc. Esp. Med. Rural Gen.

A reduction in physical activity during the pandemic may be secondary to restrictive policies implemented at the government-level, typically those policies which limit interpersonal contact;for example, physical/social distancing. It is without question that social distancing is a necessary measure to mitigate community transmission of the novel virus;however, these policies often limit the public's opportunities to engage in physical activity. The strictest enforcement of social distancing occurs during an authority-mandated â € lockdown' (also known as a â € shelter-in-place' or â € stay-at-home' order). This Viewpoint focuses on the current evidence demonstrating that physical activity declines during a COVID-19 â € lockdown'. We highlight the point that most of the available evidence stems from investigations using non-validated, self-reported measures of physical activity and discuss the caveats therewith. This Viewpoint explores whether current evidence reflects an â € actual' or rather a â € perceived' reduction in physical activity, and raises the question of whether this distinction matters in the end. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

This approach allows us to conduct synthesis planning in a bottom-up manner and design synthesizable molecules by decoding from optimized conditional codes, demonstrating the potential to solve both problems of design and synthesis simultaneously. The approach leverages neural networks to probabilistically model the synthetic trees, one reaction step at a time, according to reactivity rules encoded in a discrete action space of reaction templates. We train these networks on hundreds of thousands of artificial pathways generated from a pool of purchasable compounds and a list of expert-curated templates.

Design: With a priori information obtained from the daily number of deaths due to CODIV-19 in China and data from the Peruvian authorities, we constructed a predictive Bayesian non-linear model for the number of deaths in Peru. Exposure: COVID-19. Outcome: Number of deaths. Results: Assuming an intervention level similar to the one implemented in China, the total number of deaths in Peru is expected to be 612 (95%CI: 604.3 - 833.7) persons. Sixty four days after the first reported death, the 99% of expected deaths will be observed. The inflexion point in the number of deaths is estimated to be around day 26 (95%CI: 25.1 - 26.8) after the first reported death. Conclusion: These estimates can help authorities to monitor the epidemic and implement strategies in order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bayes, Cristian; Rosas, Victor Sal y; Valdivieso, Luis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02386v2.pdf,642
497369,COVID19: Forecasting Air Quality Index and Particulate Matter (PM2.5),2021,"IntroductionFervorous investigation and dialogue surrounding the true number of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths and implied infection fatality rates in India have been ongoing throughout the pandemic, and especially pronounced during the nations devastating second wave. We aim to synthesize the existing literature on the true SARS-CoV-2 excess deaths and infection fatality rates (IFR) in India, through a systematic search followed by viable meta-analysis. We then provide updated epidemiological model-based estimates of the wave 1, wave 2 and combined IFRs using an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, using data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, the databases PubMed, Embase, Global Index Medicus, as well as BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and SSRN for preprints (accessed through iSearch), were searched on July 3, 2021 (with results verified through August 15, 2021). Altogether using a two-step approach, 4,765 initial citations were screened resulting in 37 citations included in the narrative review and 19 studies with 41 datapoints included in the quantitative synthesis. Using a random effects model with DerSimonian-Laird estimation, we meta-analyze IFR1 which is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed reported deaths divided by the total number of estimated infections and IFR2 (which accounts for death underreporting in the numerator of IFR1). For the latter, we provide lower and upper bounds based on the available range of estimates of death undercounting, often arising from an excess death calculation. The primary focus is to estimate pooled nationwide estimates of IFRs with the secondary goal of estimating pooled regional and state-specific estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related IFRs in India. We also try to stratify our empirical results across the first and the second wave. In tandem, we present updated SEIR model estimates of IFRs for waves 1, 2, and combined across the waves with observed case and death count data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. ResultsFor India countrywide, underreporting factors (URF) for cases (sourced from serosurveys) range from 14.3-29.1 in the four nationwide serosurveys; URFs for deaths (sourced from excess deaths reports) range from 4.4-11.9 with cumulative excess deaths ranging from 1.79-4.9 million (as of June 2021). Nationwide pooled IFR1 and IFR2 estimates for India are 0.097% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.067 - 0.140) and 0.365% (95% CI: 0.264 - 0.504) to 0.485% (95% CI: 0.344 - 0.685), respectively, again noting that IFR2 changes as excess deaths estimates vary. Among the included studies in this meta-analysis, the IFR1 generally appear to decrease over time from the earliest study end date to the latest study end date (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR1 changed from 0.199 to 0.055%), whereas a similar trend is not as readily evident for IFR2 due to the wide variation in excess death estimates (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR2 ranged from (0.290-1.316) to (0.241-0.651) %). Nationwide SEIR model-based combined estimates for IFR1 and IFR2 are 0.101% (95% CI: 0.097 - 0.116) and 0.367% (95% CI: 0.358 - 0.383), respectively, which largely reconcile with the empirical findings and concur with the lower end of the excess death estimates. An advantage of such epidemiological models is the ability to produce daily estimates with updated data with the disadvantages being that these estimates are subject to numerous assumptions, arduousness of validation and not directly using the available excess death data. Whether one uses empirical data or model-based estimation, it is evident that IFR2 is at least 3.6 times more than IFR1. ConclusionWhen incorporating case and death underreporting, the meta-analyzed cumulative infection fatality rate in India varies from 0.36%-0.48%, with a case underreporting factor ranging from 25-30 and a death underreporting factor ranging from 4-12. This implies, by June 30, 2021, India may have seen nearly 900 million infections and 1.7-4.9 million deaths when the reported numbers stood at 30.4 million cases and 412 thousand deaths (covid19india.org) with an observed case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.35%. We reiterate the need for timely and disaggregated infection and fatality data to examine the burden of the virus by age and other demographics. Large degrees of nationwide and state-specific death undercounting reinforce the call to improve death reporting within India.","Zimmermann, Lauren; Bhattacharya, Subarna; Purkayastha, Soumik; Kundu, Ritoban; Bhaduri, Ritwik; Ghosh, Parikshit; Mukherjee, Bhramar",,,642

498370,Multiscale Attention Guided Network for COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Chest X-ray Images,2021,"The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown have been widely recognized as traumatic events that pose threats to psychological well-being. Recent studies reported that during such traumatic events, women tend to be at greater risk than men for developing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Several studies reported that a mindfulness-based stress reduction protocol (MBSR) provides useful skills for dealing with traumatic events. In our study, a sample of Italian females received an 8-week MBSR course plus 6 weeks of video support for meditation practice during the first total lockdown in Italy. We assessed the participants with questionnaires before and after this period to investigate their mindfulness skills, psychological well-being, post-traumatic growth, and psychological flexibility. After the intervention, the meditators group reported improvement in measures associated with self-acceptance, purpose in life, and relation to others compared to the control group. Furthermore, our results showed that participants with greater mindfulness scores showed high levels of psychological flexibility, which in turn was positively associated with higher levels of psychological well-being. We concluded that the MBSR could support psychological well-being, at least in female subjects, even during an unpredictable adverse event, such as the COVID-19 lockdown, by reinforcing key psychological aspects.","Accoto, Alessandra; Chiarella, Salvatore Gaetano; Raffone, Antonino; Montano, Antonella; de Marco, Adriano; Mainiero, Francesco; Rubbino, Roberta; Valzania, Alessandro; Conversi, David",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,642

This use is empirical and little is known about its effect in the organic systems. Objective: To determine serum levels of aminotransferases, bilirrubins and gama-glutamyl transpeptidase after copaiba oil administration. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n=20) divided in two groups of 10 animals: Group Cop which received a daily oral administration of copaiba oil, 0.63ml/kg, during 5 days; Group P in which any substance was administrated. In the sixth day the animals of both groups were submitted to inalatory anesthesia, laparotomy and collection of blood samples (3ml) from inferior vena cava for the determination of serum aminotransferases, bilirrubins and gama-glutamyl transpeptidase levels. Results: The results were compared between groups and analyzed by t-Student test. Group Cop showed AST, ALT and GGT levels significantly decreased when compared with Gruop P (p 0.01), while total bilirrubins levels increased by its direct fraction. Conclusion: Copaiba oil can alter serum levels of aminotransferases, bilirrubins and gama-glutamyl transpeptidase, showing a possible interaction between this substance and liver, but this considerations require posterior evalutaion.","Noguchi, Aki; Maciel Caldas dos Reis, José; Silva Dias, Camila; Alves Epaminondas, Wellington; Sérgio Roffé Azevedo, Paulo; Vinicius Henriques Brito, Marcus",Acta cir. bras.,,642
499418,Innovation intelligence and its role in environmental uncertainty management: a conceptual framework,2020,"Background: Whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to excess risk of requiring hospitalization or intensive care in persons with diabetes has not been reported, nor have risk factors in diabetes associated with increased risk for these outcomes. Methods: We included 44,639 and 411,976 adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes alive on Jan 1, 2020, and compared them to controls matched for age, sex, and county of residence (n=204,919 and 1,948,900). Age- and sex-standardized rates for COVID-19 related hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care and death, were estimated and hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression analyses. Findings: There were 10,486 hospitalizations and 1,416 admissions into intensive care. A total of 1,175 patients with diabetes and 1,820 matched controls died from COVID-19, of these 53*2% had been hospitalized and 10*7% had been in intensive care. Patients with type 2 diabetes, compared to controls, displayed an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2*22, 95%CI 2*13-2*32) of being hospitalized for COVID-19, which decreased to HR 1*40, 95%CI 1*34-1*47) after further adjustment for sociodemographic factors, pharmacological treatment and comorbidities, had higher risk for admission to ICU due to COVID-19 (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2*49, 95%CI 2*22-2*79, decreasing to 1*42, 95%CI 1*25-1*62 after adjustment, and increased risk for death due to COVID-19 (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2*19, 95%CI 2*03-2*36, complete adjustment 1*50, 95%CI 1*39-1*63). Age- and sex-adjusted HR for COVID-19 hospitalization for type 1 diabetes was 2*10, 95%CI 1*72-2*57), decreasing to 1*25, 95%CI 0*3097-1*62) after adjustment* Patients with diabetes type 1 were twice as likely to require intensive care for COVID-19, however, not after adjustment (HR 1*49, 95%CI 0*75-2*92), and more likely to die (HR 2*90, 95% CI 1*6554-5*47) from COVID-19, but not independently of other factors (HR 1*38, 95% CI 0*64-2*99). Among patients with diabetes, elevated glycated hemoglobin levels were associated with higher risk for most outcomes. Interpretation: In this nationwide study, type 2 diabetes was independently associated with increased risk of hospitalization, admission to intensive care and death for COVID-19. There were few admissions into intensive care and deaths in type 1 diabetes, and although hazards were significantly raised for all three outcomes, there was no independent risk persisting after adjustment for confounding factors.","Rawshani, A.; Kjolhede, E.

499604,Virtual technology of cache and real-time big data distribution in cloud computing big data center,2020,"Hyperactivation of the immune system through obesity and diabetes may enhance infection severity complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The objective was to determine the circulatory biomarkers for macrophage activation at baseline and after serum glucose normalization in obese type 2 diabetes (OT2D) subjects. A case-controlled interventional pilot study in OT2D (n = 23) and control subjects (n = 23). OT2D subjects underwent hyperinsulinemic clamp to normalize serum glucose. Plasma macrophage-related proteins were determined using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-scan plasma protein measurement at baseline (control and OT2D subjects) and after 1-h of insulin clamp (OT2D subjects only). Basal M1 macrophage activation was characterized by elevated levels of M1 macrophage-specific surface proteins, CD80 and CD38, and cytokines or chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, RANTES) released by activated M1 macrophages. Two potent M1 macrophage activation markers, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were decreased in OT2D. Activated M2 macrophages were characterized by elevated levels of plasma CD163, TFGß-1, MMP7 and MMP9 in OT2D. Conventional mediators of both M1 and M2 macrophage activation markers (IFN-Î³, IL-4, IL-13) were not altered. No changes were observed in plasma levels of M1/M2 macrophage activation markers in OT2D in response to acute normalization of glycemia. In the basal state, macrophage activation markers are elevated, and these reflect the expression of circulatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, that were not changed by glucose normalisation. These differences could potentially predispose diabetic individuals to increased infection severity complicated by ARDS.

Here we reveal that the spike protein of the Lambda variant is more infectious and it is attributed to the T76I and L452Q mutations. The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, a unique 7-amino-acid deletion mutation in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda spike protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies. Since the Lambda variant has dominantly spread according to the increasing frequency of the isolates harboring the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, our data suggest that the insertion of the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is closely associated with the massive infection spread of the Lambda variant in South America.

Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. RESULTS: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge.","Venugopal, Usha; Jilani, Nargis; Rabah, Sami; Shariff, Masood A; Jawed, Muzamil; Mendez Batres, Astrid; Abubacker, Muhamed; Menon, Sharika; Pillai, Anjana; Shabarek, Nehad; Kasubhai, Moiz; Dimitrov, Vihren; Menon, Vidya",Int J Infect Dis,,642

Thus, this study aims to assess the mechanisms of dental aerosol dispersion in dental offices and to provide recommendations based on a quantitative study to minimize infection transmission in dental offices. The spread and removal of aerosol particles generated from dental procedures in a dental office are measured near the source and at the corner of the office. We studied the effects of air purification (on/off), door condition (open/close), and particle sizes on the temporal concentration distribution of particles. The results show that in the worst-scenario scenario it takes 95 min for 0.5 um particles to settle, and that it takes a shorter time for the larger particles. The indoor air purifier tested expedited the removal time at least 6.3 times faster than the scenario air purifier off. Airborne particles may be transported from the source to the rest of the room, even when the particle concentrations in the generation zone return to the background level. These results are expected to be valuable to related policy making and technology development for infection disease control in dental offices and similar built environments.","Ravazi, Maryam; Butt, Zahid; Lin, Mark H.E.; Chen, Helen; Tan, Zhongchao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10998v1.pdf,642

Although the virus can cause disease in anyone, it is particularly dangerous for those with various ""co-morbidities"" such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and others. Furthermore, advancing age (from about 60 on), even in those older persons without any accompanying illnesses, is a strong and independent risk factor for pneumonia, need for an ICU bed and death from the virus. It is therefore essential to find ways to protect all at-risk persons (old or young) from the virus but at the same time not harming, more than absolutely necessary their essential freedoms as well as taking into account their social/psychological needs. Compared with other OECD countries, Israel's population is still relatively young, with only 11.5% being over 65+ with a smaller proportion of older persons in long-term institutions than that found in most other comparable jurisdictions. These factors might explain a part of the country's (so far) relatively low rates of serious disease and mortality compared to those seen in other developed countries. However there are still over a million older citizens at risk and the numbers of infected, hospitalized and seriously ill persons are rising once again. This is no time for complacency.An analysis of the effect of age on the disease as seen through the principles of medical ethics is followed by a proposal as to how best to balance these sometimes conflicting goals. This paper relates mainly to older persons in the community since the Ministry of Health early on in the pandemic initiated an effective program (Magen Avot) meant to protect those older persons in long-term care institutions. Recommendations include the Ministry of Health publishing clear guidelines as to risk factors and offering sensible advice on how to practice physical (not ""social"") distancing without exacerbating an older person's sense of social isolation. In order to reduce the incidence of influenza (which can clinically be confused with COVID-19) and the potentially disastrous consequences of a ""double pandemic"" this coming winter, a robust flu vaccination program needs immediate implementation. Persons at all ages (but especially those 60+) should be encouraged and assisted to sign advance directives, especially those who do not wish to undergo invasive therapy. An individual older person's wish to ""make way"" for younger people should be respected as an expression of his/her autonomy. As we enter the second wave, triage mechanisms and protocols need to be circulated in readiness for and well before a situation in which an acute imbalance develops between the availability for acute resources and the population's need for them. The Ministry of Health, in cooperation with other relevant ministries and NGOs, should take the lead in developing plans, ensuring that they are carried out in an orderly, timely and transparent manner. The blanket is indeed not large enough but we must place it as judiciously as possible in order as much as possible to protect, cover and keep warm the body politic.","Clarfield, A Mark; Jotkowitz, Alan",Isr J Health Policy Res,,642
506246,Inferring True COVID19 Infection Rates From Deaths,2020,"The adaptive immune system is important for control of most viral infections. The three fundamental components of the adaptive immune system are B cells (the source of antibodies), CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. The armamentarium of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells has differing roles in different viral infections and in vaccines, and thus it is critical to directly study adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to understand COVID-19. Knowledge is now available on relationships between antigen-specific immune responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although more studies are needed, a picture has begun to emerge that reveals that CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and neutralizing antibodies all contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 in both non-hospitalized and hospitalized cases of COVID-19. The specific functions and kinetics of these adaptive immune responses are discussed, as well as their interplay with innate immunity and implications for COVID-19 vaccines and immune memory against re-infection.","Sette, Alessandro; Crotty, Shane",Cell,,642

The focal point of CM in the treatment of infectious diseases is the personalized response state to pathogen, which is a treatment method consistent with the personalized concept of precision medicine. Compared with the methods of directly killing or inactivating pathogens, which are used in modern medicine, CM is an effective treatment modality that has a wider range of points of action in the human body. The remarkable effects achieved while treating SARS in 2003 and the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and the history of the effective responses to epidemics in the past 2,000 years have fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CM in treating infectious diseases. This article discusses the different treatment mechanisms for infectious diseases in CM and modern medicine and the advantages of CM methods, which will reacquaint the world with CM.

Healthcare workers (HCW) play a key role in vaccine promotion and patient guidance, and it is likely that hesitancy among this population will have a major impact on the adoption of a successful immunization policy. To investigate HCW attitudes towards anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination, we developed an anonymous online cross-sectional survey. 1723 Italian HCW responded. Overall, 1155 (67%) intended to be vaccinated, while 443 (26%) were not sure and 125 (7%) declared refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with hesitancy were using Facebook as the main information source and being a non-physician HCW, while predictors of acceptance included younger age, being in close contact with high-risk groups and having received flu vaccination during the 2019-2020 season. Reasons for hesitancy included lack of trust in vaccine safety (85%) and receiving little (78%) or conflicting (69%) information about vaccines. According to our results, adequate investment in vaccine education for healthcare personnel appears to be urgently needed, prioritizing non-physicians and information quality spread through social media. We hope that our data could help governments and policy-makers to target communication in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Di Gennaro, Francesco; Murri, Rita; Segala, Francesco Vladimiro; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Abdulle, Amina; Saracino, Annalisa; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; Fantoni, Massimo",Viruses,,642

Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains.

523988,Social Distancing and Isolation Management Using Machine-to-Machine Technologies to Prevent Pandemics,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID(coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic is characterized by high infectivity, droplet transmission, and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Severe disease courses are associated with interstitial pneumonia and ventilated patients, in whom tracheotomy (TT)-a droplet- and aerosol-producing medical intervention-is regularly necessary. TT as a potential infection risk for medical staff is scarcely found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify droplet exposure of the surgical team during TT, to better define the requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical TT was performed in four non-infectious patients, during which the surgeon and his assistant both wore a surgical nasal mask with a transparent visor. After the procedure, the type, distribution, and number of droplets on the visor were determined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS: An average of 29 droplets were found on the middle third of the visor, 4 on the right third, and 13 on the left third, with an average droplet size of 571â¯µm (±â¯381â¯µm). The smallest droplets were 55â¯µm, the largest 1431â¯µm. An increase in the number of droplets was found with increased ventilation during the procedure. Blood droplets were more common than secretion droplets. CONCLUSION: Contamination of the visor with droplets was demonstrated. Especially in the case of TT in highly infectious patients, e.g., COVID-19 patients, the use of hooded headgear in combination with breathing apparatus with air purification and power supply is recommended to ensure best protection from infection for the surgeon and the surgical assistant.","Plettenberg, C; Geipel, K; Stenin, I; Klenzner, T; Wagenmann, M; Schipper, J; Scheckenbach, K",HNO,,642
590654,Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 fatality trends: Death kinetics law versus infection-to-death delay rule,2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Sending emergency messages via mobile phone text messaging can be a promising communication tool to rapidly disseminate information and promote preventive behavior among the public during epidemic outbreaks. The battle to overcome COVID-19 is not yet over; thus, it is essential that the public practices preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading and obtaining information via emergency alert SMS text messages and their effects on the individual's practice of preventive behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey comprising 990 participants was conducted over 3 days (March 25-27, 2020). A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the sociodemographic factors that might influence the behavior of reading emergency alert text messages. A hierarchical linear regression model estimated the associations between reading emergency alert text messages for each precautionary behavior practiced against COVID-19. Additionally, the indirect effects of reading the text messages on each precautionary behavior via psychological factors (ie, perceived risk and response efficacy) were calculated. All data were weighted according to the 2019 Korea census data. RESULTS: Overall, 49.2% (487/990) of the participants reported that they always read emergency alert text messages and visited the linked website to obtain more information. Factors such as female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.28-2.21) and older age (30-39 years: OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.25-3.28; 40-49 years: OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47; 50-59 years: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.01-5.06; 60 years and above: OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.00-4.86 versus 18-29 years) were identified to be associated with a higher frequency of reading the text messages. Participants who always read the text messages practiced wearing facial masks (β=.074, P=.01) more frequently than those who did not. In terms of social distancing, participants who reported they always read the text messages avoided crowded places (β=.078, P=.01) and canceled or postponed social gatherings (β=.103, P<.001) more frequently than those who did not read the text messages. Furthermore, reading text messages directly and indirectly affected practicing precautionary behaviors, as the mediation effect of response efficacy between reading text messages and practicing preventive behaviors was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emergency alert text messages sent to individuals' mobile phones are timely and effective strategies for encouraging preventive behavior in public. Sending emergency alert text messages to provide the public with accurate and reliable information could be positively considered by the health authorities, which might reduce the negative impact of infodemics.","You, Myoungsoon; Lee, Minjung",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544691/,642

Recruitment and networking may be more influential in match outcomes than previous cycles. Medical residency training programs have significant challenges in recruiting diverse applicants. The American Psychiatric Association’s Black Caucus developed a virtual recruitment event for residency programs with robust diversity initiatives and underrepresented medical students. This article evaluates our methods, short-term results, and influence on participating medical students. METHODS: The authors sent web-based invitations to all programs subscribed to the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training listserv. Programs that demonstrated intention and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion were selected. The authors used various social media platforms and the Black Caucus listserv to advertise to medical students. Student participants received an online feedback survey consisting of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Thirty-six programs and one hundred seven medical students participated in the 2-day diversity fair. Seventy-six students completed the following survey, which is a response rate of 71%. A majority of students reported that this event strongly influenced their interest in a program (71.05) and are actively considering a residency program they had not previously considered (69.74). A majority of medical students (89.47) strongly agreed that program representatives treated them with professionalism and respect. CONCLUSION: This event improved communication between highly valued underrepresented minority students applicants and residency programs. A notable majority of participants found the program overwhelmingly beneficial.","Ojo, Enioluwafe; Hairston, Danielle",Acad Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-021-01447-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982272/,642

The heart is a vital organ which supplies nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body. Heart failure (HF) has been conventionally described as a disease associated with cardiac tissue damage caused by systemic inflammation, arrhythmia and conduction defects. Cardiac inflammation and subsequent tissue damage is orchestrated by the infiltration and activation of various immune cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, and T and B cells into the myocardium. After tissue injury, monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes, and function as key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration and fibrosis. Disturbance in resident macrophage functions such as uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and inefficient generation of an anti-inflammatory response or unsuccessful communication between macrophages and epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts can lead to aberrant repair, persistent injury, and HF. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the role of cardiac macrophages on cardiac inflammation, tissue repair, regeneration and fibrosis.","Lafuse, William P.; Wozniak, Daniel J.; Rajaram, Murugesan V.

A Visually-Driven, Multi-granularity Explanatory ML Approach",2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND: The consequences of COVID-19 in those who recover from acute infection requiring hospitalisation have yet to be clearly defined. We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV(1); residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC). FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52–66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77% of predicted (IQR 67–87) at 3 months, 76% of predicted (68–90) at 6 months, and 88% of predicted (78–101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 8·61 [95% CI 2·83–26·2; p=0·0002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (1·36 [1·13–1·62]; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION: In most patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, dyspnoea scores and exercise capacity improved over time; however, in a subgroup of patients at 12 months we found evidence of persistent physiological and radiographic change. A unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 is required.

Its government has already instituted an array of initiatives and plans and funding efforts toward the effective containment of the pandemic. Some of these efforts include reorientation and training for health workers, securing funding to procure and distribute needed personal protective equipment, medicine supply, health promotion, surveillance and case management. These efforts are being done in the context of an already heavy burden of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and poor health literacy. Whether efforts of the government and other stakeholders are enough, these remain to be seen in containing the virus and its aftermath.

598377,Artificial intelligence approaches and mechanisms for big data analytics: a systematic study,2021-04-14,"Background Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders have been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, e.g. to what extent genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders contributes to the observed association. Methods The analytic sample consisted of white British participants of UK Biobank registered in England, with available genetic data, and alive on Jan 31, 2020 (i.e., the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) (n=346,554). We assessed individuals' genetic predisposition to different psychiatric disorders, including substance misuse, depression, anxiety, and psychotic disorder, using polygenic risk score (PRS). Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were identified through the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. We performed a GWAS analysis for each psychiatric disorder in a randomly selected half of the study population who were free of COVID-19 (i.e., the base dataset). For the other half (i.e., the target dataset), PRS was calculated for each psychiatric disorder using the discovered genetic variants from the base dataset. We then examined the association between PRS of each psychiatric disorder and risk of COVID-19, or severe COVID-19 (i.e., hospitalization and death), using logistic regression models. The ascertainment of COVID-19 was through the Public Health England dataset, the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data and death registers, updated until July 26, 2020. For validation, we repeated the PRS analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Results 155,988 participants (including 1,451 COVID-19 cases), with a mean age of 68.50 years at COVID-19 outbreak, were included for PRS analysis. Higher genetic liability forwards psychiatric disorders was associated with increased risk of both any COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, especially genetic risk for substance misuse and depression. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for any COVID-19 were 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.31) and 1.26 (1.11-1.42) among individuals with a high genetic risk (above the upper tertile of PRS) for substance misuse and depression, respectively, compared with individuals with a low genetic risk (below the lower tertile). Largely similar ORs were noted for severe COVID-19 and similar albeit slightly lower estimates using PRSs generated from GWAS summary statistics from independent samples. Conclusion In the UK Biobank, genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, including severe course of the disease. These findings suggest the potential role of genetic factors in the observed phenotypic association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19, underscoring the need of increased medical surveillance of for this vulnerable population during the pandemic.","Chen, W.; Zeng, Y.; Suo, C.; Yang, H.; Chen, Y.; Hou, C.; Hu, Y.; Ying, Z.; Sun, Y.; Qu, Y.; Lu, D.; Fang, F.; Valdimarsdampoacutettir, U.

Alveolar macrophage-derived cytokines contribute to the inflammation underlying pulmonary disease in COVID-19. We sought to determine if basal macrophage activation, as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, was present in PCOS and, if so, was further enhanced by vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 99 PCOS and 68 control women who presented sequentially. Plasma levels of a macrophage-derived cytokine panel were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Vitamin D was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: Vitamin D was lower in PCOS women (p<0.0001) and correlated negatively with body mass index (BMI) in PCOS (r=0.28, p=0.0046). Basal macrophage activation markers CXCL5, CD163 and MMP9 were elevated, whilst protective CD200 was decreased (p<0.05); changes in these variables were related to, and fully accounted for, by BMI. PCOS and control women were then stratified according to vitamin D concentration. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with decreased CD80 and IFN-γ in PCOS and IL-12 in both groups (p<0.05). These factors, important in initiating and maintaining the immune response, were again accounted for by BMI. CONCLUSION: Basal macrophage activation was higher in PCOS with macrophage changes related with increased infection risk associating with vitamin D; all changes were BMI dependent, suggesting that obese PCOS with vitamin D deficiency may be at greater risk of more severe COVID-19 infection, but that it is obesity-related rather than an independent PCOS factor.","Moin, Abu Saleh Md; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Butler, Alexandra E.; Atkin, Stephen L.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.638621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716989/,642

We irradiated the IAV H1N1 subtype with 4.8 mJ/cm(2) UV using eight UV-LEDs [peak wavelengths (WL) = 365, 310, 300, 290, 280, 270, and 260 nm)] or a mercury low pressure (LP)-UV lamp (Peak WL = 254 nm). Inactivation was evaluated by the infection ratio of Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or chicken embryonated eggs. Irradiation by the 260 nm UV-LED showed the highest inactivation among all treatments. Because the irradiation-induced inactivation effects strongly correlated with damage to viral RNA, we calculated the correlation coefficient (R(AE)) between the irradiant spectrum and absorption of viral RNA. The R(AE) scores strongly correlated with the inactivation by the UV-LEDs and LP-UV lamp. To increase the R(AE) score, we combined three different peak WL UV-LEDs (hybrid UV-LED). The hybrid UV-LED (R(AE) = 86.3) significantly inactivated both H1N1 and H6N2 subtypes to a greater extent than 260 nm (R(AE) = 68.6) or 270 nm (R(AE) = 42.2) UV-LEDs.

609465,Application of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models to Detect COVID-19 Face Masks - A Review,2021-08-28,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a novel worldwide pandemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During Covid-19 pandemic, socioeconomic deprivation, social isolation, and reduced physical activities may induce heart failure (HF), destabilization, and cause more complications. HF appears as a potential hazard due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, chiefly in elderly patients with underlying comorbidities. In reality, the expression of cardiac ACE2 is implicated as a target point for SARS-CoV-2-induced acute cardiac injury. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, like other febrile illnesses, high blood viscosity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and endothelial dysfunction-induced coagulation disorders may increase risk of HF development. Hypoxic respiratory failure, as in pulmonary edema, severe acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may affect heart hemodynamic stability due to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, Covid-19-induced HF could be through the development of cytokine storm, characterized by high proliferation pro-inflammatory cytokines. In cytokine storm-mediated cardiac dysfunction, there is a positive correlation between levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and myocarditis-induced acute cardiac injury biomarkers. Therefore, Covid-19-induced HF is more complex and related from a molecular background in releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines to the neuro-metabolic derangements that together affect cardiomyocyte functions and development of HF. Anti-heart failure medications, mainly digoxin and carvedilol, have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-inflammatory properties that may mitigate Covid-19 severity and development of HF. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the development of HF due to direct acute cardiac injury or through the development of cytokine storms, which depress cardiomyocyte function and cardiac contractility. Anti-heart failure drugs, mainly digoxin and carvedilol, may attenuate severity of HF by reducing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the development of cytokine storms in severely affected Covid-19 patients.","Onohuean, Hope; Al-kuraishy, Hayder M.; Al-Gareeb, Ali I.; Qusti, Safaa; Alshammari, Eida M.; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-021-02147-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480616/,642

Starting from a general intention of shifting curricular responses away from instrumental and technical solutions toward cultivating the ability to act and think in times of uncertainty, the argument developed here is that the need to respond to the Covid-19 crisis involves repositioning curriculum and responsibility as caring for the Earth. The article creates a dialogue between cosmoecological alliances of different onto-epistemological practices and formulations that expand the ethics of care for other-than-humans. The central issue is to defend reimagining the relationship between curriculum and subjectivity within interdependent stories on the planet. We do this in order to develop a sort of vaccine to prevent curricular imagination from becoming captive to the geometric coordinates of the economization of life.","Ranniery, Thiago",Prospects (Paris),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-021-09549-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176970/,642
609945,Assessment of impact of relaxation in lockdown and forecast of preparation for combating COVID-19 pandemic in India using Group Method of Data Handling,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND: Across the globe, lockdowns have been enforced as a pandemic response to COVID-19. Such lockdown coupled with school closures and stay-at-home orders made women more vulnerable in terms of higher responsibility and spending more time with an abusive partner, if any. METHODS: This study investigates the situation of women during COVID-19 induced lockdown by focusing on their happiness and inquiring about the incidence of violence. Using the zero-inflated negative binomial model, our findings ascertained that family settings, type of relationship with a spouse, and age significantly affects the positive count of violence during the lockdown. We further estimated the determinants of happiness and found that years of schooling, the role of women in household decision making, and feeling empowered is affecting their happiness. RESULTS: Women having higher education have more odds of zero violence. Unemployed women and women who are not working have higher odds of zero violence as compared to women who are working. During this lockdown after the COVID-19 pandemic, women living in urban areas, having higher education, having an adequate household income to meet the expenditures, having lesser anxiety, not facing violence, feeling empowered when their husband is around, and have higher decision-making power are happier. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The study is important in the context of happiness and violence inflicted on women during the lockdown and provides the basis to improve the pandemic response policy. The inclusion of women’s safety and happiness in pandemic response policy is important to ensure the well-being of women and to devise better health and economic policy. Our estimates suggest higher education results in less incidence of violence which could be argued as desirable outcomes for building healthy, productive, and happy communities. In addition to this, as pandemic induced lock-down is likely to result in higher unemployment across the globe including Pakistan, therefore, in light of our estimates pertaining to the role of unemployment in the incidence of violence, policymakers should deploy more resources to enhance income and to combat the rising unemployment. As a counter-intuitive outcome of these policy interventions, incidence of violence will be dampened, educational attainment and women empowerment will be increased which will certainly increase happiness.","Haq, Wajiha; Raza, Syed Hassan; Mahmood, Tahir",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282567/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10472,642
613106,Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Battling Against Covid-19: A Literature Review,2020-10-03,"Since changes in pharmacological treatments for severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have been incorporated into clinical practice, both by their use (corticosteroids and remdesivir) and by stopping them (e.g., hydroxychloroquine), we sought to compare the rate of intubation and mortality of intubated patients in our ICUs between the first and second waves of the pandemic. DESIGN: Single-center, observational. SETTING: Four coronavirus disease 2019 designated ICUs at an urban Greek teaching hospital. PATIENTS: All adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 consecutively admitted to ICU during the first (n = 50) and second (n = 212) waves of the pandemic. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of intubated ICU patients dropped from 82% during the first wave to 66% during the second wave (p = 0.042). However, the absolute number of intubated ICU patients was lower during the first than the second wave (41 vs 140 patients). ICU or hospital mortality of intubated patients increased from 39% during the first wave to 60% during the second wave (p = 0.028). The binary logistic regression for hospital mortality as the dependent variable in intubated patients and covariates the age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, cardiovascular comorbidity, lactate, positive end-expiratory pressure, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and wave, distinguished only Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (odds ratio, 1.40 with 95% CI, 1.14—1.72; p = 0.001) as the sole independent predictor of hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological adaptations and other measures may have led to fewer intubations over time. However, these changes do not seem to be translated into improved outcomes of intubated patients. Perhaps the same change in the use of drugs and protocols that could cause fewer intubations of ICU patients might be a reason of increased mortality in those patients who are eventually intubated. Furthermore, the relative staff inexperience and overall increase in patients’ comorbidities during the second wave could have contributed to increased Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and mortality of intubated patients.","Routsi, Christina; Kokkoris, Stelios; Siempos, Ilias; Magira, Eleni; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Zakynthinos, Spyros",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647032/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000531,642

We also aimed to identify prominent journals, authors, organizations, and countries in the field of mindfulness. METHODS: Articles or reviews which mention mindfulness in the title, abstract, or keywords were identified using the Web of Science. A descriptive summary of the literature was obtained from the Web of Science Analysis tool. Country collaboration, co-authorship, and keyword co-occurrence networks were visualized using VOSviewer. CiteSpace, which uses document co-citation analysis, was used to identify emerging trends and transient patterns in the literature. RESULTS: From 1966 to 2021, 16,581 publications on mindfulness were identified. There has been an exponential growth of publications since 2006. Almost half (47%) of the publications were in psychology and about one-fifth (20.8%) in psychiatry. The most prolific journal was Mindfulness (contributing 7% of all publications) and the most prolific author was Eric L. Garland. The vast majority of publications originated from Western countries but representation from Asian countries has increased. The most frequently co-occurring keywords were meditation, depression, stress, and anxiety. Co-citation analysis of the early period (1966–2015) revealed how scholarly work on spiritual themes has inspired early mindfulness research. Recent trends (2016–2021) revealed a rising interest in mechanisms and moderators, long-term meditation, neuroscientific studies, and smartphone/online delivery of interventions.

Objective To assess COVID-19 vaccine intentions among US adults and their children, and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among potential refusers. Design Internet-based surveys were administered cross-sectionally to US adults during December 2020 and February to March 2021 (March-2021). Setting Surveys were administered through Qualtrics using demographic quota sampling. Participants A large, demographically diverse sample of 10,444 US adults (response rate, 63.9%). Main Outcomes and Measures COVID-19 vaccine uptake, intentions, and reasons for potential refusal. Adults living with or caring for children aged 2 to 18 years were asked about their intent to have their children vaccinated. Multivariable weighted logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for vaccine refusal. Results Of 5256 March-2021 respondents, 3467 (66.0%) reported they would definitely or most likely obtain a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible (ASAP Obtainers), and an additional 478 (9.1%) reported they were waiting for more safety and efficacy data before obtaining the vaccine. Intentions for children and willingness to receive a booster shot largely matched personal COVID-19 vaccination intentions. Vaccine refusal (ie, neither ASAP Obtainers nor waiting for more safety and efficacy data) was most strongly associated with not having obtained an influenza vaccine in 2020 (adjusted odds ratio, 4.11 [95% CI, 3.05-5.54]), less frequent mask usage (eg, rarely or never versus always or often, 3.92 [2.52-6.10]) or social gathering avoidance (eg, rarely or never versus always or often, 2.65 [1.95-3.60]), younger age (eg, aged 18-24 versus over 65 years, 3.88 [2.02-7.46]), and more conservative political ideology (eg, very conservative versus very liberal, 3.58 [2.16-5.94]); all P<.001. Conclusions and Relevance Three-quarters of March-2021 respondents in our large, demographically diverse sample of US adults reported they would likely obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, and 60% of adults living with or caring for children plan to have them vaccinated as soon as possible. With an estimated 27% of the US population having been infected with SARS-CoV-2, once vaccines are available to children and they have been vaccinated, combined post-infection and post-vaccination immunity will approach 80% of the US population in 2021, even without further infections.","Czeisler, M.

615899,The 17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics,2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the move towards home spirometry monitoring, including in children. Our aim was to determine whether the remote supervision of spirometry by a physiologist improves the technical quality and failure rate of the manoeuvres. METHOD: Children with cystic fibrosis who had been provided with NuvoAir home spirometers were randomly allocated to either supervised or unsupervised home spirometry following a detailed training session. Home spirometry was performed every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Tests were assigned a quality factor (QF) using our laboratory grading system as per ATS/ERS standards, with tests marked from A to D, or Fail. In our laboratory we aim for QF A in all spirometry tests, but report results of QF B or C with a cautionary note. QF A was therefore the primary outcome, and QF A-C the secondary outcome. RESULTS: 61 patients were enrolled; 166 measurements were obtained in the supervised group, and 153 in the unsupervised group. Significantly more measurements achieved QF A in the supervised compared to unsupervised group (89% vs 74%; p= <0.001) whilst proportions reaching grade A-C were similar (99% vs 95%; p=0.1). All significant declines in spirometry results had a clinical rather than technical reason. Family/patient feedback for both arms was very positive. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that home spirometry in children should ideally be remotely supervised by a physiologist, but acceptable results can be obtained if resources do not allow this, provided that training is delivered and results monitored according to our protocol.

Due to the threat of re-emergence, the overall fatality rate of ∼10%, and the rapid dispersion of the virus via international travel, viable vaccine candidates providing protection from SARS are clearly needed. We developed an attenuated VSV recombinant (VSV-S) expressing the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein. In cells infected with this recombinant, S protein was synthesized, glycosylated at approximately 17 Asn residues, and transported via the Golgi to the cell surface. Mice vaccinated with VSV-S developed SARS-neutralizing antibody and were able to control a challenge with SARS-CoV performed at 1 month or 4 months after a single vaccination. We also demonstrated, by passive antibody transfer, that the antibody response induced by the vaccine was sufficient for controlling SARS-CoV infection. A VSV-vectored SARS vaccine could have significant advantages over other SARS vaccine candidates described to date.","Kapadia, Sagar U.; Rose, John K.; Lamirande, Elaine; Vogel, Leatrice; Subbarao, Kanta; Roberts, Anjeanette",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205003569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16043204/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205003569,642
624926,Classification of COVID-19 chest X-rays with deep learning: new models or fine tuning?,2020-11-22,"BACKGROUND: IL-35 was recently identified as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We previously reported that recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human IgG1 Fc fragment (rIL-35) reduced Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) in vitro. However, it is unclear whether IL-35 can attenuate nasal allergic responses and symptoms of allergic rhinitis in vivo. METHODS: To investigate the in vivo effect of IL-35 on allergic rhinitis in mice, mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). Intranasal administration of rIL-35 and intranasal challenge of OVA were then performed. Nasal symptoms were estimated after the last nasal challenge. Nasal tissue and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were collected. OVA-specific IgE in sera, OVA-specific T cell response, and the production of cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) stimulated by the OVA antigen were measured. The transcription level of Foxp3 and the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells were also measured. RESULTS: rIL-35 significantly inhibited the number of sneezes and nasal rubbing movements. It also reduced the number of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa and significantly decreased the level of OVA-specific IgE, the OVA-specific T cell proliferation, and the production of IL-4 and IL-5. Furthermore, rIL-35 significantly increased the production of IL-10, the transcription level of Foxp3, and the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed for the first time that rIL-35 inhibits nasal allergic responses and symptoms in mice, and that rIL-35 increases IL-10, Foxp3, and CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells in CLN. This study also suggests that intranasal administration of IL-35 can attenuate allergic rhinitis.","Suzuki, Motohiko; Yokota, Makoto; Nakamura, Yoshihisa; Ozaki, Shinya; Murakami, Shingo",Allergol Int,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1323893016301332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1323893016301332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27707583/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alit.2016.08.014,642

Several multiplex molecular assays are costly. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens. METHODS: A GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay (GeXP assay) was developed to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes. Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the RT-PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT-PCR. The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with positive controls for each virus type/subtype. The sensitivity was evaluated by performing the assay on serial ten-fold dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA of all RNA viruses and the plasmids containing the Adv and HBoV target sequence. GeXP assay was further evaluated using 126 clinical specimens and compared with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay. RESULTS: The GeXP assay achieved a sensitivity of 20–200 copies for a single virus and 1000 copies when all of the 16 pre-mixed viral targets were present. Analyses of 126 clinical specimens using the GeXP assay demonstrated that GeXP assay and the RVP Fast assay were in complete agreement for 109/126 (88.51%) of the specimens. GeXP assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3, and slightly less sensitive for the detection of HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV. The whole process of the GeXP assay for the detection of 12 samples was completed within 2.5 hours. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the GeXP assay is a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and high throughput method for the detection of respiratory virus infections.","Li, Jin; Mao, Nai-Ying; Zhang, Chen; Yang, Meng-Jie; Wang, Miao; Xu, Wen-Bo; Ma, Xue-Jun",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891685/,642

635802,Dynamic analysis of a delayed COVID-19 epidemic with home quarantine in temporal-spatial heterogeneous via global exponential attractor method,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND: Carbohydrates are a class of large and diverse biomolecules, ranging from a simple monosaccharide to large multi-branching glycan structures. The covalent linkage of a carbohydrate to the nitrogen atom of an asparagine, a process referred to as N-linked glycosylation, plays an important role in the physiology of many living organisms. Most software for glycan modeling on a personal desktop computer requires knowledge of molecular dynamics to interface with specialized programs such as CHARMM or AMBER. There are a number of popular web-based tools that are available for modeling glycans (e.g., GLYCAM-WEB (http://https://dev.glycam.org/gp/) or Glycosciences.db (http://www.glycosciences.de/)). However, these web-based tools are generally limited to a few canonical glycan conformations and do not allow the user to incorporate glycan modeling into their protein structure modeling workflow. RESULTS: Here, we present Glycosylator, a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure that can be used directly in a Python script through its application programming interface (API) or through its graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward two-dimensional (2D) rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the glycosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific three-dimensional (3D) glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. CONCLUSIONS: Glycosylator was used to generate models of glycosylated protein without steric clashes. Since the molecular topology is based on the CHARMM force field, new complex sugar moieties can be generated without modifying the internals of the code. Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than any other available software or webserver at present. Glycosylator will be a valuable tool for the glycoinformatics and biomolecular modeling communities.","Lemmin, Thomas; Soto, Cinque",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640540/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-3097-6,642
636037,CatBoost for big data: an interdisciplinary review,2020-11-04,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted the lack of treatments to combat infections with human or (potentially) zoonotic CoVs. Thus, it is critical to develop and evaluate antiviral compounds that either directly target CoV functions or modulate host functions involved in viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that low-micromolar concentrations of 6′,6′-difluoro-aristeromycin (DFA), an adenosine nucleoside analogue, strongly inhibit the replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a cell-based infection assay. DFA was designed to target S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase and, consequently, may affect intracellular levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, which is used by two CoV methyltransferases involved in the capping of the 5’ end of the viral mRNAs. Passaging of wild-type MERS-CoV in the presence of DFA selected a virus population with a ∼100-fold decreased DFA sensitivity, which carried various amino acid substitutions in viral nonstructural proteins (nsps). Specifically, mutations were present in the RNA polymerase subunit (nsp12) and in nsp13, the helicase subunit containing a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase activity that has been implicated in CoV capping. We hypothesize that DFA directly or indirectly affects viral cap methylation, either by inhibiting the viral enzymes involved or by binding to SAH hydrolase. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of DFA against other betacoronaviruses, but found it to have limited impact on their replication, while being quite cytotoxic to the Calu-3 cells used for this comparison. Nevertheless, our results justify the further characterization of DFA derivatives as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication. Importance Currently, there is a lack of antiviral drugs with proven efficacy against human CoV infections including the MERS-CoV that is endemic in the Middle East, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and potential future zoonotic CoV. This highlights the importance to investigate new drug targets and identify compounds that can be used to inhibit CoV replication. In this study, we characterize the inhibitory effect of DFA on MERS-CoV replication by phenotypic studies, time-of-addition studies, and the generation and genotyping of a DFA-resistant virus population. Our results revealed that DFA needs further improvement to reduce its cytotoxic side-effects and potentially enhance its broad-spectrum activity. Despite this observation, we think that DFA can be used to understand the function and metabolic interactions of the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery, or as a starting point for the design of new compounds of the same class.","Ogando, Natacha S.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Jarhad, Dnyandev B.; Tripathi, Sushil Kumar; Lee, Hyuk Woo; Jeong, Lak Shin; Snijder, Eric J.; Posthuma, Clara C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.20.445077,642
636763,An Integrated Framework with Machine Learning and Radiomics for Accurate and Rapid Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from the respiratory samples of patients with pneumonia as showed by the sequence analysis of the virus genomes obtained in Wuhan, China. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood yet, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays will be crucial for the early diagnosis of infection, for epidemiological studies and for defining the presence of neutralizing antibodies in response to a possible vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). RESULTS: The ECLIA serological assay performed best and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. CONCLUSION: The ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.","Pieri, Massimo; Ciotti, Marco; Carlozzi, Nicoletta; Frassanito, Maria Loredana; Meloni, Arianna; Cistera, Alessandro; Turchetti, Giordano; Niscola, Silvia; Labate, Giuseppe; Calugi, Graziella; Bernardini, Sergio",Clin Chim Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.09.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120304654; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120304654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002475/,642

The consensus was developed by five experts with an average of 20 years of experience in neonatal intensive care working at a reference university hospital in Brazil for the care of pregnant women and newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Despite the lack of scientific evidence regarding the potential for viral transmission to their fetus in pregnant mothers diagnosed with or suspected of COVID-19, it is important to elaborate the lines of care by specialists from hospitals caring for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to guide multidisciplinary teams and families diagnosed with the disease or involved in the care of pregnant women and newborns in this context. Multidisciplinary teams must be attentive to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 so that decision-making is oriented and assertive for the management of the mother and newborn in both the hospital setting and at hospital discharge.","de Carvalho, Werther Brunow; Gibelli, Maria Augusta Bento Cicaroni; Krebs, Vera Lucia Jornada; Calil, Valdenise Martins Laurindo Tuma; Johnston, Cíntia",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2020/e1932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428112/,642

Faced with the health and social consequences of the mistrust of scientific knowledge, there is an urgent need for tools to measure the acceptance or rejection of scientific knowledge, while at the same time gaining a more detailed understanding of the processes involved. This is the purpose of this article. Thus, we conducted 4 empirical studies to provide a validation of the Credibility of Science Scale from the perspective of a French population, which aims to assess the credibility that individuals attribute to science and to empirically evaluate the link that may exist between the different levels of credibility attributed to science and the social representations of science. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrated good structural validity, the good fidelity (homogeneity and temporal stability), and the good criterion validity of the French version of the scale. In Study 2, we observed the same psychometric qualities of the French version of the scale. We also noted a structuring of the social representation of science based on age (Factor 1) and on the credibility attributed to science (Factor 2). Our results also raise the question of possible means of intervention to promote a better perception of science.","Tavani, Jean Louis; Piermattéo, Anthony; Lo Monaco, Grégory; Delouvée, Sylvain",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469445/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250823,642

However, its efficacy has not been systematically reviewed. This review aims to fill the gat. METHODS: We searched six electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), WanFang Database and SinoMed from inception to May 1, 2020. Search terms included “pangolin”, “Squama Manitis”, “Manis crassicaudata”, “Manis javanica”, “Malayan pangolins”, “Manis pentadactyla”, “Ling Li”, “Chuan Shan Jia”, “Shan Jia”, “Pao Jia Zhu”, “Jia Pian” and “Pao Shan Jia”. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to evaluate the risk of bias of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case control studies (CCSs). RESULTS: After screening, 15 articles that met the inclusion criteria were finally included. There were 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 case control study, 3 case series and 7 case reports. A total of 15 different diseases were reported in these studies, thus the data could not be merged and descriptive analysis was carried out. Included RCTs of this review have shown that Squama Manitis combined with herbal decoction was superior to herbal decoction alone in the treatment of postpartum hypogalactia (RR 1.21, 95% CI1.11 to 1.32, P < 0.00001) and breast hyperplasia (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19, P = 0.24), and the clinical efficacy of Squama Manitis combined with antibiotics was better than antibiotics alone for acute mastitis (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.35, P = 0.16) and mesenteric lymphadenitis (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.09, P = 0.01). The methodological quality was generally low in all included reports. CONCLUSION: There is no reliable evidence that Squama Manitis has special medicinal value. The removal of Squama Manitis from Pharmacopoeia is rational.","Jin, Xinyao; Chua, Hui Zi; Wang, Keyi; Li, Nan; Zheng, Wenke; Pang, Wentai; Yang, Fengwen; Pang, Bo; Zhang, Mingyan; Zhang, Junhua",Integr Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837905/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213422020301189; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422020301189?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100486,642

To this end, nowadays more than ever, it is crucial to deliver solutions that can help people to manage and control their stress, as well as to reduce sleep disturbances, so as to improve their health and overall quality of life. Technology, and in particular Ambient Intelligence Environments, can help towards that direction, when considering that they are able to understand the needs of their users, identify their behavior, learn their preferences, and act and react in their interest. This work presents two systems that have been designed and developed in the context of an Intelligent Home, namely CaLmi and HypnOS, which aim to assist users that struggle with stress and poor sleep quality, respectively. Both of the systems rely on real-time data collected by wearable devices, as well as contextual information retrieved from the ambient facilities of the Intelligent Home, so as to offer appropriate pervasive relaxation programs (CaLmi) or provide personalized insights regarding sleep hygiene (HypnOS) to the residents.

Based on an approach developed in shake flask cultures, this strategy was established in benchtop bioreactors, comprising the growth of suspension AGE1.CR.pIX cells to high cell densities in a chemically defined medium before infection with the MVA-CR19 virus strain. First, a perfusion regime was established to optimize the cell growth phase. Second, a fed-batch regime was chosen for the initial infection phase to facilitate virus uptake and cell-to-cell spreading. Afterwards, a switch to perfusion enabled the continuous supply of nutrients for the late stages of virus propagation. With maximum infectious titers of 1.0 × 10(10) IU/mL, this hybrid fed-batch/perfusion strategy increased product titers by almost one order of magnitude compared to conventional batch cultivations. Finally, this strategy was also applied to the production of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus considered for manufacturing of inactivated vaccines. Using the same culture system, a total number of 3.8 × 10(10) virions/mL was achieved. Overall, comparable or even higher cell-specific virus yields and volumetric productivities were obtained using the same cultivation systems as for the conventional batch cultivations. In addition, most viral particles were found in the culture supernatant, which can simplify further downstream operations, in particular for MVA viruses. Considering the current availability of well-described perfusion/cell retention technologies, the present strategy may contribute to the development of new approaches for viral vaccine production.

652324,FSDroid:- A feature selection technique to detect malware from Android using Machine Learning Techniques: FSDroid,2021-01-14,"MOTIVATION: Nucleus detection, segmentation, and classification is fundamental to high-resolution mapping of the tumor microenvironment using whole-slide histopathology images. The growing interest in leveraging the power of deep learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance often comes at the cost of explainability, yet there is general consensus that explainability is critical for trustworthiness and widespread clinical adoption. Unfortunately, current explainability paradigms that rely on pixel saliency heatmaps or superpixel importance scores are not well-suited for nucleus classification. Techniques like Grad-CAM or LIME provide explanations that are indirect, qualitative, and/or non-intuitive to pathologists. RESULTS: In this paper, we present techniques to enable scalable nuclear detection, segmentation and explainable classification. First, we show how modifications to the widely used Mask R-CNN architecture, including decoupling the detection and classification tasks, improves accuracy and enables learning from hybrid annotation datasets like NuCLS, which contain mixtures of bounding boxes and segmentation boundaries. Second, we introduce an explainability method called Decision Tree Approximation of Learned Embeddings (DTALE), which provides explanations for classification model behavior globally, as well as for individual nuclear predictions. DTALE explanations are simple, quantitative, and can flexibly use any measurable morphological features that make sense to practicing pathologists, without sacrificing model accuracy. Together, these techniques present a step towards realizing the promise of computational pathology in computer-aided diagnosis and discovery of morphologic biomarkers.

Here, taking a challenging classification found in coronaviruses, we argue that consideration of biological properties in addition to sequence-based demarcations is critical for generating useful taxonomy that recapitulates complex evolutionary histories. Within the Alphacoronavirus genus, the Alphacoronavirus 1 species encompasses several biologically distinct viruses. We carried out functionally based phylogenetic analysis, centered on the spike gene, which encodes the main surface antigen and primary driver of tropism and pathogenesis. Within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species, we identify clade A (encompassing serotype I feline coronavirus [FCoV] and canine coronavirus [CCoV]) and clade B (grouping serotype II FCoV and CCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]-like viruses). We propose this clade designation, along with the newly proposed Alphacoronavirus 2 species, as an improved way to classify the Alphacoronavirus genus. IMPORTANCE Our work focuses on improving the classification of the Alphacoronavirus genus. The Alphacoronavirus 1 species groups viruses of veterinary importance that infect distinct mammalian hosts and includes canine and feline coronaviruses and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. It is the prototype species of the Alphacoronavirus genus; however, it encompasses biologically distinct viruses. To better characterize this prototypical species, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the spike protein, one of the main determinants of tropism and pathogenesis, and reveal the existence of two subgroups or clades that fit with previously established serotype demarcations. We propose a new clade designation to better classify Alphacoronavirus 1 members.","Whittaker, Gary R.; André, Nicole M.; Millet, Jean Kaoru",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/mspheredirect.00463-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299531/,642
652651,Impact of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia on China’s Economy and the World Economy,2021-02-03,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is associated with severe diarrhea, dehydration, and depression, which result in significant economic damages in the dairy and beef cattle industries worldwide. However, differences in the gut microbiota structure and their correlations with differing physiological parameters between BCoV-infected calves with diarrhea and recovered calves are not well understood. In this study, fecal specimens were collected from 10 post-weaned calves, before and after 2 months of fluid therapy, and the samples were used for microbiota analysis. Following recovery, the alpha-diversity profiles (observed operational taxonomic units [OTUs], and Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) changed significantly when compared with those of calves with diarrhea. Beta-diversity analysis exhibited significant differences in gut microbiota compositions between calves with diarrhea and those in the recovered state. The abundances of eight phyla and thirteen genera in feces changed markedly after restoration of BCoV diarrhea. In addition, our correlation study clearly revealed that increased abundances of the genera Caproiciproducens, Pseudoflavonifractor, and Oscillibacter negatively correlated with serum glucose, and phosphorus levels, but positively correlated with serum chloride in calves with diarrhea, whereas increased abundances of the genera Peptostreptococcaceae;Clostridium (Clostridium cluster XI), Intestinibacter, Cellulosilyticum, Ruminococcus, Romboutsia, Paeniclostridium, Clostridiaceae;Clostridium and Turicibacter in recovered calves showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that structural changes of the gut microbiota after recovery from BCoV infection correlate with changes in physiological parameters.

SARS-CoV-2-S-targeted antibody and T cell responses following full vaccination were assessed in nursing home residents. METHODS: Sixty nursing home residents (44 female; age, 53-100 years), of whom 10 had previously been diagnosed of COVID-19, and 18 healthy controls (15 female; age, 27-54 years) were recruited. Pre- and post-vaccination blood specimens were available for quantitation of total antibodies binding SARS-CoV-2 S protein and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-γ CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The seroconversion rate in presumably SARS-CoV-2 naïve nursing home residents (41/43; 95.3%), was similar to controls (17/18; 94.4%). A booster effect was documented in post vaccination samples of nursing home residents with prior COVID-19. Plasma antibody levels were higher (P<0.01) in recovered nursing home residents (all 2,500 IU/ml) than in individuals across the other two groups (median, 1,120 IU/ml in naïve nursing home residents and 2,211 IU/ml in controls). A large percentage of nursing home residents had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-γ CD8(+) (naïve, 31/49; 63.2%; recovered, 8/10; 80%) or CD4(+) T cells (naïve, 35/49; 71.4%; recovered, 7/10; 70%) at baseline, in contrast to healthy controls (3/17, 17.6% and 5/17; 29%, respectively).

Overall, the median frequency of SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in nursing home residents decreased in post-vaccination specimens, whereas it increased in controls. CONCLUSION: The Comirnaty® COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust SARS-CoV-2-S antibody responses in nursing home residents.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hyperglycemia suffer from longer hospital stays, higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and increased mortality compared to those who do not develop hyperglycemia. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 remains poorly characterized. Here we show that insulin resistance rather than pancreatic beta cell failure is the prevalent cause of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, independent of glucocorticoid treatment. A screen of protein hormones that regulate glucose homeostasis reveals that the insulin sensitizing adipokine adiponectin is reduced in hyperglycemic COVID-19 patients. Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 also have diminished expression of adiponectin.

Overall, the Alere i RSV test performed well compared to the RT-PCR assay and has the potential to facilitate the detection of RSV in point-of-care settings.","Peters, Rebecca Marie; Schnee, Sarah Valerie; Tabatabai, Julia; Schnitzler, Paul; Pfeil, Johannes",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077700/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02433-16,642
660233,Research Progress on Coronavirus Prevention and Control in Animal-Source Foods.,2020,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important viral respiratory pathogen worldwide. Current knowledge regarding the genetic diversity, seasonality and transmission dynamics of HMPV among adults and children living in tropical climate remains limited. HMPV prevailed at 2.2% (n = 86/3,935) among individuals presented with acute respiratory tract infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2014. Seasonal peaks were observed during the northeast monsoon season (November–April) and correlated with higher relative humidity and number of rainy days (P < 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of the fusion and attachment genes identified the co-circulation of three known HMPV sub-lineages, A2b and B1 (30.2% each, 26/86) and B2 (20.9%, 18/86), with genotype shift from sub-lineage B1 to A2b observed in 2013. Interestingly, a previously unrecognized sub-lineage of A2 was identified in 18.6% (16/86) of the population. Using a custom script for network construction based on the TN93 pairwise genetic distance, we identified up to nine HMPV transmission clusters circulating as multiple sub-epidemics. Although no apparent major outbreak was observed, the increased frequency of transmission clusters (dyads) during seasonal peaks suggests the potential roles of transmission clusters in driving the spread of HMPV. Our findings provide essential information for therapeutic research, prevention strategies, and disease outbreak monitoring of HMPV.","Chow, Wei Zhen; Chan, Yoke Fun; Oong, Xiang Yong; Ng, Liang Jie; Nor’E, Siti Sarah; Ng, Kim Tien; Chan, Kok Gan; Hanafi, Nik Sherina; Pang, Yong Kek; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Tee, Kok Keng",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279080/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27730,642
661447,Special Series Guest Editorial: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Biomedical Optics,2021-05-10,"Pneumonia is a common complication associated with COVID-19 infections. Unlike common versions of pneumonia spread quickly through large lung regions, COVID-19 related pneumonia starts in small localized pockets before spreading over the course of several days. This makes the infection more resilient and with a high probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because of the peculiar spread pattern, the use of pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) scans was key in identifying COVID-19 infections. Identifying uncommon pulmonary diseases could be a strong line of defense in early detection of new respiratory infection-causing viruses. In this paper we describe a classification algorithm based on hyperdimensional computing for the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia in CT scans. We test our algorithm using three different datasets. The highest reported accuracy is 95.2% with an F1 score of 0.90, and all three models had a precision of 1 (0 false positives).","Watkinson, N.

662056,SIRSi compartmental model for COVID-19 pandemic with immunity loss,2020-10-29,"Hospital and healthcare facilities have diverse indoor environment due to the different comfort and health needs of its occupants. Currently, most ventilation studies revolve around specialised areas such as operating rooms and isolation rooms. This paper focuses on the ventilation of multiple-bed hospital wards in the tropical climate, taking into account the design, indoor conditions and engineering controls. General ward layouts are described briefly. The required indoor conditions such as temperature, humidity, air movements and indoor air quality in the ward spaces are summarized based on the current guidelines and practices. Also, recent studies and engineering practices in the hospital indoor environment are elaborated. Usage of computational fluid dynamics tools for the ventilation studies is discussed as well. As identified during the review, there is an apparent knowledge gap for ventilation studies in the tropics compared with temperate climates, as fact studies have only been published for hospital wards in countries with a temperate climate. Therefore, it is highlighted that specific tropical studies along with novel engineering controls are required in addressing the ventilation requirements for the tropics.","Yau, Y.H.; Chandrasegaran, D.; Badarudin, A.",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288016/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132310003446; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.11.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132310003446,642
664084,An Ensemble Approach for Multi-Stage Transfer Learning Models for COVID-19 Detection from Chest CT Scans,2021-02-18,"Résumé La rhinopharyngite désigne une inflammation modérée des voies aériennes supérieures d’origine infectieuse. Les signes habituels en sont l’obstruction nasale, la rhinorrhée, l’éternuement, la douleur pharyngée et la toux. Le terme de rhinopharyngite est spécifiquement français. Les auteurs anglo-saxons parlent de rhume (common cold) ou de upper respiratory tract infection (URI) pour décrire une inflammation aiguë des voies aériennes supérieures, et d’adénoïdite chronique (chronic adenoiditis) pour désigner une infection chronique des végétations adénoïdes responsable de rhinorrhées fébriles itératives ou d’obstruction des voies aériennes supérieures. Les rhinopharyngites aiguës non compliquées sont d’origine virale. Leur évolution spontanée est habituellement rapide et non compliquée. Elles ne nécessitent donc ni prélèvement bactériologique ni antibiothérapie systématique. En première intention, elles relèvent exclusivement d’un traitement antalgique et antipyrétique associé à des lavages des fosses nasales au sérum salé iso- ou hypertonique. Les complications des rhinopharyngites sont infectieuses, essentiellement représentées par les otites et les sinusites, et respiratoires obstructives. Le caractère fréquemment itératif des rhinopharyngites à partir de l’âge de 6 mois reflète un processus physiologique de maturation du système immunitaire. En présence de rhinopharyngites fréquentes et invalidantes, les principaux facteurs de risque devant être recherchés et si possible éradiqués sont le tabagisme passif et la fréquentation d’une collectivité d’enfants. L’adénoïdectomie n’est pas indiquée en l’absence de complications. Le développement d’antiviraux efficaces dans la prévention et dans le traitement des rhinopharyngites fait l’objet d’intenses recherches cliniques et expérimentales. Abstract The “common cold” or upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is a moderate inflammation of the upper respiratory tract mucosa extended from the nasal cavity to the larynx. The main symptoms are nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, pharyngeal pain, sneezing, and coughing. Acute URI is a viral infection. It usually heals without any complication, and does not require any bacteriological samples nor antibiotherapy. First-line treatment consists of analgesic and antipyretic drugs associated with normal or hypertonic saline nasal wash. The most frequent URI complications are infectious diseases, mainly otitis media, sinusitis, and upper airway obstruction. URI recurrences that are often observed after the age of 6 months reflect a physiological process of maturation of the immune system. If the frequency of recurrences becomes overwhelming, some risk factors, such as passive smoking and day care attendance, must be searched for and, if possible, suppressed. Adenoidectomy is not indicated in the absence of complications. Ongoing clinical and experimental researches are carried out in order to develop new antiviral drugs aimed at preventing or healing URI.","Couloigner, V; Van Den Abbeele, T",EMC - Oto-rhino-laryngologie,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1762568804000235; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1762568804000235,642

666372,"Automatic Diagnosis of COVID-19 Disease using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Feature Channel from Respiratory Sound Data: Cough, Voice, and Breath",2021-06-19,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common manifestation of COVID-19 and several cases have been reported in the setting of the high-risk APOL1 genotype (common genetic variants). This increases the likelihood that African American people with the high-risk genotype APOL1 are at increased risk for kidney disease in the COVID-19 environment. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are found in various microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes change the miRNA activity that leads to different diseases. Evidence has shown that SNPs increase/decrease the effectiveness of the interaction between miRNAs and disease-related target genes. The aim of this study is not only to identify miRSNPs on the APOL1 gene and SNPs in miRNA genes targeting 3′UTR but also to evaluate the effect of these gene variations in kidney patients and their association with SARS-COV-2 infection. In 3′UTR of the APOL1 gene, we detected 96 miRNA binding sites and 35 different SNPs with 10 different online software in the binding sites of the miRNA (in silico). Also we studied gene expression of patients and control samples by using qRT-PCR (in vitro). In silico study, the binding site of miR-6741-3p on APOL1 has two SNPs (rs1288875001, G > C; rs1452517383, A > C) on APOL1 3′UTR, and its genomic sequence is the same nucleotide as rs1288875001. Similarly, two other SNPs (rs1142591, T > A; rs376326225, G > A) were identified in the binding sites of miR-6741-3p at the first position. Here, the miRSNP (rs1288875001) in APOL1 3′UTR and SNP (rs376326225) in the miR-6741-3p genomic sequence are cross-matched in the same binding region. In vitro study, the relative expression levels were calculated by the 2(−ΔΔCt) method & Mann–Whitney U test. The expression of APOL1 gene was different in chronic kidney patients along with COVID-19. By these results, APOL1 expression was found lower in patients than healthy (p < 0.05) in kidney patients along with COVID-19. In addition, miR-6741-3p targets many APOL1-related genes (TLR7, SLC6A19, IL-6,10,18, chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 5, SWT1, NFYB, BRF1, HES2, NFYB, MED12L, MAFG, GTF2H5, TRAF3, angiotensin II receptor-associated protein, PRSS23) by evaluating online software in the binding sites of the miR-6741-3p. miR-6741-3p has not previously shown any association with kidney diseases and SARS-COV-2 infection. It assures that APOL1 can have a significant consequence in kidney-associated diseases by different pathways. Henceforth, this study represents and demonstrates an effective association between miR-6741-3p and kidney diseases, i.e., collapsing glomerulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and tubulointerstitial lesions susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 infection via in silico and in vitro exploration and recommended to have better insight.","Safdar, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Sajjad; Karim, Abdulkarim Yasin; Omar, Shwan Ali; Smail, Shukur Wasman; Saeed, Muhammad; Zaheer, Sana; Ali, Mazhar; Ahmad, Bilal; Tasleem, Muhammad; Junejo, Yasmeen",Mamm Genome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089082/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-021-09880-6,642

This study aimed to describe key patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes of a large U.S.-based cohort of patients hospitalized with COVD-19 using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients in the Optum De-identified COVID-19 EHR database who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a presumptive diagnosis between 20 February 2020 and 6 June 2020. We included hospitalizations that occurred 7 days prior to, or within 21 days after, COVID-19 diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients we describe the following: vital statistics and laboratory results on admission, relevant comorbidities (using diagnostic, procedural, and revenue codes), medications (NDC, HCPC codes), ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 76,819 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 16,780 of whom met inclusion criteria for COVID-related hospitalization. Over half the cohort was over age 50 (74.5%), overweight or obese (72.1%), or had hypertension (58.1%). At admission, 29.1% of patients presented with fever (>38 C) and 30.6% had low oxygen saturation (<90%). Among the 16,099 patients with complete hospital records, we observed that 58.9% had hypoxia, 23.4% had an ICU stay during hospitalization, 18.1% were ventilated, and 16.2% died. The median LOS was 6 days (IQR: 4, 11). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest descriptive study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States. We report summary statistics of key clinical outcomes that provide insights to better understand COVID-19 disease epidemiology.","Rizzo, S.; Chawla, D.; Zalocusky, K.; Keebler, D.; Chia, J.; Lindsay, L.; Yau, V.; Kamath, T.; Tsai, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156265; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.17.20156265v1?rss=1,642
