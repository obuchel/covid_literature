1503,1503,1503,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with H1N1 influenza infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis including 8 studies and 266 patients receiving ECMO,18.568413,11.30147,2013-02-13,"INTRODUCTION: H1N1 influenza can cause severe acute lung injury (ALI). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI. METHODS: CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods. RESULTS: From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I(2 )= 64%). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.","Zangrillo, Alberto; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Landoni, Giovanni; Frati, Giacomo; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pesenti, Antonio; Pappalardo, Federico",Crit Care,301,27
2366,2366,2366,Use of noninvasive ventilation at the pulmonary infection control window for acute respiratory failure in AECOPD patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on GRADE approach,18.885754,10.9389,2016-06-17,"The aim of the study was to comprehensively examine the efficacy and safety of noninvasive ventilation used at the pulmonary infection control (PIC) window for acute respiratory failure (ARF) in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Seven electronic databases and relevant resources were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients using noninvasive ventilation at PIC window with those continuing receiving invasive ventilation. Retrieved citations were screened, risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted by 2 independent review authors. Overall effect sizes were synthesized by using meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated by using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A total of 17 trials involving 959 participants were included for this review. Compared with continuous invasive ventilation, noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window significantly reduced mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. Of these, mortality significantly decreased (risk ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.17–0.42, P < 0.001) without significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.99). Quality of evidence regarding the 9 outcomes across the included studies was rated from moderate to low. Use of noninvasive ventilation at PIC window showed beneficial effects across identified trials for ARF in AECOPD patients. Considering the absence of high quality of available evidence and the uncertainty of long-term effect of this intervention, a weak recommendation for clinical practice was generated, and further well-designed and adequately powered RCTs are required to validate this conclusion.","Peng, Le; Ren, Peng-Wei; Liu, Xue-Ting; Zhang, Chao; Zuo, Hong-Xia; Kang, De-Ying; Niu, Yu-Ming",Medicine (Baltimore),301,27
2455,2455,2455,Lung ultrasound: a promising tool to monitor ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients,18.64627,11.107115,2016-10-27,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection that is independently associated with mortality. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment have been shown to improve the prognosis of VAP. Chest X-ray or computed tomography imaging are used for conventional assessment of VAP, but these methods are impractical for real-time measurement in critical patients. Therefore, lung ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used for the assessment of VAP in the ICU. Traditionally, LUS has seemed unsuitable for the detection of lung parenchyma owing to the high acoustic impedance of air; however, the fact that the reflection and reverberation in the detection region of the ultrasound reflect the underlying pathology of lung diseases has led to the increased use of ultrasound imaging as a standard of care supported by evidence-based and expert consensus in the ICU. Considering that any type of pneumonia causes air volume changes in the lungs, accumulating evidence has shown that LUS effectively measures the presence of VAP as well as dynamic changes in VAP. This review offers evidence for ultrasound as a noninvasive, easily repeatable, and bedside means to assess VAP; in addition, it establishes a protocol for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of VAP.

Here, we analyzed a large mixed cohort of immunocompromised patients with PcP, with regard to clinical course and treatment, and aimed at identifying predictors of outcome. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective analysis in a tertiary care institution across 17 years. Diagnosis of PcP required typical clinical features and microbiological confirmation of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were collected from patient records. RESULTS: A total of 52,364 specimens from 7504 patients were sent for microbiological assessment (3653 with clinical suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia). PcP was confirmed in 240 patients, about half of them HIV positive (52%). The remaining subjects were either solid organ transplant recipients (16.3%) or suffered from malignancy (15.8%) or autoimmune diseases (11.7%). Of note, 95% of patients with PcP were not receiving chemoprophylaxis. Overall in-hospital mortality was 25.4%, increasing to 58% if ICU admission was required. Multivariable regression identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.17 (95% CI 1.09–1.27), p < 0.0001). Mortality in LDH quartiles increased from 8% to 49%, and a cutoff value of 495 U/L predicted mortality with sensitivity and specificity of 70%. With regard to treatment, 40% of patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at doses that were lower than recommended, and these patients had a higher mortality risk (HR 1.80 (95% CI 1.10–3.44), p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: PcP remains a life-threatening disease among immunocompromised patients. About half of patients with PcP do not have HIV infection. Initial LDH values might serve as a stratifying tool to identify those patients at high risk of death among patients with HIV and without HIV infection.

3872,3872,3872,"Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment",18.975489,10.932262,2019-06-12,"Annual seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity result in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. In temperate climate countries, including the U.S., influenza activity peaks during the winter months. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons in the U.S. aged 6 months and older, and among those at increased risk for influenza-related complications in other parts of the world (e.g. young children, elderly). Observational studies have reported effectiveness of influenza vaccination to reduce the risks of severe disease requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. A diagnosis of influenza should be considered in critically ill patients admitted with complications such as exacerbation of underlying chronic comorbidities, community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory failure during influenza season. Molecular tests are recommended for influenza testing of respiratory specimens in hospitalized patients. Antigen detection assays are not recommended in critically ill patients because of lower sensitivity; negative results of these tests should not be used to make clinical decisions, and respiratory specimens should be tested for influenza by molecular assays. Because critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract disease may have cleared influenza virus in the upper respiratory tract, but have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, an endotracheal aspirate (preferentially) or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen (if collected for other diagnostic purposes) should be tested by molecular assay for detection of influenza viruses. Observational studies have reported that antiviral treatment of critically ill adult influenza patients with a neuraminidase inhibitor is associated with survival benefit. Since earlier initiation of antiviral treatment is associated with the greatest clinical benefit, standard-dose oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily in adults) for enteric administration is recommended as soon as possible as it is well absorbed in critically ill patients. Based upon observational data that suggest harms, adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is currently not recommended for children or adults hospitalized with influenza, including critically ill patients, unless clinically indicated for another reason, such as treatment of asthma or COPD exacerbation, or septic shock. A number of pharmaceutical agents are in development for treatment of severe influenza.","Chow, Eric J.; Doyle, Joshua D.; Uyeki, Timothy M.",Crit Care,301,12
4179,4179,4179,The early change of SOFA score as a prognostic marker of 28-day sepsis mortality: analysis through a derivation and a validation cohort,18.924976,10.959282,2019-11-29,"BACKGROUND: Since the Sepsis-3 criteria, change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score has become a key component of sepsis identification. Thus, it could be argued that reversal of this change (Δ(SOFA)) may reflect sepsis response and could be used as measure of efficacy in interventional trials. We aimed to assess the predictive performance of Δ(SOFA) for 28-day mortality. METHODS: Data from two previously published randomized controlled trials were studied: the first reporting on patients with severe Gram-negative infections as a derivation cohort and the second reporting on patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia as a validation cohort. Only patients with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 definition were included in this analysis. SOFA scores were calculated on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28. RESULTS: We included 448 patients within the derivation cohort and 199 within the validation cohort. Mean SOFA scores on day 1 were 6.06 ± 4.07 and 7.84 ± 3.39, and 28 day mortality 22.8% and 29.6%, respectively. In the derivation cohort, the earliest time point where Δ(SOFA) score predicted mortality was day 7 (AUROC (95% CI) 0.84 (0.80–0.89); p < 0.001). The best tradeoff for prediction was found with 25% changes (78% sensitivity, 80% specificity); less than 25% decrease of admission SOFA was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio for death 14.87). This finding was confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Δ(SOFA) on day 7 is a useful early prognostic marker of 28-day mortality and could serve as an endpoint in future sepsis trials alongside mortality.

Our primary aim was to review incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of AKI in burn patients admitted to the ICU. Secondary aims were to review the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and impact on health care costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, UpToDate, and NICE through 3 December 2018. All reviews in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews except protocols were added to the PubMed search. We searched for studies on AKI according to Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE); Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN); and/or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria in burn patients admitted to the ICU. We collected data on AKI incidence, risk factors, use of RRT, renal recovery, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and health care costs. RESULTS: We included 33 observational studies comprising 8200 patients. Overall study quality, scored according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, was moderate. Random effect model meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of AKI among burn patients in the ICU was 38 (30–46) %. Patients with AKI were almost evenly distributed in the mild, moderate, and severe AKI subgroups. RRT was used in 12 (8–16) % of all patients. Risk factors for AKI were high age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high Total Body Surface Area percent burnt, high Abbreviated Burn Severity Index score, inhalation injury, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation. AKI patients had 8.6 (4.0–13.2) days longer ICU LOS and higher mortality than non-AKI patients, OR 11.3 (7.3–17.4). Few studies reported renal recovery, and no study reported health care costs. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurred in 38% of burn patients admitted to the ICU, and 12% of all patients received RRT. Presence of AKI was associated with increased LOS and mortality.

4261,4261,4261,Prevention and treatment of acute lung injury with time-controlled adaptive ventilation: physiologically informed modification of airway pressure release ventilation,18.633307,11.11441,2020-01-06,"Mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high at approximately 39%. One of the only treatments is supportive: mechanical ventilation. However, improperly set mechanical ventilation can further increase the risk of death in patients with ARDS. Recent studies suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by exaggerated regional lung strain, particularly in areas of alveolar instability subject to tidal recruitment/derecruitment and stress-multiplication. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if a ventilation strategy can maintain stable lung inflation and homogeneity, regional dynamic strain would be reduced and VILI attenuated. A time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method was developed to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting the delivered breath according to the mechanical characteristics of the lung. The goal of this review is to describe how the TCAV method impacts pathophysiology and protects lungs with, or at high risk of, acute lung injury. We present work from our group and others that identifies novel mechanisms of VILI in the alveolar microenvironment and demonstrates that the TCAV method can reduce VILI in translational animal ARDS models and mortality in surgical/trauma patients. Our TCAV method utilizes the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode and is based on opening and collapsing time constants, which reflect the viscoelastic properties of the terminal airspaces. Time-controlled adaptive ventilation uses inspiratory and expiratory time to (1) gradually “nudge” alveoli and alveolar ducts open with an extended inspiratory duration and (2) prevent alveolar collapse using a brief (sub-second) expiratory duration that does not allow time for alveolar collapse. The new paradigm in TCAV is configuring each breath guided by the previous one, which achieves real-time titration of ventilator settings and minimizes instability induced tissue damage. This novel methodology changes the current approach to mechanical ventilation, from arbitrary to personalized and adaptive. The outcome of this approach is an open and stable lung with reduced regional strain and greater lung protection.","Nieman, Gary F.; Gatto, Louis A.; Andrews, Penny; Satalin, Joshua; Camporota, Luigi; Daxon, Benjamin; Blair, Sarah J.; Al-khalisy, Hassan; Madden, Maria; Kollisch-Singule, Michaela; Aiash, Hani; Habashi, Nader M.",Ann Intensive Care,301,12

Brainstem dysfunction may lead to sensory and motor deficits, cranial nerve palsies, impairment of consciousness, dysautonomia, and respiratory failure. The brainstem is prone to various primary and secondary insults, resulting in acute or chronic dysfunction. Of particular importance for characterizing brainstem dysfunction and identifying the underlying etiology are a detailed clinical examination, MRI, neurophysiologic tests such as brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of brainstem dysfunction is challenging but of utmost importance in comatose and deeply sedated patients both to guide therapy and to support outcome prediction.

4402,4402,4402,Variability in usual care fluid resuscitation and risk-adjusted outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients in shock,18.885006,11.202272,2020-01-28,"RATIONALE: There remains significant controversy regarding the optimal approach to fluid resuscitation for patients in shock. The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected (± 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p < 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation was associated with a non-uniform impact on risk-adjusted hospital mortality among distinct subgroups of mechanically ventilated patients with shock. These findings support closer evaluation of fluid resuscitation strategies that include broadly applied fluid volume targets in the early phase of shock resuscitation.","Mansoori, Jason N.; Linde-Zwirble, Walter; Hou, Peter C.; Havranek, Edward P.; Douglas, Ivor S.",Crit Care,301,12
4431,4431,4431,The effect of cisatracurium infusion on the energy expenditure of critically ill patients: an observational cohort study,18.870947,11.148769,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: Both overfeeding and underfeeding of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are associated with worse outcomes. A reliable estimation of the energy expenditure (EE) of ICU patients may help to avoid these phenomena. Several factors that influence EE have been studied previously. However, the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents on EE, which conceptually would lower EE, has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We studied a cohort of adult critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment with continuous infusion of cisatracurium for at least 12 h. The study aimed to quantify the effect of cisatracurium infusion on EE (primary endpoint). EE was estimated based on ventilator-derived VCO(2) (EE in kcal/day = VCO(2) × 8.19). A subgroup analysis of septic and non-septic patients was performed. Furthermore, the effects of body temperature and sepsis on EE were evaluated. A secondary endpoint was hypercaloric feeding (> 110% of EE) after cisatracurium infusion. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Mean EE before cisatracurium infusion was 1974 kcal/day and 1888 kcal/day after cisatracurium infusion. Multivariable analysis showed a significantly lower EE after cisatracurium infusion (MD − 132.0 kcal (95% CI − 212.0 to − 52.0; p = 0.001) in all patients. This difference was statistically significant in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011). Non-sepsis patients had lower EE than sepsis patients (MD − 120.6 kcal; 95% CI − 200.5 to − 40.8, p = 0.003). Body temperature and EE were positively correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0.486, p < 0.001). Hypercaloric feeding was observed in 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that continuous infusion of cisatracurium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients is associated with a significant reduction in EE, although the magnitude of the effect is small. Sepsis and higher body temperature are associated with increased EE. Cisatracurium infusion is associated with overfeeding in only a minority of patients and therefore, in most patients, no reductions in caloric prescription are necessary.","Koekkoek, W. A.

It is associated with long-term disability. Ultrasonography is a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass, but studies that evaluate muscle quality at the critically ill bedside are lacking. Shear wave ultrasound elastography (SWE) provides spatial representation of soft tissue stiffness and measures of muscle quality. The reliability and reproducibility of SWE in critically ill patients has never been evaluated. METHODS: Two operators tested in healthy controls and in critically ill patients the intra- and inter-operator reliability of the SWE using transversal and longitudinal views of the diaphragm and limb muscles. Reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient and a bootstrap sampling method assessed their consistency. RESULTS: We collected 560 images. Longitudinal views of the diaphragm (ICC 0.83 [0.50–0.94]), the biceps brachii (ICC 0.88 [0.67–0.96]) and the rectus femoris (ICC 0.76 [0.34–0.91]) were the most reliable views in a training set of healthy controls. Intra-class correlation coefficient for inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator reliability was above 0.9 for all muscles in a validation set of healthy controls. In critically ill patients, inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator 1 and 2 reliability ICCs were respectively 0.92 [0.71–0.98], 0.93 [0.82–0.98] and 0.92 [0.81–0.98] for the diaphragm; 0.96 [0.86–0.99], 0.98 [0.94–0.99] and 0.99 [0.96–1] for the biceps brachii and 0.91 [0.51–0.98], 0.97 [0.93–0.99] and 0.99 [0.97–1] for the rectus femoris. The probability to reach intra-class correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 in a 10,000 bootstrap sampling for inter-operator reproducibility was respectively 81%, 84% and 78% for the diaphragm, the biceps brachii and the rectus femoris respectively.

Accordingly, the present study applies machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy for this patient subset. METHODS: We randomly divided a total of 1571 adult patients who started CRRT for acute kidney injury into training (70%, n = 1094) and test (30%, n = 477) sets. The primary output consisted of the probability of mortality during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine learning algorithms with that of the APACHE II, SOFA, and the new abbreviated mortality scoring system for acute kidney injury with CRRT (MOSAIC model) results. RESULTS: For the ICU mortality, the random forest model showed the highest AUC (0.784 [0.744–0.825]), and the artificial neural network and extreme gradient boost models demonstrated the next best results (0.776 [0.735–0.818]). The AUC of the random forest model was higher than 0.611 (0.583–0.640), 0.677 (0.651–0.703), and 0.722 (0.677–0.767), as achieved by APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC, respectively. The machine learning models also predicted in-hospital mortality better than APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC. CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms increase the accuracy of mortality prediction for patients undergoing CRRT for acute kidney injury compared with previous scoring models.","Kang, Min Woo; Kim, Jayoun; Kim, Dong Ki; Oh, Kook-Hwan; Joo, Kwon Wook; Kim, Yon Su; Han, Seung Seok",Crit Care,301,12

This called to mind previous evidence for an infectious contribution of BDV-1 to mental disorders. Pilot open trials suggested that BDV-1 infected depressed patients benefitted from antiviral therapy with a licensed drug (amantadine) which also tested sensitive in vitro. Here, we designed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) which cross-linked depression and BDV-1 infection, addressing both the antidepressant and antiviral efficacy of amantadine. METHODS: The interventional phase II RCT (two 7-weeks-treatment periods and a 12-months follow-up) at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), Germany, assigned currently depressed BDV-1 infected patients with either major depression (MD; N = 23) or bipolar disorder (BD; N = 13) to amantadine sulphate (PK-Merz®; twice 100 mg orally daily) or placebo treatment, and contrariwise, respectively. Clinical changes were assessed every 2–3 weeks by the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) (total, single, and combined scores). BDV-1 activity was determined accordingly in blood plasma by enzyme immune assays for antigens (PAG), antibodies (AB) and circulating immune complexes (CIC). RESULTS: Primary outcomes (≥25% HAMD reduction, week 7) were 81.3% amantadine vs. 35.3% placebo responder (p = 0.003), a large clinical effect size (ES; Cohen’s d) of 1.046, and excellent drug tolerance. Amantadine was safe reducing suicidal behaviour in the first 2 weeks. Pre-treatment maximum infection levels were predictive of clinical improvement (AB, p = 0.001; PAG, p = 0.026; HAMD week 7). Respective PAG and CIC levels correlated with AB reduction (p = 0,001 and p = 0.034, respectively). Follow-up benefits (12 months) correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p < 0.001). In vitro, amantadine concentrations as low as 2.4–10 ng/mL (50% infection-inhibitory dose) prevented infection with human BDV Hu-H1, while closely related memantine failed up to 100,000-fold higher concentration (200 μg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate profound antidepressant efficacy of safe oral amantadine treatment, paralleling antiviral effects at various infection levels. This not only supports the paradigm of a link of BDV-1 infection and depression. It provides a novel possibly practice-changing low cost mental health care perspective for depressed BDV-1-infected patients addressing global needs.

Antimicrobial stewardship may be perceived as utilitarian rationing, seeking to preserve the availability of effective antimicrobials by limiting the development of resistance in a manner which could conflict with the immediate treatment of the patient in need. This view does not account for the growing evidence of antimicrobial-associated harm to individual patients. This review sets out the evidence for antimicrobial-associated harm and how this should be balanced with the need for prompt and appropriate therapy in infection. It describes the mechanisms by which antimicrobials may harm patients including: mitochondrial toxicity; immune cell toxicity; adverse drug reactions; selection of resistant organisms within a given patient; and disruption of the microbiome. Finally, the article indicates how the harms of antimicrobials may be mitigated and identifies areas for research and development in this field.","Arulkumaran, Nishkantha; Routledge, Matthew; Schlebusch, Sanmarié; Lipman, Jeffrey; Conway Morris, Andrew",Intensive Care Med,301,27

To explore the relationship between national and global processes for governing global health, this paper asks: in what forms of interaction between NPGH arenas and global health governance are learning and networking processes present? In a multiple case study of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, we collected data on intersectoral policy processes from semi-structured interviews with 33 informants in 2014-2015. Adapting Real-Dato’s framework, we analyzed each case separately, producing monographs for comparing NPGH arenas. Analyzing both NPGH arenas for relational structures linking external resources to internal policy arena processes, we found five zones of interactions - including institutions, transgovernmental clubs, and connective forms. These interactions circulate ideas and soften arenas’ boundaries. We argue that NPGH is characteristic of transnational governance of global health.

Setting: Dermatology intensive care unit in Mondor Hospital, France. Patients: 41 consecutive patients. Interventions: On admission, then daily, respiratory evaluation was based on clinical examination, chest X-ray, and arterial blood gas analysis. When clinical symptoms, X-ray abnormalities, or hypoxemia [partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2))<80 mm Hg] were present, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. Results: 10 patients presented early manifestations: dyspnea (n=10), bronchial hypersecretion (n=7), marked hypoxemia (n=10) (PO(2)=59 ± 8 mmHg). Chest X-ray was normal (n = 8) or showed interstitial infiltrates (n=2). In these 10 patients, fiberoptic bronchoscopy demonstrated sloughing of bronchial epithelium in proximal airways. Delayed pulmonary complications occurred in 6 of these 10 patients from day 7 to day 15: pulmonary edema (n=2), atelectasis (n=1), bacterial pneumonitis (n=4). Mechanical ventilation was required in 9 patients. A fatal outcome occurred in 7 patients. Seven patients did not develop early pulmonary manifestations (PO(2) on admission 87 ± 6 mm Hg) but only delayed pulmonary symptoms related to atelectasis (n=1), pulmonary edema (n=4), and bacterial pneumonitis (n=3); bronchial epithelial detachment was not observed. None of them required mechanical ventilation and all recovered with appropriate therapy. Conclusions: “Specific” involvement of bronchial epithelium was noted in 27 % of cases and must be suspected when dyspnea, bronchial hypersecretion, normal chest X-ray, and marked hypoxemia are present during the early stages of toxic epidermal necrosis. Bronchial injury seems to indicate a poor prognosis, as mechanical ventilation was required for most of these patients and was associated with a high mortality.","Lebargy, F.; Wolkenstein, P.; Gisselbrecht, M.; Lange, F.; Fleury-Feith, J.; Delclaux, C.; Roupie, E.; Revuz, J.; Roujeau, J.

Reported incidences vary widely from 5 to 40% depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria. VAP is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. The estimated attributable mortality of VAP is around 10%, with higher mortality rates in surgical ICU patients and in patients with mid-range severity scores at admission. Microbiological confirmation of infection is strongly encouraged. Which sampling method to use is still a matter of controversy. Emerging microbiological tools will likely modify our routine approach to diagnosing and treating VAP in the next future. Prevention of VAP is based on minimizing the exposure to mechanical ventilation and encouraging early liberation. Bundles that combine multiple prevention strategies may improve outcomes, but large randomized trials are needed to confirm this. Treatment should be limited to 7 days in the vast majority of the cases. Patients should be reassessed daily to confirm ongoing suspicion of disease, antibiotics should be narrowed as soon as antibiotic susceptibility results are available, and clinicians should consider stopping antibiotics if cultures are negative.","Papazian, Laurent; Klompas, Michael; Luyt, Charles-Edouard",Intensive Care Med,301,12

Inhaled NO was delivered in the ventilatory circuit of a continuous flow ventilator (Babylog 8000, Dräger) in a concentration of 20–80 ppm for 7 days. NO and NO(2) were continuously monitored (Polyton Draeger). Respiratory mechanics were evaluated by using the method of passive inflation by the ventilator. RESULTS: NO inhalation improved oxygenation (tcSaO(2)) and reduced respiratory system resistance without affecting arterial pressure. NO(2) level remained below 5 ppm, and methaemoglobin level below 1%. The child survived without neurologic sequela. CONCLUSIONS: Two mechanisms to explain oxygenation improvement can be suggested:selective improvement in perfusion of ventilated regions and bronchodilation.","Leclerc, F.; Riou, Y.; Martinot, A.; Storme, L.; Hue, V.; Flurin, V.; Deschildre, A.; Sadik, A.",Intensive Care Med,301,12

Pediatric candidates for ITx often suffer from severe multisystem impairments that pose challenges to the medical team. These patients frequently require intensive care preoperatively and have unique intensive care needs postoperatively. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on intensive care of pediatric intestinal transplantation as well as our own experience. This review is not aimed only at pediatric intensivists from ITx centers; these patients frequently require ICU care at other institutions. RESULTS: Preoperative management focuses on optimization of organ function, minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury, preventing excessive edema yet maintaining adequate organ perfusion, preventing and controlling sepsis and bleeding from varices at enterocutaneous interfaces, and optimizing nutritional support. The goal is to extend life in stable condition to the point of transplantation. Postoperative care focuses on optimizing perfusion of the mesenteric circulation by maintaining intravascular volume, minimizing hypercoagulability, and providing adequate oxygen delivery. Careful monitoring of the stoma and its output and correction of electrolyte imbalances that may require renal replacement therapy is critical, as are monitoring for and aggressively treating infections, which often present with only subtle clinical clues. Signs of intestinal rejection may be non-specific, and early differentiation from other causes of intestinal dysfunction is important. Understanding of the expanding armamentarium of immunosuppressive agents and their side-effects is required. CONCLUSIONS: As outcomes of ITx improve, transplant teams accept patients with higher pre-operative morbidity and at higher risk for complications. Many ITx patients would benefit from earlier referral for transplant evaluation before severe liver disease, recurrent central venous catheter-related sepsis and venous thromboses develop.","Hauser, Gabriel J.; Kaufman, Stuart S.; Matsumoto, Cal S.; Fishbein, Thomas M.",Intensive Care Med,301,12

In mice, the subset of T cells carrying the L3T4 surface antigen but lacking the Lyt-2 antigen responds predominantly to H–2 class II (la) differences whereas the L3T4(−) Lyt-2(+) subset reacts to class I (K/D) differences(1,2). For primary responses the stimulus for MLR and CML appears to be controlled by Ia(+) cells of the macrophage/dendritic cell lineages, for both L3T4(+) and Lyt-2(+) cells(3–6). The finding that la(+) cells are required for responses involving Lyt-2(+) cells has been taken to imply that triggering of these cells is controlled by la-restricted L3T4(+) cells(7,8). Lyt-2(+) cells have thus come to be regarded as crippled cells which are heavily dependent on ‘help’ from other T cells(9–11). This well-entrenched view is challenged by evidence presented here that purified Lyt-2(+) cells can give high primary responses to certain Ia(−) tumour cells in vitro.","Sprent, J.; Schaefer, Mary",Nature,301,12

Infection of a new host species can manifest as a distinct disease. In this respect, the use of non‐human viruses in clinical therapy may be a cause for concern. It could provide the opportunity for the viruses to adapt to the new host and be transferred to the recipient's relatives or medical caretakers, or even to the normal host species. Such environmental impact is evidently undesirable. To forecast future clinical use of non‐human viruses, a literature study was performed to identify the viruses that are being considered for application as therapeutic agents for use in humans. Twenty‐seven non‐human virus species were identified that are in (pre)clinical development, mainly as oncolytic agents. For risk management, it is essential that the potential environmental consequences are assessed before initiating clinical use, even if the virus is not formally classified as a genetically modified organism. To aid such assessment, each of these viruses was classified in one of five relative environmental risk categories, ranging from “Negligible” to “Very High”. Canary pox virus and the Autographa californica baculovirus were assigned a “Negligible” classification, and Seneca Valley virus, murine leukemia virus, and Maraba virus to the “High” category. A complicating factor in the classification is the scarcity of publicly available information on key aspects of virus biology in some species. In such cases the relative environmental risk score was increased as a precaution. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Koppers‐Lalic, Danijela; Hoeben, Rob C.",Rev Med Virol,301,12

The biological effects of GSM-EMF in humans affected by neuropathological processes remain seldom investigated. In this study, a 2-h head-only exposure to GSM-1800 MHz was applied to (i) rats undergoing an acute neuroinflammation triggered by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, (ii) age-matched healthy rats, or (iii) transgenic hSOD1(G93A) rats that modeled a presymptomatic phase of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Gene responses were assessed 24 h after the GSM head-only exposure in a motor area of the cerebral cortex (mCx) where the mean specific absorption rate (SAR) was estimated to be 3.22 W/kg. In LPS-treated rats, a genome-wide mRNA profiling was performed by RNA-seq analysis and revealed significant (adjusted p value < 0.05) but moderate (fold changes < 2) upregulations or downregulations affecting 2.7% of the expressed genes, including genes expressed predominantly in neuronal or in glial cell types and groups of genes involved in protein ubiquitination or dephosphorylation. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses confirmed gene modulations uncovered by RNA-seq data and showed that in a set of 15 PCR-assessed genes, significant gene responses to GSM-1800 MHz depended upon the acute neuroinflammatory state triggered in LPS-treated rats, because they were not observed in healthy or in hSOD1(G93A) rats. Together, our data specify the extent of cortical gene modulations triggered by GSM-EMF in the course of an acute neuroinflammation and indicate that GSM-induced gene responses can differ according to pathologies affecting the CNS.","Lameth, Julie; Arnaud-Cormos, Delia; Lévêque, Philippe; Boillée, Séverine; Edeline, Jean-Marc; Mallat, Michel",Neurotox Res,301,27

A functional link between the inhibition of 5-HT(2) receptors and Ca(V)1.2 channel blockade in arterial smooth muscles has been hypothesized. Therefore, the effects of ritanserin, a nonselective 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist, on vascular Ca(V)1.2 channels were investigated through electrophysiological, functional, and computational studies. Ritanserin blocked Ca(V)1.2 channel currents (I(Ca1.2)) in a concentration-dependent manner (K(r) = 3.61 µM); I(Ca1.2) inhibition was antagonized by Bay K 8644 and partially reverted upon washout. Conversely, the ritanserin analog ketanserin (100 µM) inhibited I(Ca1.2) by ~50%. Ritanserin concentration-dependently shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation curve to more negative potentials (K(i) = 1.58 µM) without affecting the slope of inactivation and the activation curve, and decreased I(Ca1.2) progressively during repetitive (1 Hz) step depolarizations (use-dependent block). The addition of ritanserin caused the contraction of single myocytes not yet dialyzed with the conventional method. Furthermore, in depolarized rings, ritanserin, and to a lesser extent, ketanserin, caused a concentration-dependent relaxation, which was antagonized by Bay K 8644. Ritanserin and ketanserin were docked at a region of the Ca(V)1.2 α(1C) subunit nearby that of Bay K 8644; however, only ritanserin and Bay K 8644 formed a hydrogen bond with key residue Tyr-1489. In conclusion, ritanserin caused in vitro vasodilation, accomplished through the blockade of Ca(V)1.2 channels, which was achieved preferentially in the inactivated and/or resting state of the channel. This novel activity encourages the development of ritanserin derivatives for their potential use in the treatment of Raynaud’s syndrome.","Fusi, Fabio; Trezza, Alfonso; Sgaragli, Giampietro; Spiga, Ottavia; Saponara, Simona; Bova, Sergio",Acta Pharmacol Sin,301,12

However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. METHODS: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. FINDINGS: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. INTERPRETATION: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

DNA polymerases select against NTPs by using steric gates to exclude the 2′OH, but RNAPs have to employ alternative selection strategies. In single-subunit RNAPs, a conserved Tyr residue discriminates against 2′dNTPs, whereas selectivity mechanisms of multi-subunit RNAPs remain hitherto unknown. Here, we show that a conserved Arg residue uses a two-pronged strategy to select against 2′dNTPs in multi-subunit RNAPs. The conserved Arg interacts with the 2′OH group to promote NTP binding, but selectively inhibits incorporation of 2′dNTPs by interacting with their 3′OH group to favor the catalytically-inert 2′-endo conformation of the deoxyribose moiety. This deformative action is an elegant example of an active selection against a substrate that is a substructure of the correct substrate. Our findings provide important insights into the evolutionary origins of biopolymers and the design of selective inhibitors of viral RNAPs.","Mäkinen, Janne J.; Shin, Yeonoh; Vieras, Eeva; Virta, Pasi; Metsä-Ketelä, Mikko; Murakami, Katsuhiko S.; Belogurov, Georgiy A.",Nat Commun,301,12

Nowadays, prokinetic drugs are the mainstay of therapy in EFI. However, available prokinetics have uncertain efficacy and safety profiles. Itopride, is a prokinetic agent which is different and unique from the available prokinetics because of its dual mode of action as well as its tolerability and safety. The current study compared the efficacy and safety of Itopride against metoclopramide for EFI in critically ill patients. Moreover, it tested the utility and applicability of ultrasonography to measure gastric residual volume (GRV) in this population. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind study included 76 EFI patients who were randomly assigned to either Itopride or metoclopramide group. The primary outcome was to measure GRV by ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes included the percentage ratio of enteral feed volume, energy and protein received by patients over 7 days of treatment, ICU length of stay, safety parameters and occurrence of infectious complications or vomiting. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients of each group completed the study. At day 7, itopride significantly decreased GRV compared with metoclopramide group (p = 0.001). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the ratios of received enteral nutrition feed volume, calories, and protein after the one-week therapy in the itopride group more than the metoclopramide group (p = 0.001), (p = 0.002), (p = 0.01), respectively and there were no differences in any secondary outcomes or adverse events between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with EFI, itopride was well tolerated with superior efficacy to metoclopramide. In addition, we demonstrated that ultrasonography is a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive, and undemanding method for GRV measurements and can offer reliable assessments in the gastric emptying modality.

In each village, children were sampled to participate in weekly sessions in which data signals were collected through wearable devices (electrocardiography [ECG] hand pads and electroencephalography [EEG] headbands). Additionally, wearable proximity sensors to elicit the social network were deployed among children and their caregivers. Mobile surveys using interactive voice response calls were also used as an additional layer of data collection. An end-line face-to-face survey was conducted at the end of the study. RESULTS: During the implementation, 82 EEG/ECG data entry points were collected across four villages. The sampled children for EEG/ECG were 0 to 5 years old. EEG/ECG data were collected once a week. In every session, children wore the EEG headband for 5 minutes and the ECG hand pad for 3 minutes. In total, 3531 calls were sent over 5 weeks, with 2291 participants picking up the calls and 984 of those answering the consent question. In total, 585 people completed the surveys over the course of 5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study achieved its objective of demonstrating the feasibility of generating data through the unprecedented use of a multimodal approach for tracking child development in Malawi, which is one of the poorest countries in the world. Above and beyond its multiple dimensions, the dynamics of child development are complex. It is the case not only that no data stream in isolation can accurately characterize it, but also that even if combined, infrequent data might miss critical inflection points and interactions between different conditions and behaviors. In turn, combining different modes at a sufficiently high frequency allows researchers to make progress by considering contact patterns, reported symptoms and behaviors, and critical biomarkers all at once. This application showcases that even in developing countries facing multiple constraints, complementary technologies can leverage and accelerate the digitalization of health, bringing benefits to populations that lack new tools for understanding child well-being and development.","Leal Neto, Onicio; Haenni, Simon; Phuka, John; Ozella, Laura; Paolotti, Daniela; Cattuto, Ciro; Robles, Daniel; Lichand, Guilherme",JMIR Public Health Surveill,301,11

However, the relationship between protein synthesis and presynaptic structural plasticity remains unclear. Here, we investigated structural changes in cannabinoid-receptor 1 (CB(1))-mediated long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD), a form of presynaptic plasticity that involves a protein-synthesis-dependent long-lasting reduction in GABA release. We found that CB(1)-iLTD in acute rat hippocampal slices was associated with protein synthesis-dependent presynaptic structural changes. Using proteomics, we determined that CB(1) activation in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, but decreased levels of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1, and presynaptic release. Moreover, while CB(1)-iLTD increased ubiquitin/proteasome activity, ubiquitination but not proteasomal degradation was critical for structural and functional presynaptic CB(1)-iLTD. Thus, CB(1)-iLTD relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.","Monday, Hannah R; Bourdenx, Mathieu; Jordan, Bryen A; Castillo, Pablo E",,301,12

Questions Remain!,18.733183,11.08805,2021-04-28,"Highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains re-emerged and circulated in China at the end of 2010, causing significant economic losses in the pork industry worldwide. To understand the genetic dynamics of PEDV during its passage in vitro, the PEDV G2 strain FJzz1 was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 200 passages. The susceptibility and adaptability of the FJzz1 strain increased gradually as it was serially passaged in vitro. Sequence analysis revealed that amino acid (aa) changes were mainly concentrated in the S glycoprotein, which accounted for 72.22%–85.71% of all aa changes. A continuous aa deletion ((55)I(56)G(57)E → (55)K(56)Δ(57)Δ) occurred in the N-terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD). To examine how the aa changes affected its virulence, FJzz1-F20 and FJzz1-F200 were selected to simultaneously evaluate their pathogenicity in suckling piglets. All the piglets in the FJzz1-F20-infected group showed typical diarrhea at 24 h postinfection, and the piglets died successively by 48 h postinfection. However, the clinical signs of the piglets in the FJzz1-F200-infected group were significantly weaker, and no deaths occurred. The FJzz1-F200-infected group also showed a lower level of fecal viral shedding and lower viral loads in the intestinal tissues, and no obvious histopathological lesions. Type I and III interferon were induced in the FJzz1-F200 infection group, together with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8. These results indicate that the identified genetic changes may contribute to the attenuation of FJzz1 strain, and the attenuated FJzz1-F200 may have the potential for developing PEDV live-attenuated vaccines.

Inadequacies such as low fibrin specificity, lethal after-effects and short life-span of available fibrinolytic enzymes stimulates an intensive hunt for novel, efficient and safe substitutes. Therefore, we herewith suggest a novel and potent fibrinolytic enzyme RFEA1 from Bacillus cereus RSA1 (MK288105). Although, attributes such as in-vitro purification, characterization and thrombolytic potential of RFEA1 were successfully accomplished in our previous study. However, it is known that structure-function traits and mode of action significantly aid to commercialization of an enzyme. Also, predicting structural model of a protein from its amino acid sequence is challenging in computational biology owing to intricacy of energy functions and inspection of vast conformational space. Our present study thus reports In-silico structural-functional analysis of RFEA1. Sequence based modelling approaches such as—Iterative threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER), SWISS-MODEL, RaptorX and Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) were employed to model three-dimensional structure of RFEA1 and the modelled RFEA1 was validated by structural analysis and verification server (SAVES v6.0). The modelled crystal structure revealed the presence of high affinity Ca1 binding site, associated with hydrogen bonds at Asp(147), Leu(181), Ile(185) and Val(187)residues. RFEA1 is structurally analogous to Subtilisin E from Bacillus subtilis 168. Molecular docking analysis using PATCH DOCK and FIRE DOCK servers was performed to understand the interaction of RFEA1 with substrate fibrin. Strong RFEA1-fibrin interaction was observed with high binding affinity (−21.36 kcal/mol), indicating significant fibrinolytic activity and specificity of enzyme RFEA1. Overall, the computational research suggests that RFEA1 is a subtilisin-like serine endopeptidase with proteolytic potential, involved in thrombus hydrolysis.","Sharma, Chhavi; Nigam, Arti; Singh, Rajni",PeerJ,301,12

As the incidence of malaria diminishes, a better understanding of the spectrum of etiological agents was important for accurate diagnosis and empirical treatment of febrile illness. METHODS: Blood, nasopharyngeal, and fecal specimens were collected from febrile patients for serological, molecular detection, and microbiologic culture to identify potential pathogens. RESULTS: For this prospective study, 142 febrile patients were enrolled. The prevalence of malaria was higher in children aged 5–15 years old (P = 0.185) and adults (P = 0.018). Acute respiratory infection (ARI) presented more commonly in the under 5 years old group (P = 0.009). For diarrhea, all children groups (P = 0.024) were predominant. A total of 22.5% of the febrile patients had malaria infection, 19.7% had typhoid infection, and 2.8% were coinfected with malaria and typhoid. ARI was the most common causes of fever, accounting for 31.7% of patients, influenza A virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and five other respiratory pathogens were found. Diarrhea accounted for 16.2%, and seven kinds of diarrhea bacteria were isolated. Hepatitis B accounted for 8.5%, including five cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ascites smear staining were both Gram-negative bacteria. Tuberculous encephalitis, parasitic diseases (ascaris and filariasis), and skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 0.7%, 2.1%, and 0.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of a wide spectrum of febrile etiological agents other than malaria was identified. The spread of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) out of hospital and establishment of a national standard for Widal test will reduce the misdiagnosis of febrile diseases. Antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria are helpful for empirical treatment.

The present study is conducted using multiple linear regression, multiple nonlinear regression and artificial neural networks. Three QSAR models are developed after partitioning the database into two sets (training and test) via the k-means method. The obtained values of the correlation coefficients by the three developed QSAR models are 0.90, 0.91 and 0.92, respectively. The resulting models are validated by using the external validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, Y-randomization test, and applicability domain methods. Moreover, we evaluated the drug-likeness properties of seven selected molecules based on their observed high activity to inhibit the c-Met receptor. The results of the evaluation showed that three of the seven compounds present drug-like characteristics. In order to identify the important active sites for the inhibition of the c-Met receptor responsible for the development of cancer cell lines, the crystallized form of the Crizotinib-c-Met complex (PDB code: 2WGJ) is used. These sites are used as references in the molecular docking test of the three selected molecules to identify the most suitable molecule for use as a new c-Met inhibitor. A comparative study is conducted based on the evaluation of the predicted properties of ADMET in silico between the candidate molecule and the Crizotinib inhibitor.

Crowdworking is an alternative to expensive expert labour. Annotation corresponds to diagnosis, so comparing unlabeled records to labeled ones seems more appropriate for crowdworkers without medical expertise. We modeled the comparison of a record to two other records as a triplet annotation task, and we conducted an experiment to investigate to what extend sensor-measured stress, task duration, uncertainty of the annotators and agreement among the annotators could predict annotation correctness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an annotation experiment on health data from a population-based study. The triplet annotation task was to decide whether an individual was more similar to a healthy one or to one with a given disorder. We used hepatic steatosis as example disorder, and described the individuals with 10 pre-selected characteristics related to this disorder. We recorded task duration, electro-dermal activity as stress indicator, and uncertainty as stated by the experiment participants (n = 29 non-experts and three experts) for 30 triplets. We built an Artificial Similarity-Based Annotator (ASBA) and compared its correctness and uncertainty to that of the experiment participants. RESULTS: We found no correlation between correctness and either of stated uncertainty, stress and task duration. Annotator agreement has not been predictive either. Notably, for some tasks, annotators agreed unanimously on an incorrect annotation. When controlling for Triplet ID, we identified significant correlations, indicating that correctness, stress levels and annotation duration depend on the task itself. Average correctness among the experiment participants was slightly lower than achieved by ASBA. Triplet annotation turned to be similarly difficult for experts as for non-experts. CONCLUSION: Our lab experiment indicates that the task of triplet annotation must be prepared cautiously if delegated to crowdworkers. Neither certainty nor agreement among annotators should be assumed to imply correct annotation, because annotators may misjudge difficult tasks as easy and agree on incorrect annotations. Further research is needed to improve visualizations for complex tasks, to judiciously decide how much information to provide, Out-of-the-lab experiments in crowdworker setting are needed to identify appropriate designs of a human-annotation task, and to assess under what circumstances non-human annotation should be preferred.","Rother, Anne; Niemann, Uli; Hielscher, Tommy; Völzke, Henry; Ittermann, Till; Spiliopoulou, Myra",PLoS One,301,12

Modern pharmacology and clinical applications of HQSJZD have shown that it has a certain curative effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The active components and targets of HQSJZD were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The genes corresponding to the targets were retrieved using UniProt and GeneCard database. The herb-compound-target network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed by Cytoscape. The core targets of HQSJZD were analysed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The main active compounds of HQSJZD were docked with acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In vitro experiments were conducted to detect the inhibitory and neuroprotective effects of AChE. RESULTS: Compound-target network mainly contained 132 compounds and 255 corresponding targets. The main compounds contained quercetin, kaempferol, formononetin, isorhamnetin, hederagenin, and calycosin. Key targets contained AChE, PTGS2, PPARG, IL-1B, GSK3B, etc. There were 1708 GO items in GO enrichment analysis and 310 signalling pathways in KEGG, mainly including the cAMP signalling pathway, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway, serotonergic synapses, the calcium signalling pathway, type II diabetes mellitus, arginine and proline metabolism, and the longevity regulating pathway. Molecular docking showed that hederagenin and formononetin were the top 2 compounds of HQSJZD, which had a high affinity with AChE. And formononetin has a good neuroprotective effect, which can improve the oxidative damage of nerve cells. CONCLUSION: HQSJZD was found to have the potential to treat AD by targeting multiple AD-related targets. Formononetin and hederagenin in HQSJZD may regulate multiple signalling pathways through AChE, which might play a therapeutic role in AD.","Zhang, Wei; Lv, Mingti; Shi, Yating; Mu, Yonghui; Yao, Zhaoyang; Yang, Zhijun",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,301,12

Key to understanding their function is recognition of their pleiotropism and often overlapping and functional redundancies. Classified here into 9 main families, most of the 23 approved cytokine preparations (19 different cytokines and 4 pegylated), all in recombinant human (rh) form, are grouped in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines are aldesleukin (rhIL-2), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rhG-CSF), sargramostim (rhGM-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin), ancestim (rh-SCF), and the rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoetin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is in the IL-1 family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rhKGF) and becaplermin (rhPDGF) are in the PDGF family; and rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGFβ family. The main physicochemical features, FDA-approved indications, modes of action and side effects of these approved cytokines are presented. Underlying each adverse events profile is their pleiotropism, potency and capacity to release other cytokines producing cytokine “cocktails.” Side effects, some serious, occur despite cytokines being endogenous proteins, and this therefore demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic. This caution is reflected in the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies and by the fact that 15 of the FDA-approved preparations carry warnings, with 10 being black box warnings.","Baldo, Brian A.",Safety of Biologics Therapy,301,12

Then, machines often have to rely on human labelling of data. This becomes challenging the more subjective the learning task is, as human agreement can be low. To cope with the resulting high uncertainty, one could train individual models reflecting a single human’s opinion. However, this is not viable, if one aims at mirroring the general opinion of a hypothetical ‘completely average person’ – the ‘average Jane’. Here, I summarise approaches to optimally learn efficiently in such a case. First, different strategies of reaching a single learning target from several labellers will be discussed. This includes varying labeller trustability and the case of time-continuous labels with potential dynamics. As human labelling is a labour-intensive endeavour, active and cooperative learning strategies can help reduce the number of labels needed. Next, sample informativeness can be exploited in teacher-based algorithms to additionally weigh data by certainty. In addition, multi-target learning of different labeller tracks in parallel and/or of the uncertainty can help improve the model robustness and provide an additional uncertainty measure. Cross-modal strategies to reduce uncertainty offer another view. From these and further recent strategies, I distil a number of future avenues to handle subjective uncertainty in machine learning. These comprise bigger, yet weakly labelled data processing basing amongst other on reinforcement learning, lifelong learning, and self-learning. Illustrative examples stem from the fields of Affective Computing and Digital Health – both notoriously marked by subjectivity uncertainty.","Rizos, Georgios; Schuller, Björn W.",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,301,12

The method constructs a robust decision tree for a decision maker that is reusable as long as the problem parameters remain in the uncertainty set. At each node of the tree we assume that the scheduler has access to some knowledge about the ongoing scenario, reducing the level of uncertainty and allowing the computation of less conservative solutions with robustness guarantees. However, obtaining information on the uncertain parameters can be costly and frequent rescheduling can be disturbing. We first formally define the robust decision tree and the information refining concepts in the context of uncertainty scenarios. Then we propose algorithms to build such a tree. Finally, focusing on a simple single machine scheduling problem, we provide experimental comparisons highlighting the potential of the decision tree approach compared with reactive algorithms for obtaining more robust solutions with fewer information updates and schedule changes.","Portoleau, Tom; Artigues, Christian; Guillaume, Romain",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,301,12

The Etx toxin is responsible for the pathogenesis of enterotoxaemia in sheep and goats, and occasionally in other livestock animals. The present study aimed to develop a Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin-based chimeric epitope construct having immunodominant B-cell epitope and universal T-cell epitope and its immunogenicity was evaluated in mice and rabbit. An artificial chimeric epitope construct (CEC) was prepared by joining tandem repeats of a peptide containing amino acids (aa) 134–145 of epsilon toxin B-cell epitope and universal T-cell epitopes. The CEC was expressed in the Escherichia coli following codon optimization for efficient translational efficiency and purified by affinity chromatography. The antigenic reactivity of r-CEC proteins was confirmed by western blot with rabbit anti-r-Etox hyperimmune sera. The immunogenicity of the recombinant single CEC was examined in mice and rabbit by indirect ELISA. It was found that r-CEC yielded high titers of neutralizing antibodies (≥ 1.035 IU/ml) in immunized mice and rabbit. The potency of chimeric protein immunized serum was observed to be higher than the recommended level (0.1–0.3 IU/ml) for protection in sheep and goats. This indicated the potential ability of the chimeric protein as a vaccine candidate. This further requires studying the immune response in targeted host species (sheep and goat).","Singh, Ajay Pratap; Prabhu, Shyama N.; Nagaleekar, Viswas K.; Dangi, Saroj K.; Prakash, Chandan; Singh, Vijendra Pal",3 Biotech,301,12

The virus has high rates of proliferation and causes severe respiratory symptoms, such as pneumonia. The standard diagnostic method for pneumonia is chest X-ray image. There are many advantages to using COVID-19 diagnostic X-rays: low cost, fast, and widely available. METHODS: We propose an intelligent system to support diagnosis by X-ray images. We tested Haralick and Zernike moments for feature extraction. Experiments with classic classifiers were done. RESULTS: Support vector machines stood out, reaching an average accuracy of 89.78%, average sensitivity of 0.8979, and average precision and specificity of 0.8985 and 0.9963, respectively. CONCLUSION: Using features based on textures and shapes combined with classical classifiers, the developed system was able to differentiate COVID-19 from viral and bacterial pneumonia with low computational cost.","Gomes, Juliana C.; Barbosa, Valter A. de F.; Santana, Maíra A.; Bandeira, Jonathan; Valença, Mêuser Jorge Silva; de Souza, Ricardo Emmanuel; Ismael, Aras Masood; dos Santos, Wellington P.",Res,301,12

We aim to describe the symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 among ambulatory patients seen at the Emory University multidisciplinary Acute Respiratory Clinic (ARC) developed to care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases seen at ARC from 4/3–5/16/2020 were included in a retrospective chart review. Encounters were classified as acute, subacute, or convalescent depending on the duration since illness onset (< 1, 1–4, or >4 weeks, respectively). Demographic, clinical, physical exam, diagnostic test, and disposition data were abstracted and analyzed with standard descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 404 visits at ARC, 127 (31.4%) were for confirmed COVID-19 illness (107 unique patients with 1–4 visits). The majority (75.7%) of patients were female, and the median age was 55 years (range 24–89). Patients presented during acute, subacute, and convalescent phases of illness (15.7%, 58.3%, and 26.0%, respectively; Table). Prevalent co-morbidities included hypertension (39.3%), obesity (27.1%), diabetes (20.6%), and asthma (21.5%). While measured or subjective fever was reported in the majority of acute visits (60.0%), it was less common in subacute and convalescent encounters (27.0% and 30.3%). Cough was commonly reported in acute, subacute, and convalescent visits (70.0%, 79.7%, 66.7%), as were dyspnea on exertion (45.0%, 70.3%, 66.7%) and chest tightness (40.0%, 40.5%, 60.6%). Although smell or taste alteration was present in almost half of acute and subacute patients, it was only reported in a quarter of convalescent patients. Among the three stages of illness, transfers from ARC to the ED or direct hospitalizations occurred in 15.0%, 23.0%, and 12.1% of acute, subacute and convalescent visits, respectively. Table Timecourse of Symptoms among COVID-19 Patients in the Ambulatory Context [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Following acute illness, COVID-19 patients can experience persistent symptoms, primarily respiratory symptoms, which can be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Clinics evaluating recovering patients should prepare to manage these symptoms. Further study of the pathophysiology and treatment of persistent pulmonary symptoms in COVID-19 is needed.

And if so, what kind? Much depends on whether Trump wins reelection and if he does, the distribution of power in the House and Senate Trump has bet his presidency on his efforts to change the dominant narratives associated with the eight policy pillars that define his Politics of American Restoration. One question is whether he will succeed. An equally important question, given Trump’s goals, is how do entrenched political paradigms and narratives change? As the election nears, two personal questions face Trump. Does he have the psychological and emotional capacities and reserves for leading and governing this divided country and bringing the country back from the ravages of the Coronavirus pandemic and the political divisions that threaten it? Second, will he be able to do so in the face of continuing unremitting personal and political attacks on his policies, supporters, officials, and family? If Trump wins reelection, whatever the distribution of power in Congress, successfully realizing his Restoration ambitions will be equivalent to scaling Mt. Annapurna. It will take skill, experience, determination, courage, resilience, and a dedicated, competent, and effective group of support allies. Many imagine that climb. Few attempt it. Fewer succeed.

The main objectives of this paper were to review the regulatory measures for plastic waste reduction and recycling, analyse the trend changes on the recycled amounts of regulated plastic containers and also address the discussions on the impacts of COVID-19 on the expected increase in plastic waste. In the past two decades, the central competent authority (i.e. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)) in Taiwan has promulgated some regulations governing plastic waste reduction and recycling, especially plastic containers. Based on the official statistics, it showed that total certified amounts of regulated plastic containers have increased from 45,552 tonnes in 1998 to 194,133 tonnes in 2019. This shift was in line with circular economy policies by the Zero Waste Program and Resource Recycling and Reuse Plan launched by the Taiwan EPA during this period. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic will impact on the regulatory policies for plastic waste management because the excess use of regulated plastic products will be temporarily permitted due to the epidemic prevention and control measures. Although the increased proportion of plastic waste in municipal solid waste (MSW) will be beneficial for the energy efficiencies of waste-to-power systems in MSW incineration plants, the recycling and reduction rates of regulated plastic containers or products could decline during the COVID-19 breakout.","Tsai, Wen-Tien","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",301,25

Materials and Methods Patients who underwent LigaSure-assisted hemorrhoidectomy or conventional hemorrhoidectomy for grade 3 and 4 hemorrhoids in our clinic between 2009 and 2014 were included in this study. The patient data were reviewed by screening records. Gender, age, preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, operation time, presence of thrombosis, number of packages, hospitalization time, early and late postoperative complications, prolonged pain presence, and follow-up period were recorded. Results In this period, surgical interventions were performed on 365 patients diagnosed with hemorrhoids. Among these, 159 underwent LigaSure-assisted operations, while 206 were operated on by conventional methods. One hundred forty-four (39.5%) cases were female, while 221 (60.5%) cases were male. The median age of the patients was 40 (19-82) years in the LigaSure group and 41 (16-78) years in the conventional method group. The operation time was 15 (4-60) min in the LigaSure group and 20 (6-40) min in the conventional method group. Postoperative analgesics were given to the 182 (88.3%) cases in the conventional group and 107 (67.3%) cases in the LigaSure group. The time required for returning to normal daily activity was 6 (1-15) days in the LigaSure group and 7 (1-30) days in the conventional method group. Conclusion In this study, LigaSure was determined to be superior to a conventional method in terms of operation time, hospitalization period, postoperative analgesic requirements, time required for returning to normal daily activity, and postoperative bleeding.","Haksal, Mustafa Celalettin; Çiftci, Ali; Tiryaki, Çağrı; Yazıcıoğlu, Murat Burç; Özyıldız, Mehmet; Yıldız, Selim Yiğit",Turkish journal of surgery,301,19

We evaluated automated ASPECTS in comparison to expert readers. METHODS Consecutive, baseline non-contrast CT-scans (5-mm slice thickness) from the prospective MR CLEAN trial (n = 459, MR CLEAN Netherlands Trial Registry number: NTR1804) were evaluated. A two-observer consensus for ASPECTS regions (normal/abnormal) was used as reference standard for training and testing (0.2/0.8 division). Two other observers provided individual ASPECTS-region scores. The Automated ASPECTS software was applied. A region score specificity of ≥ 90% was used to determine the software threshold for detection of an affected region based on relative density difference between affected and contralateral region. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating characteristic curves were calculated. Additionally, we assessed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for automated ASPECTS and observers in comparison to the reference standard in the test set. RESULTS In the training set (n = 104), with software thresholds for a specificity of ≥ 90%, we found a sensitivity of 33-49% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.741-0.785 for detection of an affected ASPECTS region. In the test set (n = 355), the results for the found software thresholds were 89-89% (specificity), 41-57% (sensitivity), and 0.750-0.795 (AUC). Comparison of automated ASPECTS with the reference standard resulted in an ICC of 0.526. Comparison of observers with the reference standard resulted in an ICC of 0.383-0.464. CONCLUSION The performance of automated ASPECTS is comparable to expert readers and could support readers in the detection of early ischemic changes.","Wolff, Lennard; Berkhemer, Olvert A; van Es, Adriaan C G M; van Zwam, Wim H; Dippel, Diederik W J; Majoie, Charles B L M; van Walsum, Theo; van der Lugt, Aad",Neuroradiology,301,1

It causes severe respiratory syndromes which is one of the leading causes of death. Evidence shows that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has close similarities with other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. So, SARS-CoV-2 might use the similar mechanisms of these viruses to attack the host cells. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with various factors, one of the major reasons is immune dysregulation or immune suppression. Immunity plays a significant role in maintaining the body in a healthy condition. In order to induce a timely immune response against the invaded pathogens, both innate and adaptive immunity must be in an active state. During the viral infection, there will be an excessive generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm and also, the antiviral agents in the body gets inhibited or inactivated through viral mechanisms. Thus, this might be the reason for the transition from mild symptoms to more severe medical conditions which leads toan immediate need for the invention of a new medicine.This review aims to show the host-viral interaction along with immune response, antiviral mechanism and effectiveness of oral low dose cytokines against virus as a therapeutic approach.","M, Ratheesh; S, Sheethal; Jose, Svenia P; Rajan, Sony; Thomas, Sulumol; Jagmag, Tariq; Tilwani, Jayesh",Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,301,1

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in medical university. Levels of perceived stress, insomnia and depression were measured using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The descriptive analyses of the demographic characteristics and correlation analyses of the three variables were calculated. The significance of the mediation effect was obtained using a bootstrap approach with SPSS PROCESS macro. RESULTS The mean age of medical students was 21.46 years (SD=2.50). Of these medical students, 10,185 (34.3%) were male and 19,478 (65.7%) were female. Perceived stress was significantly associated with depression (β=0.513, P < 0.001). Insomnia mediated the association between perceived stress and depression (β=0.513, P < 0.001). The results of the non-parametric bootstrapping method confirmed the significance of the indirect effect of perceived stress through insomnia (95% bootstrap CI =0.137, 0.149). The indirect effect of insomnia accounted for 44.13% of the total variance in depression. CONCLUSIONS These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interactive mechanisms underlying perceived stress and depression, and elucidating the mediating effects of insomnia on the association. This research provides a useful theoretical and methodological approach for prevention of depression in medical students. Findings from this study indicated that it may be effective to reduce depression among medical students by improving sleep quality and easing perceived stress.","Liu, Zhuang; Liu, Rongxun; Zhang, Yue; Zhang, Ran; Liang, Lijuan; Wang, Yang; Wei, Yange; Zhu, Rongxin; Wang, Fei",Journal of affective disorders,301,1

However, the effects of their combined use have not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil followed by CO(2) pneumoperitoneum would affect the healing of anastomoses in the colon. METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48) were given 5-fluorouracil (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 days, and were then assigned to one of the three groups. Prior to surgery, the control group received no pneumoperitoneum. The other two groups received pneumoperitoneum at 6 and 12 mmHg, respectively, for 2 hr. The large intestine was transected and anastomosis was performed via median laparotomy. On postoperative days 3 and 7, relaparotomy was performed in half of the rats in each group. From the colon, a segment including the anastomosis was excised. Tissue hydroxyproline levels were measured. For histological evaluation, the Verhofstad scale was modified and used. RESULTS No significant differences in hydroxyproline levels were seen across the groups on postoperative days 3 or 7. However, by postoperative day 7, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and necrosis in the 6-mmHg group had decreased markedly, and granulation had improved. CONCLUSION Overall, these findings suggest that preoperative 5-fluorouracil therapy followed by pneumoperitoneum at 6 or 12 mmHg does not impair anastomotic healing.","Ulas, Murat; Ozer, Ilter; Ercan, Metin; Ozogul, Yusuf B; Bostanci, E Birol; Keklik, Tulay Temucin; Turkcu, Ummuhani Ozel; Bilgihan, Ayse; Akoglu, Musa",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,301,1

Methods: From January 10 to May 15, 2020, clinical data of 1 228 patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was collected (554 males and 674 females, with the range of age from 10 to 95 years old, the average age was 55.2 years old). The patients were divided into pharyngeal symptoms group (PS, 126 cases) and non-pharyngeal symptoms group (Non-PS, 1 102 cases) according to the presence or absence of pharyngeal symptoms such as pharyngalgia, pharyngeal dryness, pharyngeal itching, and pharyngeal foreign body sensation. The clinical data in terms of age, sex, medical history, duration of symptoms, treatment time, clinical classification, pulmonary imaging findings, whole blood cell count, serum hypersensitivity C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin were statistically analyzed between the two groups. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The most common pharyngeal symptoms were pharyngalgia (59.52%, 75/126), followed by foreign body sensation (23.02%, 29/126), pharyngeal dryness (8.73%, 11/126), and itching (8.73%, 11/126). The median age of the patients in the PS group was 51.50 years old, which was less than 57.50 years old in the non-PS group, showing a significant difference (P<0.05). The female cases accounted for 65.08% (82/126), which was higher than 53.72% (592/1 102) of the non-PS group (P<0.05). The incidence of bilateral lung inflammation confirmed by CT images was 73.81% (93/126), which was significantly lower than 83.48% (920/1 102) in the non-PS group (P<0.05). No significant differences were shown in the proportion of patients with clinical types, treatment days, duration of symptoms, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, eosinophil count, eosinophil percentage, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin and other indicators (P>0.05). Conclusions: The incidence of pharyngeal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is 10.26%. Most of these symptoms occur before or at the same time as the common symptoms of the disease. Therefore, patients with such symptoms may bring a greater risk of infection to otolaryngologist. According to the current clinical classification criteria, pharyngeal symptoms have no obvious correlation with the degree of the disease; but the presence of pharyngeal symptoms may suggest a milder clinical presentation and a better prognosis.","Zhang, W; Xu, Y; Xiang, R; Gao, L",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,301,20

RESULTS The mean number of daily new patient applications to the outpatient clinic (9.87±3.87 vs 6.43±4.03, p<0.001) and OPC clinic (3.87±1.49 vs 1.13±1.46, p<0.001) was significantly reduced compared with the previous years. While the number of inpatient admissions was similar for a month frame, the median duration of hospitalisation was significantly reduced. The frequency of hospitalisations for chemotherapy was higher than in previous years (p<0.001). By comparison, the rate of hospitalisations for palliative care (p=0.028) or elective interventional procedures (p=0.001) was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION In our experience, almost all domains of care were affected during the pandemic other than patients' systemic treatments. There were significant drops in the numbers of newly diagnosed patients, patients having interventional procedures and palliative care services, and these problems should be the focus points for the risk mitigation efforts for prevention of care disruptions.","Guven, Deniz Can; Aktas, Burak Yasin; Aksun, Melek Seren; Ucgul, Enes; Sahin, Taha Koray; Yildirim, Hasan Cagri; Guner, Gurkan; Kertmen, Neyran; Dizdar, Omer; Kilickap, Saadettin; Aksoy, Sercan; Yalcin, Suayib; Turker, Alev; Uckun, Fatih Mehmet; Arik, Zafer",BMJ supportive & palliative care,301,24

Systematic and effective tools to identify patients at risk of deterioration early enough to intervene are therefore needed. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the aggregate weighted track and trigger system early warning score (EWS) can be used as a simple observational tool to identify patients at risk and predict mortality in a population of patients with acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients admitted with acute stroke at the Copenhagen University Hospital, Nordsjaellands Hospital, Denmark, from May to September 2012 were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study (n = 274). Vital signs were measured immediately after admission and consistently during the hospitalization period. Based on the vital signs, a single composite EWS was calculated. Death within 30 days was used as outcome. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and a Kaplan-Meier curve were computed to examine the prognostic validity of EWS. RESULTS A total of 24 patients (8.8%) died within 30 days. The prognostic performance was high for both the EWS at admission (AUROC 0.856; 95% CI 0.760-0.951; P-value < 0.001) and the maximal EWS measured (AUROC 0.949; 95% CI 0.919-0.980; P-value < 0.001). Mortality rates were lowest for admission EWS 0-1 (2%) and highest for admission EWS ≥ 5 (63%). CONCLUSIONS Early warning score is a simple and valid tool for identifying patients at risk of dying after acute stroke. Readily available physiological parameters are converted to a single score, which can guide both nurses and physicians in clinical decision making and resource allocation.","Liljehult, J; Christensen, T",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,301,19

SCOR has been previously proposed as a marker of clinical conditions associated with gut ischemia. Our goal was to determine SCOR values in healthy neonates in their first and second days of life. METHODS Prospective observational study measuring SCOR in term neonates in the nursery using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). RESULTS Forty-five subjects with a mean gestational age of 39.4 ± 1.3 weeks were included. Mean SCOR on the first day was 0.90 ± 0.16 and 0.97 ± 0.16 on the second day, p = 0.02 (n = 45). No correlation was found between SCOR and gestational age; however, we did find a positive correlation between hour of life and SCOR values (r = 0.28, r(2) = 0.08, p < 0.01, two tails); SCOR appears to stabilize by 36 h. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate SCOR values in healthy neonates consistent with those previously theorized and help to validate it as a diagnostic measure. In addition, we have demonstrated that SCOR values may normally be lower in infants during their first days of life, and this information may be helpful to clinicians using NIRS as a diagnostic tool.","Bailey, Sean M; Hendricks-Muñoz, Karen D; Mally, Pradeep",Pediatric surgery international,301,22

We investigated the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in patients who failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS From June through December 2014, there were 173 patients with CD and 121 patients with UC who were included in a multicenter nominative compassionate early access program granted by French regulatory agencies. This program provided patients with access to vedolizumab before it was authorized for marketing. Vedolizumab (300 mg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. We report results obtained after the 14-week induction phase. RESULTS Among the 294 patients treated with vedolizumab (mean age, 39.5 ± 14.0 y; mean disease duration, 10.8 ± 7.6 y; concomitant steroids, 44% of cases), 276 completed the induction period, however, 18 discontinued vedolizumab because of a lack of response (n = 14), infusion-related reaction (n = 2), or infections (n = 2). At week 14, 31% of patients with CD were in steroid-free clinical remission and 51% had a response; among patients with UC, 36% were in steroid-free clinical remission and 50% had a response. No deaths were reported. Severe adverse events occurred in 24 patients (8.2%), including 15 (5.1%) that led to vedolizumab discontinuation (1 case of pulmonary tuberculosis and 1 rectal adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSIONS In a cohort of patients with CD or UC who failed previous anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, approximately one third of patients achieved steroid-free clinical remission after 14 weeks of induction therapy with vedolizumab. This agent had an acceptable safety profile in these patients.","Amiot, Aurelien; Grimaud, Jean-Charles; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Filippi, Jerome; Pariente, Benjamin; Roblin, Xavier; Buisson, Anthony; Stefanescu, Carmen; Trang-Poisson, Caroline; Altwegg, Romain; Marteau, Philippe; Vaysse, Thibaud; Bourrier, Anne; Nancey, Stephane; Laharie, David; Allez, Matthieu; Savoye, Guillaume; Moreau, Jacques; Gagniere, Charlotte; Vuitton, Lucine; Viennot, Stephanie; Aubourg, Alexandre; Pelletier, Anne-Laure; Bouguen, Guillaume; Abitbol, Vered; Bouhnik, Yoram",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,301,16

However, the phenotype of blood DCs in patients with acute respiratory infections is unknown. OBJECTIVE To investigate the number and the expression of function-associated molecules of blood DCs in patients with acute infectious pneumonia. METHODS Sixteen patients with acute pneumonia and 19 controls without pneumonia were included in the study. The number as well as the expression of function-associated molecules of myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were analysed in peripheral blood using four-colour flow cytometry. RESULTS Elevated concentrations of procalcitonin (median: 0.55 ng/ml) and the rapid response to antibiotic treatment suggested a bacterial origin of the pneumonia in the patients. Total mDC (median: 27% of the controls) and pDC counts (median: 53% of the controls) were markedly reduced in patients with pneumonia, as compared to the controls. Percentages of blood mDCs, but not pDCs, were negatively correlated with serum concentrations of C-reactive protein. Patients with pneumonia were characterised by a significantly increased expression of Fc gamma receptors (CD32 and CD64) on mDCs and the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) on pDCs. CONCLUSIONS Circulating DCs are markedly reduced in patients with pneumonia, and characterised by an up-regulation of molecules recognising pathogen-associated molecular patterns and opsonised antigens.","Dreschler, Katharina; Bratke, Kai; Petermann, Sebastian; Thamm, Petra; Kuepper, Michael; Virchow, J Christian; Lommatzsch, Marek",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,301,31

METHODS Sixty-one patients with breast cancer were randomized to a conventional dissection surgical technique (CONV group; n = 30) by scalpel and monopolar cautery or that using a vessel sealing system (BVSS group; n = 31). RESULTS There was a significant difference between both groups in the mean number of days until drain removal (6.4 ± 2.9 vs. 8.2 ± 3.8 days; P value = 0.033), and the mean total volume of drainage fluid (365.3 ± 242.2 vs. 625.1 ± 446.6 mL; P value = 0.009). The incidence of seroma was similar in both groups (43.3 vs. 37.9 %; P value = 0.673). There was no statistically significant difference in axillary dissection operating time (66 vs. 70 min; P value = 0.371), or the mean volume of blood loss (18.2 ± 31.1 vs. 20.6 ± 26.3 mL; P value = 0.663).

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study demonstrates the first deployment of the Anser electromagnetic (EM) tracking system with the CustusX image-guided interventional research platform to navigate using an endobronchial catheter to injected tumour targets. Live animal investigations validated the deployment and targeting of peripheral tumour models using an innovative tumour marking routine. RESULTS Novel tumour model deployment was successfully achieved at all eight target sites across two live animal investigations without pneumothorax. Virtual bronchoscopy with tracking successfully guided the tracked catheter to 2-12 mm from the target tumour site. Deployment of a novel marker was achieved at all eight sites providing a reliable measure of targeting accuracy. Targeting accuracy within 10 mm was achieved in 7/8 sites and in all cases, the virtual target distance at marker deployment was within the range subsequently measured with x-ray. CONCLUSIONS Endobronchial targeting of peripheral airway targets is feasible using existing open-source technology. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of current commercial platforms, technological improvements in EM tracking and registration accuracy fostered by open-source technology may provide the impetus for widespread clinical uptake of electromagnetic navigation in bronchoscopy.","Jaeger, Herman Alexander; Trauzettel, Fabian; Nardelli, Pietro; Daverieux, Federico; Hofstad, Erlend Fagertun; Leira, Håkon O; Kennedy, Marcus P; Langø, Thomas; Cantillon-Murphy, Pádraig",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,301,1

Numerous alloplastic adjuncts exist, and these vary in material type, processing, storage, surgical preparation, level of sterility, available sizes and cost. However, there is little published data on most, posing a significant challenge to the reconstructive surgeon trying to compare and select the most suitable product. The aims of this systematic review were to identify, summarize and evaluate the outcomes of studies describing the use of alloplastic adjuncts for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. The secondary aims were to determine their cost-effectiveness and analyze outcomes in patients who also underwent radiotherapy. METHODS Using the PRSIMA 2009 statement, a systematic review was conducted to find articles reporting on the outcomes on the use of alloplastic adjuncts in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. Multiple databases were searched independently by three authors (Cabalag MS, Miller GS and Chae MP), including: Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1980 to 2015), PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. RESULTS Current published literature on available alloplastic adjuncts are predominantly centered on ADMs, both allogeneic and xenogeneic, with few outcome studies available for synthetic meshes. Outcomes on the 89 articles, which met the inclusion criteria, were summarized and analyzed. The reported outcomes on alloplastic adjunct-assisted breast reconstruction were varied, with most data available on the use of ADMs, particularly AlloDerm(®) (LifeCell, Branchburg, New Jersey, USA). The use of ADMs in single-stage direct-to-implant breast reconstruction resulted in lower complication rates (infection, seroma, implant loss and late revision), and was more cost effective when compared to non-ADM, two-stage reconstruction. The majority of studies demonstrated inferior outcomes in ADM assisted, two-stage expander-to-implant reconstruction compared to non-ADM use. Multiple studies suggest that the use of ADMs results in a reduction of capsular contracture rates. Additionally, the reported beneficial effects of ADM use in irradiated tissue were varied. CONCLUSIONS ADM assisted two-stage breast reconstruction was associated with inferior outcomes when compared to non-ADM use. However, alloplastic adjuncts may have a role in single stage, direct-to-implant breast reconstruction. Published evidence comparing the long-term outcomes between the different types of adjuncts is lacking, and further level one studies are required to identify the ideal product.","Cabalag, Miguel S; Rostek, Marie; Miller, George S; Chae, Michael P; Quinn, Tam; Rozen, Warren M; Hunter-Smith, David J",Gland surgery,301,17

The younger one was extubated but then she had serious stridor accompanied with abdominal and intercostal retractions. She was re-intubated and admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilatory support, where she stayed for 14 days due to multiple failed extubation attempts. The symptoms were more severe in the younger child probably due to softer tracheal wall and weaker tracheal cartilages. We should keep in mind the probable postoperative respiratory complications due to thermal injury or inappropriate surgical technique after thyroid surgeries.","Kendigelen, Pinar; Tutuncu, Ayse C; Ashyralyyeva, Gulruh; Emreb, Senol; Urkmez, Seval; Utkua, Tughan; Kaya, Guner",Archivos argentinos de pediatria,301,1

Although the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, the primary source and intermediate host have not been confirmed, but human-to-human transmission has been universally accepted. The main mode of transmission of the virus is through respiratory droplets along with prominent respiratory system involvement. However, fecal-oral transmission due to the shedding of the virus in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may continue for up to 10 weeks after respiratory clearance and is fast becoming important. SARS-CoV-2 shows a high affinity to ACE2 receptors, making sites of high ACE2 receptor expression, such as lungs, GI tract, brain, kidneys, heart, liver and immune system, a prime target for infection. Through this literature review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge of immunological pathways that contribute to the disease with a focus specifically on the GI tract involvement. We direct attention to the pathophysiological mechanism of involvement of the GI tract leading to symptomatic manifestations, track GI organ-specific viral loads to compare and contrast with other organ systems. We briefly detail specific treatment strategies from a GI disease standpoint and mention special considerations when there is involvement of the GI tract.","Dahiya, Dushyant Singh; Kichloo, Asim; Albosta, Michael; Pagad, Sukrut; Wani, Farah",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,301,1

The risk factors reported are several, including age, being male, and some chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, the relative importance of chronic diseases is still to be explored. OBJECTIVES to evaluate the role of chronic diseases on the risk to develop clinically evident (at least mild symptomatic) forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the LHU Toscana Centro. DESIGN case-population study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS 'case' is a subject with SARS-CoV-2 positive swab with at least mild clinical status, who lives in the LHU Toscana Centro area; 'controls' are all people residing in the LHU Toscana Centro area at 1 January 2020. People aged under 30 and patients living in nursing care homes are excluded from the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the analysis assesses the effect of gender, age, neoplasm, and the main chronic diseases on the onset of an infection with at least mild symptoms by calculating odds ratios (OR) by multivariate logistic regression models (to produce adjusted OR by potential confounders). RESULTS among the 1,840 cases, compared to the general population, the presence of males and over-60-year-old people is greater. Almost all the considered chronic diseases are more frequent among the cases, compared to the general population. A chronic patient has a 68% greater risk to be positive with at least mild symptoms. Many of the considered diseases show an effect on the risk of getting COVID-19 in a symptomatic form, which remains even adjusting by other comorbidities. The main ones include heart failure, psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, and rheumatic diseases. CONCLUSIONS these results confirm evidence already shown in other studies on COVID-19 patients and add information on the chronic diseases attributable risk in the population, referred to the symptomatic forms and adjusted by age, gender or the possible copresence of more diseases. These risk estimates should guide prevention interventions by health services in order to protect the chronic patients affected by the pathologies most at risk.","Profili, Francesco; Ballo, Piercarlo; Balzi, Daniela; Bellini, Benedetta; Bartalocci, Simone; Zuppiroli, Alfredo; Voller, Fabio; Francesconi, Paolo",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,301,1

Hyperglycemia caused protein glycation alters the structure of many tissues that impairs their functions and lead complications diseases in human body. This study investigated the bioactive peptides produced from red and brown Lens culinaris that might inhibit protein glycation to prevent diabetic complications. In this study, red and brown Lens culinaris protein hydrolysates were prepared by tryptic digestion, using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (g/g), at 37°C, 12 hr then peptide fractions <3 kDa were filtered by using ultrafiltration membranes. Protective ability against protein glycation, DPPH radical scavenging, and anti-proliferative activities (on HepG2, MCF-7, and PC3 cell lines) of peptide fractions were assayed in vitro. Results showed that glycation was inhibited by peptides from 28.1% to 68.3% in different test model. PC3 cell line was more sensitive to the peptides which showed strong anticancer activity with lower IC50 (0.96 mg/ml). Peptide fractions were sequenced by HPLC-MS-MS.

To mitigate this challenge, we describe validation of a commercial ELISA assay to measure osteocalcin, a biomarker of bone formation, from dried blood spots (DBS). METHODS We validated the Osteocalcin Human SimpleStep ELISA kit from Abcam (ab1951214) using 158 matched plasma and DBS samples. Passing-Bablok regression analysis assessed the relationships between plasma and DBS osteocalcin concentrations. Dilutional linearity and spike and recovery experiments determined if the DBS matrix interfered with osteocalcin measurement, and intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated. Limit of detection, analyte stability, and specific forms of osteocalcin measured by the kit were also investigated. RESULTS Mean plasma osteocalcin value was 218.2 ng/mL (range 64.6-618.1 ng/mL). Linear relationships existed between plasma and DBS concentrations of osteocalcin, with no apparent bias in plasma vs DBS concentrations. There was no apparent interference of the DBS matrix with measurement of osteocalcin in DBS. Intra-assay CV for DBS was ~8%, while average inter-assay CV was 14.8%. Limit of detection was 0.34 ng/mL. Osteocalcin concentrations were stable in DBS stored at -28°C and room temperature, but not those stored at 37°C. This ELISA kit detects total osteocalcin. CONCLUSIONS Osteocalcin, a bone formation biomarker, can be measured from DBS. Combined with a previously validated DBS assay for TRACP-5b, a bone resorption biomarker, these assays have the potential to help researchers disentangle the many factors contributing to bone strength.","Eick, Geeta N; Madimenos, Felicia C; Cepon-Robins, Tara J; Devlin, Maureen J; Kowal, Paul; Sugiyama, Lawrence S; Snodgrass, J Josh",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,301,7

DESIGN observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS accesses to the emergency departments (EDs) of Lazio Region hospitals in the first three months of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES total number of accesses to the emergency room and number of specific accesses for cardio and cerebrovascular diseases, for severe trauma, for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, and for symptoms related to pneumonia. RESULTS in the first 3 months of 2019, there were 429,972 accesses to the EDs of Lazio Region; in the same period of 2020, accesses arise to 353,806, (reduction of 21.5%), with a 73% reduction in the last three weeks of march 2020 as compared with the corresponding period of 2019. Comparing the first 3 months of the 2017-2019 with 2020, the accesses for acute coronary syndrome and acute cerebrovascular disease decreased since the 10th week up to more than 57% and 50%, respectively. The accesses due to symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, proxy of potentially inappropriate conditions, decreased since the 8th week, with a maximum reduction of 70%. Access to severe trauma decreased by up to 70% in the 11th week. The accesses for pneumonia increased up to a 70% increment in the 12th week. CONCLUSIONS the evaluation of accesses to emergency services during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic can provide useful elements for the promotion and improvement of the planning, for the management of critical situations, and for the reprogramming of the healthcare offer based on clinical and organizational appropriateness.","Pinnarelli, Luigi; Colais, Paola; Mataloni, Francesca; Cascini, Silvia; Fusco, Danilo; Farchi, Sara; Polo, Arianna; Lacalamita, Marco; Spiga, Giuseppe; Ribaldi, Sergio; Magnanti, Massimo; Davoli, Marina",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,301,22

METHODS A total of 60 patients with a body mass index of ≥40 kg/m2, who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between September 2015 and September 2016 at Fatih Sultan Mehmet Health Application and Research Center, Istanbul, Turkey were included in this randomized prospective study. After induction, anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane in group S, desflurane in group D, and propofol in group P. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), plateau pressure (Pplateau), compliance (Cdyn), respiratory resistance (Rrs), and IPI values were recorded. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal- Wallis, Dunn's, Friedman, and Fisher-Freeman- Halton tests were performed for statistical analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A significant increase was found in PIP in group S (T1: 25; T2: 27 cmH2O), and group D (T1: 25; T2: 29,5 cmH2O) during pneumoperitoneum. Dynamic compliance decreased in all groups during pneumoperitoneum. In group S, the decrease in Cdyn was also statistically significant after pneumoperitoneum(T1:43.65;T5:41.25ml/cmH2O). Comparison between groups the values of PIP, Pplateau, Cdyn, Rrs, and IPI were similar.

In the present study, we evaluated the ability of a family of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) polymers, complexed to plasmid DNA, to augment DNA expression in vivo and to enhance antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. We showed that four of five structurally different PEIs that we evaluated increased in vivo DNA expression 20- to 400-fold, and enhanced DNA-induced epitope-specific CD8⁺ T-cell responses 10- to 25-fold in BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice respectively, when delivered intravenously. Functional studies of the PEI-DNA-induced CD8⁺ T-cell responses demonstrated that formulation of DNA with PEI was associated with increased numbers of cells secreting type I cytokines. In addition, PEI-DNA complexes improved antigen-specific T(H) 1-helper cell and humoral responses. Most importantly, the PEI-DNA complexes elicited memory cellular responses, capable of rapid expansion and accelerated clearance of a lethal dose of recombinant Listeria monocytogenes. Lastly, we identified physical properties of PEI-DNA complexes that are associated with enhanced DNA-elicited immunogenicity. These findings demonstrate that PEI polymers can play an important role in the development of DNA-based vaccines in the setting of infectious disease prevention and cancer therapy.","Grant, Evita V; Thomas, Mini; Fortune, Jennifer; Klibanov, Alexander M; Letvin, Norman L",European journal of immunology,301,1

We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dynamics and influencing factors of HBsAg. METHODS Literature search was conducted through PubMed from January 1995 to May 2015 for papers reporting HBsAg in patients receiving various anti-viral treatments. We conducted weighted linear regression to select for potential influencing factors on maximum HBsAg loss percentage, and subgroup analysis to calculate the pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss and seroconversion percentage following treatment of interferon (IFN), nucleoside analogue (NUC), or combination therapies (NUC+IFN), respectively. Study heterogeneity was assessed through sensitivity test and I-square statistics. RESULTS We collected data from 24 papers involving 6674 adult CHB patients. In most studies, average HBsAg level decreased during treatment but relapsed after treatment cessation, while HBsAg loss or seroconversion percentage continued to increase or remain stable after treatment cessation. No strong relationship was observed between maximum HBsAg change and its baseline level. The pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss percentage for IFN (5.3%, 2.7%-7.9%) and NUC+IFN (5.2%, 3.1%-7.4%) were significantly higher than that of NUC (0.93%, 0.29%-1.6%). Higher maximum HBsAg loss percentage is associated with longer peak time. Pooled maximum HBsAg seroconversion percentage estimates were 1.6%, 0.56% and 6.2% for IFN, NUC and NUC+IFN. CONCLUSIONS With respect to HBsAg lowering, this meta-analysis confirmed the importance of longer treatment duration and addition of IFN, which revealed the potential value of immune-based therapies.","Chen, Yusi; Li, Justin Jinhui; Chen, Rong; Li, Gailing; Ji, Jia",Antiviral therapy,301,31

Their function can be affected by a number of drugs or other substances, many of which alter ciliary beat frequency (CBF). This has implications for diseases of the respiratory tract and nasal drug delivery. This article is a systematic review of the literature that examines 229 substances and their effect on CBF. METHODS MEDLINE was the primary database used for data collection. Eligibility criteria based on experimental design were established, and 152 studies were ultimately selected. Each individual trial for the substances tested was noted whenever possible, including concentration, time course, specific effect on CBF, and source of tissue. RESULTS There was a high degree of heterogeneity between the various experiments examined in this article. Substances and their general effects (increase, no effect, decrease) were grouped into six categories: antimicrobials and antivirals, pharmacologics, human biological products, organisms and toxins, drug excipients, and natural compounds/other manipulations. CONCLUSION Organisms, toxins, and drug excipients tend to show a cilioinhibitory effect, whereas substances in all other categories had mixed effects. All studies examined were in vitro experiments, and application of the results in vivo is confounded by several factors. The data presented in this article should be useful in future respiratory research and examination of compounds for therapeutic and drug delivery purposes.","Workman, Alan D; Cohen, Noam A",American journal of rhinology & allergy,301,19

Autophagy is a major cellular defense against oxidative stress, or related conditions that cause accumulation of damaged proteins or organelles. Selective forms of autophagy can maintain organelle populations or remove aggregated proteins. Dysregulation of redox homeostasis under pathological conditions results in excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and the associated oxidative damage of cellular components. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is necessary to maintain redox homeostasis. ROS activates autophagy, which facilitates cellular adaptation and diminishes oxidative damage by degrading and recycling intracellular damaged macromolecules and dysfunctional organelles. The cellular responses triggered by oxidative stress include the altered regulation of signaling pathways that culminate in the regulation of autophagy. Current research suggests a central role for autophagy as a mammalian oxidative stress response and its interrelationship to other stress defense systems. Altered autophagy phenotypes have been observed in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease, acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, and asthma. Understanding the mechanisms by which ROS regulate autophagy will provide novel therapeutic targets for lung diseases. This review highlights our current understanding on the interplay between ROS and autophagy in the development of pulmonary disease.","Ornatowski, Wojciech; Lu, Qing; Yegambaram, Manivannan; Garcia, Alejandro E; Zemskov, Evgeny A; Maltepe, Emin; Fineman, Jeffrey R; Wang, Ting; Black, Stephen M",Redox biology,301,31

However, few of these technologies could be applied without a well-trained team. Our goal was to demonstrate that robotic surgery depends more on the patient-side assistant surgeon's abilities than has been previously reported. METHODS In our department, 280 interventions in digestive, thoracic, and gynecological surgery were performed since the acquisition of the robotic equipment. There are three teams trained in robotic surgery with three console surgeons and four certified patient-side surgeons. Four more patient-side assistants were trained at our center. Trocar placement, docking and undocking of the robot, insertion of the laparoscopic instruments, and hemostatic maneuvers with various devices were quantified and compared. RESULTS Assistants trained by using animal or cadaver surgery are more comfortable with the robotic instruments handling and with docking and undocking of the robot. Assistants who finalized their residency or attend their final year are more accurate with the insertion of the laparoscopic instrument to the targeted organ and more skillful with LigaSure or clip applier devices. Interventions that require vivid participation of the assistants have shorter assistant-depending time intervals at the end of the learning curve than at the beginning. CONCLUSIONS Robotic surgery is a team effort and is greatly dependant on the performance of assistant surgeons. Interventions that have the benefit of a trained team are more rapid and secure.","Sgarbura, Olivia; Vasilescu, Catalin",Surgical endoscopy,301,1

Covid-19 has emerged as a pandemic affecting more than 20 million people till date with few, if any, proven therapy. Convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies against the virus has been used with some success. We did a systematic review to synthesize the available data on CP therapy for treatment of Covid-19 to study the efficacy and safety outcomes. Methods. Two reviewers searched the published and pre-published literature between 1 January 2019 and 23 June 2020 for studies comparing the use of CP with standard therapy for Covid-19 patients. Data from the selected studies were abstracted and analysed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the quality of evidence was graded as per GRADE. Results. We found 13 case series and 1 randomized trial that fulfilled our search criteria. Of the 12 case series with a total of 264 patients that reported the efficacy outcomes, 11 studies showed favourable results with survival benefit. The only RCT with 103 patients did not show any mortality benefit but was terminated early prior to complete enrolment. A single large study of 5000 patients reported safety outcomes and showed no major adverse events in patient streated with CP. Conclusion.

METHODS In this prospective observational cohort study, we enrolled mother-infant dyads whose infants were born <32 weeks' gestation. Enrollment occurred after 2 weeks of NICU exposure, when maternal social factors and demographic information was collected. Maternal time spent in the NICU was abstracted from the electronic medical record and was dichotomized into 0 to 6 days and ≥6 days per week. Demographic differences between the 2 groups were compared by using χ2 tests. Logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between maternal social factors and the average number of days per week spent in the NICU. RESULTS A total of 169 mother-infant dyads were analyzed. Maternal social factors associated with more time spent in the NICU included an annual household income of >$100 000, compared with those with an annual household income of <$50 000 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.77-18.19), a travel time <30 minutes to the NICU (compared with those who traveled >60 minutes [aOR: 7.85; 95% CI 2.81-21.96]), and the lack of other children in the household, compared with women with other children (aOR: 3.15; 95% CI 1.39-7.11).

However, this study revealed that the treatment of the virus bound to Sf9 cells at low pH could efficiently rescue the infectivity of AcMNPV in the presence of endocytosis pathway inhibitors. A colocalization assay of the major capsid protein VP39 with the early endosome marker EEA1 showed that at low pH, AcMNPV entered Sf9 cells via an endosome-independent pathway. Using a fluorescent probe (R18), we showed that at low pH, the viral nucleocapsid entered Sf9 cells via direct fusion at the cell surface. By using the myosin-specific inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) and the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole, the low pH-triggered direct fusion was demonstrated to be dependent on myosin-like proteins and independent of microtubules. The reverse transcription-PCR of the IE1 gene as a marker for viral entry showed that the kinetics of AcMNPV in cells triggered by low pH was similar to that of the normal entry via endocytosis. The low pH-mediated infection assay and VP39 and EEA1 colocalization assay also demonstrated that AcMNPV could efficiently transduce mammalian cells via direct membrane fusion at the cell surface. More importantly, we found that a low-pH trigger could significantly improve the transduction efficiency of AcMNPV in mammalian cells, leading to the potential application of this method when using baculovirus as a vector for heterologous gene expression and for gene therapy.","Dong, Sicong; Wang, Manli; Qiu, Zhijuan; Deng, Fei; Vlak, Just M; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin",Journal of virology,301,1

Conservative, surgical and endoscopic therapeutic techniques are used. Both CEP and PSF are potentially life-threatening complications and require intensive treatment. Endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT) is an innovative endoscopic surgical procedure for the treatment of transmural intestinal defects throughout the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In this retrospective study, we demonstrate its application in head and neck surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS In ENPT, open-pore drains are placed endoscopically in the wound area. The drains can be inserted in an intraluminal position spanning the length of the defect (intraluminal ENPT), or through the defect into the extraluminal wound cavity (intracavitary ENPT). An electronic suction pump applies and maintains a continuous negative pressure of - 125 mmHg over a period of several days. The endoscopic drains are changed at regular intervals every few days until stable intracorporeal wound healing by secondary intention or defect closure is achieved. Between 06/2008 and 05/2019 ten patients (f = 3, m = 7; 46-78 years old) were treated with ENPT for CEP or PSF. Five patients had postoperative wound defects with consecutive PSF after total laryngectomy or floor of mouth resection. In five patients iatrogenic CEP was found following endoscopic procedures. RESULTS In all patients treated with ENPT, healing of the perforation defect or fistula was achieved (cure rate 100%). The median treatment duration was 13.7 days (range 4-42 days). No relevant treatment-associated complications were observed. CONCLUSION ENPT is a new, minimally invasive method for treating PSF and CEP.","Loeck, Jonathan; von Lücken, Hans-Jürgen; Münscher, Adrian; Müller, Christian Theodor; Loske, Gunnar",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,301,1

Conventional transanal surgery has a high recurrence rate, for this reason transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is considered the treatment of choice in the last few years in large rectal adenomas and in early rectal cancer (low risk T1). PATIENTS AND METHOD We have intervened five patients, four with a diagnosis of villous adenoma of the rectum, and one in situ rectal carcinoma, using this new transanal approach, with a single port device. RESULTS The locations of the lesions were in the mid-rectum, at a mean distance of 9 cm (range 6-10) from the anal margin. All of them were situated in the posterior side. The resection margins were negative in all cases. The mean size of the adenomas was 4 cm, three being sessile shaped, and one with a short, thick pedicle (>1cm); the size of the carcinoma was 3 cm. The mean surgical time was 55 minutes. All the patients were discharged 48 hours after the surgical procedure. CONCLUSION We believe that the transanal endoscopic approach with a single port device is a simple, easily reproducible and cost-effective procedure when compared to TEM.","Cid, Ramón Cantero; Pérez, Juan Carlos García; Elosua, Tomás González; Pinto, Francisca Lima; Alegre, Javier Martínez; Martín, Raquel; Jiménez, Jesús Torres",Cirugia espanola,301,26

METHOD Regression-based normative data were calculated from a sample of 103 non-depressed independent community-dwelling adults aged 55 or older (67% women). Raw data for Digit Span (DS), Letters and Numbers (LN), the Trail Making Test (TMT), and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were regressed on age, sex, and education. The model predicting TMT-B scores also included TMT-A scores. Z-scores for the discrepancy between observed and predicted scores were used to identify low scores. The base rate of low scores for SABIEX normative data was compared to the base rate of low scores using published normative data obtained from the general population. RESULTS The effects of age, sex, and education varied across neuropsychological measures. Although the proportion of low scores was similar between normative datasets, there was no agreement in the identification of cognitively impaired individuals. CONCLUSIONS Normative data obtained from the general population might not be sensitive to identify low scores in cognitively active older adults, incorrectly classifying them as cognitively normal compared to the less-active population. We provide a friendly calculator for use in neuropsychological assessment in cognitively active Spanish people aged 55 or older.","Iñesta, Clara; Oltra-Cucarella, Javier; Bonete-López, Beatriz; Calderón-Rubio, Eva; Sitges-Maciá, Esther",International journal of environmental research and public health,301,1

We describe the incidence and clinical impact of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a newly identified virus, in adults. METHODS Infection with HMPV was identified in 3 prospectively enrolled adult cohorts (young persons 19-40 years old, healthy adults > or =65 years old, and high-risk adults) and a hospitalized cohort for 4 consecutive winters (November 15 through April 15 for the years 1999 through 2003). The incidence and clinical impact were compared with those of influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus infection in the same groups. RESULTS Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and serologic testing, we identified HMPV infection in 2.2% to 10.5% of the 3 prospectively followed-up outpatient cohorts annually. Asymptomatic infection was common, accounting for at least 38.8% of infections in each of the cohorts. Symptoms, when they occurred, were typical of an upper respiratory tract illness, although a few high-risk persons required hospitalization. Among 1386 hospitalized patients, HMPV was identified in 8.5% (range, 4.4%-13.2%), depending on the year. Dual viral infection was identified in 22.9%. Wheezing was frequent (80%) and more common than with influenza. Twelve percent required intensive care unit admission and 11% ventilatory support, rates similar to those for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection. CONCLUSIONS In adults of all ages, HMPV is a common infection, and, although often asymptomatic, it can result in serious infection that requires hospitalization. Like influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, HMPV is also a major contributor to the burden of wintertime respiratory illnesses in older adults.","Walsh, Edward E; Peterson, Derick R; Falsey, Ann R",Archives of internal medicine,301,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS With IRB approval, we identified 23 consecutive men with stage 1 testicular cancer (diagnosed after orchiectomy) undergoing surveillance with unenhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. Three blinded radiologists (2 inexperienced R1/R2 and 1 experienced R3) independently assessed MRI for: presence, location and size of abnormal lymph nodes and degree of confidence (5-point Likert scale) in diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy was tabulated and compared between groups using ROC. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic. RESULTS 17.4% (4/23) men developed 6 metastatic lymph nodes (reference standard: interval development from baseline, size > 1.0 cm short axis). R1 and R2 detected 75% (3/4) patients with abnormal lymph nodes, compared to R3 who detected all four cases. False positive interpretations occurred in: 5.2% (1/19) R1, 10.5% (2/19) R2 and no patients for R3. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were: R1: 75% (95% CI 19.4-99.4%), 94.7% (74.0-99.9%) and 0.85 (0.59-1.00), R2: 75% (19.4-99.4%), 89.5% (66.9-98.7%) and 0.82 (0.57-1.00) and, R3: 100% (95% 39.8-100.0%), 100% (82.4-100%) and 1.00 (1.00-1.00) with no difference in AUC between readers (p = 0.383). Comparison in accuracy between readers is limited due to the small sample size. Inter-observer agreement was substantial (K = 0.62). Median (range) degree of confidence scores were rated: R1 5 (5-5), R2 4 (3-5) and, R3 5 (5-5).

Various techniques have been reported with some failure and complications. Here, we compare the feasibility and safety between electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic marking and computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous marking using indocyanine green (ICG) and iopamidol. METHODS A total of 47 patients with small-sized pulmonary nodules, scheduled to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic limited resection, were enrolled in this study. A mixture of diluted ICG and iopamidol was injected into the lung parenchyma as a marker, using CT-guided percutaneous or electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection techniques and the results were examined and compared. RESULTS A total of 35 and 12 patients underwent preoperative marking by percutaneous injection and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection, respectively, in which a marker was detected in 33/35 (94.3%) and 12/12 (100%) patients. No combination of these procedures was performed in any patient. All markers were successfully detected in three patients who underwent injection marking at two different lesion sites. Pneumothorax occurred in five patients (14%) in the percutaneous marking group, which was relieved in all patients without the necessity for chest tube drainage. No other complication was observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection techniques using indocyanine green fluorescence plus iopamidol are safe and effective, and comparable with CT-guided localization. Furthermore, a bronchoscopic approach enables marking of multiple lesion areas without increasing patient risk, especially for puncture-related pneumothorax. KEY POINTS SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Either computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous or electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection techniques can be used for preoperative marking of pulmonary nodules with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Indocyanine green (ICG) is a safe and easily detectable fluorescent marker for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A bronchoscopic injection approach enables marking of multiple lesion areas without increasing the risk of pneumothorax.","Yang, Yan-Long; Li, Zi-Zhe; Huang, Wei-Chao; Zhuang, Jia; Lin, Dai-Ying; Zhong, Wen-Zhao; Lan, Bin",Thoracic cancer,301,8

Inhalation devices consist of nebulizers and handheld inhalers, such as dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs). Although pMDIs, DPIs and SMIs may be appropriate for most patients with COPD, certain patient populations may have challenges with these devices. Patients who have cognitive, neuromuscular, or ventilatory impairments (and receive limited assistance from caregivers), as well as those with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow may not derive the full benefit from handheld inhalers. A considerable number of patients are not capable of producing a peak inspiratory flow rate to overcome the internal resistance of DPIs. Furthermore, patients may have difficulty coordinating inhalation with device actuation, which is required for pMDIs and SMIs. However, inhalation devices such as spacers and valved holding chambers can be used with pMDIs to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery. Nebulized treatment provides patients with COPD an alternative administration route that avoids the need for inspiratory flow, manual dexterity, or complex hand-breath coordination. The recent approval of two nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonists has added to the extensive range of nebulized therapies in COPD. Furthermore, with the availability of quieter and more portable nebulizer devices, nebulization may be a useful treatment option in the management of certain patient populations with COPD. The aim of this narrative review was to highlight recent updates and the treatment landscape in nebulized therapy and COPD. We first discuss the pathophysiology of patients with COPD and inhalation device considerations. Second, we review the updates on recently approved and newly marketed nebulized treatments, nebulized treatments currently in development, and technological advances in nebulizer devices. Finally, we discuss the current applications of nebulized therapy in patients with COPD.","Barjaktarevic, Igor Z; Milstone, Aaron P",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,301,28

BACKGROUND Further understanding of migraine burden is needed. METHODS Adults with migraine randomized to mindfulness-based stress reduction or headache education arms (n = 81) in two separate randomized clinical trials participated in semistructured in-person qualitative interviews conducted after the interventions. Interviews queried participants on migraine impact on life and were audio-recorded, transcribed, and summarized into a framework matrix. A master codebook was created until meaning saturation was reached and magnitude coding established code frequency. Themes and subthemes were identified using a constructivist grounded theory approach. RESULTS Despite most participants being treated with acute and/or prophylactic medications, 90% (73/81) reported migraine had a negative impact on overall life, with 68% (55/81) endorsing specific domains of life impacted and 52% (42/81) describing impact on emotional health. Six main themes of migraine impact emerged: (1) global negative impact on overall life; (2) impact on emotional health; (3) impact on cognitive function; (4) impact on specific domains of life (work/career, family, social); (5) fear and avoidance (pain catastrophizing and anticipatory anxiety); and (6) internalized and externalized stigma. Participants reported how migraine (a) controls life, (b) makes life difficult, and (c) causes disability during attacks, with participants (d) experiencing a lack of control and/or (e) attempting to push through despite migraine. Emotional health was affected through (a) isolation, (b) anxiety, (c) frustration/anger, (d) guilt, (e) mood changes/irritability, and (f) depression/hopelessness. Cognitive function was affected through concentration and communication difficulties. CONCLUSIONS Migraine has a global negative impact on overall life, cognitive and emotional health, work, family, and social life. Migraine contributes to isolation, frustration, guilt, fear, avoidance behavior, and stigma. A greater understanding of the deep burden of this chronic neurological disease is needed to effectively target and treat what is most important to those living with migraine.","Estave, Paige M; Beeghly, Summerlyn; Anderson, Reid; Margol, Caitlyn; Shakir, Mariam; George, Geena; Berger, Anissa; O'Connell, Nathaniel; Burch, Rebecca; Haas, Niina; Powers, Scott W; Seng, Elizabeth; Buse, Dawn C; Lipton, Richard B; Wells, Rebecca Erwin",Headache,301,1

METHODS Six subjects with chronic incomplete SCI (>12 months post injury) participated in this crossover study. Intervention consisted of 3 sessions, separated by at least 1 week, in which each subject received the conditions cathodal, anodal, and sham tsDCS. Stimulation was delivered at 2.5 mA for 20 minutes with the active electrode positioned over the spinous processes of T10-T11 and the reference electrode over left deltoid. To measure the effects of tsDCS on corticospinal excitability, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured bilaterally from soleus before and after tsDCS. RESULTS Five subjects completed all 3 sessions. One subject withdrew after 2 sessions due to complications unrelated to the study. MEPs were measurable in 5 subjects. No significant differences in change of MEP amplitudes were found between the 3 conditions. However, there were trends that indicated laterality of response, particularly with cathodal tsDCS increasing corticospinal excitability contralateral to the reference electrode and decreasing corticospinal excitability ipsilateral to the reference electrode. CONCLUSION Corticospinal excitability may be modulated with laterality by tsDCS in individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI. Further research is needed to 1) determine whether different placement of the reference electrode can lead to uniform modulation bilaterally, and 2) reveal whether these alterations in corticospinal excitability can lead to improved movement function in individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI.","Powell, Elizabeth Salmon; Carrico, Cheryl; Salyers, Emily; Westgate, Philip M; Sawaki, Lumy",NeuroRehabilitation,301,1

Therefore, the exploration of prognostic predictors for patients with COVID-19 is vital for prompt clinical intervention. Our study aims to explore the predictive value of hematological parameters in the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods Ninety-eight patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Jingzhou Central Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei Province, were included in this study. Results The median age of the patients was 59 [28-80] years; the median age of patients with a good prognosis was 56 [28-79] years, and the median age of patients with a poor outcome was 67 [35-80] years. The patients in the poor outcome group were older than the patients in the good outcome group (P<0.05). The comparison of hematological parameters showed that lymphocyte count (Lym#), red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were significantly lower in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (P<0.05). Further, the red cell volume distribution width-CV (RDW-CV) and red cell volume distribution width-SD (RDW-SD) were significantly higher in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (P<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed RDW-SD, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.870 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.796-0.943], was the most significant single parameter for predicting the prognosis of severe patients. When the cut-off value was 42.15, the sensitivity and specificity of RDW-SD for predicting the prognosis of severe patients were 73.1% and 80.2%, respectively. Reticulocyte (RET) channel results showed the RET level was significantly higher in critical patients than in moderate patients and severe patients (P<0.05), which may be one cause of the elevated RDW in patients with a poor outcome. Conclusions In this study, the hematological parameters of COVID-19 patients were statistically analyzed. RDW was found to be a prognostic predictor for patients with severe COVID-19, and the increase in RET may contribute to elevated RDW.","Wang, Changzheng; Zhang, Hongmei; Cao, Xiaocui; Deng, Rongrong; Ye, Yi; Fu, Zhongxiao; Gou, Liyao; Shao, Feng; Li, Jin; Fu, Weiyang; Zhang, Xiaomei; Ding, Xiao; Xiao, Jianping; Wu, Chuanjian; Li, Tao; Qi, Huan; Li, Chengbin; Lu, Zhongxin",Annals of translational medicine,301,33

In Poland, a possibility of employment in 2 or more workplaces arose with the socio-political changes and the reform of the health care system. In Poland, the scale of the phenomenon, as well as its motifs and potential effects influencing both employees and the whole health care system, are still not known despite numerous studies being conducted to that end. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 1023 nurses (males and females) employed in public and non-public health care facilities in the territory of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. The research tool was the authors' poll questionnaire. In the statistical elaboration, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and the χ2 independence test were used. For all the analyses, the maximum permissible error of type I, α = 0.05, was accepted, and p ≤ 0.05 was recognized as statistically significant. RESULTS Work experience of the nurses studied ranged 1-43 years, on average it was 23.1 years (SD = 11.1). Persons aged >40 years accounted for 77.5% (N = 793), out of whom 38.2% (N = 391) were aged 41-years and 39.3% (N = 402) >50 years. In the study group, 450 (44%) people were employed in 2 workplaces, out of whom 93.5% in the nurse position, working >160 h/month (39%). A decisive reason to take up an additional job (93.3% of the study group) were financial matters. CONCLUSIONS Financial matters are the main reason for which almost half of the studied nurses undertake additional employment, in the scope twice as high as the work load. Research suggests the need to verify the Central Registry of Nurses and Midwives in order to precisely estimate the number of dual practice positions and the number of persons employed as nurses not only in the south of Poland but also in whole country. The results point to the necessity of further research concerning both the reasons for and consequences of dual practice for nurses, and the impact of this phenomenon on the quality of care and patient safety.

OBJECTIVES Test whether the heritabilities (h2 ) of PAI-1 and other hemostatic factors are constant throughout their distribution or whether they are quantile-specific, i.e. a larger or smaller h2 depending upon whether their concentrations are high or low. METHODS Quantile regression was applied to 5606 parent-offspring pairs and 5310 full siblings of the Framingham Heart Study. Quantile-specific heritability was estimated from the parent-offspring regression slope (βPO , h2 =2βPO /(1+rspouse )) and the full-sib regression slope (βFS , h2 ={(1+8rspouse βFS )0 .5 -1}/(2rspouse )). RESULTS Heritability (h2 ±SE) increased significantly with increasing percentiles of the offspring's age- and sex-adjusted PAI-1 distribution when estimated from βPO (Plinear trend =0.0001): 0.09±0.02 at the 10th , 0.09±0.02 at the 25th , 0.16±0.02 at the 50th , 0.29±0.04 at the 75th , and 0.26±0.08 at the 90th percentile of the PAI-1 distribution, and when estimated from βFS (Plinear trend =6.5x10-7 ). There was no significant evidence for quantile-specific heritability for Factor VII (Plinear trend =0.35), D-dimer (Plinear trend =0.08), tPA (Plinear trend =0.74), or von Willebrand factor (Plinear trend =0.79). CONCLUSION Higher mean plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations tend to accentuate genetic effects (quantile-dependent expressivity), which is consistent with the greater reported differences in PAI-1 concentrations between rs1799889 SERPINE1 (4G/5G) genotypes in patients with osteonecrosis, meningococcal sepsis, obesity, prior myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome than in healthy controls. It is also consistent with the greater increases in PAI-1 concentrations in 4G-allele carriers than 5G/5G homozygotes following fibrinolytic treatment, low-salt intake, and high saturated fat intake.","Williams, Paul T",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,301,31

Based on sparse research, our institution developed a protocol for ordering labs for this patient population, including routine admission labs in addition to eight COVID-19 specific daily labs. The study goal is to determine if COVID-19 specific admission labs have any prognostic value beyond that provided by routine admission labs and vitals, and costs of labs with no prognostic value. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed adult patients admitted with COVID-19 from 3/2020 to 7/2020. Outcomes were mortality, ICU stay and length of hospitalization. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to determine if COVID-19 specific admission labs have any prognostic value beyond that provided by vitals and routine admission labs. COVID-19 specific labs were d-Dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, LDH, CK, pro-BNP, troponin and CRP. Multivariable models included all routine admission labs and vitals. COVID-19 specific admission labs were included in the multivariable models if the p-value was <0.05 in the univariable analysis. RESULTS 331 patients met study criteria, inpatient mortality was 13.0%, 52.4% of patients required ICU stays and the average length of hospitalization was 8.9 days. COVID-19 specific labs showed no additional prognostic value for mortality. CRP, LDH and d-Dimer provided additional prognostic information for ICU stay. CRP≥100mg/dL and LDH≥900U/L were associated with increased length of hospitalization. CONCLUSION Only 3 of 8 admission COVID-19 specific labs recommended by our institution's protocol had additional prognostic value beyond that provided by routine labs and vitals.

The mean improvement in margin reflex distance 2 for all eyelids was 2.2 mm (p<0.0001). The mean decrease in ISS for all eyelids was 1.7 mm (p<0.0001). The average duration of follow up was 15.6 months. Ten eyelids of seven patients had greater than 12 months of follow up (mean 21.9 months), and this subset was evaluated separately to emphasize longevity of results. In this subset, the mean improvement in margin reflex distance 2 was 2.4 mm (p<0.0001), and the mean decrease in ISS was 1.7 mm (p=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS Noncadaveric human acellular dermal tissue is efficacious in treating lower eyelid retraction. BellaDerm produced long-term symptomatic relief and stable clinical correction of lower eyelid retraction secondary to multiple etiologies. These findings contradict the thinking that although acellular dermis is an adequate modality for correction of eyelid retraction, results may be compromised by graft resorption and recurrence of symptoms. Improved biological integrity from live donor harvesting or alternate processing techniques may contribute to the success of this particular acellular dermis.","Scruggs, Jennifer T; McGwin, Gerald; Morgenstern, Kenneth E",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,301,24

Here, we describe the evolution of TCBZ regimens and the emergence of TCBZ failure to Fasciola infection. AREAS COVERED : The present review focuses on the evidence of TCBZ for the treatment of fascioliasis. For acute fascioliasis, there is a lack of studies to measure the presence of eggs of Fasciola in stool samples on the follow-up after initial TCBZ treatment. For chronic fascioliasis, WHO recommends a single oral dose of TCBZ 10mg/kg whereas CDC recommends two doses of TCBZ 10mg/kg 12h apart. Incremental number of treatment failures have been documented worldwide. There are currently no therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of fascioliasis in humans. EXPERT OPINION : Most cases of human fascioliasis are successfully treated with TCBZ, but some continue excreting eggs in the stools despite 1-2 standard of care regimens of TCBZ. A precise regimen is unclear for those patients who fail the initial treatment with TCBZ. Further clinical trials are needed to address the possible TCBZ emerging resistance.","Marcos, Luis A; Maco, Vicente; Terashima, Angelica",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,301,1

This study adapted an existing parent training intervention to improve outcomes for low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking Latino parents of children with leukemia and pilot tested that intervention for feasibility. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with a focus group of 20 Latino parents of children treated for leukemia. Ten Latino families participated in a pilot study of the adapted parenting intervention, consisting of eight sessions over 6 months. RESULTS Focus groups revealed that parents unanimously supported a parenting intervention but barriers to participation included time constraints, transportation issues, and anxiety in the hospital environment. The parents also highlighted cultural factors that could contribute to the health disparity, such as lack of knowledge and efficacy in facilitating their child's progress with learning and school. In the pilot study, adherence was 90%, establishing feasibility, and the adapted intervention was considered beneficial. The median parenting efficacy scores improved from preintervention to postintervention (median 3.40 vs. 3.94; p < .011), as did parent-reported school functioning of the child (median 50.00 vs. 60.00; p = .088). CONCLUSIONS This study addressed a health disparity by culturally adapting a parenting intervention, which was designed to improve school functioning, to meet the needs and preferences of low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking families of children with leukemia in Southern California. The pilot study demonstrated that the adapted intervention is feasible and acceptable in the target population. A larger trial is underway to test the efficacy of this adapted parenting intervention.","Patel, Sunita K; Miranda, Leticia; Delgado, Nicole; Barreto, Nicolas; Nolty, Anne; Kelly, Natalie C; Wilson, Karla; Toomey, Debbie; Pawlowska, Anna",Journal of pediatric psychology,301,1

We utilized a placebo literature database on various aspects of the genuine placebo/nocebo response. In 2015, we had extracted 75 systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions performed in major medical areas (neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine). These meta-analyses were screened for whether sex/gender differences had been noted to contribute to the placebo/nocebo effect: in only 3 such analyses female sex was associated with a higher placebo effect, indicating poor evidence for a contribution of sex to it in RCTs. This was updated with another set of meta-analyses for the current review, but did not change the overall conclusion. The same holds true for 18 meta-analyses investigating adverse event (nocebo) reporting in RCT in the placebo arm of trials. We also screened our database for papers referring to sex/gender and the placebo effect in experimental studies, and identified 28 papers reporting 29 experiments. Their results can be summarized as follows: (a) Despite higher sensitivity of pain in females, placebo analgesia is easier to elicit in males; (b) It appears that conditioning is effective specifically eliciting nocebo effects; (c) Conditioning works specifically well to elicit placebo and nocebo effects in females and with nausea; (d) Verbal suggestions are not sufficient to induce analgesia in women, but work in men. These results will be discussed with respect to the question why nausea and pain may be prone to be responsive to sex/gender differences, while other symptoms are less. Lastly, we will discuss the apparent discrepancy between RCT with low relevance of sex, and higher relevance of sex in specific experimental settings. We argue that the placebo response is predominantly the result of a conditioning (learning) response in females, while in males it predominantly may be generated via (verbal) manipulating of expectancies. In RCT therefore, the net outcome of the intervention may be the same despite different mechanisms generating the placebo effect between the sexes, while in experimental work when both pathways are separated and explicitly explored, such differences may surface.","Enck, Paul; Klosterhalfen, Sibylle",Frontiers in neuroscience,301,26

This publication describes the protocol concerning a comprehensive systematic review that primarily aims to collect and synthesise available guidelines for prevention in primary care focused on school-aged children living in high-income regions. A second objective is to assess the quality of identified documents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search for reports providing clinical practice guidelines or consensus or expert opinion on preventive actions in paediatric primary care. We will use the WHO definition of prevention. We will focus on children aged 6-18 years living in the European region, the USA, Canada and Australia.

There have been 47 face transplants around the world to date, but none as yet in the UK. Yet in 2003, the UK was poised to undertake the first face transplant in the world. The reasons why it didn't take place are not straightforward, but largely unexplored by historians. The Royal College of Surgeons, concerned about the media attention given to face transplants and the ethical and surgical issues involved, held a working party and concluded that it could not give approval for face transplants, effectively bringing to a halt the UK's momentum in the field. This extraordinary episode in medical history has been anecdotally influential in shaping the course of British surgical history. This article explores and explains the lack of a face transplant in the UK and draws attention to the complex emotional, institutional and international issues involved. Its findings have implications beyond the theme of face transplants, into the cultural contexts and practices in which surgical innovation takes place.","Bound Alberti, Fay; Hoyle, Victoria",Medical humanities,301,31

Currently, the therapy benefits of antiviral experimental drugs are still uncertain. The main aim of this study is to describe the experience of a level III hospital regarding therapeutic management of hospitalized children with COVID-19 and to characterize clinical features and evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a descriptive study of patients with COVID-19 in a level III pediatric hospital in Portugal between March and June 2020. Experimental drugs were administered according to the best scientific evidence at the time as 'off-label use'. RESULTS Among 200 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 37 were admitted due to COVID-19. Median age was one year (23 days - 18 years), 43% had comorbidities and 20/37 (54%) received antiviral therapy. Hydroxychloroquine was administered in 13 patients, in monotherapy or combined with lopinavir/ritonavir or azithromycin. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered in eight patients and three children were treated with remdesivir. The patients who were treated had pneumonia (14), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (2), sepsis (2), myocarditis (1), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1), and mild illness with comorbidities (3). Other therapies included methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin (3), enoxaparin (2), antibiotics (16), oxygen (7), corticosteroids, and other inhaled therapy (16). DISCUSSION Several treatment approaches have been proposed for severe COVID-19, even though none of them had been proven effective or approved for small children. Currently, remdesivir is approved for children aged above 12 years-old. Although 54% of our patients were treated with antivirals, it is important to understand that the favorable clinical evolution could be related with the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of our population presented severe and critical disease, was hospitalized and received treatment according to the most recent data, although most patients had mild disease. COVID-19 treatment in children is a clinical challenge and clinical trials are urgently needed.","Saraiva, Bárbara Martins; Garcia, Ana Margarida; Silva, Tiago Milheiro; Gouveia, Catarina; Brito, Maria João",Acta medica portuguesa,301,1

DESIGN AND SETTING We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in a Brazilian public university. METHODS We sought to compile data from 6724 hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS Treatment with dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality within 28 days (risk ratio, RR: 0.89; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.82-0.97). Dexamethasone use was linked with being discharged alive within 28 days (odds ratio, OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07-1.33).

Unfortunately, it is associated with a high wound complication rate up to 50 %, caused by large wound surface and inherent trauma to abdominal skin vascularization. An endoscopically assisted modification of the original technique (ECST) spares skin vascularization and reduces wound surface, supposedly reducing wound complications. This study accurately describes ECST step by step with detailed illustrations and report the results of a 27 patient cohort. METHODS Since September 2012 patients with midline hernias without previous subcutaneous dissection and a maximum diameter of approximately 10-15 cm underwent ECST in an expert centre for abdominal wall reconstructions. Prospective data was gathered during inpatient care and 3-6 monthly follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients (17 male/10 female) with median age of 60 years (range 35-77), average BMI 27 (SD ±2) kg/m(2) and median ASA classification 2 (range 1-3) underwent ECST. Two patients were excluded due to bilateral conversion to conventional CST and finding of peritoneal metastases. Median defect size was 116 ± 48 cm(2). Median length of stay was 5 days (range 3-15). Wound complication rate was 11 %. Recurrence rate was 29 % after a median follow-up of 13 months. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopically assisted modification of the original technique can be used for reconstructing large and complex ventral hernias up to 15 cm in diameter. The results of this small sized cohort study showed that ECST is feasible in patients with a uro-, or enterostomy and suggest that ECST reduces wound complication rate when compared to CST.","Mommers, E H H; Wegdam, J A; Nienhuijs, S W; de Vries Reilingh, T S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,301,16

METHODS This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and hospitalised at the cantonal hospital Aarau (Switzerland) between 26 February 2020 and 30 April 2020. Our primary endpoint was severe COVID-19 progression defined as a composite of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS A total of 99 patients (median age 67 years [interquartile range 56–76], 37% females) were included and 35% developed severe COVID-19 progression (24% needed ICU treatment, 19% died). Patients had a high burden of comorbidities with a median Charlson comorbidity index of 3 points and a high prevalence of hypertension (57%), chronic kidney disease (28%) and obesity (27%). Baseline characteristics with the highest prognostic value for the primary endpoint by means of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were male gender (0.63) and initial laboratory values including shock markers (lactate on ambient air 0.67; lactate with O2 supply 0.70), markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein 0.72, procalcitonin 0.80) and markers of compromised oxygenation (pO2 0.75 on ambient air), whereas age and comorbidities provided little prognostic information. CONCLUSION This analysis provides insights into the first consecutively hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a Swiss tertiary care hospital during the initial period of the pandemic. Markers of disease progression such as inflammatory markers, markers for shock and impaired respiratory function provided the most prognostic information regarding severe COVID-19 progression in our sample.","Gregoriano, Claudia; Koch, Daniel; Haubitz, Sebastian; Conen, Anna; Fux, Christoph A; Mueller, Beat; Bernasconi, Luca; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Oberle, Micheal; Burgermeister, Susanne; Reiter, Hartwig; Kutz, Alexander; Schuetz, Philipp",Swiss medical weekly,301,1

An observational study with three cohorts of infertile women was designed including 37 PCOS patients, 36 women with tubal factor, and 31 women with male factor. Clinical history and physical examination were carried out in all patients. All subjects completed the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaires. Women with infertility due to PCOS showed a significantly higher prevalence of depressive (48.6 vs 19.4 and 12.9%, p < 0.01) and anxiety symptoms (21.6 vs 5.6 and 3.2%, p = 0.041) than respondents of reference groups. Sexual function in PCOS subjects was impaired in the areas orgasm and satisfaction (p < 0.01 for both) compared to patients of reference groups. Clinical, biochemical hyperandrogenism, and overweight were associated with a higher incidence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the infertile PCOS group (p < 0.01 for all). Besides, the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with the number of medically assisted reproduction attempts (p = 0.014). Weight gain and age (p = 0.04 and p = 0.047) were associated with impaired sexual functioning. The relation between reduced sexuality and depressive/anxiety symptoms was found (p = 0.038 and p = 0.012, respectively).

The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA, polysomnogram (PSG), cannot anatomically localize obstruction. Precise identification of obstruction has potential to improve outcomes following surgery. Current diagnostic modalities that provide this information require anesthesia, involve ionizing radiation or disrupt sleep. To mitigate these problems, we conceived that ultrasound (US) technology may be adapted (i) to detect, quantify and localize airway obstruction and (ii) for translational application to home-based testing for OSA. Materials and Methods Segmental airway collapse was induced in 4 fresh cadavers by application of negative pressure. Following visualization of airway obstruction, a rotary US probe was used to acquire transcervical images of the airway before and after induction of obstruction. These images (n=800) were analyzed offline using image processing algorithms. Results Our results show that the non-obstructed airway consistently demonstrated the presence of a US air-tissue interface. Importantly, automated detection of the air-tissue interface strongly correlated with manual measurements. The algorithm correctly detected an air-tissue interface in 90% of the US images while incorrectly detecting it in 20% (area under the curve=0.91). Conclusion The non-invasive detection of airway obstruction using US represents a major step in expanding OSA diagnostics beyond PSG. The preliminary data obtained from our model could spur further research in non-invasive localization of obstruction. US offers the benefit of precise localization of the site of obstruction, with potential for improving outcomes in surgical management.","Isaiah, Amal; Mezrich, Reuben; Wolf, Jeffrey",Ultrasound international open,301,26

Such tools are available but can be difficult to use. This study aimed to develop a robust observational assessment tool for use on cancer multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) by health care professionals in everyday practice. METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the United Kingdom from September 2015 to July 2016. Three tumor boards from three teaching hospitals were recruited, with 44 members overall. Six weekly meetings involving 146 consecutive cases were video-recorded and scored using the validated MODe tool. Data were subjected to reliability and validity analysis in the current study to develop a shorter version of the MODe. RESULTS Phase 1, a reduction of the original items in the MODe, was achieved through two focus group meetings with expert assessors based on previous research. The 12 original items were reduced to 6 domains, receiving full agreement by the assessors. In phase 2, the six domains were subjected to item reliability, convergent validation, and internal consistency testing against the MODe-Lite global score, the MODe global score, and the items of the MODe. Significant positive correlations were evident across all domains (p < 0.01), indicating good reliability and validity. In phase 3, feasibility and high inter-assessor reliability were achieved by two clinical assessors. Six domains measuring clinical input, holistic input, clinical collaboration, pathology, radiology, and management plan were integrated into MODe-Lite. CONCLUSIONS As an evidence-based tool for health care professionals in everyday practice, MODe-Lite gives cancer MTBs insight into the way they work and facilitates improvements in practice.","Lamb, B W; Miah, S; Skolarus, T A; Stewart, G D; Green, J S A; Sevdalis, N; Soukup, T",Annals of surgical oncology,301,31

In severe cases, the combination of crushing, tearing, and puncturing can result in scalp avulsion. Currently, microsurgical replantation of the avulsed scalp remains the gold standard but may not always be possible. The authors present their treatment algorithm with 2 patient examples. In Patient 1, the scalp was deemed unsuitable for replantation due to extensive soft tissue injury; in Patient 2, the scalp was not available on presentation. Both patients underwent debridement and early wound coverage followed by multistage secondary revision through serial tissue expansion and excision. At 3-years follow-up, both patients have achieved satisfactory aesthetic outcomes following the initial loss of 70% and 40% of hair-bearing scalp. There were no infective complications or wound dehiscence and the areas of scar alopecia are much improved with preservation of the hairline. Pediatric scalp avulsion injuries resulting from dog bites are uncommon and involve a unique injury mechanism.

Given the importance of COVID-19 TP rates for understanding COVID-related morbidity, researchers and clinicians have become increasingly interested in comparing TP rates across countries. The statistical methods for performing such comparisons fall into two general categories: frequentist tests and Bayesian methods. Using data from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org), we performed comparisons for two prototypical yet disparate pairs of countries: Bolivia versus the United States (large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates), and South Korea vs. Uruguay (two very small TP rates of similar magnitude). Three different statistical procedures were used: two frequentist tests (an asymptotic z-test and the 'N-1' chi-square test), and a Bayesian method for comparing two proportions (TP rates are proportions). Results indicated that for the case of large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates (Bolivia versus the United States), the frequentist and Bayesian approaches both indicated that the two rates were substantially different. When the TP rates were very small and of similar magnitude (values of .009 and .007 for South Korea and Uruguay, respectively), the frequentist tests indicated a highly significant contrast, despite the apparent trivial amount by which the two rates differ. The Bayesian method, in comparison, suggested that the TP rates were practically equivalent-a finding that seems more consistent with the observed data. When TP rates are highly similar in magnitude, frequentist tests can lead to erroneous interpretations. A Bayesian approach, on the other hand, can help ensure more accurate inferences and thereby avoid potential decision errors that could lead to costly public health and policy-related consequences.","Hittner, James B; Fasina, Folorunso O",Methods,301,1

The objective of this study was to test the strength of 3 different cystic duct closure methods in a model simulating postoperative biliary insufflation. METHODS The extrahepatic biliary system, including common bile duct, gallbladder, and cystic duct, was harvested en bloc from 22 swine postmortem. A cholecystectomy was performed and the cystic duct was secured using 1 of 3 randomly assigned methods: metallic clips (Ethicon Endo-Surgery), an ENDOLOOP (Ethicon Endo-Surgery), or an ENSEAL tissue sealing device (Ethicon Endo-Surgery). The common bile duct was cannulated with a pressure-monitoring system and insufflated with air. The burst pressures, location of rupture, and size of the common bile duct and cystic duct were recorded and compared. RESULTS There were 7 pigs each in the ENDOLOOP and ENSEAL groups and 8 in the metallic clip group, with no statistical significance between cystic and common bile duct size. Mean burst pressure was 432 mm Hg for metallic clips, 371 mm Hg for the ENDOLOOP, and 238 mm Hg for the ENSEAL device (P = .02). Post hoc analysis revealed clips to be statistically superior when compared with the ENSEAL (P= .01). There was no statistical difference between the ENDOLOOP and metal clips or between the ENDOLOOP and the ENSEAL. CONCLUSIONS All 3 closure methods successfully secured the cystic duct, with mean burst pressures exceeding 195 mm Hg. Metallic clips demonstrated the highest burst pressures and no cystic duct stump leaks. This study challenges the traditional dogma of additionally securing the cystic duct with an ENDOLOOP when postoperative biliary instrumentation is expected and also suggests that an adequately secure closure may be obtained with thermal sealing devices.","McVay, Derek; Nelson, Daniel; Porta, Christopher R; Blair, Kelly; Martin, Matthew",American journal of surgery,301,16

Following PRISMA methodology, databases were searched for relevant publications. A total of 83 articles with a range of methodologies were included to ensure broad coverage of this rapidly emerging research area. The literature supports an initial increase in mental health concerns which generally do not reach the threshold for diagnosis with a mental illness, but present to frontline telephone services. There is a potential delay before community and hospital-based mental health services see an increase in new or relapsing mental illness presentations. However vulnerable populations, such as people with pre-existing mental illness, are at increased risk of mental health issues during such public health crises. Many of the general recommendations distilled from the literature are closely aligned with existing strategic frameworks for mental health service provision. However, in review of these frameworks, gaps in the literature become more apparent, such as a failure to include people with lived experience, peer workers, and First Nations People in the COVID-19 mental health response.","Bowman, Candice; Branjerdporn, Grace; Turner, Kathryn; Kamara, Memunatu; Tyagi, Nischal; Delos Reyes, Neil Josen; Stapelberg, Nicolas Jc",Health psychology review,301,20

Almost overnight, providers of prenatal care adopted virtual visits and reduced visit schedules. These changes stood in stark contrast to the 12 to 14 in-person prenatal visit schedule than had been previously recommended for almost a century. As maternity care providers consider what prenatal care delivery changes we should maintain following the acute pandemic, we may gain insight from understanding the evolution of prenatal care delivery guidelines. In this paper, we start by sketching out the relatively unstructured beginnings of prenatal care in the 19th century. Most medical care fell within the domain of laypeople, and childbirth was a central feature of female domestic culture. We explore how early discoveries about ""toxemia"" created the groundwork for future prenatal care interventions, including screening of urine and blood pressure-which in turn created a need for routine prenatal care visits. We then discuss the organization of the medical profession, including the field of obstetrics and gynecology. In the early 20th century, new data increasingly revealed high rates of both infant and maternal mortality, leading to a greater emphasis on prenatal care. These discoveries culminated in the first codification of a prenatal visit schedule in 1930 by the Children's Bureau. Surprisingly, this schedule remained essentially unchanged for almost a century. Through the founding of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, significant technological advancements in laboratory testing and ultrasonography, and even an NIH Task Force call for changes in prenatal care delivery in 1989, prenatal care recommendations continued to be the same as they had been in 1930-monthly visits until 28 weeks, bimonthly visits until 36 weeks, and weekly visits until delivery. But COVID-19 forced us to change, to reconsider both the need for in-person visits and the frequency of visits. Now, as we transition from the acute pandemic, we should consider how to use what we have learned in this unprecedented time to shape future prenatal care. Lessons from over a century of prenatal care provide valuable insights to inform the next generation of prenatal care delivery.","Peahl, Alex F; Howell, Joel",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,301,11

Therefore, we should be ready for a tough and long battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.

Nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is the major structural component of the virion and is involved in viral replication, assembly and immune regulation, plays key roles in the viral life cycle. Here, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains (N-NTD and N-CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 N protein, at 1.8 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures show conserved features from other CoV N proteins. The binding sites targeted by small molecules against HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, which inhibit viral infection by blocking the RNA-binding activity or normal oligomerization of N protein, are relatively conserved in our structure, indicating N protein is a promising drug target. In addition, certain areas of N-NTD and N-CTD display distinct charge distribution patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which may alter the RNA-binding modes. The specific antigenic characteristics are critical for developing specific immune-based rapid diagnostic tests.

Reports of clinical outcomes, cost, and resource utilization differ among inpatient team structures. OBJECTIVE Directly compare outcomes among resident, APC, and solo hospitalist inpatient general medicine teams. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study using multivariable analysis adjusted for time of admission, interhospital transfer, and comorbidities that compares clinical outcomes, cost, and resource utilization. SUBJECTS Patients 18 years or older discharged from an inpatient medicine service between July 2015 and July 2018 (N = 12,716). MAIN MEASURES Length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, inpatient mortality, normalized total direct cost, discharge time, and consultation utilization. KEY RESULTS Resident teams admitted fewer patients at night (32.0%; P < .001) than did APC (49.5%) and hospitalist (48.6%) teams. APCs received nearly 4% more outside transfer patients (P = .015). Hospitalists discharged patients 26 minutes earlier than did residents (mean hours after midnight [95% CI], 14.58 [14.44-14.72] vs 15.02 [14.97-15.08]). Adjusted consult utilization was 15% higher for APCs (adjusted mean consults per admission [95% CI], 1.00 [0.96-1.03]) and 8% higher for residents (0.93 [0.90-0.95]) than it was for hospitalists (0.85 [0.80-0.90]). No differences in LOS, readmission, mortality, or cost were observed between the teams. CONCLUSION We observed similar costs, LOS, 30-day readmission, and mortality among hospitalist, APC, and resident teams. Our results suggest clinical outcomes are not significantly affected by team structure. The addition of APC or hospitalist teams represent safe and effective alternatives to traditional inpatient resident teams.","Johnson, Stacy A; Ciarkowski, Claire E; Lappe, Katie L; Kendrick, David R; Smith, Adrienne; Reddy, Santosh P",Journal of hospital medicine,301,24

In particular, providing emergency care that is equally available in rural areas is an essential part of reducing the urban-rural disparity. The objective of this study was to examine the worsening admission rate among Cambodian emergency patients in a rural area and determine their background characteristics that cause this decline. METHODS To investigate the disparity among patients who visited Sunrise Japan Hospital (SJH), a major general private hospital in the capital, patient data from November 2016 to September 2019 were obtained from the electronic reception patient database. The primary outcome was defined as the proportion of admission patients as an indicator of illness severity. The patients' addresses were classified into 4 areas based on distance from the capital. RESULTS A total of 6167 patients who visited the emergency department at SJH between January 2017 and September 2019 were included in the analysis. The proportion of patients who needed to be hospitalized or transferred increased with the distance from the capital. The proportion of patients who finished consultation decreased with the distance from the capital (P<.01: Chi-square test). The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the admission rate in rural areas was significantly higher only among males as compared to that of the capital in multivariate analyses adjusted for age, time, and season. CONCLUSION The admission rate of emergency patients who visited a private general hospital in Cambodia's capital city increased with distance from the capital city. To improve regional disparity among emergency patients, further research is necessary to identify the issues among emergency patients, especially those who are vulnerable.","Kobashi, Yurie; Cheam, Sophathya; Hayashi, Yoshifumi; Tsubokura, Masaharu; Ly, Veyleang; Noun, Chanmakara; Kozuma, Takehiro; Nit, Buntongyi; Okawada, Manabu",International journal of health policy and management,301,17

We examine four cognitive disorders/conditions that exhibit abnormal patterns of (dis)inhibition in these networks: schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), synaesthesia and Tourette's syndrome (TS), with the goal of understanding why the two phenomena altered reactive aggression and altered cross-modality cluster together in these disorders. Our proposal is that enhanced cross-modality (necessary to support language, in particular metaphoricity) was a result, partly a side-effect, of self-domestication (SD). SD targeted the taming of reactive aggression, but reactive impulses are controlled by the same cortico-subcortical networks that are implicated in cross-modality. We further add that this biological process of SD did not act alone, but was engaged in an intense feedback loop with the cultural emergence of early forms of language/grammar, whose high degree of raw metaphoricity and verbal aggression also contributed to increased brain connectivity and cortical control. Consequently, in conjunction with linguistic expressions serving as approximations/'fossils' of the earliest stages of language, these cognitive disorders/conditions serve as confident proxies of brain changes in language evolution, helping us reconstruct certain crucial aspects of early prehistoric languages and cognition, as well as shed new light on the nature of the disorders.

Methods Eligible patients received open-label infusions of vedolizumab 300 mg intravenous (IV) at weeks 0 and 2 in the induction phase. Patients with clinical response by complete Mayo score at week 6 entered the double-blind maintenance phase and were randomized to vedolizumab 108 mg SC every 2 weeks, placebo, or vedolizumab 300 mg IV every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical remission (complete Mayo score ≤ 2 points; no individual subscore > 1 point) at week 52. Results Of 49 patients who entered the induction phase, 22 out of 49 patients (45%) had clinical response at week 6 and were randomized to vedolizumab 108 mg SC (n = 10), placebo (n = 10), or vedolizumab 300 mg IV (n = 2). At week 52, 4 out of 10 patients (40%) who received vedolizumab SC had clinical remission versus 2 out of 10 patients (20%) who received placebo (difference: 20% [95% confidence interval, -27.9 to 61.8]).

However, research consistently identifies barriers they perceive prevent them from doing this work effectively. These barriers can be system-based (e.g. lack of time or training) or personal/individual. This review of qualitative evidence aims to synthesise the personal barriers that impact HCPs' responses to IPA. METHODS Five databases were searched in March 2020. Studies needed to utilise qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis and be published between 2010 and 2020 in order to qualify for inclusion; however, we considered any type of healthcare setting in any country. Article screening, data extraction and methodological appraisal using a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for qualitative studies were undertaken by at least two independent reviewers. Data analysis drew on Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies conducted in 20 countries informed the final review. A variety of HCPs and settings were represented. Three themes were developed that describe the personal barriers experienced by HCPs: I can't interfere (which describes the belief that IPA is a ""private matter"" and HCPs' fears of causing harm by intervening); I don't have control (highlighting HCPs' frustration when women do not follow their advice); and I won't take responsibility (which illuminates beliefs that addressing IPA should be someone else's job). CONCLUSION This review highlights the need for training to address personal issues in addition to structural or organisational barriers. Education and training for HCPs needs to: encourage reflection on their own values to reinforce their commitment to addressing IPA; teach HCPs to relinquish the need to control outcomes so that they can adopt an advocacy approach; and support HCPs' trust in the critical role they can play in responding. Future research should explore effective ways to do this within the context of complex healthcare organisations.","Tarzia, Laura; Cameron, Jacqui; Watson, Jotara; Fiolet, Renee; Baloch, Surriya; Robertson, Rebecca; Kyei-Onanjiri, Minerva; McKibbin, Gemma; Hegarty, Kelsey",BMC health services research,301,24

Several classes of maintenance drugs have attracted attention because of their potential to affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19. Methods Using claims data on 20% random sample of Part D Medicare enrollees from April to December 2020, we identified patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Using a nested case-control design, non-COVID-19 controls were identified by 1:5 matching on age, race, sex, dual-eligibility status and geographical region. We identified usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, clopidogrel, famotidine and hydroxychloroquine based on Medicare prescription claims data. Using extended Cox regression models with time-varying propensity score adjustment we examined the independent effect of each study drug on contracting COVID-19. For severity of COVID-19, we performed extended Cox regressions on all COVID-19 patients, using COVID-19-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality as outcomes. Covariates included gender, age, race, geographic region, low-income indicator and co-morbidities. To compensate for indication bias related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19, we censored patients who only started on hydroxychloroquine in 2020. Results Up to December 2020, our sample contained 374,229 Medicare patients over 65 who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the COVID-19 patients, 209,208 (55.9%) were on at least one study drug. The three most common study drugs were ACEI 97,872 (26.1%), ARB 83,329 (22.3%) and clopidogrel 38,203 (10.2%). Current users of ACEI, ARB, warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitor and clopidogrel were associated with reduced risk of getting COVID-19 (3-13%), and reduced risk of dying after a COVID-19 diagnosis (8-19%). Famotidine did not show consistent significant effects. Hydroxychloroquine did not show significant effects after censoring of recent starters. Conclusions Maintenance use of ACEI, ARB, warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitor and clopidogrel was associated with reduction in risk of acquiring COVID-19 and dying from it.","Fung, K.

Datasets regarding the United States, the European Union and the five largest emerging healthcare systems (i.e., Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa) were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the WHO Health Expenditure Statistics Repository. All analysis was performed on 2017 data. The results of the analysis showed the number of years lost to disability to be a linear function of life expectancy at birth (male R2 = 0.61;female R2 = 0.47), and per-capita total health expenditure to be an exponential function of the number of years lost to disability (male R2 = 0.60;female R2 = 0.65).

We study the number of deaths, which is more reliable than the number of cases at the onset of the pandemic, during Apr/May 2020. This is while countries started taking measures, so more light will be shed on the root causes of the pandemic rather than on its handling. The analysis is done against a comprehensive list of roughly 3,200 features. We find that globalization is the main contributing cause, followed by calcium intake, economic factors, environmental factors, preventative measures, and others. This analysis was done for 20 different dates and shows that some factors, like calcium, phase in or out over time. We also compute row explainability, i.e. for every country, how much each feature explains the death rate. Finally we also study a series of conditions, e.g. comorbidities, immunization, etc. which have been proposed to explain the pandemic and place them in their proper context. While there are many caveats to this analysis, we believe it sheds light on the possible causes of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Gonnet, G.; Stewart, J.; Lafleur, J.; Keith, S.; McLellan, M.; Jiang-Gorsline, D.; Snider, T.",,301,1

To investigate, we conduct two-sets of algorithmic audits for vaccine misinformation on the search and recommendation algorithms of Amazon -- world's leading e-retailer. First, we systematically audit search-results belonging to vaccine-related search-queries without logging into the platform -- unpersonalized audits. We find 10.47% of search-results promote misinformative health products. We also observe ranking-bias, with Amazon ranking misinformative search-results higher than debunking search-results. Next, we analyze the effects of personalization due to account-history, where history is built progressively by performing various real-world user-actions, such as clicking a product. We find evidence of filter-bubble effect in Amazon's recommendations; accounts performing actions on misinformative products are presented with more misinformation compared to accounts performing actions on neutral and debunking products. Interestingly, once user clicks on a misinformative product, homepage recommendations become more contaminated compared to when user shows an intention to buy that product.","Juneja, Prerna; Mitra, Tanushree",,301,20

Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as “Cluster 5” that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these “Cluster 5” mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.","Ren, Wenlin; Lan, Jun; Ju, Xiaohui; Gong, Mingli; Long, Quanxin; Zhu, Zihui; Yu, Yanying; Wu, Jianping; Zhong, Jin; Zhang, Rong; Fan, Shilong; Zhong, Guocai; Huang, Ailong; Wang, Xinquan; Ding, Qiang",bioRxiv,301,20

A totally laparoscopic procedure with intracorporeal anastomosis may improve cosmesis because midline- or paraumbilical incisions can be avoided. Here, we investigate the safety of an intracorporeal anastomosis from a technical and oncological perspective. METHODS All patients who underwent right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis between 2003-2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Parameters were duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, mortality and morbidity. Adequacy of oncologic resections was scored by resectional margins and number of harvested lymph nodes. RESULTS A total of 162 patients were included with a median age of 69 years (IQR60-76). The duration of surgery was 100 minutes (80-120) and intraoperative blood loss was 30 mL (10-100). Hundred-twenty patients (74%) underwent an oncologic resection. Number of harvested lymph nodes was 12 (9-18). RO-resection was achieved in 100%. Four patients died (2.5%). Postoperative complications were: anastomotic leakage (3.1%; n = 5), ileus (4.9%; n = 8), abscesses (2.5% ; n = 4), wound infection (3.1% ; n = 5) and cardiopulmonary complications (10.5% ; n = 17). Duration of oncological follow-up was 2.5 years (1.3-4.6). Local recurrence and overall survival rates at two years were 0.8% and 85.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION Right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis is a technically and oncologically safe procedure with acceptable operating time and low mortality.","Kornmann, V N N; Hagendoorn, J; van Koeverden, S; van Ramshorst, B; Smits, A B",Acta chirurgica Belgica,301,12

METHODS TTH48 is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, assessor-blinded, randomised, controlled superiority trial of 24 and 48 hours of TTM at 33 (±1) ° C performed in 355 comatose OHCA patients aged 18 to 80 years who were admitted to ten intensive care units (ICUs) in six Northern European countries. The primary outcome of the study is the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score observed at six months after cardiac arrest. CPC scores of 1 and 2 are defined as good neurological outcomes, and CPC scores of 3, 4 and 5 are defined as poor neurological outcomes. The secondary outcomes are as follows: mortality within six months after cardiac arrest, CPC at hospital discharge, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on day 4, length of stay in ICU and at hospital and the presence of any adverse events such as cerebral, circulatory, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, metabolic measures, infection or bleeding. With the planned sample size, we have 80% power to detect a 15% improvement in good neurological outcomes at a two-sided statistical significance level of 5%. DISCUSSION We present a detailed statistical analysis protocol (SAP) that specifies how primary and secondary outcomes should be evaluated. We also predetermine covariates for adjusted analyses and pre-specify sub-groups for sensitivity analyses. This pre-planned SAP will reduce analysis bias and add validity to the findings of this trial on the effect of length of TTM on important clinical outcomes after cardiac arrest.

The agent responsible for scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi ) has been removed from the genus Rickettsia and a bewildering array of new rickettsial pathogens have been described. An update of recent research findings is therefore particularly timely for the nonspecialist physician. RECENT FINDINGS An estimated one billion people are at risk for scrub typhus and an estimated one million cases occur annually. The disease appears to be re-emerging in Japan, with seasonal transmission. O. tsutsugamushi has evolved a variety of mechanisms to remain viable in its intracellular habitat. Slowing the release of intracellular calcium inhibits apoptosis of macrophages. Subsets of chemokine genes are induced in infected cells, some in response to transcription factor activator protein 1. Cardiac involvement is uncommon and clinical complications are predominantly pulmonary. Serious pneumonitis occurred in 22% of Chinese patients. Dual infections with leptospirosis have been reported. Standardized diagnostic tests are being developed and attempts to improve treatment of women and children are being made. Of the numerous tick-borne rickettsioses identified in recent years, African tick-bite fever appears to be of particular importance to travellers. The newly described flea-borne spotted fever caused by Rickettsia felis may be global in distribution. SUMMARY Rash and fever in a returning traveler could be rickettsial and presumptive doxycycline treatment can be curative. Recent research findings raise more questions than answers and should stimulate much needed research.","Watt, George; Parola, Philippe",Current opinion in infectious diseases,301,9

This infectious disease results in significant losses in the farming industry and therefore effective therapeutic agents are needed to control outbreaks caused by this pathogen. Thus, accurate methods to test new antiviral compounds need to be developed. Our goal was to establish a model system for testing novel antivirals with potential applications to aquaculture. In a previous study, a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was designed to detect and quantitate VHSV in rainbow trout tissues [Chico, V., Gomez, N., Estepa, A., Perez, L., 2006. Rapid detection and quantitation of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in experimentally challenged rainbow trout by real-time RT-PCR. J. Virol. Methods 132, 154-159]. In this report, we applied the real-time RT-PCR assay to the evaluation of the inhibitory effect of ribavirin, a well-known broad spectrum antiviral drug, in a cell culture system. When added from the beginning of the infection, ribavirin caused a dose-dependent reduction of VHSV RNA accumulation. Real-time RT-PCR measurements showed 99.8% inhibition at 25 microg/ml ribavirin, with an IC50 of 0.43 microg/ml. Ribavirin maintained its inhibitory activity against VHSV when added at 6 h post-infection. Quantitation of N protein messenger RNA and plus-stranded RNA showed a substantial decrease of viral transcription in ribavirin-treated cells. Partial reversion of the effect of ribavirin by addition of GTP was observed, confirming that ribavirin targets the synthesis of guanidine nucleotides in the cells. This is the first report of a real-time PCR-based assay for addressing the efficacy and mechanism of action of an antiviral agent for rainbow trout.","Marroquí, Laura; Estepa, Amparo; Perez, Luis",Veterinary microbiology,301,11

Complexes consisting of the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins were identified in cells infected with MHV-A59 or BCV. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that S and M quickly associated after translation, and suggested that both initially interacted in a pre-Golgi site. In addition, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) was identified as part of a complex with M and S in BCV infected cells. Taken together, our data indicate that similar glycoprotein complexes are present in cells infected with two different coronaviruses, and thus likely represent important prerequisite complexes involved in virus assembly.","Nguyen, V P; Hogue, B G",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,301,30

Airway epithelia may initiate and amplify inflammation in response to these attacks, but under certain conditions confinement of inflammation to the airway lumen may be beneficial to the host. Accordingly, we hypothesized that airway epithelial polarity allows different responses to basolateral vs apical stimuli that may modulate inflammation. Using primary human airway epithelial cells differentiated at an air-liquid interface in culture, we found that responses to several cytokines required basolateral mediator application. In contrast, responses to Haemophilus influenzae occurred after either basolateral or apical interaction with airway epithelia. Experiments focused on IFN-gamma receptor polarity confirmed its predominant basolateral location in cultured airway epithelia as well as in normal human airway tissue. Furthermore, physical and pharmacologic disruption of barrier function in airway epithelia allowed responses to apical application of IFN-gamma and other cytokines. These in vitro studies directly correlated with experiments in mice in which an airway epithelial response to IFN-gamma injected into the airway lumen was seen only after disruption of barrier function. The results indicate that airway epithelia with intact barrier function restrict inflammatory responses by limitation of cell activation through requiring interaction of selected mediators with the basolateral surface. However, loss of barrier integrity allows epithelial responses to these mediators if located in the airway lumen to amplify airway defenses.","Humlicek, Alicia L; Manzel, Lori J; Chin, Cecilia L; Shi, Lei; Excoffon, Katherine J D A; Winter, Michael C; Shasby, D Michael; Look, Dwight C",Journal of immunology,301,24

To evaluate the effect of hormone therapy on clinical outcomes among women, subgroup analyses using age-matched case-control data were performed. RESULTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 was most prevalent in women in the 20-39 years age group (1,250 [44.14%]). Men were more likely to receive oxygen therapy (144 [6.46%] vs 131 [4.63%], Pâ=â0.004), be admitted to the intensive care unit (60 [2.69%] vs 53 [1.87%], Pâ=â0.049), and have a longer length of stay after admission to the intensive care unit (19.70 ± 11.80 vs 14.75â±â9.23, Pâ=â0.016).

The safety and efficacy of OLNP-06 were evaluated in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group comparative clinical study in subjects with functional dyspepsia (FD). Significant improvements in clinical endpoints were observed during the trial along with excellent safety profile. Fifty subjects aged between 18 and 55 years suffering from FD as per ROME III criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomized into two treatment groups, one group received OLNP-06, 200 mg twice daily and other group received placebo 200 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy end point was global assessment of overall treatment efficacy (OTE). Secondary efficacy endpoints were elimination rate of three major symptoms (postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiation) and elimination rate for each individual symptom scores. Biochemical and hematological parameters including urine analysis were performed to evaluate the safety of OLNP-06. Out of 50 subjects, 48subjects completed the study. Total 79% of the subjects receiving OLNP-06 and 21% of the subjects receiving placebo (p < .05) were classified as responders according to the assessment of OTE. Elimination rate (score 0) of postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiation was 64% in subjects receiving ONLP-06 compared with 13% in the placebo group (p < .05). OLNP-06 was found to be safe and well tolerated as there was no incidence of treatment-related AE's. Supplementation of OLNP-06 for 4 weeks significantly reduced dyspeptic symptoms in subjects suffering from FD.

In severe cases, it affects intraoperative renal arterial anastomosis and increases the risk of postanastomosis complications. At present, safe and efficient vascular replacement methods are relatively limited. In the 2 renal transplant cases at our center, described here, the donors' iliac arteries were unavailable. We therefore attempted to replace the recipients' diseased external iliac artery with the donors' inferior vena cava and then performed an end-to-side grafting with the attachment in arterial reconstruction. One patient received a single kidney transplantation, while the other received a dual kidney transplantation. Antiplatelet/anticoagulation drug application was avoided, and both patients were observed for more than 6 months. Stable renal graft function was achieved without any vascular complications. During this study, all procedures were in compliance with the Helsinki Congress and the Declaration of Istanbul. For end-stage renal disease patients with severe iliac atherosclerosis who are waiting for kidney transplantation, a donor's vena cava graft could potentially be a promising replacement option to restore external iliac artery patency and reconstruct renal blood flow, without the necessity of harvesting a recipient's autologous vessels or looking for costly artificial ones.","Xie, Liangbo; Zeng, Xianpeng; Xia, Qiuxiang; Peng, Jingtao; Liu, Fangning; Chen, Jing; Liu, Jiali; Xiao, Xiong; Liu, Jing; Li, Heng; Wang, Zhendi",Transplant. proc,301,29

Due to the close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, their main proteases share many structural and functional features. Thus, these drugs are also regarded as potential drug candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at the atomic-level is unknown. In the present study, we revealed key interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and three drug candidates by performing pharmacophore modeling and 1 µs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. His41, Gly143, and Glu166 formed interactions with the functional groups that were common among peptide-like inhibitors in all MD simulations.

Exposure to contaminated surfaces is one of the main routes of respiratory diseases transmission. Therefore, it is very important for epidemic prevention and control to study the law of virus decay and the environmental coupling effect on various surfaces. Based on the analysis of the influencing mechanism, a large amount of experimental evidence on the survival of viruses on the surface of objects were excavated in this paper, and the effects of various factors, such as surface peripheral temperature, relative humidity, virus-containing droplet volume, surface materials and virus types, on the decay rate constants of viruses were comprehensively analyzed. It was found that although the experimental methods, virus types and experimental conditions varied widely in different experiments, the virus concentrations on the surface of objects all followed the exponential decay law, and the coupling effect of various factors was reflected in the decay rate constant k. Under different experimental conditions, k values ranged from 0.001 to 100 h-1, with a difference of 5 orders of magnitude, corresponding to the characteristic time t99 between 500 and 0.1 h when the virus concentration decreased by 99%. This indicates a large variation in the risk of virus transmission in different scenarios. By revealing the common law and individuality of the virus decay on the surface of objects, the essential relationship between the experimental observation phenomenon and virus decay was analyzed. This paper points out the huge difference in virus transmission risk on the surface at different time nodes, and discusses the prevention and control strategies to grasp the main contradictions in the different situations.","Guo, Luyao; Yang, Zhao; Guo, Lei; Chen, Linlin; Cheng, Zhu; Zhang, Li; Long, Enshen",Environ Res,301,14

This has been primarily managed by dramatically reducing in- and outpatient services for other diseases and implementing infection prevention and control measures. The impact of the pandemic on nuclear medicine departments and their services has not yet been established. The aim of this online survey was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine departments. Methods: A web-based questionnaire, made available from April 16 to May 3, 2020, was designed to determine the impact of the pandemic on in- and outpatient nuclear medicine departments, including the number of procedures, employee health, availability of radiotracers and other essential supplies, and availability of personal protective equipment. The survey also inquired about operational aspects and types of facilities as well as other challenges. Results: A total of 434 responses from 72 countries were registered and analyzed. Respondents reported an average decline of 54% in diagnostic procedures. PET/CT scans decreased by an average of 36%, whereas sentinel lymph-node procedures decreased by 45%, lung scans by 56%, bone scans by 60%, myocardial studies by 66%, and thyroid studies by 67%. Of all participating centers, 81% performed radionuclide therapies, and they reported a reduction of 45% on average in the last 4 wk, ranging from over 76% in Latin America and South East Asia to 16% in South Korea and Singapore. Survey results showed that 52% of participating sites limited their 99mTc/99Mo generator purchases, and 12% of them temporarily cancelled orders. Insufficient supplies of essential materials (radioisotopes, generators, and kits) were reported, especially for 99mTc/99Mo generators and 131I, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Conclusion: Both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures declined precipitously, with countries worldwide being affected by the pandemic to a similar degree. Countries that were in the postpeak phase of the pandemic when they responded to the survey, such as South Korea and Singapore, reported a less pronounced impact on nuclear medicine services; however, the overall results of the survey showed that nuclear medicine services worldwide had been significantly impacted. In relation to staff health, 15% of respondents experienced COVID-19 infections within their own departments.","Freudenberg, Lutz S; Paez, Diana; Giammarile, Francesco; Cerci, Juliano; Modiselle, Moshe; Pascual, Thomas N B; El-Haj, Noura; Orellana, Pilar; Pynda, Yaroslav; Carrió, Ignasi; Fanti, Stefano; Matushita, Cristina; Herrmann, Ken",J Nucl Med,301,12

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019-2020 corona virus pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. COVID-19 patients currently remain the primary source of infection. An epidemiological survey indicated that the general population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. Fever is the most common symptom, although older people and those with comorbidities may experience fever later in the disease. Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages. Some cases might progress promptly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ function failure. Asymptomatic carriers and those in the incubation period may also be infectious.Aim. To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19 at the screening clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan.Methodology. In this descriptive study, we analysed data of patients presenting to a newly established Covid-19 screening clinic in Rehman Medical Institute. Anyone who reported with new onset fever and/or cough was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the screening clinic. We documented and analysed demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, which included age, sex, travel history, clinical features, comorbidities and laboratory data of patients confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan from 15 March till 21 April 2020. Paired specimens of throat swabs and nasal swabs were obtained from 845 patients, ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR assay.Results. A total of 845 specimens were taken as described above. The positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 14.3%. Male and older population had a significantly higher positive rate. Of the 121 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 43.19 years (sd, 17.57) and the infections were more frequent among male gender accounting for 85 (70.25â%) patients. Common symptoms included fever (88 patients, 72â%), cough (72 patients, 59.5â%) and shortness of breath (69 patients, 57â%). Twenty-two (18â%) patients had recent travel history outside Pakistan in the previous 14 days, the majority of whom had returned back from Saudi Arabia.Conclusion. In this single-centre, prospective, descriptive study, fever, cough and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Old age (>50 years), chronic underlying comorbidities and travel history may be risk factors. Therefore, we concluded that viral nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in a screening clinic, which helped with isolation and cohorting of these patients.","Khan, Maria; Khan, Haris; Khan, Shehriyar; Nawaz, Maimoona",J Med Microbiol,301,20

To study the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and to assess the diagnostic performances of eight serological assays, we used 129 serum samples collected on known days post symptom onset (dpso) from 42 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 54 serum samples from healthy blood donors, and children infected with seasonal coronaviruses. The sera were analyzed for the presence of IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence testing (IIFT) based on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. They were further tested for antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (IgG, IgA) and against the viral nucleocapsid protein (IgG, IgM) using ELISAs. The assay specificities were 94.4%-100%. The sensitivities varied largely between assays, reflecting their respective purposes. The sensitivities of IgA and IgM assays were highest between 11 and 20 dpso, whereas the sensitivities of IgG assays peaked between 20 and 60 dpso. IIFT showed highest sensitivities due to the use of the whole SARS-CoV-2 as substrate and provided information on whether or not the individual has been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the current analysis, we searched for SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the human genome. To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b (open reading frames) gene. The SARS-CoV-2 human sequence lies within non-structural proteins 14 and 15 (NSP14 and NSP15), and is quite close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904-base pair sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and internalization of the complex by the host cell. It is probably no accident that a sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b gene is found in the human NTNG1 gene, implicated in schizophrenia, and that haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, may also be a treatment for COVID-19. We suggest, therefore, that it is important to investigate other haloperidol analogs. Among them are benperidol, bromperidol, bromperidol decanoate, droperidol, seperidol hydrochloride, and trifluperidol. These analogs might be valuable in the treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.","Lehrer, Steven; Rheinstein, Peter H",In Vivo,301,5

The purpose of this paper is to urge public health and medical professionals not to forget the importance of physical activity to whole-person health, recognize the importance of physical activity as a potential COVID-19 mitigation strategy and to serve as advocates for promoting active lifestyles. It is imperative that the national call for physical distancing not be interpreted as a call for physical inactivity.","Meyer, Stefanie M; Landry, Matthew J; Gustat, Jeanette; Lemon, Stephenie C; Webster, Collin A",Transl Behav Med,301,27

The great majority of COVID-19 patients (>90%) requiring ECMO have been supported using venovenous (V-V) ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While COVID-19 ECMO run duration may be longer than in non-COVID-19 ECMO patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups. However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing. Conventional selection criteria for COVID-19-related ECMO should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented. Formation of regional ECMO referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile ECMO retrieval. There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional ECMO device or patient management when applying ECMO for COVID-19 patients. Rarely, children may require ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard. We strongly encourage participation in data submission to investigate the optimal use of ECMO for COVID-19.","Badulak, Jenelle; Antonini, M Velia; Stead, Christine M; Shekerdemian, Lara; Raman, Lakshmi; Paden, Matthew L; Agerstrand, Cara; Bartlett, Robert H; Barrett, Nicholas; Combes, Alain; Lorusso, Roberto; Mueller, Thomas; Ogino, Mark T; Peek, Giles; Pellegrino, Vincent; Rabie, Ahmed A; Salazar, Leonardo; Schmidt, Matthieu; Shekar, Kiran; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel",ASAIO J,301,30

METHODS: This comparative study included COVID-19 patients diagnosed by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based test at our hospital with mild to moderate disease. The demographic details and detailed clinical history of the patient, including history of loss of smell and taste was taken at the time of presentation. The patients were divided into 2 groups, group A: COVID-19 patients with OTD; group B: COVID-19 patients without OTD. 100 contiguous patients were recruited in each group. The COVID-19 test by RT-PCR was done and Ct value of the 3 genes: E (Envelope encoding) gene, N (Nucleocapsid encoding) gene, and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene, was used for data analysis. The Ct values of each of the three genes were compared between groups A and B. RESULTS: Group A and B did not differ significantly in terms of basic demographics. The differences in the Ct values of the 3 genes E gene, N gene and RdRp gene, of group A and B were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.005, p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: The patients with OTD had a lower Ct value at diagnosis, and hence, a higher viral load than those without OTD. The evaluation of Ct value and viral load in COVID-19 patients may help in further reducing the transmission of the virus in the community.","Jain, Avani; Pandey, A K; Kaur, Jasleen; Kumar, Lakshit; Singh, Mitasha; Das, Suman; Purohit, Sandeep",Am J Otolaryngol,301,16

However, it is a very challenging and severely ill-posed problem. In consequence, even the most accurate state-of-the-art approaches have significant limitations. Purely kinematic formulations on the basis of individual joints or skeletons, and the frequent frame-wise reconstruction in state-of-the-art methods greatly limit 3D accuracy and temporal stability compared to multi-view or marker-based motion capture. Further, captured 3D poses are often physically incorrect and biomechanically implausible, or exhibit implausible environment interactions (floor penetration, foot skating, unnatural body leaning and strong shifting in depth), which is problematic for any use case in computer graphics. We, therefore, present PhysCap, the first algorithm for physically plausible, real-time and marker-less human 3D motion capture with a single colour camera at 25 fps. Our algorithm first captures 3D human poses purely kinematically. To this end, a CNN infers 2D and 3D joint positions, and subsequently, an inverse kinematics step finds space-time coherent joint angles and global 3D pose. Next, these kinematic reconstructions are used as constraints in a real-time physics-based pose optimiser that accounts for environment constraints (e.g., collision handling and floor placement), gravity, and biophysical plausibility of human postures. Our approach employs a combination of ground reaction force and residual force for plausible root control, and uses a trained neural network to detect foot contact events in images. Our method captures physically plausible and temporally stable global 3D human motion, without physically implausible postures, floor penetrations or foot skating, from video in real time and in general scenes.

METHODS: Patients' data were obtained from medical records of the clinical chart of dell'Angelo Hospital, Venice, Italy. RESULTS: The first patient is a 42-year-old male patient who developed, 10 days after the resolution of coronavirus-2 pneumonia and intensive care unit hospitalization with hyperactive delirium, a cranial multineuritis with asymmetric distribution (bilateral hypoglossus involvement and right Claude Bernard Horner syndrome). No albumin-cytologic dissociation was found in cerebrospinal fluid; severe bilateral denervation was detected in hypoglossus nerve, with normal EMG of other cranial muscles, blink reflex, and cerebral magnetic resonance with gadolinium. He presented a striking improvement after intravenous human immunoglobulin therapy. The second case is a 67-year-old male patient who developed a cranial neuritis (left hypoglossus paresis), with dyslalia and deglutition difficulties. He had cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities (albumin-cytologic dissociation), no involvement of ninth and 10th cranial nerves, diffuse hyporeflexia, and brachial diparesis. DISCUSSION: Cranial neuritis is a possible neurological manifestation of coronavirus-2 pneumonia. Etiology is not clear: it is possible a direct injury of the nervous structures by the virus through olfactory nasopharyngeal terminations. However, the presence of albumin-cytological dissociation in one patient, the sparing of the sense of smell, and the response to human immunoglobulin therapy suggests an immune-mediated genesis of the disorder.","De Gennaro, R; Gastaldo, E; Tamborino, C; Baraldo, M; Casula, N; Pedrali, M; Iovino, S; Michieletto, L; Violo, T; Ganzerla, B; Martinello, I; Quatrale, R",Neurol. sci,301,26

Besides the epidemics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease already faced by South Asian countries, recent studies suggest that South Asians may also be at an increased risk of heart failure (HF), and that it presents at earlier ages than in most other racial/ethnic groups. Although a frequently underrecognized threat, an eventual HF epidemic in the densely populated South Asian nations could have dramatic health, social and economic consequences, and urgent interventions are needed to flatten the curve of HF in South Asia. In this review, we discuss recent studies portraying these trends, and describe the mechanisms that may explain an increased risk of premature HF in South Asians compared with other groups, with a special focus on highly relevant features in South Asian populations including premature coronary heart disease, early type 2 diabetes mellitus, ubiquitous abdominal obesity, exposure to the world's highest levels of air pollution, highly prevalent pretransition forms of HF such as rheumatic heart disease, and underdevelopment of healthcare systems. Other rising lifestyle-related risk factors such as use of tobacco products, hypertension, and general obesity are also discussed. We evaluate the prognosis of HF in South Asian countries and the implications of an anticipated HF epidemic. Finally, we discuss proposed interventions aimed at curbing these adverse trends, management approaches that can improve the prognosis of prevalent HF in South Asian countries, and research gaps in this important field.","Martinez-Amezcua, Pablo; Haque, Waqas; Khera, Rohan; Kanaya, Alka M; Sattar, Naveed; Lam, Carolyn S P; Harikrishnan, Sivadasanpillai; Shah, Sanjiv J; Kandula, Namratha R; Jose, Powell O; Narayan, K M Venkat; Agyemang, Charles; Misra, Anoop; Jenum, Anne K; Bilal, Usama; Nasir, Khurram; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel",Circ Heart Fail,301,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design: Our study involves 30 patients, who had undergone different orthodontic therapies in a traditional way, and that the clinician continued to follow by means of tele-orthodontics. Given the obvious limitations of tele-practice, a comparison with patients who did not undergo any follow-up or underwent only in-office follow-ups could not be possible. The communication tools used in our study and proposed in our model of tele-orthodontics are videocalls, dedicated applications, intraoral and extraoral photos taken by the patients and instant messaging. RESULTS: Tele-orthodontics allowed to perform some orthodontic follow-ups with less chairside time, reduced time spent by the patients in the dental office from up to 45 min, less risk of infection, fewer to no missed appointments, specific troubleshooting solutions, and more follow-ups with odontophobic patients. Overall, tele-orthodontics balanced the disadvantages of less personal contacts and in-office visits. CONCLUSIONS: The need to respect safety distance and the fears patients have about the risk of infection make tele-orthodontics a fundamental tool during a pandemic lockdown and in its immediate post-emergency phase. Tele-orthodontics demonstrated to be a viable tool to continue at least some orthodontic care in times of emergency, but it may be considered an appropriate solution and addition even in normal times to ease therapy demands for both the orthodontist and the patient, while reducing time and money spent, without an excessive decrease in orthodontic quality.","Saccomanno, S; Quinzi, V; Sarhan, S; Laganà, D; Marzo, G",Eur J Paediatr Dent,301,1

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with an unfavourable outcome in this population. DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive, monocentric study conducted in the surgical ICU of a French university hospital. METHODS: Patients aged &#8805;75 years admitted in the surgical ICU for a predicted length of stay &#8805;48 hours were included. Patients received an initial and a 6-months nutritional and functional assessment performed by physicians and nurses. The outcome was considered as favourable if the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) variation (ADL delta = 6-months ADL - ICU admission ADL) was between 0 and -0.5 point 6 months after ICU discharge and unfavourable if the ADL delta decreased by more than 0.5 points or if the patient had died 6 months after ICU discharge. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients-32 (57%) male-aged 79 [77; 83] y were included. ICU mortality was 19%; 6-month mortality was 22%. Median ADL delta was -0.5 [-0.5-0] points. A low ADL score (P = .0438) and a low albumin level (P = .0213) at admission were the two independent factors associated with an unfavourable outcome. CONCLUSION: Mortality and loss of independence were high in this elderly population during and after their surgical ICU stay. The benefit of a systematic collaboration between intensive care specialists, ICU nurses, and geriatricians, to assess and manage nutritional and functional problems and to prevent a pejorative outcome in patients over 75 years old admitted in surgical ICU needs to be studied.

The consequences may be fatal, or result in lasting downstream organ damage. Therefore, assessment of endogenous fibrinolytic status in an individual may identify those at risk of occlusive thrombus formation and provide prognostic information. Arterial thrombi are more platelet-rich and more resistant to fibrinolysis than venous thrombi. Several recent studies using global tests of fibrinolysis in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have shown that despite dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with impaired fibrinolytic status have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, compared to those with effective fibrinolytic function. Such data add significantly to the predictive value of established cardiovascular risk factors and conventional biomarkers. Most data reported have been obtained with the Global Thrombosis Test and the turbidimetric plasma clot lysis assay. A few small studies in patients with ischaemic stroke suggest a similar predictive role of fibrinolytic status assessment in these patients. Studies reporting an association between impaired fibrinolysis and future venous thrombotic events are limited, and in the form of case-control studies. Viscoelastic assays may have a role in the prediction of venous thromboembolic risk. Assays of fibrinolytic function should be used to obtain a more accurate risk of future thrombotic events, particularly in the setting of ACS. The availability of point-of-care tests helps facilitate this and should encourage future studies to assess personalised antithrombotic treatment combinations to optimise fibrinolytic status and reduce thrombosis risk.","Kanji, Rahim; Kubica, Jacek; Navarese, Eliano P; Gorog, Diana A",Eur J Clin Invest,301,9

One of these factors is the Large subunit GTPase 1 (Lsg1), a protein that acts as the release factor for the export adaptor named Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay 3 protein (Nmd3) and facilitates the incorporation of the last structural protein uL16 into the 60S subunit. Here, we characterised the recombinant yeast Lsg1 and studied its catalysis and binding properties for guanine nucleotides. We described the interaction of Lsg1 with guanine nucleotides alone and in the presence of the complex Nmd3â¢60S using fluorescence spectroscopy. Lsg1 has a greater affinity for GTP than for GDP suggesting that in the cell cytoplasm it exists mainly bound to the former. In the presence of 60S subunits loaded with Nmd3, the affinity of Lsg1 for both nucleotides increases but to a larger extent towards GTP. From this observation together with the excess of GTP present in the cytoplasm of exponentially growing cells over that of GDP, we can infer that the pre-ribosomal particle composed by Nmd3â¢60S acts as a GTP Stabilising Factor for Lsg1. Additionally, Lsg1 undergoes different conformational changes depending on its binding partner or the guanine nucleotides it interacts with. Steady-state kinetic analysis of free Lsg1 indicated slow GTP hydrolysis with values of kcat 1â¯min-1 and Km of 34â¯µM.","Jaramillo-Ramírez, Juliana; Marcial-Bazaldua, Nancy; Sánchez-Puig, Nuria",Biochim Biophys Acta Proteins Proteom,301,23

The pandemic has significantly increased the amount of time many children spend on YouTube-watching videos for both entertainment and education. However, it is unclear how children conceptualize the people they see on YouTube. Prior to the pandemic, children 3-8 years old (N = 117) were recruited to participate. Children were told that they would see pictures taken from videos and answer questions about them. Children saw three physical photos with the same image of a man and a bird and were told that the photo was (a) from a video on the experimenter's phone, (b) from a video on television, or (c) from a video on YouTube. They were asked whether the person in the photo was real or not real, which video would be best for learning, and which video they would prefer to watch. Findings indicated that children were marginally less likely to believe that people on YouTube are real than people in a video on a phone, with no difference between beliefs about people on YouTube and television. Notably, these beliefs were similar across the age range tested here. Across all ages, children preferred to watch YouTube more than phone videos and believed that YouTube possessed greater educational value than both phone and television videos.","Hassinger-Das, Brenna; Dore, Rebecca A; Aloisi, Katherine; Hossain, Maruf; Pearce, Madeleine; Paterra, Mark",Front Psychol,301,1

The files of patients who underwent open cholecystectomy operations during the same period were also examined. The demographic data, medical history, operation notes and reasons of conversion were evaluated. RESULTS: The total number of patients who were initiated a laparoscopic operation but converted to open cholecystectomy was 28 (2.28%). A total of 89 patients underwent open cholecystectomy including converted cases. In the regression analysis age, adhesions, edema in the gallbladder, bleeding, previous scar tissue were found to be significantly related to conversion, while sex and higher BMI were not.

Current research is promoting the circulating protein role as a systemic inflammatory marker. However, most studies report serum calprotectin analysis although plasma assay prevents its massive release by granulocytes. In this perspective, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserves deployment of convenient and easy-to-dose markers that could reliably address the state of infection. METHODS: We analyzed serum circulating calprotectin (cCLP) levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and plasma cCLP levels from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, then assessed negative or positive on molecular tests. RESULTS: Our results confirm a significant circulating calprotectin increase in infected subjects respect to controls, in serum and plasma. Moreover, plasma calprotectin has higher levels in suspected patients with positive SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR, compared to suspected patients with negative SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR. Furthermore, ROC curves results showed the circulating plasma calprotectin discriminatory ability to differentiate infected SARS-CoV-2 patients at a cutoff value greater than 131.3 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Our data propose circulating calprotectin as a new, quantitative and predictive marker, which in addition to being an interesting generic inflammatory marker may provide important indications in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cherubini, Fabio; Cristiano, Antonio; Valentini, Alessandra; Bernardini, Sergio; Nuccetelli, Marzia",Inflamm. res,301,27

The current study was focused on the development of a single chiral method uisng supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) for separation of stereoisomers of TDF and 3TC combination employing design of experiment (DoE) approach. Method development was planned in three steps by using different experimental designs for each step. I-optimal, Taguchi orthogonal array and face-centred central composite designs (CCD) were employed for primary parameter selection, secondary parameter screening and final method optimization, respectively. All six stereoisomers were separated in a 10 minute run on Chiralpak IA column with carbon di-oxide /methanol (containing 0.5 % v/v n-butylamine) as mobile phase at 1.5 mL/min in gradient mode. The optimized method was verified for performance through establishing specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, limit of quantification, and solution stability.

Timely gathering of information on this topic can provide valuable insight and improve the handling of the ongoing and future pandemic outbreaks. Methods and Results A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via e-mail, text messaging, WhatsApp, and social media to interventional cardiologists between April 6, 2020, and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the United States (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart, and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protective equipment was available to 95% of respondents; however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70%, and 74% indicated absence of coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patient, primarily because of fear of viral transmission (88%). Although the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%), and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss. Conclusions Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission. There is near universal adoption of personal protective equipment; however, coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting and access to FIT-tested N95 masks is suboptimal. Although there is concern over impending financial loss, substantial engagement in telemedicine and online education is reported.","Banerjee, Subhash; Tarantini, Giuseppe; Abu-Fadel, Mazen; Banerjee, Avantika; Little, Bertis B; Sorajja, Paul; Shishehbor, Mehdi H; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",J Am Heart Assoc,301,16

POC tests have the intrinsic advantage of being able to be performed near the patient or treatment facility, owing to their portable character. With rapid results often in minutes, these diagnostic platforms have a high positive impact on disease management. POC tests are, in addition, advantageous in situations of a shortage of skilled personnel and restricted availability of laboratory-based analytics. While POC testing programs are widely considered in addressing health care challenges in low-income health systems, the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections could largely benefit from fast, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective point-of-care testing (POCT) devices for limiting COVID-19 spreading. The unrestrained availability of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests is indeed one of the adequate means of better managing the COVID-19 outbreak. A large number of novel and innovative solutions to address this medical need have emerged over the last months.

Here we introduce a fragment-based docking method and test if it reduces requirements on the accuracy of an input receptor structures relative to non-fragment docking approaches. In this method, small rigid fragments are docked first using AutoDock Vina to generate a large number of favorably docked poses spanning the receptor binding pocket. Then a graph theory maximum clique algorithm is applied to find combined sets of docked poses of different fragment types onto which the complete ligand can be properly aligned. On the basis of these alignments, possible binding poses of complete ligand are determined. This docking method is first tested for bound docking on a series of Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme-substrate complexes, in which experimentally determined receptor structures are used. For all complexes tested, ligand poses of less than 1 Å root mean square deviations (RMSD) from the actual binding positions can be recovered. Then the method is tested for unbound docking with modeled receptor structures for a number of protein-ligand complexes from different families including the very recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protease. For all complexes, poses with RMSD less than 3 Å from actual binding positions can be recovered. Our results suggest that for docking with approximately modeled receptor structures, fragment-based methods can be more effective than common complete ligand docking approaches.","Sarfaraz, Sara; Muneer, Iqra; Liu, Haiyan",J Comput Aided Mol Des,301,29

However, few large-scale and no cross-national studies have been conducted to date that investigate modifiable pandemic-related behavioral or cognitive factors that may influence mental health in this vulnerable group. This international study sought to identify and measure the associations between pandemic-related information seeking, worries, and prevention behaviors on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant and postpartum women was conducted in 64 countries between May 26, 2020 and June 13, 2020. The survey, available in twelve languages, was hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies (https://corona.pregistry.com) and advertised in social media channels and online parenting forums. Participants completed measures on demographics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, information seeking, COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and mental health symptoms including posttraumatic stress via the IES-6, anxiety/depression via the PHQ-4, and loneliness via the UCLA-3. Of the 6,894 participants, substantial proportions of women scored at or above the cut-offs for elevated posttraumatic stress (2,979 [43%]), anxiety/depression (2,138 [31%], and loneliness (3,691 [53%]). Information seeking from any source (e.g., social media, news, talking to others) five or more times per day was associated with more than twice the odds of elevated posttraumatic stress and anxiety/depression, in adjusted models. A majority of women (86%) reported being somewhat or very worried about COVID-19. The most commonly reported worries were related to pregnancy and delivery, including family being unable to visit after delivery (59%), the baby contracting COVID-19 (59%), lack of a support person during delivery (55%), and COVID-19 causing changes to the delivery plan (41%). Greater worries related to children (i.e., inadequate childcare, their infection risk) and missing medical appointments were associated with significantly higher odds of posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression and loneliness. Engaging in hygiene-related COVID-19 prevention behaviors (face mask-wearing, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces) were not related to mental health symptoms or loneliness. Elevated posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression, and loneliness are highly prevalent in pregnant and postpartum women across 64 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive information seeking and worries related to children and medical care are associated with elevated symptoms, whereas engaging in hygiene-related preventive measures were not. In addition to screening and monitoring mental health symptoms, addressing excessive information seeking and women's worries about access to medical care and their children's well-being, and developing strategies to target loneliness (e.g., online support groups) should be part of intervention efforts for perinatal women.

We calibrate our model with data on cumulative detected infections and deaths from the Robert-Koch Institute and demonstrate how the model can be used to obtain county- or even city-level estimates on the number of new infections, hospitality rates and demands on intensive care units.

Methods: A total of 1790 nurses participated in the study and completed the questionnaire. Demographic data and related scales of PTG, post-traumatic stress disorder, coping style, social support, and self-efficacy were collected online. Through univariate analysis and multiple linear regression analysis, the related influencing factors were studied. Results: The total score of PTG of 1790 nurses was 67.17 +/- 14.79. The analysis revealed that good social support and self-efficacy were important factors to improve the level of PTG of clinical nurses, while bad psychological state and working for many years were the negative factors of PTG. Conclusion: Good social support and self-efficacy can help clinical nurses cope with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and accept the disease's challenges. If these factors can be considered in clinical practice, this will help promote clinical nurses' mental health.","Zhang, X. T.; Shi, S.

The pneumococcal vaccine coverage presents extremely low among elderly people in China. However, the serious event of COVID-19 drives interest in the pneumococcal vaccine, prompting us investigating the willingness to accept the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and influencing factors among people aged over 60 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed using a self-administered questionnaire in Shenzhen City of China, elaborating the willingness toward PPSV23 in the elderly persons. Binomial logistic analyses were performed to estimate the influencing factors using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Among 15,066 respondents, 91.5% presented a positive attitude toward PPSV23. Logistic analyses suggested the influencing factors included knowledge about pneumonia (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.391, 95%CI 1.214-1.593), perception of the seriousness of pneumonia (aOR 1.437, 95%CI 1.230-1.680) and preventing way for pneumonia (aOR 1.639, 95%CI 1.440-1.865), worried about getting pneumonia (aOR 2.751, 95%CI 2.444-3.096), understanding vaccine policy (aOR 1.774, 95%CI 1.514-2.079), and influenza vaccine (aOR 3.516 and 95%CI 2.261-5.468) and PPSV23 histories (aOR 3.199, 95%CI 1.492-6.860).

The model has a trigonometric baseline and considers any upwards deviation from that to come from flu or extreme temperatures. To measure it, the model considers two variables: influenza activity and extreme temperatures. With the former, the model gives the number of deaths because of flu and with the latter the number of deaths because of extreme temperatures. In this article, we show that FluMOMO lacks important variables to be an accurate measure of all-cause mortality and flu mortality. Indeed, we found, as expected, that population ageing and exposure to the risk of death cannot be excluded from the linear predictor. We model weekly deaths as an autoregressive process (lag of one together with a lead of one week). This step allowed us to avoid FluMOMO trigonometric baseline and have a fit to weekly deaths through demographic variables. Our model uses data from Portugal between 2009 and 2020, on ISO-week basis. We use negative binomial-generalized linear models to estimate the weekly number of deaths as an alternative to traditional overdispersion Poisson. As explanatory variables were found to be statistically significant, we registered the number of deaths from the previous week, the influenza activity index, the population average age, the heat waves, the flu season, the number of deaths with COVID-19, and the population exposed to the risk of dying. Considering as excess mortality the number of deaths above the best estimate of deaths from our model, we conclude that excess mortality in 2020 (net of COVID-19 deaths, heat wave of July, and ageing) is low or inexistent. The model also allows us to have the number of deaths arising from flu and we conclude that FluMOMO is overestimating deaths from flu by 78%. Averages from the probability of dying are obtained as well as the probability of dying from flu. The latter is shown to be decreasing over time, probably due to the increase of flu vaccination. Higher mortality detected with the start of COVID-19, in March-April 2020, was probably due to COVID-19 deaths not recognized as COVID-19 deaths.","Portugal, Luís",J Environ Public Health,301,24

It is spread from person to person through the air, causing a public health burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This study aims to assess the knowledge on tuberculosis and the utilization of Directly-Observed Therapy, Short Course (DOTS) service from the public DOTS centers in Lalitpur district of Nepal. METHOD: A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 23 DOTS centers in Lalitpur district. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was applied to assess the knowledge on tuberculosis and utilization of DOTS among people living with tuberculosis. RESULTS: Among 390 respondents, 80% of patients had knowledge of tuberculosis and 76.92% utilized the DOTS service from the DOTS center. People of higher age (50-60 years) [aOR; 13.96, 95% CI 4.79,40.68], [aOR; 10.84,95% CI 4.09,28.76] had significantly more knowledge on TB and utilization of the DOTS service compared to the younger group. Additionally, those who completed twelfth class [aOR; 2.25, 95% CI 0.46,11.07] and [aOR;2.47, 95% CI 0.51,11.28] had greater knowledge of Tuberculosis and utilization of DOTS compared to those who had not completed twelfth class.

However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus authoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death counts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting of pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to variability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing capacities across countries.

Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government Covid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the generally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from the recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the context of the political and fragile state dimensions. Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths by authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2) substantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to standard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian governments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic than democratic governments. Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent to authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic statistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess pandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in studies using death as an outcome variable.","Badman, Ryan P.; Wu, Yunxin; Inukai, Keigo; Akaishi, Rei",,301,1

These lessons learned represent participatory action research methods involving the people who were responsible for taking actions to improve their own and their communities' health. The objective was to build participation of users, academics and service organizations in a novel technology enhanced system leading to quality management of the COVID-19 pandemic. A new technology enhanced system for medical field personnel encouraged network participation resulting in co-creation of a health data center. Application technology assisted COVID-19 infected patients and high-risk people to identify their own symptoms and to provide a rapid tracking method that could be employed until public health surveillance was achieved. A patient and hospital management system employing new application technology was effective in monitoring COVID-19 patients utilizing an interconnected hospital network.

Insufficient attention has been given to the challenge posed by the 2019 novel coronavirus to legislatures, the vital organ of democracy. This article develops a comprehensive analysis of the multiple ways in which the pandemic challenges legislatures and their operation, drawing on illustrative examples from various countries around the world. It argues that covid-19 poses a unique and complex challenge for legislatures; resulting from the characteristics of this pandemic and the ways they interact with the fundamental institutional features of legislatures; the typical demographic traits of legislators; the psychological biases that can prejudice legislatures’ ability to evaluate the risk; and the effects of emergencies on legislatures. The article then delves into an in-depth case study analysis of Israel to analyze how the pandemic particularly challenges parliaments in countries where covid-19 coincides with a pre-existing political crisis. By understanding the complex challenges posed by covid-19 on parliaments, we can help ensure that parliaments, and perhaps ultimately democracy itself, would not become casualties of covid-19.","Bar-Siman-Tov, Ittai",Theo.

Despite ongoing efforts to characterize this population and develop approaches for effective management, individuals with MCCs continue to contribute substantially to health care expenditures. Based on a review of recent literature, several identified barriers limit the effectiveness of care for patients with MCCs. Health care delivery system structural limitations, evidence-based care concerns, patient-clinician relationship constraints, and barriers to inclusion of patient-centered priorities may singly or in combination negatively affect outcomes for individuals with MCCs. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed further light on inequities contributing to suboptimal MCC patient management.

This cross-sectional study explores the Nigerian COVID-19 report to expose some links between the number of confirmed cases, testing, and some environmental conditions. The findings reveal that there is no state in Nigeria which has up to 12 confirmed cases per 10,000 population. That means, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is less than 0.15% of the population of people across each state in Nigeria.

However, it might be a challenge to develop a well-performing algorithm for small non-public data, which have only a few subjects and show differences in recording devices and setup. In this paper, we use transfer learning to tackle the mismatch of the recording setup. This allows us to transfer knowledge from one dataset to another dataset for crackle detection in lung sounds. In particular, a single input convolutional neural network (CNN) model is pre-trained on a source domain using ICBHI 2017, the largest publicly available database of lung sounds. We use log-mel spectrogram features of respiratory cycles of lung sounds. The pre-trained network is used to build a multi-input CNN model, which shares the same network architecture for respiratory cycles and their corresponding respiratory phases. The multi-input model is then fine-tuned on the target domain of our self-collected lung sound database for classifying crackles and normal lung sounds. Our experimental results show significant performance improvements of 9.84% (absolute) in F-score on the target domain using the multi-input CNN model based on transfer learning for crackle detection in adventitious lung sound classification task.","Nguyen, Truc; Pernkopf, Franz",,301,20

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus causes serious respiratory tract infections that can lead to viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have an activated coagulation system characterized by elevated plasma levels of d-dimer-a biomarker of fibrin degradation. Importantly, high levels of D-dimer on hospital admission are associated with increased risk of mortality. Venous thromboembolism is more common than arterial thromboembolism in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary thrombosis and microvascular thrombosis are observed in autopsy studies, and this may contribute to the severe hypoxia observed in COVID-19 patients. It is likely that multiple systems contribute to thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, such as activation of coagulation, platelet activation, hypofibrinolysis, endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps, and complement. Targeting these different pathways may reduce thrombosis and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients.","Mackman, Nigel; Antoniak, Silvio; Wolberg, Alisa S; Kasthuri, Raj; Key, Nigel S",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,301,26

Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in black and Hispanic populations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as they relate to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation. SETTING: NYC. METHODS: COVID-19 data were obtained from the official New York authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age-adjusted COVID-19-related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. These data were cross-compared with historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC. RESULTS: The 2 NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are the Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both the Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates at 32% and 27%, respectively. The 2 ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanic and black) were also found to have the highest age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared with the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Hispanic and black populations in NYC seem to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of the higher incidence of mortality rates. Obesity may have played a role in the high incidence of mortality in those ethnic groups.","El Chaar, Maher; King, Keith; Galvez Lima, Alvaro",Surg Obes Relat Dis,301,30

METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 102 successive PWE. The frequency of seizures was evaluated during pre-quarantine (January- February), quarantine (March-April), and post-quarantine period (May-June), while PwE were divided into A) cases responding to treatment with &#8804; 1 seizure per year; B) cases responding to treatment with 2-5 seizure per year; C) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with &#8804; 4 seizures per month; D) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5-10 seizures per month. PwE underwent several self-report questionnaires regarding therapeutic compliance, mood, stress and sleep during quarantine period. RESULTS: Approximately 50 % of PwE showed seizure frequency changes (22.55 % an increase and 27.45 % a reduction) during quarantine. Seizure frequency significantly (p < 0.05) increased in PwE responding to treatment with &#8804; 1 seizure per year, while significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in PwE with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5-10 seizures per month.

The analysis of anxiety showed a moderate level of anxiety in PwE responding to treatment with < 1 seizure per year, while moderate stress was perceived by all PwE. Seizure frequency changes were related to quarantine, but not to COVID-19 infection. In fact, unlike other regions of Italy, particularly Northern Italy, Apulia and Basilicata regions were less affected by COVID-19 infection, and almost all PwE recognized the quarantine as a stressful event. Emotional distress and anxiety due to social isolation, but also the relative reduction of triggers for epileptic seizures were the most important factors for changes in seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds to the growing concern that the indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic will far outstrip the direct consequences of the infection.","d039,; Orsi, Giuseppe; Mazzeo, Francesca; Ravidà, Domenico; Di Claudio, Maria Teresa; Sabetta, Annarita; Lalla, Alessandra; Sbrizzi, Stefania; Avolio, Carlo",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,301,20

The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the COVID-19 infection can further complicate pregnancies and thus if the protocol we usually use for GDM pregnancies is also applicable to patients who have contracted a Sars-Cov-2 infection. METHODS: This is a retrospective study analysing all pregnant women with gestational diabetes and a concomitant COVID-19 infection admitted to our Institution for antenatal care between March 1st and April 30th 2020. RESULTS: Among pregnant women with GD and a concomitant COVID-19 infection, the mean age was 32,9 (SD 5,6) years. Two patients (33%) were of Caucasian ethnicity while four (67%) were non-Caucasian. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy. Two women were asymptomatic while four were symptomatic. Only two patients (33,3%) received treatment with insulin. None of the patients required intensive care or mechanical ventilation. No complications were found among the newborns. CONCLUSION: the COVID-19 infection was not found to worsen the prognosis of GD patients or of their offspring. Glycaemic monitoring, diet therapy and insulin, when needed, are sufficient for a good metabolic control and a favourable maternal and fetal outcome.","D039,; Ambrosi, F; Rossi, G; Soldavini, C M; Maggi, V; Cetera, G E; Carbone, I F; Di Martino, D; Di Maso, M; Ferrazzi, E",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,301,26

Less well studied are the similar acts of protest that occurred during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, when residents, business owners, clergy, and even local politicians grew increasingly restless by the ongoing public health measures, defied public health edicts, and agitated to have them rescinded. We explore several of the themes that emerged during the late fall of 1918 and conclude that, although the nation seems to be following the same path as it did in 1918, the motivations for pushback to the 2020 pandemic are decidedly more political than they were a century ago.","Navarro, J Alexander; Markel, Howard",Am J Public Health,301,14

It is unknown how public interest and demand for total knee arthroplasties was affected. Public interest in knee pain, knee osteoarthritis and knee arthroplasty in Germany and the UK was investigated using Google Trend Analysis. In addition, we monitored for changes in patient composition in our outpatient department. As of early March in Germany and of late March in the UK, until the lockdown measures, a 50 to 60% decrease in relative search frequency was observed in all categories investigated compared to the beginning of the year. While public interest for knee pain rapidly recovered, decreased interest for knee osteoarthritis and replacement lasted until the easing of measures. Shortly prior to and during the first lockdown mean search frequency for knee replacement was significantly decreased from 39.7% and 36.6 to 26.9% in Germany and from 47.7% and 50.9 to 23.7% in the UK (Germany: p = 0.022 prior to lockdown, p < 0.001 during lockdown; UK: p < 0.0001 prior to and during lockdown). In contrast, mean search frequencies did not differ significantly from each other for any of the investigated time frames during the second half of 2020 in both countries. Similarly, during the first lockdown, the proportion of patients presenting themselves to receive primary knee arthroplasty compared to patients that had already undergone knee replacement declined markedly from 64.7% to 46.9%. In contrast, patient composition changed only marginally during the lockdown measures in late 2020 in both Germany and the UK. We observed a high level of public interest in knee arthroplasty despite the ongoing pandemic. The absence of a lasting decline in interest in primary knee arthroplasty suggests that sufficient symptom reduction cannot be achieved without surgical care for a substantial number of patients.","Kienzle, Arne; Biedermann, Lara; Babeyko, Evgeniya; Kirschbaum, Stephanie; Duda, Georg; Perka, Carsten; Gwinner, Clemens",,301,21

Air medical movement of individuals with potential infectious disease poses unique challenges and threats to crews and receiving personnel. The US Department of Health and Human Services air medical evacuation teams of the National Disaster Medical System directly supported 39 flights, moving over 2,000 individuals. Infection control precautions focused on source and engineering controls, personal protective equipment, safe work practices to limit contamination, and containment of the area of potential contamination. Source control to limit transmission distance was used by requiring all passengers to wear masks (surgical masks for persons under investigation and N95 for known positives). Engineering controls used plastic sheeting to segregate and treat patients who developed symptoms while airborne. Crews used Tyvek (Dupont Richmond, VA) suits with booties and a hood, a double layer of gloves, and either a powered air-purifying respirator or an N95 mask with a face shield. For those outside the 6-ft range, an N95 mask and gloves were worn. Safe work practices were used, which included mandatory aircraft surface decontamination, airflow exchanges, and designated lavatories.

This category of specialists has exposure of high risk of COVID-19, due to inevitable numerous contacts with infected persons. Because of this, existing practicable models of medical care are needed to be upgraded (Tavakoli, 2020). The emergency response path was implemented through the opening of new infectious hospitals, re-profiling clinics, as well as increasing workload on medical personnel. This approach is associated with the possible rapid drop-up of qualified medical specialists due to the illness, which is a strong limiting factor to respond to new threats of COVID-19 due to the risks of exhaustion of the human resource. In the worst scenario, a threat of collapse of the emergency and specialized medical care system due to peak load of severe patients under the shortage of doctors and support personnel. To prevent such an emergency, a complex of anti-epidemic events is provided, most of the purpose of interrupting infection contacts, isolation of the most vulnerable contingents, extended population testing for virus or contact with infected persons, this allows you to follow unwanted contacts with the subsequent mobility limitation. Digital monitoring technologies with digitization of incoming data of significant events played the increasing role in all these options. Today they are complemented by robotic supporting. Due to the high risk of the infection in the COVID-19 spread, including the intra-clinic infections, the requirements for reliable disinfection of closed premises intended for patients and medical personnel should be fulfilled. At the same time, the following circumstance should be taken into account. When these work-time activities are imposed on the employee who is forced to stay long in an infected air environment, he is subjected to additional impact of pathogenes. To reduce these threats, robotic support for the work for disinfection of premises with automated air environment control and tracing contacts. © Authors 2021. CC BY 4.0 License.","Knyazkov, M.

Exploring the causative alterations of T2DM within the nasal mucosa and NALT could provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms and bridge the gap between innate immunity and adaptive immunity for virus clearance. Here, we designed a case-control study to compare the olfactory function (OF) among the groups of normal control (NC), COVID-19 mild pneumonia (MP), and MP patients with T2DM (MPT) after a 6-8 months' recovery, in which MPT had a higher risk of hyposmia than MP and NC. No significant difference was found between the MP and NC. This elevated risk of hyposmia indicated that T2DM increased COVID-19 susceptibility in the nasal cavity with unknown causations. Therefore, we used the T2DM animal model (db/db mice) to evaluate how T2DM increased COVID-19 associated susceptibilities in the nasal mucosa and lymphoid tissues. Db/db mice demonstratedupregulated microvasculature ACE2 expression and significant alterations in lymphocytes component of NALT. Specifically, db/db mice NALT had increased immune-suppressive TCRÎ³Î´+ CD4-CD8- T and decreased immune-effective CD4+/CD8+ TCRß+ T cells and decreased mucosa-protective CD19+ B cells. These results indicated that T2DM could dampen the first-line defense of nasal immunity, and further mechanic studies of metabolic damage and NALT restoration should be one of the highest importance for COVID-19 healing.","Zhao, Yi; Liu, Yujie; Yi, Fangzheng; Zhang, Jun; Xu, Zhaohui; Liu, Yehai; Tao, Ye",Int Immunopharmacol,301,20

A total of 320 laying hens (36 weeks of age) were divided into 4 treatment groups, with 10 replicates per treatment and 8 hens per replicate. They were fed on a control diet, the control diet supplemented with 0.8% BC, the control diet supplemented with 0.4% BV, or the control diet supplemented with a combination of BC (0.8%) and BV (0.4%) from 36 to 51 weeks of age. Egg production increased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets during 48 to 51 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Damaged egg rate decreased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets for the whole experiment (P < 0.05). Shell thickness was highest in the BCV-fed group at week 43, and shell strength was higher in the BV-fed group at week 51 (P < 0.05). Supplementation of BC or BCV in the diet resulted in a decreased abdominal fat pad (P < 0.05). In the ileal content, the population of Salmonella spp. decreased in the BV and BCV groups and the population of Lactobacillus spp. increased in the BV group (P < 0.05). The present results indicate that feeding BV or BCV alleviates damaged egg rate and decreases intestinal pathogenic bacteria, while feeding BC benefits by reducing abdominal fat. These results suggest that the effect of BCV seems to be induced by the synergistic effect of BC and BV, and that the BCV contributes to the effective use of bamboo on the laying hen's production.","Rattanawut, Jessada; Pimpa, Opart; Venkatachalam, Karthikeyan; Yamauchi, Koh-En",Trop Anim Health Prod,301,24

All specialties including neurosurgery are involved, and due to resource limitations, the number of elective surgeries in subspecialized filed has substantially decreased. Herein, we report our practice experience in pediatric neurosurgery in a tertiary hospital during pandemic, and the effects of pandemic on educational issues. METHODS: All the patients on whom any kind of neurosurgical operation was performed from March to June 2020 were retrospectively collected, and also from the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients underwent surgery in this period. This figure was 159 patients during the same period in 2019. The total number of surgical cases reduced by 31% compared to the last year. While ventriculoperitoneal shunts and supratentorial tumor were more frequent, there was a considerable reduction in subspecialized educational surgeries like neural tube defects and craniosynostoses. CONCLUSION: CVID-19 pandemic changed all scopes of medical practice and training. Considering the limitation in the available resources, the number of educational cases may decrease in subspecialized disciplines like pediatric neurosurgery.

While practical sessions are important for the acquisition of clinical skills, few studies have examined the role of home-based simulation learning (HBSL). This study aims to identify key aspects of simulation design and factors associated with students' satisfaction with HBSL. METHODS: During a ""circuit-breaker"" period in Singapore, the Nanyang Polytechnic School of Health & Social Sciences (Oral Health Therapy) distributed portable manikins and instruments to students and staff for use at home. Synchronous teaching sessions with real-time feedback were carried out over the Zoom teleconferencing platform. A cross-sectional survey of students was conducted after 3 weeks of the HBSL program. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to assess the association between satisfaction with domains of simulation design and overall satisfaction with HBSL. RESULTS: The top three factors of importance to students in HBSL were feedback and guided reflection, support, and objectives and information. Final-year students expressed higher levels of overall satisfaction and self-confidence following HBSL than first-year students. Satisfaction with the objectives (ß = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.57), support (ß = 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.42), and problem-solving (ß = 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.46) domains in the Simulation Design Scale were positively associated with overall student satisfaction and self-confidence in learning.

This study describes changes in levels of physical activity and screen time from February 2020 (i.e., before COVID-19 restrictions were introduced in Western Australia) to May 2020 (i.e., when COVID-19 restrictions were in place). Parents of children aged 5 to 9 years from Western Australia were eligible to participate and recruited through convenience sampling. An online survey instrument that included validated measures of their children's physical activity (unstructured, organized, home-based, indoor/outdoor active play, dog play/walking), sociodemographic, and other potential confounders was administered to parents. Paired t-tests and mixed ANOVA models assessed changes in physical activity outcomes. The analytic sample comprised parents of 157 children who were 6.9 years of age (SD = 1.7) on average. Overall, weekly minutes of total physical activity (PA) did not change from before to during COVID-19. However, frequency and duration (total and home-based) of unstructured physical activity significantly increased. Outdoor play in the yard or street around the house, outdoor play in the park or playground or outdoor recreation area, and active indoor play at home all significantly increased. Frequency and total duration of organised physical activity significantly declined during COVID-19 distancing. During Western Australian COVID-19 restrictions, there was an increase in young children's unstructured physical activity and outdoor play and a decrease in organised physical activity. It remains to be seen whether children's increased physical activity has been sustained with the easing of physical distancing restrictions.","Nathan, Andrea; George, Phoebe; Ng, Michelle; Wenden, Elizabeth; Bai, Pulan; Phiri, Zino; Christian, Hayley",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),301,20

Many developed countries do not achieve the World Health Organization influenza immunization target of 75% in people &#8805;65 years. We aimed to determine whether a brief pharmacy phone call could increase vaccine uptake of standard and enhanced influenza. Twenty-eight community pharmacists across Canada performed a telephone consultation with 643 older adults whose primary care records indicated that they had not received their influenza vaccination from their usual practitioner. Of these 643 adults, 169 (26.3%) had been vaccinated in another setting. Of the remaining 474, 313 (66%) agreed to receive the vaccine. Of those who refused vaccination, 69 provided a rationale for not wanting it, including that the flu shot ""causes the flu"" (n = 25), ""doesn't work"" (n = 25), ""is too painful"" (n = 10), and other (n = 10). Overall, of the 643 individuals who had not received their vaccination from their usual health care provider in the first wave of vaccinations, 75.4% (n = 485) ultimately received their vaccination in the 2019-2020 season.

These are goods that, once delivered, can be unrestrictedly consumed by most—if not all—countries on the planet. Nor are their benefits rivalrous. Moreover, the production of GPGs cannot be left to markets or individual countries, as these have suboptimal incentives to act. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the concept of GPGs has seen a revival of sorts, with the pandemic not only striking just as multilateralism was at its lowest ebb, but also serving as irrefutable proof that the world needs international collaboration now more than ever. Multilateral institutions, and in particular the World Bank—a leading global institution with global membership—can rightfully be regarded as a possible solution to many global challenges. Based on interviews conducted with World Bank senior staff, as well as numerous experts, this article discusses arguments in favor of such a strategic shift. While there are legitimate claims for the Bank becoming a full-fledged provider of GPGs, the institution’s historical roots and operational constraints make this an unlikely prospect.","Kopiński, Dominik Wróblewski Marek",World Affairs,301,24

This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. RESULTS: According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Yan, Xiangbin; Qayyum, Abdul; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Shah, Syed Jamal",Int J Med Inform,301,28

Results from Ontario, Canada",18.856062,4.0464807,2021,"COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory symptoms of various severities, ranging from mild upper respiratory signs to acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with a high mortality rate. However, the pathophysiology of the disease is largely unknown. Shotgun metagenomics from nasopharyngeal swabs were used to characterize the genomic, metagenomic and transcriptomic features of patients from the first pandemic wave with various forms of COVID-19, including outpatients, patients hospitalized not requiring intensive care, and patients in the intensive care unit, to identify viral and/or host factors associated with the most severe forms of the disease. Neither the genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, nor the detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites were associated with the severity of pulmonary disease. Severe pneumonia was associated with overexpression of cytokine transcripts activating the CXCR2 pathway, whereas patients with benign disease presented with a T helper ""Th1-Th17"" profile. The latter profile was associated with female gender and a lower mortality rate. Our findings indicate that the most severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the presence of overactive immune cells resulting in neutrophil pulmonary infiltration which, in turn, could enhance the inflammatory response and prolong tissue damage. These findings make CXCR2 antagonists, in particular IL-8 antagonists, promising candidates for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Rodriguez, Christophe; de Prost, Nicolas; Fourati, Slim; Lamoureux, Claudie; Gricourt, Guillaume; N039,; debi, Melissa; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Désveaux, Isaac; Picard, Oriane; Demontant, Vanessa; Trawinski, Elisabeth; Lepeule, Raphaël; Surgers, Laure; Vindrios, William; Lelièvre, Jean-Daniel; Mongardon, Nicolas; Langeron, Olivier; Cohen, José L; Mekontso-Dessap, Armand; Woerther, Paul-Louis; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel",PLoS Pathog,301,30

The pandemic of the disease is a tragedy, which may leave a catastrophic psychological imprint on nurses. Understanding nurses' mental distress can help when implementing interventions to mitigate psychological injuries to nurses. Aims and objectives: To quantify the severity of nurses' post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and stress and explore the influencing factors of their psychological health when caring for patients with COVID-19. Design: A cross-sectional survey. Methods: The PTSD Checklist-Civilian and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered from 11 to 18 March 2020, to 90 nurses selected from another city to go and help an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China. These nurses were selected because of their high levels of clinical performance and resilience status. Results: Nurses' average PTSD score was 24.62 ± 6.68, and five (5.6%) of the nurses reported a clinically significant level of PTSD symptoms (&gt;38 points). Nurses' perceived stress averaged 19.33 ± 7, and 20 nurses (22.22%) scored positively &gt;25 points. Nurses' stress and PTSD symptoms were positively correlated (P &lt;.01). Major stress sources included working in an isolated environment, concerns about personal protective equipment shortage and usage, physical and emotional exhaustion, intensive workload, fear of being infected, and insufficient work experiences with COVID-19. Conclusions: This study showed that even relatively highly resilient nurses experienced some degree of mental distress, including PTSD symptoms and perceived stress. Our findings highlight the importance of helping nurses cultivate resilience and reduce stress. Relevance to clinical practice_ Recommendations for practice include providing adequate training and orientation before assigning nurses to ICU to help, offering disaster-emergency-preparedness training to keep nurses prepared, providing caring and authentic nursing leadership, offering ongoing psychological support to frontline nurses.","Leng, Min; Wei, Lili; Shi, Xiaohui; Cao, Guorong; Wei, Yuling; Xu, Hong; Zhang, Xiaoying; Zhang, Wenwen; Xing, Shuyun; Wei, Holly",Nurs.

Therefore, the objective of writing this paper is to analyse how the disaster communication was carried out by Jokowi on Twitter during the Covid-19 pandemic. This research was conducted using data from President Jokowi’s tweets (@jokowi) related to Covid-19 from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. The number of tweets analysed was 150 tweets related to coronavirus from a total of 290 tweets. These tweets were collected automatically with the help of the Ncapture and NVIVO 12 analysis tools. However, the researcher also re-checked the data manually. The collected data is then encoded using Microsoft Excel. Finally, the data was analysed using quantitative content analysis. The results found that Jokowi has provided a wide variety of information, ranging from socialising policies related to the handling of COVID-19 in Indonesia to the extension of condolences to the affected patients. The use of photos and videos is also carried out by Jokowi to increase public awareness. Unfortunately, disaster communications were not carried out in advance before the pandemic occurred. It was only actively carried out when the pandemic had claimed many victims. Furthermore, coordination with many parties in providing the information is also crucial.

It discusses what is known about vulnerabilities and how to support local protective action. There is heightened concern about informal urban settlements because of the combination of population density and inadequate access to water and sanitation, which makes standard advice about social distancing and washing hands implausible. There are further challenges to do with the lack of reliable data and the social, political and economic contexts in each setting that will influence vulnerability and possibilities for action. The potential health impacts of COVID-19 are immense in informal settlements, but if control measures are poorly executed these could also have severe negative impacts. Public health interventions must be balanced with social and economic interventions, especially in relation to the informal economy upon which many poor urban residents depend. Local residents, leaders and community-based groups must be engaged and resourced to develop locally appropriate control strategies, in partnership with local governments and authorities. Historically, informal settlements and their residents have been stigmatized, blamed, and subjected to rules and regulations that are unaffordable or unfeasible to adhere to. Responses to COVID-19 should not repeat these mistakes. Priorities for enabling effective control measures include: collaborating with local residents who have unsurpassed knowledge of relevant spatial and social infrastructures, strengthening coordination with local governments, and investing in improved data for monitoring the response in informal settlements.","Wilkinson, Annie; Ali, Harris; Bedford, Juliet; Boonyabancha, Somsook; Connolly, Creighton; Conteh, Abu; Dean, Laura; Decorte, Filiep; Dercon, Bruno; Dias, Sonia; Dodman, David; Duijsens, Raimond; D’Urzo, Sandra; Eamer, Gwendolen; Earle, Lucy; Gupte, Jaideep; Frediani, Alex Apsan; Hasan, Arif; Hawkins, Kate; Herbst, Natalia; Kadihasanoglu, Aynur; Keil, Roger; Kibuchi, Eliud; Leach, Melissa; Lilford, Richard; Macarthy, Joseph; Mitlin, Diana; Napier, David; O’Donnell, Ian; Oyebode, Oyinlola; Ozano, Kim; Perera, Laxman; Rashid, Sabina; Ringwald, Beate; Ripoll, Santiago; Saleem, Amjad; Satterthwaite, David; Sellu, Sudie Austina; Siddique, Omar; Soesilo, Cynthia; Sommer, Kerstin; Steege, Rosie; Sverdlik, Alice; Tacoli, Cecilia; Taylor, John; Theobald, Sally; Tolhurst, Rachel; Walnycki, Anna; Watson, Samuel; Whittaker, Lana",Environ.

Earlier we reported a down-regulation of several key hepatic lipogenic enzymes and their upstream regulators in liver-specific PDC-deficient mouse (L-PDCKO model by deleting the Pdha1 gene). In this study we investigated gene expression profiles of key glycolytic enzymes and other proteins that respond to various metabolic stresses in liver from L-PDCKO mice. Transcripts of several, such as hexokinase 2, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase muscle-type 2, and lactate dehydrogenase B as well as those for the nonglycolysis-related proteins, CD-36, C/EBP homologous protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³, were up-regulated in L-PDCKO liver whereas hypoxia-induced factor-1&#945;, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and Sirtuin 1 transcripts were down-regulated. The protein levels of pyruvate kinase muscle-type 2 and lactate dehydrogenase B were increased whereas that of lactate dehydrogenase A was decreased in PDC-deficient mouse liver. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress indicators suggests that the L-PDCKO liver showed evidence of the former but not the latter.

Although critical to reducing the virus' reproduction rate, these restrictions come with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers currently working from home. Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal study ($N~=~192$), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological factors that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include anxiety, distractions, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and work motivation. This design allowed us to identify those variables that explain unique variance in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively, and stress predicted an individual's well-being negatively when controlling for other variables consistently across both waves; (2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively; (3) productivity was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time two compared to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time; and (4) the longitudinal study did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained variance in well-being and productivity.

We retrospectively analyzed 303 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and evaluated the clinical data of 240 patients who were discharged. The coagulation function of the two groups (mild and severe) was compared. Compared with the mild group, majority of patients in the severe group were male (76.9% vs. 49.8%) and elderly (median age 65 vs. 50), and the proportion with chronic underlying diseases was higher (73.1% vs. 36.1%). There were 209 abnormalities (69.0%) of coagulation parameters in 303 patients admitted to hospital. Comparison of various indexes of coagulation function between the two groups in admission, the proportion of abnormal coagulation indicators in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group (100% vs. 66.1%). The median coagulation parameters in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group: international normalized ratio (1.04 vs. 1.01), prothrombin time (13.8 vs. 13.4) seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (43.2 vs. 39.2) seconds, fibrinogen (4.74 vs. 4.33) g/L, fibrinogen degradation products (2.61 vs. 0.99) µg/mL, and D-dimer (1.04 vs. 0.43) µg/mL, the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

However, limited research has examined the impact of different commercial bowel preparations (CBPs) on IBP and adenoma detection. We aim to determine whether type of CBP used is associated with IBP or adenoma detection. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated outpatient, screening or surveillance colonoscopies performed in the Cleveland Clinic health system between January 2011 and June 2017. IBP was defined by the Aronchick scale. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to assess the association between CBP type and IBP and adenoma detection. Fixed effects were defined as demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and colonoscopy factors. Random effect of individual endoscopist was considered. RESULTS: Of 153,639 colonoscopies, 75,874 records met inclusion criteria. Median age was 54; 50% were female; 17.7% had IBP, and adenoma detection rate was 32.6%. In adjusted analyses, compared to GoLYTELY, only NuLYTELY [OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.60, 0.72)] and SuPREP [OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.40, 0.69)] were associated with reduced IBP. Adenoma detection did not vary based on the type of bowel preparation used. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients referred for screening or surveillance colonoscopy, choice of CBP was not associated with adenoma detection. Decisions about CBP should be based on other factors, such as tolerability, cost, or safety.","Sarvepalli, Shashank; Garber, Ari; Burke, Carol A; Gupta, Niyati; Ibrahim, Mounir; McMichael, John; Morris-Stiff, Gareth; Bhatt, Amit; Vargo, John; Rizk, Maged; Rothberg, Michael B",Dig. dis. sci,301,10

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is vaccinated. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.","Wang, Rui; Chen, Jiahui; Wei, Guo-Wei",,301,21

Due to the tortuous hairpin turn, the microcatheter position was distal to the tumor blush for the convexity meningioma. Given the distal microcatheter position, we opted for nBCA as the liquid embolic of choice for tumor embolization. The time of polymerization for nBCA may be delayed using glacial acetic acid, which makes nBCA ideal when the microcatheter is in a distal position relative to the target location for embolization. The patient underwent successful embolization using nBCA and was taken for a right frontal craniotomy for resection of the meningioma the next day.

Concerns have been raised in both scientific and lay press around the quality of some of this research. We assessed clinical research from major clinical journals, comparing methodological and reporting quality of covid-19 papers published in the first wave (here defined as December 2019 to May 2020 inclusive) of the viral pandemic with non-covid papers published at the same time. METHODS: We reviewed research publications (print and online) from The BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine, from first publication of a covid-19 research paper (February 2020) to May 2020 inclusive. Paired reviewers were randomly allocated to extract data on methodological quality (risk of bias) and reporting quality (adherence to reporting guidance) from each paper using validated assessment tools. A random 10% of papers were assessed by a third, independent rater. Overall methodological quality for each paper was rated high, low or unclear. Reporting quality was described as percentage of total items reported. RESULTS: From 168 research papers, 165 were eligible, including 54 (33%) papers with a covid-19 focus. For methodological quality, 18 (33%) covid-19 papers and 83 (73%) non-covid papers were rated as low risk of bias, OR 6.32 (95%CI 2.85 to 14.00). The difference in quality was maintained after adjusting for publication date, results, funding, study design, journal and raters (OR 6.09 (95%CI 2.09 to 17.72)). For reporting quality, adherence to reporting guidelines was poorer for covid-19 papers, mean percentage of total items reported 72% (95%CI:66 to 77) for covid-19 papers and 84% (95%CI:81 to 87) for non-covid. CONCLUSIONS: Across various measures, we have demonstrated that covid-19 research from the first wave of the pandemic was potentially of lower quality than contemporaneous non-covid research. While some differences may be an inevitable consequence of conducting research during a viral pandemic, poor reporting should not be accepted.","Quinn, Terence J; Burton, Jennifer K; Carter, Ben; Cooper, Nicola; Dwan, Kerry; Field, Ryan; Freeman, Suzanne C; Geue, Claudia; Hsieh, Ping-Hsuan; McGill, Kris; Nevill, Clareece R; Rana, Dikshyanta; Sutton, Alex; Rowan, Martin Taylor; Xin, Yiqiao",BMC Med,301,16

A mechanism similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been proposed. In the US, the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), which uses a human adenoviral vector, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 27, 2021. By April 12, 2021, approximately 7 million Ad26.COV2.S vaccine doses had been given in the US, and 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia had been identified among the recipients, resulting in a temporary national pause in vaccination with this product on April 13, 2021. Objective: To describe reports of CVST with thrombocytopenia following Ad26.COV2.S vaccine receipt. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 12 US patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia following use of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine under EUA reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 2 to April 21, 2021 (with follow-up reported through April 21, 2021). Exposures: Receipt of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, laboratory tests, and outcomes after CVST diagnosis obtained from VAERS reports, medical record review, and discussion with clinicians. Results: Patients' ages ranged from 18 to younger than 60 years;all were White women, reported from 11 states. Seven patients had at least 1 CVST risk factor, including obesity (n = 6), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and oral contraceptive use (n = 1);none had documented prior heparin exposure. Time from Ad26.COV2.S vaccination to symptom onset ranged from 6 to 15 days. Eleven patients initially presented with headache;1 patient initially presented with back pain and later developed headache. Of the 12 patients with CVST, 7 also had intracerebral hemorrhage;8 had non-CVST thromboses. After diagnosis of CVST, 6 patients initially received heparin treatment. Platelet nadir ranged from 9 x103/microL to 127 x103/microL. All 11 patients tested for the heparin-platelet factor 4 HIT antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening had positive results. All patients were hospitalized (10 in an intensive care unit [ICU]). As of April 21, 2021, outcomes were death (n = 3), continued ICU care (n = 3), continued non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharged home (n = 4). Conclusions and Relevance: The initial 12 US cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination represent serious events.

When the carrier can highly disperse the drug, it will increase the wettability of the drug and reduce the surface tension, thus improving the solubility, dissolution, and bioavailability. However, amorphous solid dispersions usually have low drug loading and poor stability. Therefore, the goal of this work is to study the increased dissolution and high stability of high drug-loading crystalline solid dispersion (CSD), and the difference in dissolution and stability of high-loading and low-loading amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). A CSD of nimodipine with a drug loading of 90% was prepared by wet milling, with hydroxypropyl cellulose (model: HPC-SL) and sodium dodecyl sulfate as stabilizers and spray drying. At the same time, the gradient drug-loaded ASD was prepared by hot melt extrusion with HPC-SL as the carrier. Each preparation was characterized by DSC, PXRD, FT-IR, SEM, and in vitro dissolution testing. The results indicated that the drug in CSD existed in a crystalline state. The amorphous drug molecules in the low drug-loading ASD were uniformly dispersed in the carrier, while the drug state in the high drug-loading ASD was aggregates of the amorphous drug. At the end of the dissolution assay, the 90% drug-loading CSD increased cumulative dissolution to 60%, and the 10% drug-loading ASD achieved a cumulative dissolution rate of 90%.","Wang, Xiaolin; Zhang, Lu; Ma, Danyang; Tang, Xing; Zhang, Yu; Yin, Tian; Gou, Jingxin; Wang, Yanjiao; He, Haibing",AAPS PharmSciTech,301,10

The infection is highly contagious, has a high mortality rate, and its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Pulmonary inflammation with substantial lung damage together with generalized immune dysregulation are major components of COVID-19 pathogenesis. The former component, lung damage, seems to be at least in part a consequence of immune dysregulation. Indeed, studies have revealed that immune alteration is not merely an association, as it might occur in systemic infections, but, very likely, the core pathogenic element of COVID-19. In addition, precise management of immune response in COVID-19, i.e. enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment. Herein, we have reviewed current evidence related to different aspects of COVID-19 immunology, including innate and adaptive immune responses against the virus and mechanisms of virus-induced immune dysregulation. Considering that current antiviral therapies are chiefly experimental, strategies to do immunotherapy for the management of disease have also been reviewed. Understanding immunology of COVID-19 is important in developing effective therapies as well as diagnostic, and prophylactic strategies for this disease.","Mohamed Khosroshahi, Leila; Rokni, Mohsen; Mokhtari, Tahmineh; Noorbakhsh, Farshid",Int Immunopharmacol,301,17

Abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients are important prognostic factors of disease severity. The aim of this study was to analyze coagulation profiles of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 455 Covid-19 patients admitted at Millennium COVID-19 care and treatment center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from July 1- October 23, 2020. Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and International normalized ratio (INR) were determined on HUMACLOT DUE PLUS® coagulation analyzer (Wiesbaden, Germany). In all statistical analysis of results, p<0.05 was defined as statistically significant. RESULT: A prolonged prothrombin time was found in 46.8% of study participants with COVID-19 and a prolonged prothrombin time and elevated INR in 53.3% of study subjects with severe and 51% of critically COVID patients. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 22.1% of COVID-19 patients. 50.5% and 51.3% of COVID-19 patients older than 55 years had thrombocytopenia and prolonged APTT respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, prolonged prothrombin time and elevated INR were detected in more than 50% of severe and critical COVID-19 patients.

There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. METHODS: A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. In addition, 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N = 164 individuals) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and neutralizing activity was determined. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.0% across 100 negative control individuals. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These three clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients.

In the light of recent outbreak of COVID19 Pandemic for which is there no specific treatment, prevention and awareness is the only key to overcome an adversity of such magnitude. Thus, we aimed to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices of undergraduate medical students pertaining to infection with the COVID19. Methods. An electronic survey developed using an online cloud-based website (Survey Monkey) was served to undergraduate medical students. Participants had a week to voluntarily complete the 8 minute long questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and figures were obtained from surveymonkey.com. Results. Of 2507 invitees across six medical colleges in India, 616 (24.6%) responded. Most undergraduates (age 21.5 years, 46.1% males) were undergoing internship (16.7%) or final year undergraduate training (54.1%). Knowledge regarding viral transmission, clinical-radiologic features, laboratory diagnosis and treatment was adequate among most students (Fig 1). However, the understanding of the incubation period and time to symptoms was less than satisfactory (Supplementary Table 1). Nearly three-fourths 461 (74.8%) were aware of the COVID-19 specific precautions. While their universities had advised most regarding hand hygiene, social distancing, symptom identification, and high-risk groups, fewer were advised to avoid staying back in hostels or drug prevention. Nearly 70% were reluctant to attend clinics from fear of getting infected or passing on to others. Most students read about COVID-19 regularly, and social media accounts of medical journals were the primary 78.9% source. Conclusion. Most medical students are aware of the basics of COVID19 infection and act as a potential reservoir to fill the gaps in Healthcare services should the need arise.","Gupta, Latika; Agarwal, Vishwesh; Davalbhakta, Samira; Agarwal, Vikas; Misra, Durga",,301,1

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.","Danon, Leon; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Bailey, Mick; Keeling, Matt J",,301,3

Binding of N protein to membranes of mouse fibroblast L-2 cells is very specific and occurs under conditions in which no other viral or cellular proteins show datectable binding. Binding occurs with both free and nucleocapsid-associated N protein, arguing for membrane-binding sites on the N protein itself, rather than on RNA. Binding of N protein also occurs to membranes in the absence of MHV matrix (M) protein which is known to interact with the N protein. Both non-viral, single-stranded RNA and DNA inhibit membrane binding of N protein. In addition, purified phospholipid liposomes compete against N protein binding to membranes. Of various phospholipids tested, cardiolipin was the most effective in inhibiting membrane binding. The N protein was also shown to bind directly to phospholipid liposomes containing cardiolipin as well as to liposomes containing total lipids extracted from mouse L-2 cells. Because of certain structural similarities between phospholipids and nucleic acids, we speculate that membrane lipid association of the N protein may compete for RNA binding sites on the N protein. Such a mechanism may be important for processes such as nucleocapsid uncoating and nucleocapsid assembly. Most interestingly the properties of phospholipid and nucleic acid binding are markedly similar to those recently described for the bacterial DNA-binding proteins DnaA and recA.","Anderson, Robert; Wong, Fred",Virology,301,16

This study assessed the ability of chest computed tomography (CT) severity score (CSS) to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 192 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia aged more than 20 years and typical CT findings and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction positive admitted in a tertiary hospital were included. Clinical symptoms at admission and short-term outcome were obtained. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to evaluate the parenchymal involvement. The association between CSS, disease severity, and outcomes were evaluated. Prediction of CSS was assessed with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The incidence of admission to ICU was 22.8% in men and 14.1% in women. CSS was related to ICU admission and mortality. Areas under the ROC curves were 0.764 for total CSS. Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model, gender, age, oxygen saturation, and CSS had a significant independent relationship with ICU admission and death. Patients with CSS ≥12.5 had about four-time risk of ICU admission and death (odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.66 – 9.25). The multivariate regression analysis showed the superiority of CSS over other clinical information and co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: CSS was a strong predictor of progression to ICU admission and death and there was a substantial role of non-contrast chest CT imaging in the presence of typical features for COVID-19 pneumonia as a reliable predictor of clinical severity and patient’s outcome.","Hajiahmadi, Somayeh; Shayganfar, Azin; Janghorbani, Mohsen; Esfahani, Mahsa Masjedi; Mahnam, Mehdi; Bakhtiarvand, Nagar; Sami, Ramin; Khademi, Nilufar; Dehghani, Mehrnegar",Infect Chemother,301,24

The live vaccine MTBVAC is based on rational attenuation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with the objective of improving BCG protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the development of recombinant mycobacteria as antigen-presenting microorganisms has been hindered due to their fastidious genetic manipulation. In this study, we used MTBVAC as a genetic platform to deliver diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis toxoids, which are the immunogenic constituents of the DTP vaccine. When using nonoptimal genetic conditions, the expression of these immunogens was barely detectable. Accordingly, we pursued a rational, step-by-step optimization of the genetic components to achieve the expression and secretion of these toxoids. We explored variants of the L5 mycobacteriophage promoter to ensure balanced antigen expression and plasmid stability. Optimal signal sequences were identified by comparative proteomics of MTBVAC and its parental strain. It was determined that proteins secreted by the Twin Arginine Translocation pathway displayed higher secretion in MTBVAC, and the Ag85A secretion sequence was selected as the best candidate. Because the coding regions of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis toxoids significantly differ in G + C content relative to mycobacterial genes, their codon usage was optimized. We also placed a 3xFLAG epitope in frame with the C-terminus of these toxoids to facilitate protein detection. Altogether, these optimizations resulted in the secretion of DTP antigens by MTBVAC, as demonstrated by western blot and MRM-MS. Finally, we examined specific antibody responses in mice vaccinated with recombinant MTBVAC expressing DTP antigens.","Broset, Esther; Calvet Seral, Juan; Arnal, Carmen; Uranga, Santiago; Kanno, Alex I.; Leite, Luciana C.C.; Martín, Carlos; Gonzalo-Asensio, Jesús",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,301,1

There is evidence that changes to the midface and lower third of the face in isolation contribute significantly to one’s perception of overall facial age. With data suggesting that facial coverings are effective against the spread of the respiratory virus COVID-19, mask wearing has become commonplace. To date, there have been no studies that explore how covering the lower third of the face impacts an observer’s perception of age. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that covering the lower third of the face with a mask will make a person appear younger. METHODS: One hundred consecutive plastic surgery patients were photographed in a standardized fashion, both masked and unmasked. A questionnaire for factors known to contribute to facial aging was administered. These photographs were randomized to 6 judges who estimated the patients’ age and also quantified facial rhytids with the validated Lemperle wrinkle assessment score6. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED analysis. RESULTS: Masked patients on average appeared 6.17% younger (mean difference = 3.16 years, 95% CI = 2.26-4.06, P < 0.0001). Wrinkle assessment scores were 9.81% lower in the masked group (mean difference = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.10-0.32, P = 0.0003). All subgroups appeared younger in a mask except for patients aged 18-40 years chronological age (P = 0.0617) and patients BMI>35 (P = 0.5084). CONCLUSIONS: The mask group appeared younger and had lower overall and visible wrinkle assessment scores when compared to the unmasked group.

SLR14 demonstrated remarkable protective capacity against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection when used prophylactically and retained considerable efficacy as a therapeutic agent. In immunodeficient mice carrying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection, SLR14 elicited near-sterilizing innate immunity by inducing IFN-I responses in the absence of the adaptive immune system. In the context of infection with variants of concern (VOC), SLR14 conferred broad protection and uncovered an IFN-I resistance gradient across emerging VOC. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SLR14 as a host-directed, broad-spectrum antiviral for early post-exposure treatment and for treatment of chronically infected immunosuppressed patients.","Mao, Tianyang; Israelow, Benjamin; Lucas, Carolina; Vogels, Chantal B.

This study reports a straightforward fabrication technique for patterning an on-chip graphene-based device with hole arrays, in which the mechanism of surface structures can achieve stable and uniform thermal control for the amplification of DNA fragments. A thin-film based PCR device was fabricated using picosecond laser (PS-laser) ablation of the multilayer graphene (MLG). Under the optimal fluence of 4.72 J/cm(2) with a pulse overlap of 66%, the MLG can be patterned with arrays of 250 μm(2) hole surface structures. A 354-bp DNA fragment of VP1, an effective marker for diagnosing the BK virus, was amplified on an on-chip device in less than 60 min. A thin-film electrode with the aforementioned MLG as the heater was demonstrated to significantly enhance temperature stability for each stage of the thermal cycle. The temperature control of the heater was performed by means of a developed programmable PCR apparatus. Our results demonstrated that the proposed integration of a graphene-based device and a laser-pulse ablation process to form a thin-film PCR device has cost benefits in a small-volume reagent and holds great promise for practical medical use of DNA amplification.","Chen, Zhao-Chi; Chang, Tien-Li; Li, Ching-Hao; Su, Kai-Wen; Liu, Cheng-Che",Biosens Bioelectron,301,0

N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs. AIM: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. METHODS: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies. We found published literature was scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and based on Hydrogen peroxide vapor. Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.

By March 2020 the novel coronavirus known to cause a pandemic has infected nearly about 119 thousand people and killed more than 4,300 around 114 countries. Apart from the current controversial opinions about the origin, spreading, and sociological impact, it is much more imperative to put a halt to this current situation. Understanding, testing, and early to rapid diagnosis may be now the only key that can contain COVID-19 by “flattening the curve”. Biosensing is the platform that allows rapid, highly sensitive, and selective detection of analytes which in turn can serve the purpose for fast and precise detection of COVID-19.

In this study, we combined network pharmacology and experimental pharmacology and discovered the potential mechanism of action and the active ingredients of the lily, Tricyrtis maculata was discovered. The monomer compound with stronger activity was discovered through in vitro cell experiments. METHODS: Forty known compounds were isolated from T. maculata. Using TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction, metaTarFisher, GeneCards and OMIM databases, targets of drug compositions and AMI-related genes were obtained, and the differential expression genes between AMI and normal tissues were extracted through the GEO database. Then, through an online mapping tool, the intersection genes were obtained to predict the possible effective components of T. maculata that can be used to treat AMI. The top five targets were selected for molecular docking via the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network to verify the binding activity between key compounds and target proteins. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the intersection genes were carried out with the program R to further screen key genes and effective compositions. On this basis, the compound with more optimal activity was screened and validated in vitro. RESULTS: In this study, 40 known monomer components were selected, and 1112 predicted genes, 1655 disease genes, 1425 differentially expressed genes, 1206 GO functions and 127 KEGG pathways were obtained. The results of molecular docking showed that the binding of MMP9 with drug components is stable. Through the comprehensive research of network pharmacology and experimental pharmacology, it was shown that T. maculata intervenes in the process of AMI through multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel synergistic effects. It is speculated that the anti-AMI effect may be related to the regulation of the Akt/FoxO/BCl signaling pathway. Cellular experiments showed that nicotiflorin has satisfactory anti-inflammatory activity and endothelial protection and can reduce the release of nitric oxide (NO), an inflammatory medium after endothelial cell damage. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the therapeutic effect and relative mechanism of extract of T. maculata extract on AMI. Analysis revealed that nicotiflorin from T. maculata is a compound with satisfactory anti-inflammatory activity and endothelial protection, which provides a new direction and treatment basis for further experimental exploration and clinical treatment.","Yu, Shangshang; Guo, Qi; Jia, Tianqian; Zhang, Xiaofei; Guo, Dongyan; Jia, Yanzhuo; Li, Jia; Sun, Jing",Drug Des Devel Ther,301,26

It is largely unknown how hospitalized patients conceptualize trust in their providers. OBJECTIVE: To examine the dimensionality of a measure of trust in the inpatient setting. DESIGN: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients (N = 1756; 76% response rate) across six hospitals in the midwestern USA. The sample was randomly split such that approximately one half was used in the EFA, and the other half in the CFA. MAIN MEASURES: The Trust in Physician Scale, adapted for inpatient care. KEY RESULTS: Based on the Kaiser-Guttman criterion and parallel analysis, EFAs were inconclusive, indicating that trust may be comprised of either one or two factors in this sample. In follow-up CFAs, a 2-factor model fit best based on a chi-squared difference test (Δχ(2) = 151.48(1), p < .001) and a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) difference test (CFI difference = .03). The overall fit for the 2-factor CFA model was good (χ(2) = 293.56, df = 43, p < .01; CFI = .95; RMSEA = .081 [90% confidence interval = .072–.090]; TLI = .93; SRMR = .04). Items loaded onto two factors related to cognitive (i.e., whether patients view providers as competent) and affective (i.e., whether patients view that providers care for them) dimensions of trust. CONCLUSIONS: While measures of trust in the outpatient setting have been validated as unidimensional, in the inpatient setting, trust appears to be composed of two factors: cognitive and affective trust. This provides initial evidence that inpatient providers may need to work to ensure patients see them as both competent and caring in order to gain their trust.","Gregory, Megan E.; Nyein, Kyi Phyu; Scarborough, Seth; Huerta, Timothy R.; McAlearney, Ann Scheck",J Gen Intern Med,301,30

While such variants are usually of no functional significance, in some cases they may allow the virus to transmit faster, change disease severity, or confer resistance to antiviral therapies. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of COVID-19, the virus has spread around the globe, and thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced. The rate of sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates is modest for an RNA virus but the enormous number of human-to-human transmission events has provided abundant opportunity for selection of sequence variants. Among these, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant, D614G, was not present in the presumptive common ancestor of this zoonotic virus but was first detected in late January in Germany and China. The D614G variant steadily increased in frequency and now constitutes >97% of isolates world-wide, raising the question whether D614G confers a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-2. Structural models predict that D614G would disrupt contacts between the S1 and S2 domains of the Spike protein and cause significant shifts in conformation. Using single-cycle vectors we showed that D614G is three to nine-fold more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung and colon cell lines, as well as on other human cell lines rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or by ACE2 orthologues from pangolin, pig, dog, or cat. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein retain full neutralization potency. These results suggest that D614G was selected for increased human-to-human transmission, that it contributed to the rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, and that it does not confer resistance to antiviral therapies targeting the receptor binding domain.","Yurkovetskiy, Leonid; Pascal, Kristen E.; Tomkins-Tinch, Christopher; Nyalile, Thomas; Wang, Yetao; Baum, Alina; Diehl, William E.; Dauphin, Ann; Carbone, Claudia; Veinotte, Kristen; Egri, Shawn B.; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Lemieux, Jacob E.; Munro, James; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Kyratsous, Christos A.; Shen, Kuang; Luban, Jeremy",bioRxiv,301,1

We applied the prioritisation method recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to rank infectious diseases, according to their relative importance for surveillance and public health, to inform future public health action in Belgium. METHODS: We applied the multi-criteria-decision-analysis approach. A working group of epidemiologists and statisticians from Belgium (n = 6) designed a balanced set of prioritisation criteria. A panel of Belgian experts (n = 80) allocated in an online survey each criteria a weight, according to perceived relative importance. Next, experts (n = 37) scored each disease against each criteria in an online survey, guided by disease-specific factsheets referring the period 2010–2016 in Belgium. The weighted sum of the criteria’s scores composed the final weighted score per disease, on which the ranking was based. Sensitivity analyses quantified the impact of eight alternative analysis scenarios on the top-20 ranked diseases. We identified criteria and diseases associated with data-gaps as those with the highest number of blank answers in the scoring survey. Principle components of the final weighted score were identified. RESULTS: Working groups selected 98 diseases and 18 criteria, structured in five criteria groups. The diseases ranked highest were (in order) pertussis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Among the five criteria groups, overall the highest weights were assigned to ‘impact on the patient’, followed by ‘impact on public health’, while different perceptions were identified between clinicians, microbiologists and epidemiologists. Among the 18 individual criteria, ‘spreading potential’ and ‘events requiring public health action’ were assigned the highest weights. Principle components clustered with thematic disease groups. Notable data gaps were found among hospital-related diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We ranked infectious diseases using a standardised reproducible approach. The diseases ranked highest are included in current public health programs, but additional reflection for example about needs among risk groups is recommended. Cross-reference of the obtained ranking with current programs is needed to verify whether resources and activities map priority areas. We recommend to implement this method in a recurrent evaluation cycle of national public health priorities.","Klamer, Sofieke; Van Goethem, Nina; Thomas, Daniel; Duysburgh, Els; Braeye, Toon; Quoilin, Sophie",BMC Public Health,301,1

However, all these data refer to regional settings and national data are still missing. We aimed to assess the OHCA incidence and population mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in whole Switzerland and in the different regions (Cantons) according to the infection rate. METHODS: We considered OHCAs and deaths which occurred in Switzerland after the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 (February 25th) and for the subsequent 65 days and in the same period in 2019. We also compared Cantons with high versus low COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: A 2.4% reduction in OHCA cases was observed in Switzerland. The reduction was particularly high (−21.4%) in high-incidence COVID-19 cantons, whilst OHCAs increased by 7.7% in low-incidence COVID-19 cantons. Mortality increased by 8.6% in the entire nation: a 27.8% increase in high-incidence cantons and a slight decrease (−0.7%) in low-incidence cantons was observed. The OHCA occurred more frequently at home, CPR and AED use by bystander were less frequent during the pandemic. Conversely, the OHCAs percentage in which a first responder was present, initiated the CPR and used an AED, increased. The outcome of patients in COVID-19 high-incidence cantons was worse compared to low-incidence cantons. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland mortality increased in Cantons with high-incidence of infection, whilst not in the low-incidence ones. OHCA occurrence followed an opposite trend showing how variables related to the health-system and EMS organization deeply influence OHCA occurrence during a pandemic.","Baldi, Enrico; Auricchio, Angelo; Klersy, Catherine; Burkart, Roman; Benvenuti, Claudio; Vanetta, Chiara; Bärtschi, Jürg",Resusc Plus,301,1

These clusters have involved both staff and patients and compromise staffing, bed management and routine care, especially delivery of elective surgical procedures. They have also contributed towards the overall morbidity and mortality of the pandemic. COVID-19 infection rates are rising again, so it is important to consider implementing additional activities designed to impede transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in acute hospitals. These aim to protect staff, patients and visitors, and conserve safe and continued access for patients needing routine and emergency surgical interventions. Current infection prevention strategies include hand hygiene; patient and staff screening; surveillance; personal protective equipment; cohorting and isolation; and enhanced cleaning. Additional activities include restriction of staff and patient movement; COVID-19 pathways for wards, operating theatres and outpatient services; bathroom management; and ensuring fresh air in the absence of effective mechanical ventilation systems. Seasonal pressures and spread of more contagious and/or vaccine-tolerant variants will continue to disrupt routine and emergency care of non-COVID-19 patients, as well as increase the risk of COVID-19 infection for staff and patients.

METHODS: We examined the individuals (n = 6331) that consulted two private diagnostic centers in Lahore, Pakistan, for COVID-19 testing between May 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020. The attending nurse collected clinical and demographic information. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing was positive in 1094 cases. Out of which, 5.2% had severe, and 20.8% had mild symptoms. We observed a strong association of COVID-19 severity with the number and type of comorbidities. The severity of the disease intensified as the number of comorbidities increased. The most vulnerable groups for the poor outcome are patients with diabetes and hypertension. Increasing age was also associated with PCR positivity and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of COVID-19 included in this study developed mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. Risk factors for adverse outcomes included older age and the simultaneous presence of comorbidities.","Shoaib, Naila; Noureen, Naila; Munir, Rimsha; Shah, Farhad Ali; Ishtiaq, Noshaba; Jamil, Nazia; Batool, Rida; Khalid, Mohammad; Khan, Ihsan; Iqbal, Naser; Zaidi, Nousheen",PLoS One,301,16

Partial but incomplete resolution of clinical signs and thoracic radiographic/computed tomographic imaging lesions were noted with use of susceptibility-guided antimicrobials. Additionally, a concern for an infectious nidus led to left cranial lung lobectomy at 9 months of age. Histopathology predominantly revealed polypoid and constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans (i.e., small airway disease). Intermittent antimicrobial administration over the next 5 years failed to blunt progressive clinical signs. At 8 years, necropsy confirmed severe airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. This pattern of fibrosis was strongly suggestive of underlying small airway disease as the trigger. In retrospect, post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO), a syndrome in young children caused by pulmonary infections but not yet recognized in pet dogs, likely initiated a pathway of fibrosis in this dog. In dogs with risk factors for community-acquired pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, PIBO is a differential diagnosis with development of severe, persistent respiratory signs incompletely responsive to appropriate antimicrobials. Untreated PIBO may lead to airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. Future study is required to determine if targeted therapy of PIBO could alter the course of end-stage pulmonary fibrosis.","Jaffey, Jared A.; Harmon, Mark; Masseau, Isabelle; Williams, Kurt J.; Reinero, Carol",Front Vet Sci,301,22

Here, we describe the elicitation of mucosal immunity to modulate the gut microbiota by oral delivery of living probiotics into Peyer’s patches. Probiotics are individually camouflaged within a yeast membrane, on which the embedded β-glucan can facilitate the phagocytosis of microfold cells that locate in the intestinal epithelium. The delivery of probiotics into lymphoid follicles after oral ingestion promotes robust mucosal immune responses and notably upgrades the production of secretory immunoglobulin A. The provoked immunity positively regulates the gut microflora, which, in turn, retains gut homeostasis and provides defense against environmental attacks. In two murine models of gut barrier impairment, oral administration with camouflaged probiotics effectively prevents the breakdown of intestinal barrier and evidences limited bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation.","Lin, Sisi; Mukherjee, Subhajit; Li, Juanjuan; Hou, Weiliang; Pan, Chao; Liu, Jinyao",Sci Adv,301,8

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. SETTING: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. PARTICIPANTS: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. RESULTS: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). CONCLUSION: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.","Cyrus, E.; Clarke, R.; Hadley, D.; Bursac, Z.; Trepka, MJ.; Dévieux, J.

We aimed to observe the dynamic changes of D-dimer levels during disease progression to evaluate their value for thrombosis. In this study, we report the clinical and laboratory results of 57 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 46 patients with confirmed community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP). And their concentrations of D-dimer, infection-related biomarkers, and conventional coagulation were retrospectively analyzed. The Padua prediction score is used to identify patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The results found that, on admission, both in COVID-19 patients and CAP patients, D-dimer levels were significantly increased, and compared with CAP patients, D-dimer levels were higher in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). Besides, we found that in COVID-19 patients, D-dimer were related with markers of inflammation, especially with hsCRP (R = 0.426, P < 0.05). However, there was low correlation between VTE score and D-dimer levels (Spearman’s R = 0.264, P > 0.05) weakened the role of D-dimer in the prediction of thrombosis. After treatments, D-dimer levels decreased which was synchronous with hsCRP levels in patients with good clinical prognosis, but there were still some patients with anomalous increasing D-dimer levels after therapy. In conclusion, elevated baseline D-dimer levels are associated with inflammation but not with VTE score in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that it is unreasonable to judge whether anticoagulation is needed only according to D-dimer levels. However, the abnormal changes of D-dimer and inflammatory factors suggest that anticoagulant therapy might be needed.

In this study, we performed modeling studies to obtain its 3D structure and NDM-1/antibiotics complex. It revealed that the hydrolytic mechanisms are highly conserved. In addition, the detailed analysis indicates that the more flexible and hydrophobic loop1, together with the evolution of more positive-charged loop2 leads to NDM-1 positive strain more potent and extensive in antibiotics resistance compared with other MBLs. Furthermore, through biological experiments, we revealed the molecular basis for antibiotics catalysis of NDM-1 on the enzymatic level. We found that NDM-1 enzyme was highly potent to degrade carbapenem antibiotics, while mostly susceptible to tigecycline, which had the ability to slow down the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1. Meanwhile, the mutagenesis experiments, including D124A, C208A, K211A and K211E, which displayed down-regulation on meropenem catalysis, proved the accuracy of our model.

Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations. RESULTS: 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (±10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression.

The 14-day quarantine caused surgery of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) postponed. We aimed to explore the risk factors of RRD progression in a group of patients whose surgery was postponed during the top-level emergency response of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case series. Medical records of all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of RRD who underwent a surgical treatment at Beijing Tongren Hospital’s retina service from February 16, 2020, to April 30, 2020 have been reviewed retrospectively. Medical history, symptoms, and clinical signs of progression of RRD were recorded. RRD progression was defined as the presence of either choroidal detachment or proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) progression during the quarantine period. Risk factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model, survival analysis, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-nine eyes of 79 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The median time from the patients’ presentation at the clinic to admission for surgery was 14 days (3–61 days). There were 70 cases (88.6%) who did not present to the hospital within 1 week of the onset of visual symptoms. There were 69 (87.3%) macular-off cases at the presentation and 27 (34.2%) cases combined with choroidal detachment. There were 49 (62.0%) cases with PVR B, 22 (27.8%) cases with PVR C, 4 (5.1%) cases with PVR D, and 4 (5.1%) cases with anterior PVR. After the 14-day quarantine, 21 (26.6%) cases showed RRD progression, and 9 cases showed RRD regression at the time of surgery. Neither the time of onset of the visual symptom (p = 0.46) nor the time between presentation and admission (p = 0.31) was significantly different between the patients with RRD progression and patients without RRD progression. The combination of choroidal detachment (3.07, 1.68-5.60, p<0.001) and retinal breaks located posterior to the equator (3.79, 1.21-11.80, p=0.02) were factors related to the progression of RRD. CONCLUSIONS: In our study during the COVID-19 outbreak, the RRD progression risk factors included a combination of choroidal detachment and retinal breaks posterior to the equator. Ophthalmologists should schedule the surgeries for RRD patients with these signs as soon as possible.","Zhao, Meng; Li, Jipeng; She, Haicheng; Liu, Ningpu",BMC Ophthalmol,301,20

Nous avons recensé des échantillons de malades ayant eu un dosage de la 25(OH)vitamine D3 pendant la période allant de mars 2020 à février 2021 au service de physiologie et d’exploration fonctionnelle de Sousse. Notre série comprend 852 patients dont 694 femmes et 157 hommes. L’âge moyen des patients est de 36 ans. L’évaluation du taux de la vitamine D3 a été le plus fréquemment motivée par une asthénie (29,9 %) suivie par les troubles phosphocalciques (19,2 %). Le contrôle après une supplémentation par la vitamine D3 concernait 7,9 % des patients. Le dosage de la Vitamine D3 a révélé un taux normal, une insuffisance ou une carence chez respectivement 14,2 %, 53,5 % et 32,3 % des malades. Trente malades étaient porteurs du COVID-19. Parmi ceux-ci 9 avaient une carence en Vitamine D3, 14 avaient une insuffisance et 5 étaient supplémentés. Le taux de vitamine D3 était significativement plus élevé uniquement dans le groupe des malades supplémentés en vitamine D3 (p <10−3). Par ailleurs il n’y a aucune corrélation significative entre l’atteinte par le COVID-19 et l’hypovitaminose D3 dans notre série (p =0,1775). Aucun motif de dosage de la Vitamine D3 n’a été significativement corrélé à l’hypovitaminose D3 sauf pour malades supplémentés. L’atteinte par le COVID-19 n’était pas associée significativement à une hypovitaminose D.","Elleuch, F.; Sallami, S.; Ben Abdsselem, I.; Zaouali, M.",Annales d'Endocrinologie,301,24

The rarity of the disease increases in the pediatric age group where only 4 cases of pediatric patients with PDAA. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: We present A case of a 2-year-old baby girl who was diagnosed with dorsalis pedis pseudoaneurysm, which was treated successfully with pseudoaneurysm dissection and anastomosis. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The dorsalis pedis pseudoaneurysm in this case has a rare anatomical location in addition to the unusual onset at this age group. Due to the rarity of this condition among all age groups, there is not a well-structured approach. CONCLUSION: DPAA/pseudoaneurysm is a rare entity in the field of vascular surgery. Medical treatment is not suitable for DPAA/pseudoaneurysm to avoid the future risk of thrombosis or ischemia. The surgical approach is the Mainstay of treatment.","Dahman, Mohammed; Alhomaidi, Yara; Albattah, Meshare; Howil, Abdulaziz A.; Alsultan, Abdullah M.; Alenazi, Nahar",Int J Surg Case Rep,301,16

The populations of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who have demonstrated better response to non-invasive ventilation are those with previous cardiac or respiratory disease, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By contrast, the use of non-invasive ventilation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia without these pre-existing diseases should be very cautious and under strict monitoring conditions, since there are increasing evidences that the unnecessary delay in intubation of those patients who fail treatment with non-invasive ventilation is associated with lower survival. Pulmonary complications of immunosuppressed patients are associated with high rates of intubation and mortality. The use of non-invasive ventilation in these patients may decrease the need for intubation and improve the poor outcome associated with these complications. Continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in several conditions characterised by alveolar collapse. While this is extremely useful in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the efficacy in pneumonia seems limited to immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary complications. Conversely, there are no sufficient evidences on the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia and severe acute respiratory failure.","Ferrer, Miquel; Cosentini, Roberto; Nava, Stefano",Eur J Intern Med,301,24

Measures required are likely to vary largely across regions and individual institutions, depending on the level of the strain imposed by the pandemic (e.g., number of inpatients infected with COVID‐19 and the availability of resources, including personal protective equipment and inpatient beds). Also, models suggest that second and third waves of COVID‐19 will occur before effective vaccines and medicines become widely available in Japan (expected time, 2–3 years). This guide should serve as a good reference for best practices in the management of HCC in light of the possible risk of impending collapse of the healthcare system due to a surge in COVID‐19 infections.","Kudo, Masatoshi; Kurosaki, Masayuki; Ikeda, Masafumi; Aikata, Hiroshi; Hiraoka, Atsushi; Torimura, Takuji; Sakamoto, Naoya",Hepatol Res,301,22

To understand the impact on transplant activity across the United States, and center‐level variation in testing, clinical practice, and policies, we conducted a national survey between March 24, 2020 and March 31, 2020 and linked responses to the COVID‐19 incidence map. Response rate was a very high 79.3%, reflecting a strong national priority to better understand COVID‐19. Complete suspension of live donor kidney transplantation was reported by 71.8% and live donor liver by 67.7%. While complete suspension of deceased donor transplantation was less frequent, some restrictions to deceased donor kidney transplantation were reported by 84.0% and deceased donor liver by 73.3%; more stringent restrictions were associated with higher regional incidence of COVID‐19. Shortage of COVID‐19 tests was reported by 42.5%. Respondents reported a total of 148 COVID‐19 recipients from <1 to >10 years posttransplant: 69.6% were kidney recipients, and 25.0% were critically ill. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was used by 78.1% of respondents; azithromycin by 46.9%; tocilizumab by 31.3%, and remdesivir by 25.0%. There is wide heterogeneity in center‐level response across the United States; ongoing national data collection, expert discussion, and clinical studies are critical to informing evidence‐based practices.","Boyarsky, Brian J.; Po‐Yu Chiang, Teresa; Werbel, William A.; Durand, Christine M.; Avery, Robin K.; Getsin, Samantha N.; Jackson, Kyle R.; Kernodle, Amber B.; Van Pilsum Rasmussen, Sarah E.; Massie, Allan B.; Segev, Dorry L.; Garonzik‐Wang, Jacqueline M.",Am J Transplant,301,20

However, this fraction depends heavily on the sampling intensity and the various test criteria used in different jurisdictions, and many sources indicate that a large fraction of cases tend to go undetected. METHODS: Estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population can be made by random sampling and pooling of RT-PCR tests. Here I use simulations to explore how experiment sample size and degrees of sample pooling impact precision of prevalence estimates and potential for minimizing the total number of tests required to get individual-level diagnostic results. RESULTS: Sample pooling can greatly reduce the total number of tests required for prevalence estimation. In low-prevalence populations, it is theoretically possible to pool hundreds of samples with only marginal loss of precision. Even when the true prevalence is as high as 10% it can be appropriate to pool up to 15 samples. Sample pooling can be particularly beneficial when the test has imperfect specificity by providing more accurate estimates of the prevalence than an equal number of individual-level tests. CONCLUSION: Sample pooling should be considered in COVID-19 prevalence estimation efforts.","Brynildsrud, Ola",BMC Med Res Methodol,301,16
