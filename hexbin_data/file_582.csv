This was expanded to include a classification of protein inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes in 2004. Each peptidase or inhibitor is assigned to a distinct identifier, based on its biochemical and biological properties, and homologous sequences are assembled into a family. Families in which the proteins share similar tertiary structures are assembled into a clan. The MEROPS classification is thus a hierarchy with at least three levels (protein‐species, family, and clan) showing the evolutionary relationship. Several other data collections have been assembled, which are accessed from all levels in the hierarchy. These include, sequence homologs, selective bibliographies, substrate cleavage sites, peptidase–inhibitor interactions, alignments, and phylogenetic trees. The substrate cleavage collection has been assembled from the literature and includes physiological, pathological, and nonphysiological cleavages in proteins, peptides, and synthetic substrates. In this article, we make recommendations about how best to analyze these data and show analyses to indicate peptidase binding site preferences and exclusions. We also identify peptidases where co‐operative binding occurs between adjacent binding sites.","Rawlings, Neil D.; Bateman, Alex",Protein Sci,582,1

Cluster randomised controlled trials in two endemic localities for Ae. aegypti of south Mexico, showed that ITS conferred both, immediate and sustained (~2 yr) impact on indoor-female Ae. aegypti infestations. Such encouraging results require further validation with studies quantifying more epidemiologically-related endpoints, including arbovirus infection in Ae. aegypti. We evaluated the efficacy of protecting houses with ITS on Ae. aegypti infestation and arbovirus infection during a Zika outbreak in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluated the entomological efficacy of ITS compared to the absence of ITS (with both arms able to receive routine arbovirus vector control) in the neighbourhood Juan Pablo II of Merida. Cross-sectional entomological surveys quantified indoor adult mosquito infestation and arbovirus infection at baseline (pre-ITS installation) and throughout two post-intervention (PI) surveys spaced at 6-month intervals corresponding to dry/rainy seasons over one year (2016–2017). Household-surveys assessed the social reception of the intervention. Houses with ITS were 79–85% less infested with Aedes females than control houses up to one-year PI. A similar significant trend was observed for blood-fed Ae. aegypti females (76–82%). Houses with ITS had significantly less infected female Ae. aegypti than controls during the peak of the epidemic (OR = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.08–0.29), an effect that was significant up to a year PI (OR = 0.24, 0.15–0.39). Communities strongly accepted the intervention, due to its perceived mode of action, the prevalent risk for Aedes-borne diseases in the area, and the positive feedback from neighbours receiving ITS. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show evidence of the protective efficacy of ITS against an arboviral disease of major relevance, and discuss the relevance of our findings for intervention adoption.","Manrique-Saide, Pablo; Herrera-Bojórquez, Josué; Medina-Barreiro, Anuar; Trujillo-Peña, Emilio; Villegas-Chim, Josué; Valadez-González, Nina; Ahmed, Ahmed M.

The purpose of this systematic review was to determine which indications for DC have evidence that they are reliable and/or valid (and therefore in which clinical situations evidence supports use of DC or that DC improves outcomes). METHODS: We searched 11 databases (1950–April 1, 2019) for studies that enrolled exclusively civilian trauma patients and reported data on the reliability (consistency of surgical decisions in a given clinical scenario) or content (surgeons would perform DC in that clinical scenario or the indication predicted use of DC in practice), construct (were associated with poor outcomes), or criterion (were associated with improved outcomes when DC was conducted instead of definitive surgery) validity for suggested indications for DC surgery or DC interventions. RESULTS: Among 34,979 citations identified, we included 36 cohort studies and three cross-sectional surveys in the systematic review. Of the 59 unique indications for DC identified, 10 had evidence of content validity [e.g., a major abdominal vascular injury or a packed red blood cell (PRBC) volume exceeding the critical administration threshold], nine had evidence of construct validity (e.g., unstable patients with combined abdominal vascular and pancreas gunshot injuries or an iliac vessel injury and intraoperative acidosis), and six had evidence of criterion validity (e.g., penetrating trauma patients requiring > 10 U PRBCs with an abdominal vascular and multiple abdominal visceral injuries or intraoperative hypothermia, acidosis, or coagulopathy). No studies evaluated the reliability of indications. CONCLUSIONS: Few indications for DC surgery or DC interventions have evidence supporting that they are reliable and/or valid. DC should be used with respect for the uncertainty regarding its effectiveness, and only in circumstances where definitive surgery cannot be entertained.

To extend our previous review on extrapulmonary tuberculosis (Kohli 2018), we performed this update to inform updated WHO policy (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 3) 2020). OBJECTIVES: To estimate diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, 2 August 2019 and 28 January 2020 (Xpert Ultra studies), without language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cross‐sectional and cohort studies using non‐respiratory specimens. Forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis: tuberculous meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, disseminated tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture and a study‐defined composite reference standard (tuberculosis detection); phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays (rifampicin resistance detection). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS‐2. For tuberculosis detection, we performed separate analyses by specimen type and reference standard using the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). We applied a latent class meta‐analysis model to three forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: 69 studies: 67 evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF and 11 evaluated Xpert Ultra, of which nine evaluated both tests. Most studies were conducted in China, India, South Africa, and Uganda. Overall, risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains, and low (49%) or unclear (43%) for the reference standard domain. Applicability for the patient selection domain was unclear for most studies because we were unsure of the clinical settings. Cerebrospinal fluid Xpert Ultra (6 studies) Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 89.4% (79.1 to 95.6) (89 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 91.2% (83.2 to 95.7) (386 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculous meningitis, 168 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive: of these, 79 (47%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives) and 832 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative: of these, 11 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). Xpert MTB/RIF (30 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 71.1% (62.8 to 79.1) (571 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 96.9% (95.4 to 98.0) (2824 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculous meningitis, 99 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive: of these, 28 (28%) would not have tuberculosis; and 901 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative: of these, 29 (3%) would have tuberculosis. Pleural fluid Xpert Ultra (4 studies) Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 75.0% (58.0 to 86.4) (158 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 87.0% (63.1 to 97.9) (240 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have pleural tuberculosis, 192 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive: of these, 117 (61%) would not have tuberculosis; and 808 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative: of these, 25 (3%) would have tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/RIF (25 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 49.5% (39.8 to 59.9) (644 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 98.9% (97.6 to 99.7) (2421 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have pleural tuberculosis, 60 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive: of these, 10 (17%) would not have tuberculosis; and 940 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative: of these, 50 (5%) would have tuberculosis. Lymph node aspirate Xpert Ultra (1 study) Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) against composite reference standard were 70% (51 to 85) (30 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 100% (92 to 100) (43 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have lymph node tuberculosis, 70 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive and 0 (0%) would not have tuberculosis; 930 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative and 30 (3%) would have tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/RIF (4 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against composite reference standard were 81.6% (61.9 to 93.3) (377 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 96.4% (91.3 to 98.6) (302 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have lymph node tuberculosis, 118 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive and 37 (31%) would not have tuberculosis; 882 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative and 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis. In lymph node aspirate, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity against culture was 86.2% (78.0 to 92.3), lower than that against a composite reference standard. Using the latent class model, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity was 99.5% (99.1 to 99.7), similar to that observed with a composite reference standard. Rifampicin resistance Xpert Ultra (4 studies) Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% (95.1 to 100.0), (24 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 100.0% (99.0 to 100.0) (105 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive (resistant): of these, zero (0%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative (susceptible): of these, zero (0%) would have rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF (19 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 96.5% (91.9 to 98.8) (148 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and 99.1% (98.0 to 99.7) (822 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 105 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive (resistant): of these, 8 (8%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 895 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative (susceptible): of these, 3 (0.3%) would have rifampicin resistance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF may be helpful in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens: while for most specimens specificity is high, the tests rarely yield a positive result for people without tuberculosis. For tuberculous meningitis, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity than Xpert MTB/RIF against culture. Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF had similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance. Future research should acknowledge the concern associated with culture as a reference standard in paucibacillary specimens and consider ways to address this limitation.","Kohli, Mikashmi; Schiller, Ian; Dendukuri, Nandini; Yao, Mandy; Dheda, Keertan; Denkinger, Claudia M; Schumacher, Samuel G; Steingart, Karen R",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,582,1

Over the past 50 years, the electrolyte leakage method has emerged as a popular and practical method for quantifying the amount of damage inflicted on plant tissue by exposure to freezing temperatures. Numerous approaches for carrying out this method and analyzing the resultant data have emerged. These include multiple systems for standardizing and modeling raw electrolyte leakage data and multiple protocols for boiling or autoclaving samples in order to maximize leakage as a positive control. We compare four different routines for standardization of leakage data and assess a novel control method—immersion in liquid nitrogen in lieu of traditional autoclaving—and apply them to woody twigs collected from 12 maple (Acer) species in early spring. We compare leakage data from these samples using each of four previously published forms of data analysis and autoclaving vs. liquid nitrogen controls and validate each of these approaches against visual estimates of freezing damage and differential thermal analysis. RESULTS: Through presentation of our own data and re-analysis of previously published findings, we show that standardization of raw data against estimates of both minimum and maximum attainable freezing damage allows for reliable estimation of cold hardiness at the species level and across studies in diverse systems. Furthermore, use of our novel liquid nitrogen control produces data commensurate across studies and enhances the consistency and realism of the electrolyte leakage method, especially for very cold hardy samples. CONCLUSION: Future leakage studies that relativize data against minimum and maximum leakage and that employ our updated liquid nitrogen control will contribute generalizable, repeatable, and realistic data to the existing body of cold hardiness research in woody plants. Data from studies conducted using a liquid nitrogen (and not an autoclaving) control can still be compared to previously published data, especially when raw data are standardized using the best-performing approach among those we assessed. Electrolyte leakage of woody twigs emerges as a useful technique for quickly assessing the probability of tissue death in response to freezing in dormant plants. Differential thermal analysis may provide different and complementary information on cold hardiness.

METHODS: We reviewed the records of 112 patients with TAMG after thymectomy between January 2010 and December 2019 in Peking University People’s Hospital. Demographic, pathological, preoperative data and the Anesthesia, surgery details were assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis to predict the risk of prolonged ventilation after thymectomy. A nomogram to predict the probability of post-thymectomy ventilation was constructed with R software. Discrimination and calibration were employed to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. RESULTS: By multivariate analysis, male, low vital capacity (VC), Osserman classification (IIb, III, IV), total intravenous anesthesia, and long operation time were identified as the risk factors and entered into the nomogram. The nomogram showed a robust discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0. 835 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.757–0.913). The calibration plot indicated that the nomogram-predicted probabilities compared very well with the actual probabilities (Hosmer–Lemeshow test: P = 0.921).

A wide variety of data sources are used for surveillance purposes. Some data sources were designed for the purpose of surveillance while other data sources are used secondarily for surveillance. To improve the timeliness and quality of surveillance data while simultaneously minimizing cost, surveillance networks and Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) were developed. Surveillance networks allow developing countries to participate in surveillance, establishing early warning of outbreaks. HIEs facilitate access to and retrieval of patient clinical data to support more efficient, timely, effective, equitable, and safe healthcare and to enhance case reporting. Seroepidemiology is the systematic collection and testing of blood samples from a target population to identify current and past experiences with infectious diseases by means of biological markers. Data from serological surveys can reveal total burden of current and past, as well as apparent and inapparetnt infections. Surveillance and seroepidemiology have provided critical epidemiologic information to support public health policy at the local, national, and international levels.","Jiles, Ruth; Klevens, Monina; Hughes, Elizabeth",Viral Infections of Humans,582,12

Its seasonal phenology, temperature and land use preference related to oviposition in newly colonised regions remain unclear, especially in the context of co-occurring native mosquito species. METHODS: Focussing on regions in Germany known to be infested by Ae. japonicus japonicus, we installed ovitraps in different landscapes and their transition zones and recorded the oviposition activity of mosquitoes in relation to season, temperature and land use (arable land, forest, settlement) in two field seasons (May–August 2017, April–November 2018). RESULTS: Ae. japonicus japonicus eggs and larvae were encountered in 2017 from June to August and in 2018 from May to November, with a markedly high abundance from June to September in rural transition zones between forest and settlement, limited to water temperatures below 30 °C. Of the three native mosquito taxa using the ovitraps, the most frequent was Culex pipiens s.l., whose offspring was found in high numbers from June to August at water temperatures of up to 35 °C. The third recorded species, Anopheles plumbeus, rarely occurred in ovitraps positioned in settlements and on arable land, but was often associated with Ae. japonicus japonicus. The least frequent species, Aedes geniculatus, was mostly found in ovitraps located in the forest. CONCLUSIONS: The transition zone between forest and settlement was demonstrated to be the preferred oviposition habitat of Ae. japonicus japonicus, where it was also the most frequent container-inhabiting mosquito species in this study. Compared to native taxa, Ae. japonicus japonicus showed an extended seasonal activity period, presumably due to tolerance of colder water temperatures. Higher water temperatures and arable land represent distribution barriers to this species. The frequently co-occurring native species An. plumbeus might be useful as an indicator for potentially suitable oviposition habitats of Ae. japonicus japonicus in hitherto uncolonised regions. The results contribute to a better understanding of mosquito ecology and provide a basis for more targeted monitoring, distribution modelling and risk management of mosquitoes.

Inadvertent subclavian artery (SCA) puncture is a rare complication associated with internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization. We determined the position of the SCA by ultrasonography, and propose a needle-insertion position for avoiding inadvertent SCA puncture. METHODS We positioned an ultrasound probe at an angle of 60° to the skin to mimic a puncture needle halfway between the clavicle and the angle of the mandible (center) and moved the probe parallel to the right IJV (RIJV) toward the clavicle until locating the SCA. We measured the distance from the clavicle to the probe 60 and from the probe to the SCA (P60-SCA) where the SCA was visible by ultrasonography. RESULTS For 50 volunteers with a mean age of 27.3 years, the center position was, on average, 67 mm from the clavicle. The image of the SCA appeared within 65 mm of the clavicle. P60-SCA differed significantly between men and women (p = 0.0058). For 45 volunteers, P60-SCA was <25 mm with the probe 65 mm from the clavicle on the skin. RIJVP-SCA averaged 4.4 mm. Only P60-SCA correlated well with BMI for men (r = 0.732, p = 0.0068). CONCLUSION Puncturing the RIJV away from the center should avoid SCA puncture; puncturing it while approaching the clavicle is more dangerous. The exact location of the SCA varies from person to person; thus, confirming SCA position by ultrasonography is recommended every time before puncturing.","Imai, Keiko; Kayashima, Kenji",Journal of anesthesia,582,1

Olfactory dysfunction was reported more commonly in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (P < .001), and outpatients paradoxically reported loss of smell more commonly than inpatients (P = .02). Headaches were present in 52% of patients with olfactory dysfunction.

In addition, the relationship between early vessel signs on imaging studies and clot compositions has been poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between clot composition and stroke etiology following mechanical thrombectomy and to investigate the effect of varied clot compositions on gradient-echo MR imaging of clots. MATERIALS AND METHODS Histopathologic analysis of retrieved clots from 37 patients with acute MCA occlusion was performed. Patients underwent gradient-echo imaging before endovascular therapy. Retrieved clots underwent semiquantitative proportion analysis to quantify red blood cells, fibrin, platelets, and white blood cells by area. Correlations between clot compositions and stroke subtypes and susceptibility vessel signs on gradient-echo imaging were assessed. RESULTS Stroke etiology was classified as cardioembolism in 22 patients (59.4%), large-artery atherosclerosis in 8 (21.6%), and undetermined in 7 (18.9%). The clots from cardioembolism had a significantly higher proportion of red blood cells (37.8% versus 16.9%, P = .031) and a lower proportion of fibrin (32.3% versus 48.5%, P = .044) compared with those from large-artery atherosclerosis. The proportion of red blood cells was significantly higher in clots with a susceptibility vessel sign than in those without it (48.0% versus 1.9%, P < .001), whereas the proportions of fibrin (26.4% versus 57.0%, P < .001) and platelets (22.6% versus 36.9%, P = .011) were significantly higher in clots without a susceptibility vessel sign than those with it. CONCLUSIONS The histologic composition of clots retrieved from cerebral arteries in patients with acute stroke differs between those with cardioembolism and large-artery atherosclerosis. In addition, a susceptibility vessel sign on gradient-echo imaging is strongly associated with a high proportion of red blood cells and a low proportion of fibrin and platelets in retrieved clots.","Kim, S K; Yoon, W; Kim, T S; Kim, H S; Heo, T W; Park, M S",AJNR.

AIMS To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a pilot multifactorial intervention to reduce potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults. METHODS We conducted a phase 2, feasibility, open-label study in the ambulatory setting of an integrated healthcare network in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We recruited primary care physicians (PCPs) and measured PIM use in a sample of their patients (65 years or older). Educational workshops for PCPs were organized with the involvement of clinician champions. Practical deprescribing algorithms were designed based on Beers criteria. Automatic email alerts based on specific PIMs recorded in each patient's electronic health record were used as a reminder tool. PCPs were responsible for deprescribing decisions. We randomly sampled 879 patients taking PIMs from eight of the most commonly used drug classes at our institution and compared basal (6 months prior to the intervention) and final (12 months after) prevalence of PIM use using a test of proportions. RESULTS There was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in all drug classes evaluated. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (basal prevalence 5.92%; final 1.59%); benzodiazepines (10.13%; 6.94%); histamine antagonists (7.74%; 3.07%); opioids (2.16%; 1.25%); tricyclic antidepressants (8.08%; 4.10%); muscle relaxants (7.74%; 3.41%), anti-hypertensives (3.53%; 1.82%) and oxybutynin (2.96%; 1.82%). The absolute reduction in the overall prevalence was 8.5 percentage points (relative reduction of 51.4%).

Identifying subgroups of pregnant women at high risk of poor adaptation might optimize clinical screening and intervention, which could, in turn, contribute to mitigating the potentially devastating effects of prenatal stress on mothers and fetus. Level of personality functioning may be a good indicator of who may be more vulnerable to distress in challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, as adults with high levels of personality dysfunction may experience significant difficulties in mentalizing threatening situations. The aims of the present study are (a) to determine the impact of level of personality pathology on affective, behavioral, and thought problems in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (b) to test a model where mentalization of trauma mediates the impact of personality pathology on symptomatology. Data from 1,207 French-Canadian pregnant women recruited through social media during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Latent profile analysis, using the Criterion A elements of the alternative model for personality disorders (Identity, Self-Direction, Empathy, Intimacy) as latent indicators, yielded four profiles: Healthy, Mild Self-Impairment, Intimacy Impairment, and Personality Disorder. Profiles showed significant associations with diverse indicators of symptomatology. Mediation models showed both direct and indirect (through mentalization of trauma) significant associations between level of personality functioning and affective/behavioral/thought problems.

METHODS The charts of 30 thoracoscopic resections for congenital lung diseases were retrospectively reviewed. This study compared 17 children younger than 6 months (mean, 3.94 months; range, 0.37-5.7 months; group 1) with 13 children older than 6 months (mean, 12.05 months; range, 6.2-24.63 months; group 2) at the time of surgery. The median follow-up period was 9 months (range, 1-41 months). RESULTS Lobectomy was performed in 27 cases, bilobectomy in 1 case, and nonanatomic excision in 2 cases. The mean operating time for group 1 (176±54 min) was similar to that for group 2 (160±46 min). The difference is not significant. The mean duration of chest tube drainage was similar in the two groups (4.4 days; range, 1-9 days for group 1 vs. 4.1 days; range, 3-8 days for group 2). The complications included 1 major and 10 minor complications, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Three surgical procedures in each group were converted.

The exponential community spread of disease limited the time for development and training. METHODS The goals of our workflow and process development were to maximize safety for staff and patients, minimize the risk of contamination, and reduce the waste of unused supplies and materials. We used a cyclical improvement system and the plus/delta debriefing method to rapidly develop workflows consisting of sequential checklists and procedure-specific packs. RESULTS We designed independent workflows for labor analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, conversion of labor analgesia to cesarean anesthesia, and general anesthesia. In addition, we created procedure-specific material packs to optimize supplies and prevent wastage. Finally, we generated sequential checklists to allow staff to perform standard operating procedures without extensive training. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, these workflows and tools allowed our staff to urgently care for patients in high-risk situations without prior experience.

Although disease manifestations are infrequent, the virus is still present in pig herds, causing sporadic outbreaks in a milder form. Identification and characterisation of the spike genes from TGEV and PRCoV, detected in such outbreaks, were performed in Hungary. Analysis of the amplified partial gene sequences showed that TGEV was present in herds with TGE clinical signs together with PRCoV.

Denitrification is a critical process for transferring soil N to the atmosphere. Denitrifying bacterial communities in soil are indicative of the soil quality of a functional ecosystem. We investigated the effects of physicochemical properties of soil on the diversity and activity of denitrifiers in the top-soil and sub-soil of two typical montane riparian meadows: a multi-colored and a flood-plain meadow. Illumina MiSeq 2500 sequencing of nirS showed that the multi-colored meadow had greater diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers than the flood-plain meadow and that the total N content, ammonium content, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in soil differed significantly between the two types of meadows. The abundances of dominant denitrifiers at phylum and genus levels showed different responses to the two soil layers of the two meadow types. In top-soils, the highest abundance of Firmicutes was recorded in the multi-colored meadow, while in the flood-plain meadow, there was the highest abundance of Proteobacteria. The Actinobacteria abundance was the highest in top-soil and sub-soil of the flood-plain meadow. The abundance of Chloroflexi was the highest in top-soil of the flood-plain meadow and in sub-soil of the multi-colored meadow. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria was strongly influenced by variations of soil properties down the soil profile. Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed that the diversity and community composition of denitrifying bacteria were strongly associated with most of the soil properties. Therefore, physicochemical soil properties, and particularly the organic carbon, nitrate, and ammonium contents, influence the diversity and abundance of denitrifiers in soil.","Han, Xiaoli; Huang, Chunguo; Khan, Shahbaz; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chen, Yinglong; Guo, Jinping",Environmental science and pollution research international,582,1

This approach may be useful for maternal and child health home visitors who provide direct services and facilitate connections to community resources for client families. However, little is known about the effectiveness of warm handoffs. METHODS A systematic review of the literature on warm handoffs was conducted with studies identified in four databases. Full text was reviewed for studies for which abstracts met inclusion criteria or for which abstracts were not available. Evidence tables summarizing study characteristics, outcome measures and data sources, intervention descriptions, intervention components, and study results were constructed. RESULTS Of the 42,816 unique articles identified, 32,163 titles/abstracts were screened, 227 qualified for full text review, and five comprised the study sample. Three studies examined referrals from substance use treatment centers to self-help groups, one from federally qualified health centers to community mental health clinics, and one from a mobile needle exchange program to substance use treatment/intake. Three studies showed increases in receipt of services by clients following referral between the warm handoff intervention and control group.

Its effectiveness remains disputed due to the limited number of robust high-quality investigations. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of multimodality cyclical pressure Topical Wound Oxygen (TWO2) home care therapy in healing refractory diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that had failed to heal with standard of care (SOC) alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with diabetes and chronic DFUs were randomized (double-blind) to either active TWO2 therapy or sham control therapy-both in addition to optimal SOC. The primary outcome was the percentage of ulcers in each group achieving 100% healing at 12 weeks. A group sequential design was used for the study with three predetermined analyses and hard stopping rules once 73, 146, and ultimately 220 patients completed the 12-week treatment phase. RESULTS At the first analysis point, the active TWO2 arm was found to be superior to the sham arm, with a closure rate of 41.7% compared with 13.5%. This difference in outcome produced an odds ratio (OR) of 4.57 (97.8% CI 1.19, 17.57), P = 0.010. After adjustment for University of Texas Classification (UTC) ulcer grade, the OR increased to 6.00 (97.8% CI 1.44, 24.93), P = 0.004. Cox proportional hazards modeling, also after adjustment for UTC grade, demonstrated >4.5 times the likelihood to heal DFUs over 12 weeks compared with the sham arm with a hazard ratio of 4.66 (97.8% CI 1.36, 15.98), P = 0.004. At 12 months postenrollment, 56% of active arm ulcers were closed compared with 27% of the sham arm ulcers (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS This sham-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrates that, at both 12 weeks and 12 months, adjunctive cyclical pressurized TWO2 therapy was superior in healing chronic DFUs compared with optimal SOC alone.","Frykberg, Robert G; Franks, Peter J; Edmonds, Michael; Brantley, Jonathan N; Téot, Luc; Wild, Thomas; Garoufalis, Matthew G; Lee, Aliza M; Thompson, Janette A; Reach, Gérard; Dove, Cyaandi R; Lachgar, Karim; Grotemeyer, Dirk; Renton, Sophie C",Diabetes care,582,1

With the evolution of robotics, advanced techniques including retro rectus mesh reinforcement, and component separation are being popularized. However, these procedures require more dissection, and longer operative times. In this study we reviewed our experience with robotic ventral/incisional hernia repair (RVHR) with hernia defect closure (HDC) and IPOM. METHODS Retrospective chart review and follow-up of 31 consecutive cases of ventral/incisional hernia treated between August 2011 and December 2018. Demographics, operative times, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), hernia size, location, and type, mesh size and type, recurrence, conversion to open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) and complications including bleeding, seroma formation and infection were analyzed. RESULTS Mean age was 63.9 years old, with median BMI of 31.24 kg/m2. Median hernia area was 17 cm2. Mean operating time was 142.61 min (SD 59.79). Mean LOS was 1.46 days (range 1-5), with 48% being outpatient, and overnight stay in 32% for pain control. Conversion was necessary in 12.9% cases. Complication rate was 3% for enterotomy. Recurrence was 14.81% after a mean follow-up of 26.96 months. There was significant association of recurrence with COPD history (P = 0.0215) and multiple hernia defects (P = 0.0376).

Serological testing is the primary means of diagnosis but testing approaches differ widely, with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, there is currently no reliable test to determine disease resolution following treatment. A distinct challenge in Lyme disease diagnostics is the variable patterns of human immune response to a plurality of antigens presented by Borrelia spp. during the infection. Thus, multiplexed testing approaches that capture these patterns and detect serological response against multiple antigens may be the key to prompt, accurate Lyme disease diagnosis. In this review, current state-of-the-art multiplexed diagnostic approaches are presented and compared with respect to their diagnostic accuracy and their potential for monitoring response to treatment.","Chou, Eunice; Minor, Armond; Cady, Nathaniel C",Experimental biology and medicine,582,16

However, there is much debate about the diagnostic accuracy of this instrument. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of lung auscultation for the most common respiratory pathologies. Studies concerning adult patients with respiratory symptoms are included. Main outcomes are pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals, likelihood ratios (LRs), area under the curve (AUC) of lung auscultation for different pulmonary pathologies and breath sounds. A meta-regression analysis is performed to reduce observed heterogeneity. For 34 studies the overall pooled sensitivity for lung auscultation is 37% and specificity 89%. LRs and AUC of auscultation for congestive heart failure, pneumonia and obstructive lung diseases are low, LR- and specificity are acceptable. Abnormal breath sounds are highly specific for (hemato)pneumothorax in patients with trauma. Results are limited by significant heterogeneity. Lung auscultation has a low sensitivity in different clinical settings and patient populations, thereby hampering its clinical utility. When better diagnostic modalities are available, they should replace lung auscultation. Only in resource limited settings, with a high prevalence of disease and in experienced hands, lung auscultation has still a role.","Arts, Luca; Lim, Endry Hartono Taslim; van de Ven, Peter Marinus; Heunks, Leo; Tuinman, Pieter R",Scientific reports,582,12

Risk factors for dementia such as hypertension and diabetes are more common in Black, Asian, and other ethnic minorities. There are also marked ethnic inequalities in care seeking, likelihood of diagnosis, and uptake of treatments for dementia. Nevertheless, ethnic differences in dementia incidence and prevalence remain under-explored. OBJECTIVE To examine published peer-reviewed observational studies comparing age-specific or age-adjusted incidence or prevalence rates of dementia between at least two ethnic groups. METHODS We searched seven databases on 1 September 2019 using search terms for ethnicity, dementia, and incidence or prevalence. We included population-based studies comparing incidence or prevalence of dementia after accounting for age of at least two ethnic groups in adults aged 18 or more. Meta-analysis was conducted for eligible ethnic comparisons. RESULTS We included 12 cohort studies and seven cross-sectional studies. Thirteen were from the US, and two studies each from the UK, Singapore, and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China. The pooled risk ratio for dementia incidence obtained from four studies comparing Black and White ethnic groups was 1.33 (95% CI 1.07-1.65; I-squared = 58.0%). The pooled risk ratio for dementia incidence comparing the Asian and White ethnic groups was 0.86 (95% CI 0.728-1.01; I-squared = 43.9%). There was no difference in the incidence of dementia for Latino ethnic group compared to the White ethnic group. CONCLUSION Evidence to date suggest there are ethnic differences in risk of dementia.

METHODS Participants (N = 1,770) underwent primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and were followed ≤7 years in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2, a multicenter US cohort study. Alimentary limb and biliopancreatic limb lengths were measured according to research protocol; common channel was measured in a subsample (N = 547). Aimentary limb, biliopancreatic limb, and common channel ratio to total small bowel length were calculated. RESULTS Median presurgery body mass index was 46 (25th-75th percentile: 43-51) kg/m2. Medians (25th-75th percentiles) for alimentary limb length were 125 cm (100-150), for biliopancreatic limb length were 50 cm (50-60), and common channel length were 410 cm (322-520). Statistics for ratios to the small bowel length were 0.23 (0.18-0.27) for alimentary limb, 0.09 (0.07-0.10) for biliopancreatic limb, and 0.69 (0.63-0.73) for common length. There were no significant associations between alimentary limb, biliopancreatic limb, common channel, alimentary limb ratio, biliopancreatic limb ratio or common channel ratio, and either weight loss or improvement in cardiometabolic outcomes.

In humans, the seriousness of infection caused by a coronavirus in the respiratory tract can vary from mild to lethal. A serious illness can be developed in old people and those with underlying medical problems like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease. For the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease, due to the growing number of cases, a limited number of test kits for COVID-19 are available in the hospitals. Hence, it is important to implement an automated system as an immediate alternative diagnostic option to pause the spread of COVID-19 in the population. OBJECTIVE This paper proposes a deep learning model for classification of coronavirus infected patient detection using chest X-ray radiographs. METHODS A fully connected convolutional neural network model is developed to classify healthy and diseased X-ray radiographs. The proposed neural network model consists of seven convolutional layers with rectified linear unit, softmax (last layer) activation functions and max pooling layers which were trained using the publicly available COVID-19 dataset. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION For validation of the proposed model, the publicly available chest X-ray radiograph dataset consisting COVID-19 and normal patient's images were used. Considering the performance of the results that are evaluated based on various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, MSE, RMSE & accuracy, it is seen that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model is 98.07%.","Rao, P Srinivasa; Bheemavarapu, Pradeep; Kalyampudi, P S Latha; Rao, T V Madhusudhana",Current medical imaging,582,10

After fragmentation is completed and concretions are extracted, conventional irrigation with saline dissolves the polymer, which is then flushed out. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 68 subjects with a single stone in the proximal ureter and an indication for ureteroscopic lithotripsy were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multisite clinical study. Each subject was randomly assigned to the BackStop group (34) or the control group (34 with no antiretropulsion device). For subjects in the experimental group BackStop was dispensed into the ureter above the stone using a 3Fr or 5Fr catheter. Ureteroscopic lithotripsy was performed in all subjects using pneumatic or laser energy. Measured end points included the retropulsion rate, the need for subsequent procedures, the stone-free rate at followup, the occurrence of adverse events and ureteral occlusion, if any, and post-stone fragmentation and extraction. RESULTS Subjects randomized to the BackStop group experienced a statistically significant (p = 0.0002) lower rate of retropulsion (8.8%, 3 of 34) vs the control group (52.9%, 18/34). There were no adverse events in the BackStop group and BackStop was successfully dissolved in every subject, resulting in a patent ureter. CONCLUSIONS BackStop appears to be a novel, safe and effective means of preventing stone fragment retropulsion during ureteroscopic lithotripsy for the management of ureteral stones.","Rane, Abhay; Bradoo, Anil; Rao, Pradeep; Shivde, Subodh; Elhilali, Mostafa; Anidjar, Maurice; Pace, Kenneth; D'A Honey, John R",The Journal of urology,582,17

Recent case reports found that long-deceased cadavers can produce capnographic waveforms. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of waveform capnography for endotracheal tube placement verification and detection of misplacement using a cadaveric experimental model. METHODS We conducted a controlled experiment with two intubated cadavers. Tubes were placed within the trachea, esophagus, and hypopharynx utilizing video laryngoscopy. We recorded observations of capnographic waveforms and quantitative end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) values during tracheal versus extratracheal (i.e., esophageal and hypopharyngeal) ventilations. RESULTS 106 and 89 tracheal ventilations delivered to cadavers one and two, respectively (n=195) all produced characteristic alveolar waveforms (positive) with ETCO2 values ranging 2-113mmHg. 42 esophageal ventilations (36 to cadaver one and 6 to cadaver two), and 6 hypopharyngeal ventilations (4 to cadaver one and 2 to cadaver two) all resulted in non-alveolar waveforms (negative) with ETCO2 values of 0mmHg. Esophageal and hypopharyngeal measurements were categorized as extratracheal (n=48). A binary classification test showed no false negatives or false positives, indicating 100% sensitivity (NPV 1.0, 95%CI 0.98-1.00) and 100% specificity (PPV 1.0, 95%CI 0.93-1.00). CONCLUSION Though current guidelines question the reliability of waveform capnography for verifying endotracheal tube location during low-perfusion states such as cardiac arrest, our findings suggest that it is highly sensitive and specific.","Silvestri, Salvatore; Ladde, Jay G; Brown, James F; Roa, Jesus V; Hunter, Christopher; Ralls, George A; Papa, Linda",Resuscitation,582,26

The effects of SILC technique on oxidative stress have not been well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic cholecystectomy techniques on systemic oxidative stress by using ischemia modified albumin (IMA). METHODS In total, 70 patients who had been diagnosed with benign gallbladder pathology were enrolled for this prospective study. Twenty-one patients underwent SILC and 49 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). All operations were performed under a standard anesthesia protocol. Serum IMA levels were analysed before operation, 45 minutes and 24 hours after operation. RESULTS Demographics and preoperative characteristics of the patients were similiar in each group. The mean duration of operation was 37.5 ± 12.5 and 44.6 ± 14.3 minutes in LC and SILC group, respectively. In both groups, there was no statistically significant difference in hospital stay, operative time, or conversion to open surgery. Operative technique did not effect the 45th minute and 24th hour IMA levels. However, prolonged operative time (>30 minutes) caused an early increase in the level of IMA. Twenty-fourth hour IMA levels were not different. CONCLUSION SILC is an effective and safe surgical prosedure for benign gallbladder diseases. Independent of the surgical technique for cholecystectomy, the prolonged operative time could increase the tissue ischemia.","Ece, Ilhan; Ozturk, Bahadir; Yilmaz, Huseyin; Yormaz, Serdar; Şahin, Mustafa",Annals of surgical treatment and research,582,1

To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. OBJECTIVES We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease. SEARCH METHODS An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. MAIN RESULTS We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions.

This study was proposed to quantify the magnitude of the problem. METHODS Fifteen patients undergoing gastric bypass had oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) recorded continuously, but not displayed, for 24h postoperatively; eight also had arterial blood analysis every 4h. All received narcotic PCA. SpO(2)<90% lasting more than 10 s was reviewed. Results are mean+/-SEM. RESULTS Mean age was 44+/-4 y, and mean BMI was 48+/-2kg/m(2); 77% had OSA. Every patient had more than one episode with SpO(2)<90% for longer than 30s undetected by routine monitoring; most had multiple episodes. Nadir SpO(2) averaged 75% +/- 8%. Mean longest duration of desaturation below 90% averaged 21+/-15min. Mean PaCO(2) was 37+/-3mm Hg; maximum PaCO(2) was 47mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS Severe and prolonged episodes of hypoxemia were a consistent finding, despite aggressive preoperative diagnosis and treatment of OSA, including use of CPAP postoperatively. Although some postoperative hypoventilation was expected, the degree and frequency of desaturation were surprising. No patient exhibited arterial PaCO(2) evidence of hypoventilation. No patient experienced cardiopulmonary arrest/instability, in spite of severe, repeated episodes of hypoxemia. In no instance was a significant hypoxemic episode suspected or detected. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring, with an audible alarm set for a saturation less than 90% for 10 s, would have alerted providers to 100% of significant hypoxemic episodes. Our recommendation is routinely monitoring (with alarm capability enabled) every bariatric surgical patient, to prevent such occurrence.","Gallagher, Scott F; Haines, Krista L; Osterlund, Lynette G; Mullen, Matt; Downs, John B",The Journal of surgical research,582,7

In cross-correlation analyses, natural environmental factors correlated with the regional epidemic status on a scale of months, whereas the airway symptoms among non-COVID-19 population affected on a scale of weeks. When applying an autoregression model to the serial data of Nt, large-scale movements of people were suggested to be another factor to influence the local epidemics on a scale of days. In conclusion, the prevalence of cough symptoms in the local population, lower air humidity or higher wind speed, and large-scale movements of people in the locality would jointly influence the local epidemic status of COVID-19.","Ishii, Tadashi; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Katori, Yukio; Kure, Shigeo; Igarashi, Kaoru; Fujita, Motoo; Sugawara, Noriko; Takayama, Shin; Abe, Michiaki; Tanaka, Junichi; Kikuchi, Akiko; Abe, Yoshiko; Imai, Hiroyuki; Inaba, Yohei; Iwamatsu-Kobayashi, Yoko; Nishioka, Takashi; Onodera, Ko; Akaishi, Tetsuya",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,582,16

METHODS We performed a single-center review of all adult kidney transplants performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients were managed with standard immunosuppression protocols, including lymphocyte depleting induction and trough-guided tacrolimus. Retrospective data were collected for 3 months from the date of transplantation or until study conclusion (5/7/2020). The primary outcomes assessed included patient and allograft survival as well as COVID-19 related hospital readmission. RESULTS 30 kidney transplants were performed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a median follow-up of 51.5 days, 93.3% of patients were alive with 100% death-censored allograft survival. 9 patients were readmitted to the hospital during the study period, 4 (13.3%) related to infection with COVID-19. Infections were mild in 3/4 patients, with one patient developing severe disease leading to respiratory failure. Patients readmitted with COVID-19 were numerically more likely to be African American, have a BMI > 30 kg/m2, have a lymphocyte count ≤ 300 cells/mL, and be on maintenance corticosteroids.

In Scotland, a public health mass-media campaign was launched on March 24, 2014, called Take it Right Outside (TiRO), with a focus on reducing the exposure of children to domestic second-hand smoke. In this study, our aim was to establish whether the TiRO campaign was followed by a decrease in hospital admissions for childhood asthma and other respiratory conditions related to second-hand smoke exposure across Scotland. METHODS For an interrupted time-series analysis, data were obtained on all hospital admissions in Scotland between 2000 and 2018 for children aged younger than 16 years. We studied changes in the monthly incidence of admissions for conditions potentially related to second-hand smoke exposure (asthma, lower respiratory tract infection, bronchiolitis, croup, and acute otitis media) per 1000 children following the 2014 TiRO campaign, while considering national legislation banning smoking in public spaces from 2006. We considered asthma to be the primary condition related to second-hand smoke exposure, with monthly asthma admissions as the primary outcome. Gastroenteritis was included as a control condition. The analysis of asthma admissions considered subgroups stratified by age and area quintile of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivations (SIMD). FINDINGS 740 055 hospital admissions were recorded for children. 138 931 (18·8%) admissions were for respiratory conditions potentially related to second-hand smoke exposure, of which 32 342 (23·3%) were for asthma. After TiRO in 2014, we identified a decrease relative to the underlying trend in the slope of admissions for asthma (-0·48% [-0·85 to -0·12], p=0·0096) in younger children (age <5 years), but not in older children (age 5-15 years). Asthma admissions did not change after TiRO among children 0-15 years of age when data were analysed according to area deprivation quintile. Following the 2006 legislation, independent of TiRO, asthma admissions decreased in both younger children (-0·36% [-0·67 to -0·05], p=0·021) and older children (-0·68% [-1·00 to -0·36], p<0·0001), and in children from the most deprived (SIMD 1; -0·49% [-0·87 to -0·11], p=0·011) and intermediate deprived (SIMD 3; -0·70% [-1·17 to -0·23], p=0·0043) area quintiles, but not in those from the least deprived (SIMD 5) area quintile. INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that smoke-free home interventions could be an important tool to reduce asthma admissions in young children, and that smoke-free public space legislation might improve child health for many years, especially in the most deprived communities.

However, several cases of transmission between elephants and from elephants to humans or other animals without direct contact or over long distances have been reported. Elephants have been shown to be capable of producing aerosolized bacterial droplets, suggesting a possible route of transmission that is magnified by the size and force of the elephant respiratory tract. To investigate the dispersion and viability of aerosolized bacteria generated from the elephant respiratory tract, a pre-existing model with a proxy organism was used. A six-stage Andersen sampler was used to detect the proxy organism, a commensal elephant respiratory bacterium, at different locations around an elephant barn at a zoo. The amount of proxy organism detected at various time points and distances from the elephants indicates they are capable of dispersing viable bacterial aerosols further than humans can. The concentration of these aerosols is dependent on proximity to the elephants and does not remain at a high level for prolonged periods of time. These findings support the model of aerosol-mediated transmission of bacteria from elephants and can be used to improve disease management practices and prevent the spread of pathogens from elephants in zoos and other facilities.","Paul, Erin N; Thompson, Paul; Miller, Natalie; Meagher, Phoebe; Vogelnest, Larry",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,582,1

To test whether optical monitoring (OM) can detect decrements in CBF producing cerebral hypoxia, we applied the OM technique continuously to probe brain-injured patients who also had invasive brain tissue oxygen (PbO2) monitors. METHODS Comatose patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 8) were enrolled in an IRB-approved protocol after obtaining informed consent from the legally authorized representative. Patients underwent 6-8 h of daily monitoring. Brain PbO2 was measured with a Clark electrode. Absolute CBF was monitored with DCS, calibrated by perfusion measurements based on intravenous indocyanine green bolus administration. Variation of optical CBF and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline was measured during periods of brain hypoxia (defined as a drop in PbO2 below 19 mmHg for more than 6 min from baseline (PbO2 > 21 mmHg). In a secondary analysis, we compared optical CBF and MAP during randomly selected 12-min periods of ""normal"" (> 21 mmHg) and ""low"" (< 19 mmHg) PbO2. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression analysis were employed to assess the utility of optical CBF, MAP, and the two-variable combination, for discrimination of brain hypoxia from normal brain oxygen tension. RESULTS Seven patients were enrolled and monitored for a total of 17 days. Baseline-normalized MAP and CBF significantly decreased during brain hypoxia events (p < 0.05). Through use of randomly selected, temporally sparse windows of low and high PbO2, we observed that both MAP and optical CBF discriminated between periods of brain hypoxia and normal brain oxygen tension (ROC AUC 0.761, 0.762, respectively). Further, combining these variables using logistic regression analysis markedly improved the ability to distinguish low- and high-PbO2 epochs (AUC 0.876). CONCLUSIONS The data suggest optical techniques may be able to provide continuous individualized CBF measurement to indicate occurrence of brain hypoxia and guide brain-directed therapy.","Busch, David R; Balu, Ramani; Baker, Wesley B; Guo, Wensheng; He, Lian; Diop, Mamadou; Milej, Daniel; Kavuri, Venkaiah; Amendolia, Olivia; St Lawrence, Keith; Yodh, Arjun G; Kofke, W Andrew",Neurocritical care,582,6

The main objective of this simulation study was to characterize the surgical smoke exposure in terms of the particle number concentration and size distribution in a human breathing zone. Additionally, the performance of respiratory protective devices designed for ORs was examined using two commercially available N95 facepiece filtering respirators (FFRs) as well as the same FFRs modified with new faceseal technology. The tests were conducted in an OR-simulating exposure chamber with the surgical smoke generated by electrocautery equipment applied to animal tissue and measured in the breathing zone with four aerosol spectrometers. The simulated workplace protection factor of each tested respirator was determined for ten subjects by measuring the total aerosol concentrations inside and outside of a respirator. The peak of the particle size distribution was in a range of 60-150 nm. The concentration of particles generated during the simulated surgical procedure significantly exceeded the background concentration under all tested air exchange conditions. The data suggest that wearing N95 filtering facepiece respirators significantly decreased the human exposure to surgical smoke. The new faceseal technology provided significantly higher respiratory protection than the commercial N95 FFRs.","Elmashae, Yousef; Koehler, Richard H; Yermakov, Michael; Reponen, Tiina; Grinshpun, Sergey A",Aerosol science and technology : the journal of the American Association for Aerosol Research,582,16

Most studies on surgical treatment for recurrent inguinal hernia reported on laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of repeat TEP for contralateral occurrence after primary TEP for unilateral inguinal hernia. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 215 patients undergoing TEP performed between April 2003 and May 2009. We employed a similar approach to that of standard TEP for primary hernia. RESULTS Twenty eight of 215 patients who underwent unilateral TEP also underwent repeat TEP for contralateral-side hernia occurring after primary TEP. The initial hernia was on the right side in 15 patients and on the left side in 13. The initial hernia was indirect in 26 patients and direct in 2. Mean duration of primary TEP to contralateral occurrence was 54.4 months. Mean operation time for the contralateral occurrence was 73.3 minutes, and there was little intraoperative blood loss. Three patients were converted to an anterior approach because of insufficient surgical field due to injury of the peritoneum. Although the inferior epigastric artery and vein were divided in 4 patients, there were no difficulties during surgery. The postoperative course in all patients was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS TEP after primary TEP for contralateral occurrence is feasible. Repeat TEP might be an alternative technique for new occurrence of contralateral inguinal hernia after primary TEP.","Uchida, Hiroki; Matsumoto, Toshifumi; Endo, Yuichi; Kusumoto, Tetsuya; Muto, Yoichi; Kitano, Seigo",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Fast-track combines evidence-based, clinical features with organizational optimization including a revision of traditions resulting in a streamlined pathway from admission till discharge – and beyond. The goal is to reduce morbidity, mortality and functional convalescence with an earlier achievement of functional milestones including functional discharge criteria with subsequent reduced length of stay and high patient satisfaction. Outcomes are traditionally measured as length of stay; safety aspects in the form of morbidity/mortality; patient satisfaction; and – as a secondary parameter – economic savings. Optimization of the clinical aspects include focusing on analgesia; DVT-prophylaxis; mobilization; care principles including functional discharge criteria; patient-characteristics to predict outcome; and traditions which may be barriers in optimizing outcomes. Patients should be informed and motivated to be active participants and their expectations should be modulated in order to improve satisfaction. Also, organizational aspects need to be analyzed and optimized. New logistical approaches should be implemented; the ward ideally (re)structured to only admit arthroplasties; the staff educated to have a uniform approach; extensive preoperative information given including discharge criteria and intended length of stay. This thesis includes 9 papers on clinical and organizational aspects of fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty (I–IX). A detailed description of the fast-track set-up and its components is provided. Major results include identification of patient characteristics to predict length of stay and satisfaction with different aspects of the hospital stay (I); how to optimize analgesia by using a compression bandage in total knee arthroplasty (II); the clinical and organizational set-up facilitating or acting as barriers for early discharge (III); safety aspects following fast-track in the form of few readmissions in general (IV) and few thromboembolic complications in particular (V); feasibility studies showing excellent outcomes following fast-track bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty (VI) and non-septic revision knee arthroplasty (VII); how acute pain relief in total hip arthroplasty is not enhanced by the use of local infiltration analgesia when multi-modal opioid-sparing analgesia is given (VIII); and a detailed description of which clinical and organizational factors detain patients in hospital following fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty (IX). Economic savings following fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty is also documented in studies, reviews, metaanalyses and Cochrane reviews – including the present fast-track (ANORAK). In conclusion, the published results (I–IX) provide substantial, important new knowledge on clinical and organizational aspects of fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty – with concomitant documented high degrees of safety (morbidity/mortality) and patient satisfaction. Future research strategies are multiple and include both research strategies as efforts to implement the fast-track methodology on a wider basis. Research areas include improvements in pain treatment, blood saving strategies, fluid plans, reduction of complications, avoidance of tourniquet and concomitant blood loss, improved early functional recovery and muscle strengthening. Also, improvements in information and motivation of the patients, preoperative identification of patients needing special attention and detailed economic studies of fast- track are warranted.","Husted, Henrik",Acta orthopaedica.

However, it is difficult to supervise the authenticity of herbal materials in mixed herbal products according to the current quality standards, especially for traditional herbal patent medicine, with a distinct variance in the dosage of herbal materials. This study utilized the shotgun metabarcoding approach to analyze the biological ingredients of Fuke Desheng Wan (FKDSW), which is an effective traditional herbal product for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Six herbal materials were collected, and a lab-made mock FKDSW sample was produced to establish a method for the authentication assessment of biological ingredients in traditional herbal patent medicine based on shotgun metabarcoding. Furthermore, four commercial FKDSW samples were collected to verify the practicality of the shotgun metabarcoding approach. Then, a total of 52.16 Gb raw data for 174 million paired-end reads was generated using the Illumina NovaSeq sequencing platform. Meanwhile, 228, 23, and 14 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained for the ITS2, matK, and rbcL regions, respectively, after bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, no differences were evident between the assembly sequences obtained via shotgun metabarcoding and their corresponding reference sequences of the same species obtained via Sanger sequencing, except for part of the ITS2 and matK assembly sequences of Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Saussurea costus (Falc.) Lipsch. and Bupleurum chinense DC. with 1-6 different bases. The identification results showed that all six prescribed ingredients were successfully detected and that the non-authentic ingredient of Bupleuri Radix (Chaihu, Bupleurum chinense DC. or Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd.) was found in all the commercial samples, namely Bupleurum falcatum L. Here, 25 weed species representing 16 genera of ten families were detected. Moreover, 26 fungal genera belonging to 17 families were found in both lab-made and commercial FKDSW samples. This study demonstrated that the shotgun metabarcoding approach could overcome the biased PCR amplification and authenticate the biological ingredients of traditional herbal patent medicine with a distinct variance in the dosage of the herbal materials. Therefore, this provides an appropriate evaluation method for improving the safety and efficacy of traditional herbal patent medicine.","Xie, Hongbo; Zhao, Qing; Shi, Mengmeng; Kong, Weijun; Mu, Weishan; Li, Baoli; Zhao, Jingyi; Zhao, Chunying; Jia, Jing; Liu, Jinxin; Shi, Linchun",Frontiers in pharmacology,582,27

However, the timing of 2009 pandemic provides a natural experiment for evaluating the impact of school closure during holidays on influenza transmission. To quantify the transmission intensity of the influenza A (H1N1) pdm'09 in India, by estimating the time varying reproduction number (Rt) and correlating the temporal changes in the estimates of Rt for different regions of India with the timing of school holidays. We used daily lab-confirmed case reports of influenza A (H1N1) pdm'09 in India (during 17 May'09 to 17 May'10), stratified by regions. We estimated the transmissibility of the pandemic for different regions from these time-series, using Bayesian methods applied to a branching process model of disease spread and correlated the resulting estimates with the timing of school holidays in each region. The North-west region experienced two notable waves, with the peak of the first wave coinciding with the start of a 4 week school holiday (September-October'09). In the southern region the two waves were less clear cut, though again the first peak of the first wave coincided with the start of school holidays--albeit of less than 2 weeks duration (August'09). Our analysis suggests that the school holidays had a significant influence on the epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic in India. We estimate that school holidays reduced the reproduction number by 14-27% in different regions of India, relative to levels seen outside holiday periods. The estimates of the reproduction number obtained (with peak R values below 1.5) are compatible with those reported from other regions of the world. This work reinforces past studies showing the significant impact of school holidays on spread of 2009 pandemic virus, and by inference the role of contact patterns in children on transmission.","Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Kadi, A S; Ferguson, Neil M",Epidemics,582,16

It is important for this patient population, if infected with COVID-19 or another severe form of infection, to adjust the treatment protocol by specialists, in consultation with their own medical team. Special awareness and educational programs, understandable for mentally retarded patients, must be developed to educate them about social distancing, curfew, sanitization, and sensitization to the disease and quarantine. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance to reconsider the care required by patients with a rare disease during a pandemic or disaster, a program that should be adopted by the World Health Organization and governmental institutions for consideration.","Boudjelal, Mohamed; Mehyar, Nimer; Alghanem, Bandar; Almajed, Faisal; Alfadhel, Majid",Journal of infection in developing countries,582,23

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of SNOMED CT for structured searches of COVID-19 studies, using the German Corona Consensus Dataset (GECCO) as example. Suitability of the international standard SNOMED CT was measured with the scoring system ISO/TS 21564, and intercoder reliability of two independent mapping specialists was evaluated. The resulting analysis showed that the majority of data items had either a complete or partial equivalent in SNOMED CT (complete equivalent: 141 items; partial equivalent: 63 items; no equivalent: 1 item). Intercoder reliability was moderate, possibly due to non-establishment of mapping rules and high percentage (74%) of different but similar concepts among the 86 non-equal chosen concepts. The study shows that SNOMED CT can be utilized for COVID-19 cohort browsing. However, further studies investigating mapping rules and further international terminologies are necessary.","Vorisek, Carina Nina; Klopfenstein, Sophie Anne Ines; Sass, Julian; Lehne, Moritz; Schmidt, Carsten Oliver; Thun, Sylvia",Studies in health technology and informatics,582,17

While community mental health nurses (CMHN) might be well-placed to support people with SMI in averting relapse, no systematic reviews have examined this association. AIM To review the evidence from studies reporting an association between CMHN exposure and hospitalisation of persons living with SMI (a proxy for relapse). METHODS Searches were undertaken in ten bibliographic databases and two clinical trial registries. We included studies of patients with SMI, where CMHN was the exposure, and the outcome was relapse (i.e. readmission to a psychiatric inpatient facility). Quality assessment of included studies was completed using two risk-of-bias measures. RESULTS Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were rated as being of low-moderate methodological quality. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that community mental health nursing reduced the risk of admission to psychiatric inpatient facilities. CONCLUSIONS The review found no evidence that CMHN was associated with higher or lower odds of admission to psychiatric inpatient facilities among patients with SMI. The findings of the review point to a need for further research to investigate the impact of CMHN exposure and relapse in people with SMI.

International examples indicate the importance of quality control elements in the implementation of cost containment policies. Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used in health care to facilitate health care decision based on multiple objectives. Our objective was to develop a pilot MCDA tool for repeated use to support the value-based purchasing of generic medicines in the UAE. Methods: An international evidence framework was adapted to UAE in a multistakeholder workshop organized by Dubai Health Authority. After validating the relevance of nine criteria in the local jurisdiction, participants decided the ranking and weight of each criterion by anonymous voting. Results: The top four criteria focused on quality elements starting with real-world clinical or economic outcomes (with 19.8% weight), followed by the quality assurance of manufacturing (17.3%), then evidence on the equivalence with the original product (14.8%), and drug formulation and stability (12.3%). The pharmaceutical acquisition cost criteria ranked fifth with 9.4% weight. The bottom four criteria, including reliability of drug supply, macroeconomic benefit, pharmacovigilance and added value services related to the product had similar weights in the range of 5.5-7.7%. Conclusion: Policy-makers in Dubai put high emphasis of value-based health care by incentivizing manufacturers of off-patent pharmaceuticals to generate additional scientific evidence compared to the mandatory minimum and acknowledging efforts to improve quality standards. The MCDA tool is considered suitable to improve the transparency and consistency of decision making in UAE for off-patent pharmaceuticals, and subsequently for other health technologies.","Farghaly, Mohamed Naser; Al Dallal, Sara Ahmad Mohammad; Fasseeh, Ahmad Nader; Monsef, Nahed AbdulKhaleq; Suliman, Eldaw Abdalla Mohamed Ali; Tahoun, Mohamed Attia; Abaza, Sherif; Kaló, Zoltán",Frontiers in pharmacology,582,19

Frozen, readily available off-the-shelf EGFR-CAR NK cells showed enhanced killing of tumor cells compared to empty vector-transduced NK cells. In vivo, OV-IL15C significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of GBM-bearing mice in the presence of CD8+ T cells compared to parental OV. OV-IL15C plus EGFR-CAR NK cells synergistically suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either monotherapy, correlating with increased intracranial infiltration and activation of NK and CD8+ T cells and elevated persistence of CAR NK cells in an immunocompetent model.

METHODS A systematic literature search of medical databases from 1995-2021 was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials that reported at least one of the following glycaemic outcomes: mean glucose, area under the curve, time in range or hypoglycaemic episodes. RESULTS Eighteen studies were included. Thirteen studies gave additional insulin. Five studies gave an additional 30-43% of the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) for 32-50g of fat and 31-51% ICR for 7-35g of fat with 12-27g of protein added to control meals. A further eight studies gave -28- +75% ICR using algorithms based on fat and protein for meals with 19-50g of carbohydrate, 2-79g of fat and 10-60g of protein, only one study reported a glycaemic benefit of giving less than an additional 24% ICR. Eight studies evaluated insulin delivery patterns. Four of six studies in pump therapy, and one of two studies in multiple daily injections showed the combination bolus and split dose, respectively were superior. Five studies examined the insulin dose split, four demonstrated 60%-125% ICR upfront was necessary. Two studies investigated the timing of insulin delivery, both reported administration 15 min before the meal lowered postprandial glycaemia. CONCLUSIONS Findings highlight the glycaemic benefit of an additional 24-75% ICR for fat and fat and protein meals. For these meals, there is supportive evidence for insulin delivery in a combination bolus with a minimum upfront dose of 60% ICR, 15 min before the meal.","Smith, Tenele A; Marlow, Alexandra A; King, Bruce R; Smart, Carmel E",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,582,14

OBJECTIVES To describe the incidence, extent, associated clinical features and evolution of DVT after stroke. PATIENTS/METHODS The CLOTS trials 1 and 2 together randomized 5632 immobile stroke patients in 135 hospitals in nine countries. We screened patients for asymptomatic DVT with compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) at about 7-10 days and again at about 25-30 days after enrollment. RESULTS Six hundred and forty-one (11.4%) of 5632 patients had DVT detected on the first CDU scan at a median of 8 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7-10 days) after enrollment, and an additional 176 (3.1%) had a DVT on the second CDU scan at a median of 28 days (IQR 26-30 days). Of the 817 with DVTs, 289 (35%) were symptomatic and 39 (5%) had pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by imaging. Six hundred and seventy-six (83%) were unilateral, 141 (17%) were bilateral, 322 (39%) were limited to calf veins, 172 (21%) were popliteal, and 323 (40%) were femoral.

Several recent human studies have proved the safety and efficacy of TB in different surgical procedures, but there have been no similar studies about its efficacy in hepatic parenchymal transection. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the TB device in laparoscopic liver resection. METHODS This retrospective study compared TB and ultrasonic Harmonic devices in 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection from 2010 to 2016 in our institution. To reduce the selection bias, the two groups were matched in a 1-to-2 ratio on the basis of propensity scores. RESULTS There were no differences in the preoperative patient characteristics between the two groups. The extent of liver resection was comparable between the groups. Although the Harmonic group's intraoperative blood loss and operative time were less than that of the TB group, the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.08, P = 0.32, respectively). Postoperative complications, mortality within 90 days, and hospital stay were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION TB is as safe and effective for parenchymal transection in laparoscopic hepatectomy as ultrasonic devices, but it is not a superior alternative.","Badawy, Amr; Seo, Satoru; Toda, Rei; Fuji, Hiroaki; Ishii, Takamichi; Taura, Kojiro; Yasuchika, Kentaro; Kaido, Toshimi; Uemoto, Shinji",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,582,1

Due to constrained dental services during lockdown, pediatric dental needs were severely compromised therefore, parental attitude and practices of maintaining child's oral hygiene impose significant impact on child's oral hygiene. Aim This study aims to assess the attitude and practices of parents toward their children's oral health care during COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology The present cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 120 parents selected randomly from the outpatient department after obtaining informed consent. A structured questionnaire was used to assess attitude and practice of parents toward their child's oral hygiene during lockdown in COVID-19 pandemic. Results The overall attitude and practice score of parents in maintaining their child's oral hygiene was low, with mean value of 2.36 ± 1.36 and 2.51 ± 1.50, respectively. 60.8% of parents reported the need of dental treatment for their child during the lockdown period whereas 50.8% parents contacted the dentist during this period; majority (37.5%) of which reported due to toothache. 68.3% of parents would like to visit nearby dental hospital for emergencies during lockdown period. Only 33.3% of parents took extra efforts to maintain their child's oral hygiene while 45% made dietary changes in their child's diet to prevent tooth decay. Conclusion The overall attitude and practices of the parents were poor toward the oral health of their children during the lockdown period in COVID-19 pandemic. There is urgent need of increasing awareness among parents regarding the importance of maintaining their child's oral health. The inability to see the doctor should at least encourage better home practice measures for future.

We aimed to determine if preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation was more efficient than high-flow oxygen in reducing the risk of severe hypoxaemia during intubation. METHODS The FLORALI-2 multicentre, open-label trial was done in 28 intensive care units in France. Adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (a partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] to fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] ratio of ≤300 mm Hg) were randomly assigned (1:1; block size, four participants) to non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen during preoxygenation, with stratification by PaO2/FiO2 ratio (≤200 mm Hg vs >200 mm Hg). Key exclusion criteria were intubation for cardiac arrest, altered consciousness (defined as a Glasgow coma score of less than eight points), other contraindications to non-invasive ventilation (recent laryngeal, oesophageal, or gastric surgery, and substantial facial fractures), pulse oximetry not available, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and refusal to participate. The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe hypoxaemia (pulse oximetry <80%) during the procedure, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02668458. FINDINGS Between April 15, 2016, and Jan 8, 2017, 2079 patients were intubated in the 28 participating units, and 322 were enrolled. We excluded five patients with no recorded data, two who withdrew consent or were under legal protection, one who was not intubated, and one who had a cardiac arrest. Of the 313 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 142 were assigned to non-invasive ventilation and 171 to high-flow oxygen therapy. Severe hypoxaemia occurred in 33 (23%) of 142 patients after preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation and 47 (27%) of 171 with high-flow oxygen (absolute difference -4·2%, 95% CI -13·7 to 5·5; p=0·39). In the 242 patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 ≤200 mm Hg), severe hypoxaemia occurred less frequently after preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation than with high-flow oxygen (28 [24%] of 117 patients vs 44 [35%] of 125; adjusted odds ratio 0·56, 0·32 to 0·99, p=0·0459). Serious adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, with the most common immediate complications being systolic arterial hypotension (70 [49%] patients in the non-invasive ventilation group vs 86 [50%] patients in the high-flow oxygen group) and chest infiltrate on x-ray (28 [20%] vs 33 [19%]), and the most common late complications being death at day 28 (53 [37%] vs 58 [34%]) and ventilator-associated pneumonia during ICU stay (31 [22%] vs 35 [20%]). INTERPRETATION In patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy did not change the risk of severe hypoxaemia. Future research should explore the effect of preoxygenation method in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia at baseline.

Hypothermia treatment (HT) does not provide neuroprotection after pre-insult inflammatory sensitisation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a gram-negative bacterial wall constituent. However, early-onset sepsis in term babies is caused by gram-positive species in more than 90% of cases, and neuro-inflammatory responses triggered through the gram-negative route (Toll-like receptor 4, TLR-4) are different from those induced through the gram-positive route via TLR-2. Whether gram-positive septicaemia sensitises the neonatal brain to hypoxia and inhibits the neuroprotective effect of HT is unknown. Seven-day-old Wistar rats (n = 178) were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of PAM3CSK4 (1 mg/kg, a synthetic TLR-2 agonist) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl). After an 8-h delay, the left carotid artery was ligated followed by 50 min of hypoxia (8% O2) at a rectal temperature of 36°C. Pups received a 5-h treatment of normothermia (NT, 37°C) or HT (32°C) immediately after the insult. Brains were harvested after 7 days' survival for hemispheric and hippocampal area loss analyses and immunolabelling of microglia (Iba1) and hippocampal neurons (NeuN). Normothermic PAM3CSK4-injected animals showed significantly more brain injury than vehicle animals (p = 0.014). Compared to NT, HT significantly reduced injury in the PAM3CSK4-injected animals, with reduced area loss (p < 0.001), reduced microglial activation (p = 0.006), and increased neuronal rescue in the CA1 region (p < 0.001). Experimental induction of a sepsis-like condition through the gram-positive pathway sensitises the brain to HI injury. HT was highly neuroprotective after the PAM3CSK4-triggered injury, suggesting HT may be neuroprotective in the presence of a gram-positive infection. These results are in strong contrast to LPS studies where HT is not neuroprotective.","Falck, Mari; Osredkar, Damjan; Maes, Elke; Flatebø, Torun; Wood, Thomas Ragnar; Sabir, Hemmen; Thoresen, Marianne",Developmental neuroscience,582,33

The current research aims to target COVID-19 immunological human host receptors i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 using curcumin derivatives to prevent viral infection and control overproduction of early clinical responses of COVID-19. Targeting these host proteins will mitigate the infection and will filter out many complications caused by these proteins in COVID-19 patients. It is proven through computer-aided computational modeling approaches, total 30 compounds of curcumin and its derivatives were chosen. Drug-likeness parameters were calculated for curcumin and its derivatives and 20 curcumin analogs were selected for docking analysis. From docking analysis of 20 curcumin analogs against five chosen human host receptor targets reveals 11 curcumin analogs possess least binding affinity and best interaction at active sites subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis of five final shortlisted curcumin derivatives was done to show least binding affinity toward chosen host target protein. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) was performed to observe behavior and interaction of potential drug hydrazinocurcumin against target proteins ACE-2 and PAR-1. It was performed at 100 nanoseconds and showed satisfactory results. Finally, our investigation reveals that hydrazinocurcumin possesses immunomodulatory and anti-cytokine therapeutic potential against COVID-19 and it can act as COVID-19 warrior drug molecule and promising choice of drug for COVID-19 treatment, however, it needs further in vivo clinical evaluation to commercialize as COVID-19 drug.

NASH-related alterations in hepatic protein expression (e.g., transporters) and in overall physiology may affect drug exposure by altering drug disposition and elimination. The aim of this study was to build a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict drug exposure in NASH by incorporating NASH-related changes in hepatic transporters. Morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) were used as model compounds. A PBPK model of morphine with permeability-limited hepatic disposition was extended to include M3G disposition and enterohepatic recycling (EHR). The model captured the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of morphine and M3G after intravenous morphine administration within 0.79- and 1.94-fold of observed values from three independent clinical studies for healthy adult subjects (n= 6, 10, and 14 individuals). When NASH-related changes in multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and MRP3 were incorporated into the model, the predicted M3G mean AUC in NASH was 1.35-fold higher compared to healthy subjects, which is slightly lower than the observed value (1.63-fold). Exploratory simulations on other physiological changes occurring in NASH (e.g., moderate decreases in glomerular filtration rate and portal vein blood flow) revealed that the effect of transporter changes was most prominent. Additionally, NASH-related transporter changes resulted in decreased morphine EHR, which could be important for drugs with extensive EHR. This study is an important first step to predict drug disposition in complex diseases such as NASH using PBPK modeling.","Sjöstedt, Noora; Neuhoff, Sibylle; Brouwer, Kim L R",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,582,24

The mosquito species is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe, and thought to be absent in Australia. METHODS In February and May, 2020 the Medical Entomology unit of the Northern Territory (NT) Top End Health Service collected Cx. tritaeniorhynchus female specimens (n = 19) from the Darwin and Katherine regions. Specimens were preliminarily identified morphologically as the Vishnui subgroup in subgenus Culex. Molecular identification was performed using cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcoding, including sequence percentage identity using BLAST and tree-based identification using maximum likelihood analysis in the IQ-TREE software package. Once identified using COI, specimens were reanalysed for diagnostic morphological characters to inform a new taxonomic key to related species from the NT. RESULTS Sequence percentage analysis of COI revealed that specimens from the NT shared 99.7% nucleotide identity to a haplotype of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Dili, Timor-Leste. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the NT specimens formed a monophyletic clade with other Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We provide COI barcodes for most NT species from the Vishnui subgroup to aid future identifications, including the first genetic sequences for Culex (Culex) crinicauda and the undescribed species Culex (Culex) sp. No. 32 of Marks. Useful diagnostic morphological characters were identified and are presented in a taxonomic key to adult females to separate Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from other members of the Vishnui subgroup from the NT. CONCLUSIONS We report the detection of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Australia from the Darwin and Katherine regions of the NT. The vector is likely to be already established in northern Australia, given the wide geographical spread throughout the Top End of the NT. The establishment of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Australia is a concern to health officials as the species is an important vector of JEV and is now the sixth species from the subgenus Culex capable of vectoring JEV in Australia. We suggest that the species must now be continuously monitored during routine mosquito surveillance programmes to determine its current geographical spread and prevent the potential transmission of exotic JEV throughout Australia.","Lessard, Bryan D; Kurucz, Nina; Rodriguez, Juanita; Carter, Jane; Hardy, Christopher M",Parasites & vectors,582,1

To increase the availability of this promising therapy in patients with advanced melanoma, a minimally invasive approach to procure tumor for TIL generation is warranted. METHODS A feasibility study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic liver resection to generate TIL for ACT. Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database identified 22 patients with advanced melanoma and visceral metastasis (AJCC Stage M1c) who underwent laparoscopic liver resection between 1 October 2005 and 31 July 2011. The indication for resection in all patients was to receive postoperative ACT with TIL. RESULTS Twenty patients (91%) underwent resection utilizing a closed laparoscopic technique, one required hand-assistance and another required conversion to open resection. Median intraoperative blood loss was 100 mL with most cases performed without a Pringle maneuver. Median hospital stay was 3 days. Three (14%) patients experienced a complication from resection with no mortality. TIL were generated from 18 of 22 (82%) patients. Twelve of 15 (80%) TIL tested were found to have in vitro tumor reactivity. Eleven patients (50%) received the intended ACT. Two patients were rendered no evidence of disease after surgical resection, with one undergoing delayed ACT with generated TIL after relapse. Objective tumor response was seen in 5 of 11 patients (45%) who received TIL, with one patient experiencing an ongoing complete response (32+ months). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic liver resection can be performed with minimal morbidity and serve as an effective means to procure tumor to generate therapeutic TIL for ACT to patients with metastatic melanoma.","Alvarez-Downing, Melissa M; Inchauste, Suzanne M; Dudley, Mark E; White, Donald E; Wunderlich, John R; Rosenberg, Steven A; Kammula, Udai S",World journal of surgical oncology,582,1

Here we have studied how the protomeric units of Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope protein (Env) are activated in relation to each other, sequentially or simultaneously. We followed the isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide and subsequent SU release from Env with biochemical methods and found that this early activation step occurred sequentially in the three protomers, generating two asymmetric oligomer intermediates according to the scheme (SU-TM)3 → (SU-TM)2TM → (SU-TM)TM2 → TM3 This was the case both when activation was triggered in vitro by depleting stabilizing Ca2+ from solubilized Env and when viral Env was receptor triggered on rat XC cells. In the latter case, the activation reaction was too fast for direct observation of the intermediates, but they could be caught by alkylation of the isomerization active thiol.","Sjöberg, Mathilda; Löving, Robin; Lindqvist, Birgitta; Garoff, Henrik",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,582,1

Current management of AMR-RTI patients focuses on pathogen-directed antimicrobial treatment. Overt lung inflammation, parenchymal damage, and ineffective immune activation perpetrate increased patient morbidity and mortality. Immunomodulatory and tissue-regenerative host-directed therapies (HDT) may improve treatment outcomes. HDTs under investigation for improving AMR-RTI treatment outcomes are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS Various HDTs are being developed or evaluated for adjunctive AMR-RTI treatment. α-1 antitrypsin was shown to reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa burden in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Cellular therapy by reinfusing autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs into MDR/XDR-TB patients shows promise, whereas adjunctive T cell-based therapies are considered. Cytotoxic therapy using etoposide, a topoisomerase II-inhibiting anticancer drug extends survival of patients with severe influenza H1N1 infection-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Two other novel HDT candidates, DAS181 and resveratrol show antiinfluenza effects. Novel kinase inhibitors SB203580 (MAPK-2 antagonist) and LY294002 (phosphoinositide-3 kinases antagonist) exhibit promising anti-MERS-CoV activity. Palivizumab, an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, effectively prevents RSV infection in high-risk paediatric populations. T-cell therapy is currently considered for adjunctive HDT of azole-resistant pulmonary aspergillosis. SUMMARY Novel HDTs may revolutionize future treatment regimens for AMR-RTIs.

Thus, PQ is frequently found in surface water systems and is potentially toxic to aquatic organisms, since it can cause mitochondrial dysfunction altering in the redox state of cells. This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of PQ to Chironomus riparius and Girardia tigrina, and compare their physiological strategies to cope with environmental stress. The mean emergence time was the most sensitive endpoint for Chironomids, with the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) being 0.02 for males and 0.1 mg PQ L-1 for females. Moreover, PQ reduced the body weight of male and female imagoes, with LOECs of 0.5 and 2.5 mg PQ L-1, respectively. Paraquat also decreased the respiration rate (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) and total glutathione (tGSH) content (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1). Thus, the aerobic production of energy was not affected and allowed chironomids to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ, but with consequent physiological costs in terms of development rates and weight of adults. In planarians, PQ decreased the locomotion and feeding activity, and delayed photoreceptor regeneration (LOECs = 2.5 mg PQ L-1 for all endpoints). Despite increased aerobic energy production (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1), planarians were not able to cope with oxidative stress induced by the highest PQ concentrations, since lipid peroxidation levels were significantly increased (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) concomitantly with a significant decrease of tGSH (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1). These results showed that planarians were unable to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ with consequent impairments of behavior and regeneration despite an increased aerobic energy production.","Saraiva, Althiéris S; Sarmento, Renato A; Gravato, Carlos; Rodrigues, Andreia C M; Campos, Diana; Simão, Fátima C P; Soares, Amadeu M V M",The Science of the total environment,582,1

The mechanisms contributing to latency are diverse and depend on the nature of both the microbe and the host. Latency has advantages for both host and microbe. The host avoids progressive damage caused by interaction with the microbe that may translate into disease, and the microbe secures a stable niche in which to survive. Latency is clinically important because some latent microbes can be transmitted to other hosts, and it is associated with a risk for recrudescent microbial growth and development of disease. In addition, it can predispose the host to other diseases, such as malignancies. Hence, latency is a temporally unstable state with an eventual outcome that mainly depends on host immunity. Latency is an integral part of the pathogenic strategies of microbes that require human (and/or mammalian) hosts, including herpesviruses, retroviruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Toxoplasma gondii. However, latency is also an outcome of infection with environmental organisms such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which require no host in their replicative cycles. For most microbes that achieve latency, there is a need for a better understanding and more investigation of host and microbial mechanisms that result in this state.","Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Casadevall, Arturo",The Journal of clinical investigation,582,31

In recent emerging diseases, disease spread has been attributed to superspreaders, highly infectious individuals that infect a large number of susceptible individuals. In some re-emerging infectious diseases, disease spread is attributed to waning immunity in susceptible hosts. We apply a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model to study disease emergence or re-emergence from different groups, where the transmission rates depend on either the infectious host or the susceptible host. Multitype branching processes approximate the dynamics of the CTMC model near the disease-free equilibrium and are used to estimate the probability of a minor or a major epidemic. It is shown that the probability of a major epidemic is greater if initiated by an individual from the superspreader group or by an individual from the highly susceptible group. The models are applied to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and measles.","Nandi, Aadrita; Allen, Linda J S",Journal of biological dynamics,582,7

In this animal study, the authors aimed to elucidate the role of collateral supply with regard to the hemodynamic changes and neointimal modifications that occur from jailing arteries with FDSs. To serve this purpose, the authors sought to quantify 1) the hemodynamic changes that occur at the jailed arterial branches immediately after stent placement and 2) the ostia surface values at 3 months after stenting; both parameters were investigated in the presence or absence of collateral arterial flow. METHODS After an a priori power analysis, 2 groups (Group A and Group B) were created according to an animal flow model for terminal and anastomotic arterial circulation; each group contained 7 Large White swine. Group A animals possessed an anastomotic-type arterial configuration to supply the territory of the right ascending pharyngeal artery (APhA), while Group B animals possessed a terminal-type arterial configuration to supply the right APhA territory. Subsequently, all animals underwent FDS placement, thereby jailing the right APhAs. Mean flow rates and velocities inside the jailed branches were quantified using time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MR angiography before and after stenting. Three months after stent placement, the jailed ostia surface values were quantified on scanning electron micrographs. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and group comparisons with parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS The endovascular procedures were feasible, and there were no findings of in situ thrombus formation on postprocedural optical coherence tomography or ischemia on postprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging. In Group A, the mean flow rate values at the jailed right APhAs were reduced immediately following stent placement as compared with values obtained before stent placement (p = 0.02, power: 0.8). In contrast, the mean poststenting flow rates for Group B remained similar to those obtained before stent placement. Three months after stent placement, the mean ostia surface values were significantly higher for Group B (527,911 ± 306,229 μm2) than for Group A (89,329 ± 59,762 μm2; p < 0.01, power: 1.00), even though the initial dimensions of the jailed ostia were similar between groups. A statistically significant correlation was found between groups (A or B), mean flow rates after stent placement, and ostia surface values at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS When an important collateral supply was present, the jailing of side arteries with flow diverters resulted in an immediate and significant reduction in the flow rate inside these arteries as compared with the prestenting values. In contrast, when competitive flow was absent, jailing did not result in significant flow rate reductions inside the jailed arteries. Ostium surface values at 3 months after stent placement were significantly higher in the terminal group of jailed arteries (Group B) than in the anastomotic group (Group A) and strongly correlated with poststenting reductions in the velocity value.","Iosif, Christina; Berg, Philipp; Ponsonnard, Sebastien; Carles, Pierre; Saleme, Suzana; Ponomarjova, Sanita; Pedrolo-Silveira, Eduardo; Mendes, George A C; Waihrich, Eduardo; Trolliard, Gilles; Couquet, Claude-Yves; Yardin, Catherine; Mounayer, Charbel",Journal of neurosurgery,582,16

However, the promiscuous reactivity often interferes with identification of the fragments possessing specific binding affinity to the targeted protein. In our study, we report the fragment-based covalent drug discovery using the chemically tuned weak reactivity of chlorofluoroacetamide (CFA). We constructed a small fragment library composed of 30 CFA-appended compounds and applied it to the covalent ligand screening for cysteine protease papain as a model protein target. Using the fluorescence enzymatic assay, we identified CFA-benzothiazole 30 as a papain inhibitor, which was found to irreversibly inactivate papain upon enzyme kinetic analysis. The formation of the covalent papain-30 adduct was confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis. The activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) experiment using an alkynylated analog of 30 (i.e., 30-yne) revealed that 30-yne covalently labeled papain with high selectivity. These data demonstrate potential utility of the CFA-fragment library for de novo discovery of target selective covalent inhibitors.","Miura, Chizuru; Shindo, Naoya; Okamoto, Kei; Kuwata, Keiko; Ojida, Akio",Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,582,11

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become a recognized tool in the treatment of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, but its use in gastric dysplasia has not yet been studied. We aim to describe three cases of RFA treatment in patients with persistent dysplastic gastric mucosa confirmed by consensus of two expert gastrointestinal pathologists. In each patient, two catheter-based RFA procedures were performed 8 weeks apart in an outpatient setting. Although each patient reported minor epigastric pain after RFA, there were no major complications such as bleeding, perforation, stricture, or the need for hospitalization. Endoscopic follow-up with extensive biopsy sampling 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months after the last RFA revealed negative results for dysplasia in all patients. These results suggest that RFA may be considered in the treatment of gastric dysplasia. The confirmation of these data with a large series can lead to a change in the paradigm of gastric dysplasia management.","Baldaque-Silva, Francisco; Cardoso, Helder; Lopes, Joanne; Carneiro, Fatima; Macedo, Guilherme",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,582,1

Many cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN-γ), utilize the JAK/STAT pathway for signal propagation. Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-1 (SOCS1) is an inducible, intracellular protein that regulates IFN-γ signaling by dampening JAK/STAT signaling. Using Fas deficient, MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J (MRL/lpr) mice, which develop lupus-like disease spontaneously, we tested the hypothesis that a peptide mimic of the SOCS1 kinase inhibitory region (SOCS1-KIR) would inhibit lymphocyte activation and modulate lupus-associated pathologies. Consistent with in vitro studies, SOCS1-KIR intraperitoneal administration reduced the frequency, activation, and cytokine production of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes within the peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. In addition, SOCS1-KIR administration reduced lymphadenopathy, severity of skin lesions, autoantibody production, and modestly reduced kidney pathology. On a cellular level, peritoneal SOCS1-KIR administration enhanced Foxp3 expression in total splenic and follicular regulatory T cells, reduced the effector memory/naïve T lymphocyte ratio for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and reduced the frequency of GL7+ germinal center enriched B cells. Together, these data show that SOCS1-KIR treatment reduced auto-reactive lymphocyte effector functions and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the SOCS1 pathway through peptide administration may have efficacy in mitigating autoimmune pathologies.","Sharma, Jatin; Collins, Teresa D; Roach, Tracoyia; Mishra, Shiwangi; Lam, Brandon K; Mohamed, Zaynab Sidi; Veal, Antia E; Polk, Timothy B; Jones, Amari; Cornaby, Caleb; Haider, Mohammed I; Zeumer-Spataro, Leilani; Johnson, Howard M; Morel, Laurence M; Larkin, Joseph",Scientific reports,582,7

However, allocating the COVID-19 vaccine globally poses a novel challenge of redistribution, one that cannot be effectively undertaken using current mechanisms for the dispensation of aid. An examination of the origins and implicit logic of global public goods theory shows that it would not be effective as a framework in this context. I argue that while it is a useful rhetorical tool to underscore the need for global access, it fails to account for concerns arising out of structural inequities between countries in the Global South and North. In addition to being ill-defined, the phrase encodes a neoliberal logic - one that prioritises the protection of private capital over democratic claims of redistribution and social justice. To ensure global access, our attention must be focussed instead on explicitly accounting for inequities, securing access for countries in the Global South and addressing the norm-setting powers of pharmaceutical companies.","Saksena, Nivedita",Global public health,582,24

The aim was to determine willingness to pay for a pair of spectacles among presbyopic people if the service begins. Methods An interview-based questionnaire was employed among presbyopic people, who were refracted during a community-based outreach service conducted at Debre-Tabor town, South Gondar. Results A total of 322 study subjects have completed the questionnaire. The median value of gross monthly income was US $75.0 (Range from US $7.1-321.4). The mean amount of willing to pay for a pair of spectacles was US $17.9 (Range from US $1.1-107.1). Participants who were willing to pay at least US $12.5 (minimum cost at the public optical dispensing unit) for a pair of spectacles accounted 63.0% (95% CI: 57.8-68.3). Based on multivariable logistics regression output analysis age (P = .049), occupation (P = .001), monthly income (p = .001), and positive history of previous spectacles wear (P = .005) show statistically significant association with willingness to pay for a pair of spectacles. Conclusion In the study area, the mean amount willing to pay for a pair of spectacles was higher than the average set of the price at the public optical dispensing units in Gondar. Public willingness to pay for a pair of spectacles could be considered as an assurance to set up an affordable and financially sustainable spectacle supply service. Conducted on a community-based outreach service may likely pool keen population segments to overestimate the result.

METHODS Using data from a randomized controlled trial of subjects undergoing TKR for osteoarthritis, we assessed problematic MSK areas in six body regions before TKR and 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after TKR. We defined the following two variables: 1) density count (number of problematic MSK areas occurring after TKR; range 0-24) and 2) cumulative density count (problematic MSK areas both before and after TKR, categorized into four levels: no preoperative areas and density count of 0-1 [reference group]; no preoperative areas and density count of 2 or more; one or more preoperative areas and density count of 0-1; and one or more preoperative areas and density count of 2 or greater). We evaluated the associations between categorized 60-month WOMAC and cumulative density count by ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS Among 230 subjects, 24% reported one or more preoperative problematic MSK area. After TKR, 75% reported a density count of 0 to 1; 25% reported a density count of 2 or more. Compared with the reference group, each cumulative density count category was associated with an increased odds of having a higher category of 60-month WOMAC pain score, as follows: 2.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-5.98) for no preoperative problematic areas and density count of 2 or greater, 3.31 (95% CI, 1.64-6.66) for one or more preoperative problematic areas and density count of 0 to 1, and 2.85 (95% CI, 0.97-8.39) for one or more preoperative problematic areas and density count of 2 or greater.

STUDY TYPE Development and analysis of a system dynamics model. METHODS To define the pandemic context and specify model-building parameters, we searched for literature on COVID-19, its epidemiology in Australia, case finding processes, and factors that might affect community acceptance of the COVIDSafe smartphone app for contact tracing. We then developed a system dynamics model of COVID-19 based on a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered compartmental model structure, using initial pandemic data and published information on virus behaviour to determine parameter values. We applied the model to examine factors influencing the projected trends: the extent of viral testing, community participation in social distancing, and the level of uptake of the COVIDSafe app. RESULTS Modelling suggests that a second COVID-19 wave will occur if social distancing declines (i.e. if the average number of contacts made by each individual each day increases) and the rate of testing declines. The timing and size of the second wave will depend on the rate of decrease in social distancing and the decline in testing rates. At the app uptake level of approximately 27% (current at 20 May 2020), with a monthly 50% reduction in social distancing (i.e. the average number of contacts per day doubling every 30 days until they reach pre-social distancing rates) and a 5% decline in testing, the app would reduce the projected total number of new cases during April-December 2020 by one-quarter. If uptake reaches the possible maximum of 61%, the reduction could be more than half. CONCLUSIONS Maintenance of a large-scale testing regimen for COVID-19 and widespread community practice of social distancing are vital. The COVIDSafe smartphone app has the potential to be an important adjunct to testing and social distancing. Depending on the level of community uptake of the app, it could have a significant mitigating effect on a second wave of COVID-19 in Australia.","Currie, Danielle J; Peng, Cindy Q; Lyle, David M; Jameson, Brydie A; Frommer, Michael S",Public health research & practice,582,9

Results We found that distilled water extracted a more important mass of phytochemical compounds (7.9-21.2%) compared to ethanol (5.8-12.4%). Except C. officinalis and G. lucida leaves, the rest of extracts were active with inhibition diameters (ID) ranging from 5 to 36 mm.

Only the EE of E. chloranta bark (ECB) had a strong activity against all the microorganisms tested (MIC <2 mg / ml); L. vulgare leaves (LVL) and G. lucida seed (GLS) had moderate (average MIC of 8 mg/ml) while all other extracts showed very weak antimicrobial activity. In addition, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) ranged from 0.125 to 0.750. No antagonism (FIC> 4) or indifference (1≤ FIC≤4) was noted between the extracts and the antibiotics, but the best synergies were found with ECB which well-modulated Kanamycin (FIC = 0.125 against S. aureus and 0.250 against E. coli), nitrofurantoin (FIC = 0.250 against S. aureus and 0.188 against E. coli) and ampicillin (FIC = 0.125 against E. coli). Similarly, compared to other extracts, ECB, LVL and GLS also well-modulated ampicillin, ceftazidime, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim against all the above-mentioned resistant uropathogenic bacteria with important increase in fold area (IFA). Conclusion This study show that E. chlorantha bark, L. vulgare leaves G. lucida seed, have good antimicrobial activity against both bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative) and fungi (C. albicans); and should be more investigated for their possible use to the fight against MDR and MRU microorganisms.","Joseph Arsene, Mbarga Manga; Irina Viktorovna, Podoprigora; Linda Davares, Anyutoulou Kitio; Mouafo, Hippolyte Tene; Monique Manga, Irma Aurelia; Pavlovna, Smirnova Irina; Sergueïevna, Das Milana",bioRxiv,582,1

Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) metrics for youth age 7-12 during school hours (8AM-3PM) were compared between weekdays and weekends for 14 days pre COVID-19. Youth with >70% CGM wear (n=214) were identified from a large academic center: 96% white, 46% male, mean (SD) age 10.6 (1.5) years, duration 3.5 (2.5) years, HbA1c 7.5 (0.8) %, 63% with an insulin pump. For weekday school hours, median TIR (70-180 mg/dL) was 52.4%;only 34 (15%) of youth met a TIR goal of >70%. Using random coefficient multilevel linear mixed models, TIR in school was significantly associated with younger age (p=0.008), shorter duration (p<0.001), and lower HbA1c (p<0.001), but not pump use (p=0.42). Weekday and weekend CGM metrics were clinically similar (Table), though TIR was statistically higher (p<0.001) and time high/very high (>180 mg/dL) lower on weekends (p<0.01). Time exhibited a significant fixed and random effect in mixed models;youth with lower TIR at 8AM tended to have larger improvements over subsequent hours. Notably, TIR early in the school day was nearly half of TIR during similar weekend hours, perhaps relating to sleep/meal schedules. Our data support that TIR in school is sub-optimal but may improve while in school, suggesting a benefit to school day routines and opportunity for improving glycemic control in school.","March, Christine Nanni Michelle Kavanaugh Madison K.; Rothenberger, Scott D.; Siminerio, Linda M.; Miller, Elizabeth Libman Ingrid",Diabetes,582,21

This retrospective study was undertaken to compare two different devices to determine if there was an advantage to either device. Methods: Laparoscopic hysterectomies performed where vaginal cuff closure times could be measured on recorded video were reviewed. Demographic information was obtained on these cases and the two suturing devices were compared. Results: Cuff closure times with the EndoStitch® (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) and the RD-180® (LSI Solutions, Rochester, NY) devices were evaluated for overall cuff closure time, per stitch time, and assessed for confounding factors. The EndoStitch had an overall faster cuff closure time than the RD-180 (17.2 minutes vs. 20.1 minutes, p = 0.046). However, the per-stitch closure times were similar (5.66 minutes/stitch, 5.56 minutes/stitch, p = 0.78). No conversions to laparotomy and no cuff dehiscences were experienced. Per-stitch closure time was not affected by the level of resident, but was lengthened by increased patient body mass index. However, closure times were longer with both devices than when using barbed suture and conventional suturing techniques. Conclusions: Both the EndoStitch and RD-180 suturing devices provide a reasonable cuff closure time with a low risk of cuff dehiscence. The learning curve for both instruments is relatively flat.

The ratio of BOD5 to COD of ˂0.5 implied that hadwashing wastewater was not amenable to biological treatment processes. Turbidity of ˃50 NTU pointed to the need for a roughing filter prior to slow sand filtration. Subsequently, a handwashing wastewater treatment system consisting of selected particle sizes of silica sand, zeolite, and granular activated carbon as filtration and/or adsorption media was developed and assessed for performance towards amelioration of the physicochemical and biological parameters of the handwashing wastewater. Treated water from the developed wastewater treatment system exhibited a turbidity of 5 NTU, true colour of 10 Pt-Co, apparent colour of 6 Pt-Co, and TSS of 9 mgL-1, translating to removal efficiencies of up to 98.5, 98.1, 99.7, and 96.9%, respectively. The residual total coliforms and E.coli of 1395 and 1180 CFU(100mL)-1 respectively, were totally eliminated upon disinfection with 0.5mL NaOCl (3.5% w/v) per liter of treated wastewater. The treated water was thus suitable for recycling for handwashing purpose as opposed to letting handwashing wastewater merely go down the drain. This approach provides a resilient response to COVID-19, where communities faced with water scarcity can treat and recycle handwashing wastewater at the point of washing. It thus enables more people to have the opportunity to practice handwashing, abating the high risks of infection, which could otherwise arise.","Olupot, Peter Wilberforce Menya Emmanuel Jjagwe Joseph Wakatuntu Joel Kavuma Tonny Wabwire Andrew Kavuma Steven McMondo Samuel Okodi Nabuuma Betty Kalibbala Herbert Mpagi",Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering,582,31

About that age almost everyone has antibodies to them. Second infections occur and may not be as rare as laboratory findings so far suggest. Very young infants sometimes get subclinical disease-the effect of maternal antibody transmitted across the placenta? Very similar viruses, all possessing a common antigen detectable by immunofluorescence, are known to infect and/or cause diarrhoea in children, calves, piglets, mice, foals and monkeys. The calf virus and the human virus both infect piglets; piglet virus infects calves; we don't know whether any of these can infect children. Other mammals probably have similar diarrhoea viruses. An antigen common to all these viruses is probably in the inner capsid layer, and ""species-specific"" antigens are probably in the outer capsid layer. A precise test for comparing different strains is bably needed. Adenoviruses possibly cause a smaller proportion of cases of diarrhoea. Coronaviruses, well-known as enteric pathogens of pigs and calves, appear also to infect adults and children. 27 nm particles and 22-23 nm particles of density 1.4 (and other particles) can be found in faeces of children with natural diarrhoea and adults with experimental diarrhoea, sometimes in enormous numbers.

Although this virus grows in a variety of tissues that express its receptor, the mechanism of the severe respiratory illness caused by this virus is not well understood. Here, we report a possible mechanism for the extensive damage seen in the major target organs for this disease. A recent study of the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV reveals that it takes an endosomal pathway. We found that proteases such as trypsin and thermolysin enabled SARS-CoV adsorbed onto the cell surface to enter cells directly from that site. This finding shows that SARS-CoV has the potential to take two distinct pathways for cell entry, depending on the presence of proteases in the environment. Moreover, the protease-mediated entry facilitated a 100- to 1,000-fold higher efficient infection than did the endosomal pathway used in the absence of proteases. These results suggest that the proteases produced in the lungs by inflammatory cells are responsible for high multiplication of SARS-CoV, which results in severe lung tissue damage. Likewise, elastase, a major protease produced in the lungs during inflammation, also enhanced SARS-CoV infection in cultured cells.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Ujike, Makoto; Morikawa, Shigeru; Tashiro, Masato; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,582,17

After the World Health Organization declared the world SARS-free on 5 July 2003, there were episodic recurrences of SARS between September 2003 and May 2004, including 4 cases of laboratory-acquired SARS. SARS posed a mammoth challenge because of the impact of nosocomial transmission on healthcare manpower and facilities, and the resources needed for controlling and preventing further spread. Through worldwide scientific collaboration, the medical community has made much progress in unraveling its enigma, though much more needs to be discovered. This paper highlights how we can apply our knowledge of its epidemiology, mode of transmission, clinical course, ICU admission, complications, predictors of poor outcome, treatment and infection control to help us avert a catastrophic outbreak, and to manage our resources and patients. SARS preparedness and response planning must be flexible and dynamic so that appropriate measures can be implemented as an outbreak progresses.

Although Btk is activated by cross-linking of a variety of cell-surface receptors, the most critical signal transduction pathway is the one initiated by the pre-B cell and B-cell antigen receptor complex. Mutations in Btk are highly diverse, and no single mutation accounts for more than 3% of patients. Although there is no strong genotype/phenotype correlation in XLA, the specific mutation in Btk is one of the factors that influences the severity of disease. Mutations in the components of the pre-B cell and B-cell antigen receptor complex account for an additional 5-7% of patients with defects in early B-cell development. Patients with defects in these proteins are clinically indistinguishable from those with XLA. However, they tend to be younger at the time of diagnosis, and whereas most patients with XLA have a small number of B cells in the peripheral circulation, these cells are not found in patients with defects in micro heavy chain or Igalpha.

The novel 2019 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The virus specific molecular interaction with the host cell represents a promising therapeutic target for identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The repurposing of drugs can provide a rapid and potential cure toward exponentially expanding COVID-19. Thereto, high throughput virtual screening approach was used to investigate FDA approved LOPAC library drugs against both the receptor binding domain of spike protein (S-RBD) and ACE2 host cell receptor. Primary screening identified a few promising molecules for both the targets, which were further analyzed in details by their binding energy, binding modes through molecular docking, dynamics and simulations. Evidently, GR 127935 hydrochloride hydrate, GNF-5, RS504393, TNP, and eptifibatide acetate were found binding to virus binding motifs of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, KT203, BMS195614, KT185, RS504393, and GSK1838705A were identified to bind at the receptor binding site on the viral S-protein. These identified molecules may effectively assist in controlling the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 by not only potentially inhibiting the virus at entry step but are also hypothesized to act as anti-inflammatory agents, which could impart relief in lung inflammation. Timely identification and determination of an effective drug to combat and tranquilize the COVID-19 global crisis is the utmost need of hour. Further, prompt in vivo testing to validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibition efficiency by these molecules could save lives is justified.","Choudhary, Shweta; Malik, Yashpal S; Tomar, Shailly",Front Immunol,582,16

Through a snowball sampling procedure, in Wave 1 424 respondents completed a survey in March 2020. One hundred thirteen of these participants completed the same survey in Wave 2 in May 2020. Consistent with research on SARS, females and older individuals engaged in the behaviors more often than men and younger individuals. After accounting for these variables in predicting frequency of protective health behaviors, components of the PMT accounted for an additional 12% of the variance in Wave 1 and 16% in Wave 2, with perceived severity and outcome efficaciousness correlating positively with frequency. Anticipatory regret mediated the relationship between PMT and protective health behavior frequency. The results suggest that public health announcements that are tailored toward the severity of the virus and the efficacy of the health behaviors in decreasing the spread of the virus may meet with more success than those that heighten people's vulnerability to the disease.","Kowalski, Robin M; Black, Kelly J",Health Commun,582,30

Here we present an analytical pipeline for large-scale intracellular peptidomics of Lactococcus lactis It entails an optimized sample preparation protocol for L. lactis, used as an ""enzyme complex"" to digest ß-casein, an extraction method for its intracellular peptidome, and a peptidomics data analysis and visualization procedure. In addition, we proofread the publicly available bioactive peptide databases and obtained an optimized database of bioactive peptides derivable from bovine ß-casein. We used the pipeline to examine cultures of L. lactis MG1363 and a set of 6 isogenic multiple peptidase mutants incubated with ß-casein. We observed a clearly strain-dependent accumulation of peptides with several bioactivities, such as ACE inhibitory, DPP-IV inhibitory, immunoregulatory functions. The results suggest that both the number of different bioactive peptides and the bioactivity diversity can be increased by editing the proteolytic system of L. lactis This comprehensive pipeline offers a model for bioactive peptide discovery in combination with other proteins and might be applicable to other bacteria.ImportanceLactic acid bacteria (LAB) are very important for the production of safe and healthy human and animal fermented foods and feed and, increasingly more, in the functional food industry. The intracellular peptidomes of LAB are promising reservoirs of bioactive peptides. We show here that targeted genetic engineering of the peptide degradation pathway allows steering the composition of the peptide pool of the LAB Lactococcus lactis and producing peptides with interesting bioactivities. Our work could be used as a guideline for modifying proteolytic systems in other LAB to further explore their potential as cell peptide factories.","Huang, Chenxi; Kok, Jan",,582,22

However, whether these trends reflect a reduction in ACS incidence or a decrease in emergency room visits is unknown. Using Google Trends, queries for chest pain that have previously been shown to closely correlate with coronary heart disease were compared with searches for myocardial infarction and COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluates if search terms (or topics) pertaining to chest pain symptoms correlate with the reported decrease in presentations of ACS. METHODS: Google Trends data for search terms ""chest pain,"" ""myocardial infarction,"" ""cough,"" and ""fever"" were obtained from June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Related queries were evaluated for a relationship to coronary heart disease. RESULTS: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, chest pain searches increased in all countries studied by at least 34% (USA P=.003, Spain P=.007, UK P=.001, Italy P=.002), while searches for myocardial infarction dropped or remained unchanged. Rising searches for chest pain included ""coronavirus chest pain,"" ""home remedies for chest pain,"" and ""natural remedies for chest pain."" Searches on COVID-19 symptoms (eg, cough, fever) rose initially but returned to baseline while chest pain-related searches remained elevated throughout May. CONCLUSIONS: Search engine queries for chest pain have risen during the pandemic as have related searches with alternative attribution for chest pain or home care for chest pain, suggesting that recent drops in ACS presentations may be due to patients avoiding the emergency room and potential treatment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Senecal, Conor; Gulati, Rajiv; Lerman, Amir",JMIR Cardio,582,24

Thoracic aortic dissection typically presents with tearing chest, back, or abdominal pain. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2), which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and usually manifests with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and fever. This case report highlights an important impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the identification and management of aortic dissection in the emergency department. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old Bahraini male, a suspected case of Marfan syndrome, presented with complaints of shortness of breath and worsening productive cough after returning from the United States (U.S). He denied any chest, back, or abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness in any limb, gait disturbance, headache, or change in vision. He was considered high risk for COVID-19 because of the recent travel and respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed incidentally with ascending aortic dissection along with a right lung consolidation. His SARS-Cov2 PCR came negative thrice during hospital stay, and he underwent elective cardiothoracic surgery. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major stressor for the healthcare system worldwide, inflicting serious threats. Aortic dissection is one of the major life-threatening diseases that needs to be identified early on in the emergency department; however, in this case delayed diagnosis raised significant concerns due to underlying evolving triaging system for COVID-19 and atypical and overlapping clinical presentation. Further research is needed to look for COVID-19-associated factors, affecting the standard of care in the emergency department. Improving handover can directly impact patient care; therefore, it should be optimized.","Shahzad, Tahir; Mohamed Salih Mustafa, Mulham; Bhutta, Zain A; Edmund Harris, TimRichard",Qatar Med J,582,16

METHODS: This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and admitted to a regional inpatient rehabilitation hospital from April 29th to May 22nd, 2020. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and complications from acute hospitalization were examined. Measures of fall risk (Berg Balance Scale), endurance (6 Minute Walk Test), gait speed (10 Meter Walk Test), mobility (transfer and ambulation independence), cognition, speech and swallowing (American Speech and Hearing Association National Outcomes Measurement System Functional Communication Measures) were assessed at rehabilitation admission and discharge. RESULTS: The study population included 29 patients and was 70% male, 58.6% white and with a mean age of 59.5. The mean length of acute hospitalization was 32.2 days with a mean of 18.7 days intubated. Patients spent a mean of 16.7 days in inpatient rehabilitation and 90% were discharged home. Patients demonstrated significant improvement from admission to discharge in measures of fall risk, endurance, gait speed, mobility, cognition, speech and swallowing, (p< 0.05). At discharge, a significant portion of the population continued to deficits in cognition (attention 37%; memory 28%; problem solving 28%), balance (55%) and gait speed (97%). CONCLUSION: Patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation after hospitalization with COVID-19 demonstrated deficits in mobility, cognition, speech and swallowing at admission and improved significantly in all of these domains by discharge. However, a significant number of patients exhibited residual deficits at discharge highlighting the post-acute care needs of this patient population.","Olezene, Cameron Spencer; Hansen, Elizabeth; Steere, Hannah K; Giacino, Joseph T; Polich, Ginger R; Borg-Stein, Joanne; Zafonte, Ross D; Schneider, Jeffrey C",PLoS One,582,26

While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to CP is unknown. We retrospectively examined 427 adult inpatient CP transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 adult patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) within the Mount Sinai Health System, through the US Food and Drug Administration emergency investigational new drug and the Mayo Clinic Expanded Access Protocol to Convalescent Plasma approval pathways. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics and clinical and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusions were identified (12.9% incidence), and 13 were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile nonhemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), and allergic (1.8%) and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12 to 13, and decreased risk within the age group of 80 to 89 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of CP as a safe, therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.","Nguyen, Freddy T; van den Akker, Tayler; Lally, Kimberly; Lam, Hansen; Lenskaya, Volha; Liu, Sean T H; Bouvier, Nicole M; Aberg, Judith A; Rodriguez, Denise; Krammer, Florian; Strauss, Donna; Shaz, Beth H; Rudon, Louella; Galdon, Patricia; Jhang, Jeffrey S; Arinsburg, Suzanne A; Baine, Ian",Transfusion,582,21

This study, prepared by a large international panel of stroke experts, assesses the rapidly growing research and personal experience with COVID-19 stroke and offers recommendations for stroke management in this challenging new setting: modifications needed for prehospital emergency rescue and hyperacute care; inpatient intensive or stroke units; posthospitalization rehabilitation; follow-up including at-risk family and community; and multispecialty departmental developments in the allied professions. SUMMARY: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses spike proteins binding to tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, most often through the respiratory system by virus inhalation and thence to other susceptible organ systems, leading to COVID-19. Clinicians facing the many etiologies for stroke have been sobered by the unusual incidence of combined etiologies and presentations, prominent among them are vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial dysfunction. International standards of acute stroke management remain in force, but COVID-19 adds the burdens of personal protections for the patient, rescue, and hospital staff and for some even into the postdischarge phase. For pending COVID-19 determination and also for those shown to be COVID-19 affected, strict infection control is needed at all times to reduce spread of infection and to protect healthcare staff, using the wealth of well-described methods. For COVID-19 patients with stroke, thrombolysis and thrombectomy should be continued, and the usual early management of hypertension applies, save that recent work suggests continuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Prothrombotic states, some acute and severe, encourage prophylactic LMWH unless bleeding risk is high. COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy adds risk of cardioembolic stroke, where heparin or warfarin may be preferable, with experience accumulating with DOACs. As ever, arteritis can prove a difficult diagnosis, especially if not obvious on the acute angiogram done for clot extraction. This field is under rapid development and may generate management recommendations which are as yet unsettled, even undiscovered. Beyond the acute management phase, COVID-19-related stroke also forces rehabilitation services to use protective precautions. As with all stroke patients, health workers should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or distress developing in their patients and caregivers. Postdischarge outpatient care currently includes continued secondary prevention measures. Although hoping a COVID-19 stroke patient can be considered cured of the virus, those concerned for contact safety can take comfort in the increasing use of telemedicine, which is itself a growing source of patient-physician contacts. Many online resources are available to patients and physicians. Like prior challenges, stroke care teams will also overcome this one. Key Messages: Evidence-based stroke management should continue to be provided throughout the patient care journey, while strict infection control measures are enforced.","Venketasubramanian, Narayanaswamy; Anderson, Craig; Ay, Hakan; Aybek, Selma; Brinjikji, Waleed; de Freitas, Gabriel R; Del Brutto, Oscar H; Fassbender, Klaus; Fujimura, Miki; Goldstein, Larry B; Haberl, Roman L; Hankey, Graeme J; Heiss, Wolf-Dieter; Lestro Henriques, Isabel; Kase, Carlos S; Kim, Jong S; Koga, Masatoshi; Kokubo, Yoshihiro; Kuroda, Satoshi; Lee, Kiwon; Lee, Tsong-Hai; Liebeskind, David S; Lip, Gregory Y H; Meairs, Stephen; Medvedev, Roman; Mehndiratta, Man Mohan; Mohr, Jay P; Nagayama, Masao; Pantoni, Leonardo; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Parrilla, Guillermo; Pastori, Daniele; Pendlebury, Sarah T; Pettigrew, Luther Creed; Renjen, Pushpendra N; Rundek, Tatjana; Schminke, Ulf; Shinohara, Yukito; Tang, Wai Kwong; Toyoda, Kazunori; Wartenberg, Katja E; Wasay, Mohammad; Hennerici, Michael G",Cerebrovasc Dis,582,21

We use exogenous climate shocks as instruments for social distancing since people are more likely to stay home in wetter and colder periods. Our findings suggest that the health benefits of social distancing differ by levels of municipal development and may have vanished if the COVID-19 spread was not controlled in neighboring municipalities. In turn, we did not find evidence that municipalities with tougher social distancing performed worse economically.

Payment is not the sort of benefit that justifies exposing subjects to risk. Alan Wertheimer has raised a serious challenge to this view, pointing out that in industry, social value is not considered necessary to make dangerous jobs ethical. This article argues that Wertheimer was correct to think that the ethics of hazard pay should be the same in medical research and in business. Nevertheless, a qualified social benefit requirement should apply in both fields. For a study or a job with significant net physical risk to be ethical, it must have social value beyond the satisfaction of ordinary preferences, including the preference for money. The requirement derives from a non-absolutist version of the doctrine of double effect. If a risky study or a dangerous job has no distinctive social value, and hazard pay is subjects' or workers' only reason to undergo risks, the very fact that they undergo risk is intended as a means to a financial end. Inviting people to enrol in such a study or to take such a job wrongfully treats people as mere means. By contrast, if a study or a job has social value, people can participate with a primary end other than money, even if they accept compensation. Researchers or employers do not intend but merely foresee risks to subjects or workers.","Hughes, Robert C",J. med. ethics,582,12

However, it is proving to be more dangerous during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tobacco use may increase the risk of being infected, increases the chances of complications, and also increases the probability of its spread. We assessed the awareness about this association and the impact of the lockdown on tobacco use among tobacco users registered before the lockdown for LifeFirst, a tobacco dependence treatment program. METHODS: 1016 tobacco users were under active follow-up in their course of the 6-month counselling program. From 14 to 28 May 2020, 650 (64%) of these registered users were contacted by counsellors for follow-up sessions over the telephone. Semi-structured questionnaires were filled in during the calls. RESULTS: Two-thirds (67%) of tobacco users were unaware of the association between tobacco and COVID-19. Only 30% of the users felt that the current situation had affected their tobacco use, the commonest impacts being unavailability and increased prices of tobacco products. While this was seen as an opportunity to quit by some users, some reported increased tobacco use due to increased stress. Of the 219 (34%) tobacco users who quit tobacco during the lockdown, 51% quit because of the lockdown and their concern over COVID-19. Abstinence among those who were aware of the association between the coronavirus and tobacco was twice that among those who were not aware. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness activities about the harmful effects of tobacco during the coronavirus pandemic have to be strengthened. Measures to motivate and support tobacco users to quit have to be provided through cessation services.","Gupte, Himanshu A; Mandal, Gauri; Jagiasi, Dinesh",Tob Prev Cessat,582,20

However, despite its extraordinary capabilities, cryo-EM remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is therefore beneficial to have a means for rapidly assessing and optimizing the quality of samples prior to lengthy cryo-EM analyses. To do this, we have developed a native mass spectrometry (nMS) platform that provides rapid feedback on sample quality and highly streamlined biochemical screening. Because nMS enables accurate mass analysis of protein complexes, it is well suited to routine evaluation of the composition, integrity, and homogeneity of samples prior to their plunge-freezing on EM grids. We demonstrate the utility of our nMS-based platform for facilitating cryo-EM studies using structural characterizations of exemplar bacterial transcription complexes as well as the replication-transcription assembly from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Olinares, Paul Dominic B; Kang, Jin Young; Llewellyn, Eliza; Chiu, Courtney; Chen, James; Malone, Brandon; Saecker, Ruth M; Campbell, Elizabeth A; Darst, Seth A; Chait, Brian T",,582,21

Ozone is a harmful pollutant and is responsible for many health issues. However, some reports suggest that ozone is a strong disinfectant, and can kill the viruses. We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27th March to 10th April 2020. The NO2, CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O3-NOx-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India. The data obtained from this study advances the fundamental understanding of ozone chemistry that may lead to improved ozone parameterization in chemical transport models and better planning of ozone risk management strategies for any global mega cities.","Rathod, A; Sahu, S K; Singh, S; Beig, G",Heliyon,582,1

Peptidase is the drug target for corona viruses and this enzyme processes the production of polyproteins from the viral RNA. Objective of this study is to find the inhibitors against SARS-Cov-2 peptidase. Auto Dock 4.2 was used for docking calculations. To check diûerent molecules, test ligands like lopinavir, ritonavir (retroviral drugs) and hydroxychloroquine (anti-malarial drug) were docked against our target enzyme peptidase retrieved from Protein Data Bank. With respect to docking free binding energy, it is revealed that, Lopinavir has the lowest binding energy followed by Ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine binds significantly to target enzyme peptidase. The results of this study provides a solid basis for the use of Hydroxychloroquine for CORONA treatment. The interactions from structural models at the peptidase active site can offer a useful guide for more designs for structure-based medications and development of more operative inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 peptidase.","Mamidala, E.; Davella, R.; Gurrapu, S.","Asian Journal of Microbiology, Biotechnology and Environmental Sciences",582,29

Recent empirical data however, indicated that suicide rates in many countries remained unchanged or even decreased. Existing studies assessed the overall rates and did not stratify by age-subgroups. Methods We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the age-stratified (<25, 25-44, 45-64, ≥ 65) trends in monthly suicide rates before (January 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2019) and after (January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020) the outbreak of COVID-19 in Taiwan. Results We found a slight decrease in overall suicide rates after the outbreak (annual average rates were 16.4 and 15.5 per 100,000 population, respectively, p=0.05). Age-stratified analysis indicated that suicide rates increased in younger (<25) and decreased in the middle age group (25-64 years). In older age groups (≥65), an immediate rate decrease was observed followed by a sustained upward trend during the onset of the pandemic. Conclusions Although an overall decrease in annual suicide rates was found after the outbreak, the age-specific subgroup analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. Stratified analysis is crucial to identify vulnerable subgroups in the midst of the pandemic.","Chen, Ying-Yeh Yang Chi-Ting Pinkney Edward Yip Paul S.

This study aimed to identify causes of delay in interfacility transport by air ambulance in Ontario. METHODS: Causes of delay were identified by manual review of electronic patient care records (ePCRs). All emergent interfacility transfers conducted by Ornge, the sole provider of air-based medical transport in Ontario, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 were included. The ePCRs were reviewed if they met one or more of the following: (1) contained a standardized delay code; (2) contained free text including ""delay"", ""wait"", or ""duty-out""; (3) were above the 75th percentile in total transport time; or (4) were above the 90th percentile in time to bedside, time at the sending hospital, or time to receiving facility. RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 1,220 ePCRs for manual review, which identified a total of 872 delays. Common delays cited included aircraft refueling (234 delays), waiting for land emergency medical service (EMS) escort (146), and staffing- or dispatch-related issues (124). Other delays included weather/environmental hazards (43); mechanical issues (36); and procedures, imaging, or stabilization (80). CONCLUSIONS: Some common causes of interfacility delay are potentially modifiable: better trip planning around refueling and improved coordination with local EMS, could reduce delays experienced during interfacility trips. To better understand causes of delay, we would benefit from improved documentation and record availability which limited the results in this study.","Wong, Alanna; McParland, Aidan; Nolan, Brodie",CJEM,582,16

They are typically assessed using validated, self-completed questionnaires known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are used in healthcare settings to support care planning, clinical decision-making, patient-practitioner communication and quality improvement. PROMs have a potential role in the delivery of social care where people often have multiple and complex long-term health conditions. However, the use of PROMs in this context is currently unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the evidence relating to the use of PROMs in adult social care.

Of various drug delivery systems (DDSs) for gene and oligonucleotide drugs, few examples of the clinical application of polymer as drug carriers are known, despite development of the novel polymers has been progressing. Cyclodextrin (CD) conjugates with starburst polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer (CDEs), as a new type of polymer-based carriers, were first published in 2001. After that, galactose-, lactose-, mannose-, fucose-, folate-, and polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-appended CDEs have been prepared for passive and active targeting for gene, oligonucleotide, and low-molecular-weight drugs. PEG-appended CDE formed polypsuedorotaxanes with α-CD and γ-CD, which are useful for a sustained release system of gene and oligonucleotide drugs. Interestingly, CDEs were found to have anti-inflammatory effects and anti-amyloid effects themselves, which have potential as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Most recently, CDE is reported to be a useful Cas9-RNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNP) carrier that induces genome editing in the neuron and brain. In this review, the history and progression of CDEs are overviewed.","Arima, Hidetoshi",Pharmaceutics,582,1

A respected clinician and scientist, as well as a skilled communicator, she has every prospect of restoring credibility and leadership to the nation's foremost public health agency. Walensky recently co-authored an important paper in Health Affairs, which examined the future determinants of a successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Her message was sobering. While the present obsession with vaccine efficacy might be understandable, there are likely to be more important influences on future immunisation programmes-vaccine manufacturing capacity, distribution systems and infrastructure, pace of imple-mentation, coverage, health messaging, and continued adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Those old enough to remember the story of smallpox eradication will not have been surprised by Walensky's conclusions. What is surprising is that we are having to relearn those lessons all over again. D A Henderson led WHO's campaign against smallpox. As we look ahead to the implementation of a worldwide vaccination programme to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, Henderson's messages deserve revisiting.","Horton, R.",Lancet,582,33

To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation.","Fisher, Eva; Padula, Laura; Podack, Kristin; O039,; Neill, Katelyn; Seavey, Matthew M; Jayaraman, Padmini; Jasuja, Rahul; Strbo, Natasa",Front Immunol,582,33

The various lockdown measures may have devastating impacts on economies and livelihoods. This approach risks undermining public trust in government responses and therefore undermines efforts to promote behaviour change, which is key to the success of social interventions. Important lessons can be drawn from past Ebola outbreaks and the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic on how communities should be central to COVID-19 responses. Communities are complex and only their members can inform public health experts about their lived realities, the community's understanding of the outbreak and what will work locally to reduce transmission. The public should be encouraged to take positive actions to ensure their own health and well-being, rather than made to feel powerless. Communities should be supported to develop their own response plans, community leaders should be recognised as vital assets, community representatives should have equal inclusion in strategic meetings and greater empathy should be built into decision-making processes.","Johnson, Oliver; Goronga, Tinashe",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,582,26

It was found that, as a result of standard treatment, patients in the control group showed a decrease in the concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The addition of thymalin to standard therapy accelerated the decline in both these indicators and the indicators of the T cell system.

In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

A commitment to equity is about making specific changes in practices and decisions at multiple levels, along with growing a wider ethical framework. This pivot of a mindset requires us, as tourists, corporations, and educators to step away from a selfish perspective and critically change our perception and understanding of tourism to a truly equitable focus. Consequently, these actions force us to question the consumerism and capitalistic lens that has contributed to mass growth across the touristic landscape and instead, choose a system that fosters sustainable and equitable growth - which in turn, ‘slows down’ our ways of consuming the world around us - transforming our values and experiences of what tourism is and should be.","Benjamin, Stefanie; Dillette, Alana; Alderman, Derek H.",Tour.

The main goal was to obtain robust and high-quality plans for different anatomic sites and various dosimetric requirements. METHODS: Monaco (Elekta, St. Louis, US) was the TPS in this work. All input parameters for inverse planning could be defined in a plan template inside Monaco. A software tool called Robot Framework was used to launch auto-planning trials with updated plan templates. The template modifier external to Monaco was the major component of our auto-planning platform. For current implementation, it was a rule-based system that mimics the trial-and-error process of an experienced planner. A template was automatically updated by changing the optimization constraints based on dosimetric evaluation of the plan obtained in the previous trial, along with the data of the iterative optimization extracted from Monaco. Treatment plans generated by Monaco with all plan evaluation criteria satisfied were considered acceptable, and such plans would be saved for further evaluation by clinicians. The auto-planning platform was validated for 10 prostate and 10 head-and-neck cases in comparison with clinical plans generated by experienced planners. RESULTS: The performance and robustness of our auto-planning platform was tested with clinical cases of prostate and head and neck treatment. For prostate cases, automatically generated plans had very similar plan quality with the clinical plans, and the bladder volume receiving 62.5 Gy, 50 Gy, and 40 Gy in auto-plans was reduced by 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. For head and neck cases, auto-plans had better conformity with reduced dose to the normal structures but slightly higher dose inhomogeneity in the target volume. Remarkably, the maximum dose in the spinal cord and brain stem was reduced by more than 3.5 Gy in auto-plans. Fluence map optimization only with less than 30 trials was adequate to generate acceptable plans, and subsequent optimization for final plans was completed by Monaco without further intervention. The plan quality was weakly dependent on the parameter selection in the initial template and the choices of the step sizes for changing the constraint values. CONCLUSION: An automated planning platform to interface with Monaco was developed, and our reported tests showed preliminary results for prostate and head and neck cases.","Huang, Xiaotian; Quan, Hong; Zhao, Bo; Zhou, Wing; Chen, Charles; Chen, Yan",J Appl Clin Med Phys,582,8

Additive manufacturing (AM), the most efficient-material processing technology to date, has likewise made great strides to promote sustainable industrial solutions to our needs in engineered products. Bringing lignin research to AM has prompted the emergence of the nascent ""lignin 3D printing"" field. This review presents the recent state of art of this promising field and highlights its challenges and opportunities. Following a review of the industrial availability, molecular attributes, and associated properties of technical lignins, we review R&D efforts at implementing lignin systems in extrusion-based and stereolithography (SLA) printing technologies. Doing so underlines the adage of lignin research that ""all lignins are not created equal,"" and stresses the opportunity nested in this chemical diversity created mostly by differences in isolation conditions to molecularly select and tune the attributes of technical lignin systems towards desirable properties, be it by modification or polymer blending. Considering the AM design process in its entirety, we finally propose onward routes to bring the full potential to this emerging field.

METHODS: Twenty ENT surgeons assessed how much of a given procedure they would expect to allow a trainee to perform for their first time. Responses were provided for trainees who had undergone a relevant simulation course and those who had not, and scored according to the eLogbook levels of involvement in surgery. This was completed for simulated procedures with validated models, across four grades of junior doctors. RESULTS: A total of 1120 judgements on the trainees' intended level of involvement were made. The median involvement score was higher in the simulation group versus the non-simulation group (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.0001), corresponding to a translation in surgical opportunity from a primarily assisting role to an active role. CONCLUSION: Trainer perception of a relevant ENT simulation course appears to positively impact on the initial surgical opportunities afforded to the trainee.","Noon, E J R; Singh, A; Hall, A",J Laryngol Otol,582,13

Here, we use population size for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and forecasting of the epidemic. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and using nonlinear filtering theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. The model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter. Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its selection criterion. We estimate the mean of the basic reproductive number of China and the rest of the globe except China (GEC) to be 2.46 (95% CI: 2.41-2.51) and 3.64 (95% CI: (3.55-3.72), respectively. We infer that the number of latent infections of GEC is about 7.47*10^5 (95% CI: 7.32*10^5-7.62*10^5) as of April 2, 2020. We predict that the peak of infections in hospitals of GEC may reach 3.00*10^6 on the present trajectory, i.e., if the population size for pathogen transmission and epidemic parameters remains unchanged. If the control intensity is strengthened, e.g., 50% reduction or 75% reduction of the population size for pathogen transmission, the peak would decline to 1.84*10^6, 1.27*10^6, respectively.","Zhang, Xuqi; Liu, Haiqi; Tang, Hanning; Zhang, Mei; Yuan, Xuedong; Shen, Xiaojing",,582,24

Although they involve separate legal areas, patent and copyright, the common thread linking the two is intellectual property's difficult relationship with access in the public interest. This paper examines the tensions caused by access barriers, the tools used to reduce them and their effectiveness. It is clear that the access barriers magnified by COVID-19 are not restricted to narrow or specific contexts but are widespread. They are created by, and are a feature of, our existing IPR frameworks. Open movements provide limited remedies because they are not designed to, nor can adequately address the wide range of access barriers necessary to promote the public interest. Existing legislative mechanisms designed to remove access barriers similarly fail to effectively remedy access needs. These existing options are premised on the assumption that there is a singular ""public"" motivated by homogenous ""interests"", which fails to reflect the plurality and cross-border reality of the public(s) interest(s) underpinning the welfare goals of IPR. We conclude that a systemic re-evaluation is required and call for positive and equitable legal measures protective of the public(s) interest(s) to be built within IPR frameworks that also address non-IPR barriers. The current pandemic and development of a ""new normal"" provides a crucial opportunity to comprehensively consider the public(s) interest(s), not just during a global health crisis, but on an ongoing basis.","Walsh, Karen; Wallace, Andrea; Pavis, Mathilde; Olszowy, Natalie; Griffin, James; Hawkins, Naomi",IIC Int Rev Ind Prop Copyr Law,582,23

However, the spatiotemporal variations and risk determinants of COVID-19 in typical labor export regions of China remain unclear. Understanding the geographical distribution of the disease and the socio-economic factors affecting its transmission is critical for disease prevention and control. METHODS: A total of 2152 COVID-19 cases were reported from January 21 to February 24, 2020 across the 34 cities in Henan and Anhui. A Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchy model was used to detect the spatiotemporal variations of the risk posed by COVID-19, and the GeoDetector q statistic was used to evaluate the determinant power of the potential influence factors. RESULTS: The risk posed by COVID-19 showed geographical spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Temporally, there was an outbreak period and control period. Spatially, there were high-risk regions and low-risk regions. The high-risk regions were mainly in the southwest areas adjacent to Hubei and cities that served as economic and traffic hubs, while the low-risk regions were mainly in western Henan and eastern Anhui, far away from the epicenter. The accessibility, local economic conditions, and medical infrastructure of Wuhan in Hubei province all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The results indicated that the q statistics of the per capita GDP and the proportion of primary industry GDP were 0.47 and 0.47, respectively. The q statistic of the population flow from Wuhan was 0.33. In particular, the results showed that the q statistics for the interaction effects between population density and urbanization, population flow from Wuhan, per capita GDP, and the number of doctors were all greater than 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the labor export regions of China. The high-risk regions were mainly located in areas adjacent to the epicenter as well as in big cities that served as traffic hubs. Population access to the epicenter, as well as local economic and medical conditions, played an important role in the interactive effects of the disease transmission.","Wang, Li; Xu, Chengdong; Wang, Jinfeng; Qiao, Jiajun; Yan, Mingtao; Zhu, Qiankun",BMC Infect Dis,582,13

According to Cox's regression analysis, age variables (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.03, CI: 1.02-1.04), patients with a history of diabetes (HR: 2.16, CI: 1.38-3.38), cancer (HR: 3.57, CI: 1.82-7.02), CLD (HR: 2.21, CI: 1.22-4) and CHD (HR: 2.20, CI: 1.57-3.09) were significant and affected the hazard of death in patients with COVID-19 and assuming that the other variables in the model are constant, the hazard of death increases by 3% by increasing one unit (year), and the hazard of death in COVID-19 patients with CHD, diabetes, cancer, CLD is 2.16, 3.57, 2.2 and 2.21, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to findings, it is necessary to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with CLD, diabetes, cancer, CHD, and elder, as patients with these characteristics may face a greater risk of death. Therefore, we suggest that elders and people with those underlying illnesses need to be under active surveillance and screened frequently.","Zandkarimi, Eghbal; Moradi, Ghobad; Mohsenpour, Behzad",Int. j. health policy manag,582,20

Sacco Hospital (Milano, Italy) on 20th February 2020 in a 38 years old male patient, who was found positive for pneumonia at the Codogno Hospital. Thereafter Lombardy has reported the highest prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the country, especially in Milano, Brescia and Bergamo provinces. The aim of this study was to assess the potential presence of different viral clusters belonging to the six main provinces involved in Lombardy COVID-19 cases in order to highlight peculiar province-dependent viral characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 20 full length genomes obtained from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020, aligned with 41 Italian viral genome assemblies available on GISAID database as of 30th March, 2020: two main monophyletic clades, containing 8 and 53 isolates, respectively, were identified. Noteworthy, Bergamo isolates mapped inside the small clade harbouring M gene D3G mutation. The molecular clock analysis estimated a cluster divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains had spread worldwide at different times, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, this epidemiological reconstruction suggests that virus initial circulation in Lombardy was ascribable to multiple introduction. The phylogenetic reconstruction robustness, however, will be improved when more genomic sequences are available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.","Micheli, Valeria; Rimoldi, Sara G; Romeri, Francesca; Comandatore, Francesco; Mancon, Alessandro; Gigantiello, Anna; Perini, Matteo; Mileto, Davide; Pagani, Cristina; Lombardi, Alessandra; Gismondo, Maria R",J Med Virol,582,29

The reported values of CT sensitivity and specificity calculated using RT-PCR as a reference standard vary widely. The objective of this study was to reevaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT using an alternative approach. This study included 973 symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged 42 $\pm$ 17 years, 56% females. We reviewed the disease dynamics between the initial and follow-up CT studies using a""CT0-4""grading system. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated as conditional probabilities that a patient's condition would improve or deteriorate relative to the initial CT study results. For the calculation of negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values, we estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. We used several ARIMA and EST models with different parameters to fit the data on total cases of COVID-19 from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, and forecast the incidence. The""CT0-4""grading scale demonstrated low sensitivity (28%) but high specificity (95%). The best statistical model for describing the pandemic in Moscow was ETS with multiplicative trend, error, and season type. According to our calculations, with the predicted prevalence of 2.1%, the values of NPV and PPV would be 98% and 10%, correspondingly. We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values with the small sample size of the patients with severe symptoms and non-optimal methodological setup for measuring these specific characteristics. The""CT0-4""grading scale was highly specific and predictive for identifying admissions to hospitals of COVID-19 patients. Despite the ambiguous accuracy, chest CT proved to be an effective practical tool for patient management during the pandemic, provided that the necessary infrastructure and human resources are available.","Morozov, Sergey P.; Reshetnikov, Roman V.; Gombolevskiy, Victor A.; Ledikhova, Natalia V.; Blokhin, Ivan A.; Kljashtorny, Vladislav G.; Mokienko, Olesya A.; Vladzymyrskyy, Anton V.",,582,33

We decided to follow this path and screened approved medications ""off-label"" against SARS-CoV-2. Fluoxetine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 0.8 µg/ml significantly in these screenings, and the EC50 was determined with 387 ng/ml. Furthermore, Fluoxetine reduced viral infectivity in precision-cut human lung slices showing its activity in relevant human tissue targeted in severe infections. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in a decrease in viral protein expression. Fluoxetine is a racemate consisting of both stereoisomers, while the S-form is the dominant serotonin reuptake inhibitor. We found that both isomers show similar activity on the virus, indicating that the R-form might specifically be used for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Fluoxetine inhibited neither Rabies virus, human respiratory syncytial virus replication nor the Human Herpesvirus 8 or Herpes simplex virus type 1 gene expression, indicating that it acts virus-specific. Moreover, since it is known that Fluoxetine inhibits cytokine release, we see the role of Fluoxetine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of risk groups.","Zimniak, Melissa; Kirschner, Luisa; Hilpert, Helen; Geiger, Nina; Danov, Olga; Oberwinkler, Heike; Steinke, Maria; Sewald, Katherina; Seibel, Jürgen; Bodem, Jochen",Sci Rep,582,24

It then proposes liturgical temporality as an alternative to 24/7 temporality, framing it as a fitting context for the cultivation of solidarity between human beings and between human beings and the natural world. It argues that modern Jewish and Christian theologies of Sabbath-keeping as a mode of liturgical and ethical praxis have articulated a liberative vision for shared liturgical temporality but have not paid sufficient attention to concrete, collective modes of liturgical time keeping that could contend with the all-encompassing reality of 24/7 life. It concludes by discussing three ways that a more robust spirituality and praxis of liturgical time could support the cultivation of solidarity: a sense of the present that is mindful of the past and future, the invitation of practitioners into a shared story, and meaningful repetition toward the appropriation of a vision of redemption and liberation for human and non-human life.

A rising number of atypical infections have been reported. Thus, scientists and clinicians are doing hard work to unravel scientific knowledge about this novel pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work was to highlight the oral manifestations which could be observed in mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was performed on 665 Egyptian patients who were confirmed COVID-19-positive based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. After applying the exclusion criteria, cases with mild-to-moderate symptoms were included in the study. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The 1st section included demographic data, smoking, alcohol consumption, and general health status. The 2nd section contained questions regarding the oral hygiene status of the patients, and additionally a question about the hygienic measures they took while being infected with COVID-19. The 3rd section included questions about the most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms the patients suffered from. The 4th section included questions that referred to the oral manifestations the patients complained of while being infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were included in this survey. It was reported that 71.7% of COVID-19 patients presented with some oral manifestations at a level of significance, with variable incidence - oral or dental pain (23%), pain in jaw bones or joint (12.0%), halitosis (10.5%), ulcerations (20.4%), and xerostomia (47.6%). Some patients (28.3%) showed 2 or 3 manifestations simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: It was proven that mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 infection are associated with oral symptoms, and thus the significance of dental examination of patients with communicable diseases should be emphasized.","Abubakr, Nermeen; Salem, Zeinab Amin; Kamel, Amany Hany Mohamed",Dent Med Probl,582,24

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality for transplant candidates; interestingly, posttransplant comorbidities play a larger role than immunosuppression status. COVID-19 therapies and vaccinations are well tolerated in pre and postliver transplant patients with few exceptions, although further research is needed regarding effectiveness in this patient population. Provider practice patterns should evolve to minimize contagion during the current pandemic and prepare for an increase in liver disease due to after-shocks of missed diagnosis and progression of liver disease. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has spurred new research and technologies to ensure the safety of liver transplant candidates, recipients, and donors, and most COVID-19 therapies are safe in this patient population.

Some available therapies (antimalarials, antivirals, biological agents) were grounded on clinical case observations or basic science data. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and impact of different therapies on clinical outcomes in a cohort of severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we collected sequential data on adult patients admitted to Hospital Universitario Quironsalud Madrid. Eligible patients should have a microbiological (positive test on RT-PCR assay from a nasal swab) or an epidemiological diagnosis of severe COVID-19. Demographic, baseline comorbidities, laboratory data, clinical outcomes, and treatments were compared between survivors and non-survivors. We carried out univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Findings: From March 10th to April 15th, 2020, 607 patients were included. Median age was 69 years [interquartile range, {IQR} 22; 65% male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (276 [46·94%]), diabetes (95 [16·16%]), chronic cardiac (133 [22·62%]) and respiratory (114 [19·39%]) diseases. 141 patients (23·2%) died. In the multivariate model the risk of death increased with older age (odds ratio, for every year of age, 1·15, [95% CI 1·11 - 1·2]), tocilizumab therapy (2·4, [1·13 - 5·11]), C-reactive protein at admission (1·07, per 10 mg/L, [1·04 - 1·10]), d-dimer > 2·5 µg/mL (1·99, [1·03 - 3·86]), diabetes mellitus (2·61, [1·19 - 5·73]), and the PaO2/FiO2 at admission (0·99, per every 1 mmHg, [0·98 - 0·99]). Among the prescribed therapies (tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine), only cyclosporine was associated with a significant decrease in mortality (0·24, [0·12 - 0·46]; p<0·001). Interpretation: In a real-clinical setting, inhibition of the calcineurin inflammatory pathway, NF-&#954;&#914;, could reduce the hyperinflammatory phase in COVID-19. Our findings might entail relevant implications for the therapy of this disease and could boost the design of new clinical trials among subjects affected by severe COVID-19.

At present, the level of fear of COVID-19 and associated factors among nursing students in the Philippines are not well understood. This cross-sectional online survey determined the relationship between Internet use and eHealth literacy with fear of COVID-19. One thousand three hundred and sixty-seven (n=1,367) answered an online survey using the adopted eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) administered from May 1 to 15, 2020. Descriptive statistics, tests for differences, and correlational analysis were performed. Results indicated that the composite score of the FCV-19S was 3.65, indicating moderate to high levels of fear. Fear of COVID-19 significantly differed based on sex, year level, and location. A significant inverse relationship was found between the average daily use of the Internet and fear of COVID-19. On the other hand, no significant association was noted between eHealth literacy and fear of COVID-19. The first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a far-reaching impact on nursing students' psychological well-being. This study highlights the value of the Internet and its use during the outbreak may not always lead to higher fear related to COVID-19.

Bacterial infection is the main cause of sepsis, however, sepsis caused by virus is often ignored. Increased awareness, early recognition of viral sepsis, rapid administration of appropriate antiviral drugs, and urgent treatment can significantly reduce deaths of viral sepsis. Objectives: Given the rapid global spread of novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), coupled with the high rate of missed diagnosis of viral sepsis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is urgent to evaluate the multiple organ failure score and viral sepsis in COVID-19 patients, so as to determine the clinical characteristics of viral sepsis more accurately and reveal the risk factors related to mortality. Methods: Here we provide a full description of three cases of viral sepsis and subsequent multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection imported to Guiyang from Wuhan. Results: We analyzed complete laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment methods for the patients and assessed Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA score) and Multiple organ dysfunction scores (MOD score) daily, aimed to elucidate the clinical feature of viral sepsis and MODS and to attract enough attention by clinicians.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We have undertaken a rapid review of published literature on the role of radiotherapy in the multimodality treatment of paediatric cancers governing the European practise of paediatric radiotherapy. The derived data has been discussed with expert paediatric radiation oncologists to derive a hierarchy of recommendations. RESULTS: The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis. The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed.

Intestinal ischemic injury plays prominent role in chemotherapeutic enteritis clinically. However, mechanism is not clear. In this article, irinotecan (CPT-11) was used to establish chemotherapeutic enteritis mice model. Western blotting, gelatin zymography, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were used to detect the pathogenesis of ischemia-hypoxia injury. CPT-11 increased levels of tissue factor (TF) both in the blood and in intestines, and decreased the intestinal blood flow in mice. Interestingly, the elevation of TF in the blood displayed ""double-peak,"" which was consistent with the intestinal mucosal ""double-strike"" injury trend. Intestinal microthrombus and mixed thrombus formation were detectable in chemotherapeutic enteritis. Furthermore, ozone therapy relieved chemotherapeutic enteritis in mice. Ozone inhibited TF expression induced by CPT-11 via activating AMPK/SOCS3, and effectively ameliorated the intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Moreover, ozone autotransfusion therapy effectively attenuated chemotherapeutic enteritis and the blood hypercoagulability in patients. For the first time, we proposed that TF-induced thrombotic intestinal ischemic injury is a core trigger pathological mechanism of chemotherapeutic enteritis, and provided a new treatment strategy, ozone therapy, to suppress TF expression and treat chemotherapeutic enteritis.","Yu, Qingqing; Yang, Xing; Zhang, Chen; Zhang, Xiaotao; Wang, Chaoyu; Chen, Lu; Liu, Xiaolin; Gu, Yufeng; He, Xueming; Hu, Liang; Liu, Wen-Tao; Li, Yan",FASEB j,582,1

In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, hand washing and wearing face covering. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people's mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys, we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Repeated 20 min structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults in Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure the primary outcomes of adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes and questions that align with the evolving pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Life Sciences and Medicine College Ethics Review Board (CERB) at the University of Aberdeen (CERB/2020/5/1942). Results will be made available to policy makers, funders, interested lay people and other researchers through weekly reports and three bimonthly bulletins placed on the CHARIS website and advertised through social media.","Den Daas, Chantal; Hubbard, Gill; Johnston, Marie; Dixon, Diane",BMJ Open,582,16

To avoid library size dependency, one common way of analyzing multivariate compositional data is to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on data transformed with the centered log-ratio, hereafter called a log-ratio PCA. Two aspects typical of amplicon sequencing data are the large differences in library size and the large number of zeroes. In this paper we show on real data and by simulation that, applied to data that combines these two aspects, log-ratio PCA is nevertheless heavily dependent on the library size. This leads to a reduction in power when testing against any explanatory variable in log-ratio redundancy analysis. If there is additionally a correlation between the library size and the explanatory variable, then the type 1 error becomes inated. We explore putative solutions to this problem.","Te Beest, Dennis E; Nijhuis, Els H; Möhlmann, T W R; Ter Braak, Cajo J F",Mol. ecol. resour. (Online),582,20

Mainly based on results obtained by autopsies, the seminal features of fatal COVID-19 have been described by many groups worldwide. Early changes encompass edema, epithelial damage, and capillaritis/endothelialitis, frequently combined with microthrombosis. Subsequently, patients with manifest respiratory insufficiency exhibit exudative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte type 2 hyperplasia, variably complicated by superinfection, which may progress to organizing/fibrotic stage DAD. These features, however, are not specific for COVID-19 and can be found in other disorders including viral infections. Clinically, the early disease stage of severe COVID-19 is characterized by high viral load, lymphopenia, massive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypercoagulability, documented by elevated D-dimers and an increased frequency of thrombotic and thromboembolic events, whereas virus loads and cytokine levels tend to decrease in late disease stages, when tissue repair including angiogenesis prevails. The present review describes the spectrum of lung pathology based on the current literature and the authors' personal experience derived from clinical autopsies, and tries to summarize our current understanding and open questions of the pathophysiology of severe pulmonary COVID-19.","Bösmüller, Hans; Matter, Matthias; Fend, Falko; Tzankov, Alexandar",Virchows Arch,582,24

However, the association between autonomy, optimism, work engagement and organisational citizenship behaviour remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to test if the effect of autonomy on organisational citizenship behaviour through the mediating effects of optimism and work engagement. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 242 nurses who came from multiple areas of China to work at the Wuhan Jinyintan hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic participated in this study. METHODS: A serial mediation model (model 6) of the PROCESS macro in SPSS was adopted to test the hypotheses, and a 95% CI for the indirect effects was constructed by using Bootstrapping. RESULTS: The autonomy-organisational citizenship behaviour relationship was mediated by optimism and work engagement, respectively. In addition, optimism and work engagement mediated this relationship serially. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study may have implications for improving organisational citizenship behaviour. The effects of optimism and work engagement suggest a potential mechanism of action for the autonomy-organisational citizenship behaviour linkage. A multifaceted intervention targeting organisational citizenship behaviour through optimism and work engagement may help improve the quality of nursing care among nurses supporting patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Hui; Zhao, Yi; Zou, Ping; Liu, Yang; Lin, Shuanghong; Ye, Zhihong; Tang, Leiwen; Shao, Jing; Chen, Dandan",BMJ Open,582,10

We surveyed Michigan NHs to evaluate preparedness, staffing, testing, and adaptations to these challenges. METHODS: Interpandemic survey responses were collected May 1-12, 2020. We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site. To reduce isolation, NHs facilitated communication via phone calls (98%), videoconferencing (96%), and window visits (81%). A majority continued to provide requisite therapies (90%). CONCLUSIONS: NHs experienced shortages of resources, testing supplies, and staffing challenges. COVID-19 in the facility was a key predictor of staff resignations. Facilities relied on rapidly changing, often conflicting advice from multiple sources, suggesting high-yield areas of improvement.","Jones, Karen; Mantey, Julia; Washer, Laraine; Meddings, Jennifer; Patel, Payal K; Montoya, Ana; Mills, John P; Gibson, Kristen; Mody, Lona",Am. j. infect. control,582,16

Considering the limitations of drugs and prophylactic methods used in current medicine, antiviral materials are a useful strategy in preventing the spread of viruses and enhancing treatment efficiency. Thus, this review highlights the state‐of‐the‐art antiviral materials, describes the scientific landscape of the primary antiviral materials used based on bibliometric analysis, presents their mechanisms of action, and discusses their clinical applications. The mechanisms of action underlying the broad‐spectrum antiviral properties of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites are also discussed. Polyanions, polycations, oxides, and metal‐based materials, from bulk to nanoparticles, have good potential in antiviral applications that may help prepare the world for future viral breakouts.

Hyperandrogenemia and ovarian dysfunction characterize polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women. Women with PCOS have higher prevalence of obesity and higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases and renal injury, making them a population at risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Three-week-old female mice were implanted with Silastic tubes filled with the nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 8 mg) or vehicle (empty tubes). Animals were maintained on high-fat diet (HFD;60% kcal fat) or low-fat diet (LFD;10% kcal fat, sucrose-matched) for 90 days. Fat mass (EchoMRI), kidney and left ventricle (LV) weights as well as the cardiac and renal expression of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1? (IL-1?) were assessed. Moreover, circulatory, urinary, renal and cardiac levels of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) were quantified. Additionally, renal and cardiac mRNA and protein expression of the multiple cellular proteases required for viral entry (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17) were assessed. Results HFD exacerbated DHT-mediated increases in fat mass (20.28 ± 1.10 vs. 6.78 ± 0.43 g, p&lt;0.05), kidney weight (33.79 ± 1.35 vs. 26.52 ± 1.08 g, p&lt;0.05), LV hypertrophy (7.48 ± 0.21 vs. 6.41 ± 0.28 g, p&lt;0.05) and renal and cardiac expression of the inflammatory marker IL-6 (1.5 and 2.5-fold, respectively). PCOS mice on both diets showed higher urinary ACE2 (LFD: 18-fold, HFD: 10-fold) and altered renal mRNA and/or protein expression of all the measured targets. DHT upregulated renal TMPRSS2 (1.19 ± 0.04 vs. 0.98 ± 0.03 AU, p&lt;0.05) and cathepsin L (2.64 ± 0.25 vs. 0.62 ± 0.25 AU, p&lt;0.05) proteins in HFD-fed DHT-treated mice compared to LFD-fed DHT-treated mice. In the heart, LFD-fed DHT-treated mice showed no change in ACE2 and the cellular proteases on either the mRNA or protein levels except for ADAM17 protein that was significantly upregulated (1.63-fold) compared to the vehicle-treated group. On the other hand, while HFD-fed DHT-treated mice showed similar increase in cardiac ADAM17 protein (1.64-fold vs. LFD-fed vehicle-treated), they showed higher mRNA expression of ACE2 (1.83-fold) and furin (1.32-fold) compared to the HFD-fed vehicle-treated mice. Conclusion and significance Our findings highlight women with PCOS as a population with a high risk of COVID-19 associated cardiac and renal complications. Further, our study suggests dietary control recommendations for optimal management of women with PCOS that can ultimately attenuate COVID-19 cardiorenal outcomes.","Rezq, Samar Huffman Alexandra Basnet Jelina Yanes Cardozo Licy Romero Damian",The FASEB Journal,582,15

However, this group was not included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, and limited postauthorization vaccine effectiveness (VE) data are available for this critical population (3). It is not known how well COVID-19 vaccines protect SNF residents, who typically are more medically frail, are older, and have more underlying medical conditions than the general population (1). In addition, immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be lower in adults aged 65-85 years than in younger adults (4). Through the CDC Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, SNF residents and staff members in Connecticut began receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020 (5). Administration of the vaccine was conducted during several on-site pharmacy clinics. In late January 2021, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH) identified two SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks among residents and staff members that occurred after each facility's first vaccination clinic. CT DPH, in partnership with CDC, performed electronic chart review in these facilities to obtain information on resident vaccination status and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Partial vaccination, defined as the period from >14 days after the first dose through 7 days after the second dose, had an estimated effectiveness of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33%-79%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) among residents within these SNFs. This is similar to estimated effectiveness for a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adults across a range of age groups in noncongregate settings (6) and suggests that to optimize vaccine impact among this population, high coverage with the complete 2-dose series should be recommended for SNF residents and staff members.","Britton, Amadea; Jacobs Slifka, Kara M; Edens, Chris; Nanduri, Srinivas Acharya; Bart, Stephen M; Shang, Nong; Harizaj, Adora; Armstrong, Jillian; Xu, Kerui; Ehrlich, Hanna Y; Soda, Elizabeth; Derado, Gordana; Verani, Jennifer R; Schrag, Stephanie J; Jernigan, John A; Leung, Vivian H; Parikh, Sunil",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,582,20

This study aimed to investigate the characterization of metastable rutin-ethanolate and its solubility and oral bioavailability. In this research, a soluble rutin/CH3CH2OH solvate (Form &#928;) was prepared by solvent crystallization. High-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatograph, and 1H-NMR showed that Form &#928; was formed by rutin and ethanol in a molar ratio of 1:1. The changes of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H-NMR spectrum and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicted hydrogen bond formation between 4'-O of rutin and -OH of ethanol. The results of morphology, solid state CP/MAS 13C-NMR, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that Form &#928; is a novel polymorph that differs from Form &#921; (rutin trihydrate). Form &#928; can be stored for a long time under sealed and dry conditions at 40°C but would gradually transform into Form &#921; under humid conditions. Although Form &#928; is a new metastable polymorph relative to Form &#921;, Form &#928; has better solubility and faster dissolution rate. Moreover, the bioavailability of Form &#928; was 2.04 times higher than that of Form &#921;.

The Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS as a diagnostic indicator for assessing suspicion of lung involvement of COVID-19 on a scale of 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). We investigated retrospectively 154 adult patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, between April and June 2020, who underwent chest CT and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients' average age was 61.3 years (range, 21-93), 101 were male, and 76 were RT-PCR positive. Using CO-RADS, four radiologists evaluated the chest CT images. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Interobserver agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) by comparing the individual reader's score to the median of the remaining three radiologists. The average sensitivity was 87.8% (range, 80.2-93.4%), specificity was 66.4% (range, 51.3-84.5%), and AUC was 0.859 (range, 0.847-0.881); there was no significant difference between the readers (p > 0.200).

AIMS: To explore the association between MAFLD and the severity of COVID-19 by meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Medline (OVID), and MedRxiv from inception to July 6, 2020. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Stata 14.0 were used for quality assessment of included studies as well as for performing a pooled analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies with 1,293 participants were included after screening. Four studies reported the prevalence of MAFLD patients with COVID-19, with a pooled prevalence of 0.31 for MAFLD (95CI 0.28, 0.35, I2â¯=â¯38.8%, Pâ¯=â¯0.179).

Metformin mainly activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver which leads to suppression of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Metformin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle as well, which increases translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane and thereby increases glucose uptake. Further, metformin suppresses glucagon signaling in the liver by suppressing adenylate cyclase which leads to suppression of gluconeogenesis. In addition, metformin reduces autophagy failure observed in pancreatic ß-cells under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, it is known that metformin alters the gut microbiome and facilitates the transport of glucose from the circulation into excrement. It is also known that metformin reduces food intake and lowers body weight by increasing circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Furthermore, much attention has been drawn to the fact that the frequency of various cancers is lower in subjects taking metformin. Metformin suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by activating AMPK in pre-neoplastic cells, which leads to suppression of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis in pre-neoplastic cells. It has been shown recently that metformin consumption potentially influences the mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). Taken together, metformin is an old drug, but multifaceted mechanisms of action of metformin have been unraveled one after another in its long history.","Kaneto, Hideaki; Kimura, Tomohiko; Obata, Atsushi; Shimoda, Masashi; Kaku, Kohei",Int. j. mol. sci.

In June 2020, the COVID-SCORE-10 study reported that the Spanish public's perception of their government's response to the pandemic was low. This study examines these perceptions in greater detail. METHODS: We employed an ordered logistic regression analysis using COVID-SCORE-10 data to examine the Spanish public's perception of ten key aspects of their government's COVID-19 control measures. These included support for daily needs, mental and general health services, communication, information and coordination, which were examined by gender, age, education level, having been affected by COVID-19, and trust in government´s success in addressing unexpected health threats. RESULTS: ´Trust in the government´ showed the greatest odds of positive perception for the ten measures studied. Odds of positive perception of communication significantly varied by gender, education level, and having been affected by COVID-19, whereas for information and coordination of disease control, odds significantly varied by gender and having been affected by COVID-19. Odds of positive perception for access to mental health services significantly varied by gender and education level. Age was not significant. CONCLUSION: Public perception of the government's pandemic response in Spain varied by socio-demographic and individual variables, particularly by reported trust in the government. Fostering public trust during health threats may improve perception of response efforts. Future efforts should tailor interventions that consider gender, education level, and whether people have been affected by COVID-19.","White, Trenton M; Cash-Gibson, Lucinda; Martin-Moreno, Jose M; Matesanz, Rafeal; Crespo, Javier; Alfonso-Sanchez, Jose L; Villapol, Sonia; El-Mohandes, Ayman; Lazarus, Jeffrey V",Eur. j. public health,582,1

AIMS: To describe end-of-life symptoms and care needs of people dying of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive admitted patients who died at a Victorian tertiary referral hospital from 1 January to 30 September directly due to COVID-19. Clinical characteristics, symptoms, and use of supportive therapies including medications and non-pharmacological interventions in the last three days of life were extracted. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 58 patients (median age 87 years IQR 81, 90) predominantly admitted from home (n = 30), who died after a median of 11 days (IQR 6, 28) in the acute medical (n = 31) or aged care (n = 27) wards of the hospital. The median Charlson Comorbidity Score was 7 (IQR 5,8). Breathlessness (n = 42), agitation (n = 36) and pain (n = 33) were the most frequent clinician-reported symptoms in the final three days of life, with most requiring opioids (n = 52), midazolam (n = 40), with dose escalation commonly being required. While oxygen therapy was commonly used (n = 47), few (n = 13) required an anti-secretory agent. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents one of the first and largest Australian report of the end of life and symptom experience of people dying of COVID-19. This information should help clinicians to anticipate palliative care needs of these patients, for example recognising that higher starting doses of opioids and sedatives may help reduce prevalence and severity of breathlessness and agitation near death.

Cohort 2, hospital workers (n = 92) who had either been (n = 40) or not (n = 52) diagnosed with proven/probable COVID-19 and were asymptomatic at the time of the sampling. Cohort 3, patients (n = 38) cared at the hospital before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of serum antibodies was done using Abbott´s SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM device. Both methods showed 98% agreement for IgG detection. No antibodies were detected in the 38 samples from hospitalized pre-COVID subjects. The diagnostic performance of IgGs detected by Abbott´s SARS-CoV-2 assay in Cohorts 1/2 was: sensitivity (60.7%/75%) and specificity (100%/84.6%). The diagnostic performance of IgM by PanbioTM COVID-19 in Cohorts 1/2 was: sensitivity (16%/17.5%) and specificity (100%/98.1%). We show that IgG detection alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of active or cured COVID-19. IgM detection has a limited diagnostic value.","Escribano, Pilar; Álvarez-Uría, Ana; Alonso, Roberto; Catalán, Pilar; Alcalá, Luis; Muñoz, Patricia; Guinea, Jesús",Sci Rep,582,30

Also, black swan risks are constantly evolving and can strike from almost anywhere, including natural disaster, cyber risk, or viruses. As more companies are outsourcing their logistics to third-party logistics (3PL), at the same time, supply chain risks and uncertainties are also shifted to 3PLs. A 3PL's supply chain network capability to assure continuity can be expressed in terms of resilience, i.e., the ability of sensing and responding to disturbances or threats. Operations research/management science (OR/MS) methods have been widely applied in supply chain management. The objective of this paper is to look into research regarding the development of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs through the utilization of OR/MS methods. After extensive literature review, a so called pro-silience framework is developed aiming at improving resilience from a 3PL perspective maintaining or increasing its competitive advantage during and after major disruptions, yet also maintain competitiveness under normal operating conditions. Additionally, the framework offers insights into topics for future research.","Gkanatsas, Evangelos; Krikke, Harold",Sustainability,582,16

METHODS: A total of 117 samples from 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 61 patients without COVID-19 were collected. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were used for qualitative and quantitative analyses of these samples to evaluate the diagnostic performance and applicability of the two methods. RESULTS: The positive detection rates of RT-qPCR and ddPCR were 93.3% and 100%, respectively. Among the 117 samples, 6 samples were tested single-gene positive by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR, and 3 samples were tested negative by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR. The viral load of samples with inconsistent results were relatively low (3.1-20.5 copies/test). There were 17 samples (37%) with a viral load below 20 copies/test among the 46 positive samples, and only 9 of them were successfully detected by RT-qPCR. A severe patient was dynamically monitored. All 6 samples from this patient were tested negative by RT-qPCR, but 4 samples were tested positive by ddPCR with a low viral load. CONCLUSION: Qualitative analysis of COVID-19 samples can meet the needs of clinical screening and diagnosis, while quantitative analysis provides more information to the research community. Although both ddPCR and RT-qPCR can provide qualitative and quantitative results, ddPCR showed higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection than RT-qPCR, and it does not rely on the standard curve to quantify viral load. Therefore, ddPCR offers greater advantages than RT-qPCR.","Dang, Yan; Liu, Ning; Tan, Chianru; Feng, Yingmei; Yuan, Xingxing; Fan, Dongdong; Peng, Yanke; Jin, Ronghua; Guo, Yong; Lou, Jinli",Clin Chim Acta,582,20

Because of high exposure, HCWs are at an increased risk of contracting the disease. AIMS: This study aims to assess the level of precautionary measures, both at home and the workplace, amongst medical doctors who were on duty during the national lockdown in Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 23 and May 1, 2020, utilising a self-administered web-based questionnaire to examine a sample of medical doctors (n = 270) working at different healthcare institutions in Jordan. Likert scale was used to code the data and generate means and percentages. RESULTS: The most practiced on-duty precautionary measures were cleaning hands with water and disinfectant for more than 20 seconds (47.4%), followed by proper hygiene before and during meals (38.9%). The most practiced off-duty measures were taking off clothes before entering the residential place (65.9%) and prohibiting visitors (58.1%). Overall, the mean work protection percentage score was 73.8% (range: 28%-100%), while the mean home safety percentage score was 71.3% (range: 25%-100%). Work protection score was positively correlated with the home safety score. Female doctors were found to be more precautious at home than males. Doctors with chronic illness(es) were found to be less precautious than their healthier counterparts. Participants who isolated themselves expressed the highest level of home safety practice. Doctors who reported to smoke were found more precautious at home and doctors who preferred to work during lockdowns were more precautious at the workplace. CONCLUSION: The level of precautionary behaviour of medical doctors in Jordan was not optimal. More attention and efforts are needed to enhance the adherence of doctors to precautionary guidance. Strengthening the role of infectious disease and infection control units within healthcare settings remains a necessity.","Ramadan, Mohannad; Hasan, Zuheir; Saleh, Tareq; Jaradat, Mahmoud; Al-Hazaimeh, Mohammad; Bani Hani, Omar; Al-Tammemi, Ala039; a, B; Shorman, Enas; Al-Mistarehi, Abdel-Hameed; Kheirallah, Khalid",Int J Clin Pract,582,16

These documents reflect a tension that stems from limited healthcare resources which are insufficient to save lives that, under normal conditions, could have been saved, or at least could have received the best possible treatment. First, we analyse the healthcare systems of these two countries before the spread of the virus, both of which have seen decreases in the number of intensive care beds and have been marked by financial cuts during the last ten years. It is a fact that a greater number of people, especially those over 70 years of age, have been left without respiratory support treatment, and therefore, there have been a greater number of deaths. It is also a fact that there has been a higher infection rate among healthcare professionals due to the delay in the management of protective measures and the inability to provide adequate care for those in nursing homes, as recognised by WHO. In the context of this health emergency, healthcare professionals have suffered a real 'moral distress' because, knowing first-hand the causes of the limitation of resources, they have had to put triage protocols into practice. Finally, we set forth a series of concrete ethical proposals with which to face the successive waves of COVID-19 infection, as well as other future pandemics.","Faggioni, Maurizio P; González-Melado, Fermín Jesús; Di Pietro, Maria Luisa",J. med. ethics,582,6

They act as negative regulators of protein synthesis through binding to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the complementary target mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation or inhibition. The databases of Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for literature regarding the importance of miRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, pathogenesis, and genomic mutations.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (ß = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.","Gupta, Manoj Kumar; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Goel, Akhil Dhanesh; Saurabh, Suman; Misra, Sanjeev",J Infect Dev Ctries,582,2

Wuhan city (where 23.4% of participants resided), Hubei province outside Wuhan (13.4% of participants), and elsewhere in China (63.1% of participants) were categorized into high, moderate, and low infection severity areas, respectively. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale's severity cut-points were used to categorize participants. In the overall sample, 20.9, 34.2, and 29.0% of the participants showed elevated (mild to extremely severe) levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Those in the highest infection severity group were significantly more likely to be categorized as having elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. General linear modeling was performed on a composite mental distress variable (taking into account stress, anxiety, and depression scores). This model indicated that, even after adjusting for group differences in age, gender, education, and filial piety, the high infection severity group displayed more mental distress than the low infection severity groups. The model also found reciprocal filial piety to have a negative association with mental distress. Conversely, authoritarian filial piety was found to be unrelated to mental distress when controlling for the other variables in the model. No evidence was found for an interaction between either authoritarian or reciprocal filial piety and infection severity, which suggests that the negative association observed between reciprocal filial piety and mental distress was relatively consistent across the three infection severity groups. The findings suggest that future public health programs may integrate the promotion of filial piety as a strategy to help Chinese people maintain good mental health in the face of pandemic crises.","Li, W.

Currently there are no approved drugs and vaccines available for the prevention of COVID-19 infection, although couples of immunizations are being tested in clinical trials. However, the present efforts are focused on computational vaccination technique for evaluating candidates to design multi-epitope-based vaccine against pathogenic mechanism of novel SARS-COV-2. Based on recent published evidence, we recognized spike glycoprotein and envelope small membrane protein are the potential targets to combat the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, in the present study we identified epitope of both B and T cell associated with these proteins. Extremely antigenic, conserve, immunogenic and nontoxic epitope of B and T cell of Spike protein are WPWYVWLGFI, SRVKNLNSSEGVPDLLV whereas the CWCARPTCIK and YCCNIVNVSL are associated with envelope small membrane protein were selected as potential candidate for vaccine designing. These epitopes show virtuous interaction with HLAA0201 during molecular docking analysis. Under simulation protocol the predicted vaccine candidates show stability. Collectively, this work provides novel potential candidates for epitope-based vaccine designing against COVID-19 infection.","Bashir, Z.; Ahmad, S. U.; Kiani, B.

These various types of cells have several important functions; thus, communication between these cells plays an important role in homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of diseases in the lungs. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology of lung diseases, researchers have isolated each type of lung cell to investigate the changes in their gene expressions, including their humoral factor or adhesion molecules, to reveal the intercellular communication among these cells. In particular, investigations during the past decade have focused on extracellular vesicles, which are lipid bilayer delimited vesicles released from a cell that can move among various cells and transfer substances, including microRNAs, mRNAs and proteins, thus, functioning as intercellular messengers. Extracellular vesicles can be classified into three general groups: apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microparticles. Extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes and microparticles, are attracting increasing attention from pulmonologists as tools for understanding pathogenesis and disease diagnosis. Here, we review studies, including our own, on exosomes and microparticles and their roles in both lung homeostasis and the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This review also addresses the roles of extracellular vesicles in COVID-19, the current global public health crisis.","Yamada, Mitsuhiro",Respir Investig,582,29

We evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 infection and lockdown on mental and physical health in PWS. At the end of April, 85 adults with PWS completed a self-administered questionnaire, including lockdown conditions, physical activity (PA), ED, and medical and behavioral outcomes. Body weight was measured at home and self-reported. RESULTS: Patients (52.9% women, 44.8% disomic) were assessed, with a mean age of 28.05 ± 8.73 years and body mass index (BMI) of 36.76 ± 10.74 kg/m2. Seventy percent lived in the Paris region (France) and were confined with their parents. The mean weight change was 0.96 ± 3.28 kg. We compared patients showing weight loss (n = 39, - 3.30 ± 2.93 kg) to patients showing weight gain (n = 22, + 2.35 ± 1.54 kg): the BMI was lower (34.60 ± 9.18 versus 40.45 ± 9.45 kg/m2, p = 0.02), PA increased (25.6% versus 4.5%, p = 0.04), and EDs improved (51.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.005). Behavioral disorders increased for 12.9% of the cohort. Three individuals (3.5%) were diagnosed with non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with positive effects for most French adults with PWS, with weight loss probably associated with a more favourable environment during this period.

METHODS: Chest CT images of patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive COVID-19 were categorized according to the CORADS and RSNA classifications by radiologists with different levels of experience and who were initially unaware of the RT-PCR results. The inter- and intra-observer concordances for each of the classifications were calculated, as were the concordances between classifications. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in this study. The RSNA classification showed an almost perfect inter-observer agreement between reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.995). CORADS showed substantial agreement among reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.642 (95% CI, 0.491-0.793). There was inter-observer variation when comparing less experienced reviewers with more experienced reviewers, with the highest kappa coefficient of 0.396 (95% CI, 0.255-0.588). There was a significant correlation between both classifications, with a Kendall coefficient of 0.899 (p&lt;0.001) and substantial intra-observer agreement for both classifications. CONCLUSION: The RSNA and CORADS classifications showed excellent inter-observer agreement for reviewers with the same level of experience, although the agreement between less experience reviewers and the reviewer with the most experience was only reasonable.

Since COVID-19 testing is now available, some have raised the question of whether we should be routinely testing asymptomatic healthcare workers. OBJECTIVE: To provide a quantitative analysis of the predicted impact that regular COVID-19 testing of healthcare workers may have on COVID-19 infection prevention in emergency department patients and staff. METHODS: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 infections and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we generated a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic members of the emergency department staff in regions affected by COVID-19 infection. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and we created a Markov model according to average COVID-19 incubation time. RESULTS: Our model predicts that after 180 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections per person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of healthcare workers (HCW) would reduce new HCW and patient infections by 3~5.9% and bi-weekly testing would reduce both by 1~2.1%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections per person2, weekly testing would reduce infections by 11~23% and bi-weekly testing would reduce infections by 5.5~13%. For a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections per person2, weekly and biweekly HCW testing would result in a 1% and 0.5~0.8% reduction in infections respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily-affected by COVID-19 and/or facing resource constraints may reduce COVID-19 transmission significantly among healthcare workers and previously-uninfected patients.","Zhang, Yuemei; Cheng, Sheng-Ru",,582,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2020 in three hospitals in China. The Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) was used to investigate the PTG of frontline nurses. Data on related factors, including demographic characteristics and subjective variables, were collected. The Event-Related Rumination Inventory was used to assess rumination. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation was calculated for bivariate analysis. Independent sample t-tests or one-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression analysis were used to examine the related factors. RESULTS: A total of 179 frontline nurses were recruited, and 167 were included in the analyses. The mean PTG score was 70.53±17.26. The bivariate analyses showed that deliberate rumination was modestly positively correlated with PTG (r=0.557, p<0.01), while intrusive rumination had a modest negative correlation with PTG (r=-0.413, p<0.01). Multiple linear regression demonstrated that working years, self-confidence in frontline work, awareness of risk, psychological intervention or training during the epidemic and deliberate rumination were the main influencing factors of PTG among frontline nurses and accounted for 42.5% of the variance (F=31.626, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The PTG of frontline nurses was at a medium to high level and was influenced by working years, self-confidence in frontline work, awareness of risk, psychological intervention or training and deliberate rumination. It is necessary to strengthen psychological guidance and training for frontline nurses and promote their deliberate rumination on epidemic events to improve their PTG.","Cui, Pan Pan; Wang, Pan Pan; Wang, Kun; Ping, Zhiguang; Wang, Peng; Chen, Changying",Occup. environ. med,582,24

The effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity has been little studied. In this study, we tried to determine the frequency of allergic diseases in COVID-19 patients and the effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Patients were contacted by phone and those who approved to participate in the study were questionned about their sociodemographic characteristics, body-mass index, smoking history, and about their atopic status. Rate of atopic diseases among mild and severe COVID-19 patients and risk estimates for mild disease in atopic and non-atopic COVID-19 patients were calculated. RESULTS: Study population consisted of 235 adults with COVID-19 (mean age, 45.3 years [standard deviation, 15.0 years]; 139 (59.1%) male). Among study population 16 (6.8%) subjects had one of the three atopic symptoms which were wheezing, rhinitis or eczema. Among the subjects with atopic status 4 (1.7%) subjects had wheezing, 8 (3.4%) had rhinitis and 4 (1.7%) had eczema within the last 12 months. Although atopic status is associated with 3.1 times higher odds for mild disease, being atopic or not being atopic was not found to be associated with COVID-19 severity (p=.054).

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 lineage was first identified in South Africa (2) and might be neutralized less effectively by antibodies produced after vaccination or natural infection with other strains (3-6). To limit SARS-CoV-2 chains of transmission associated with this index patient, MDH used contact tracing to identify the source of infection and any linked infections among other persons. The investigation identified two linked clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection that included 17 patients. Three additional specimens from these clusters were sequenced; all three had the B.1.351 variant and all sequences were closely related to the sequence from the index patient's specimen. Among the 17 patients identified, none reported recent international travel or contact with international travelers. Two patients, including the index patient, had received the first of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination series in the 2 weeks before their likely exposure; one additional patient had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 5 months before exposure. Two patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, and one died. These first identified linked clusters of B.1.351 infections in the United States with no apparent link to international travel highlight the importance of expanding the scope and volume of genetic surveillance programs to identify variants, completing contact investigations for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and using universal prevention strategies, including vaccination, masking, and physical distancing, to control the spread of variants of concern.","Feder, Kenneth A; Pearlowitz, Marcia; Goode, Alexandra; Duwell, Monique; Williams, Thelonious W; Chen-Carrington, Ping An; Patel, Ami; Dominguez, Catherine; Keller, Eric N; Klein, Liore; Rivera-Colon, Alessandra; Mostafa, Heba H; Morris, C Paul; Patel, Neil; Schauer, Anna M; Myers, Robert; Blythe, David; Feldman, Katherine A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,582,10

Although numerous efforts have been made to unravel the mechanisms underlying the coronavirus, a notable gap remains in our perception of the COVID-19 pathogenesis. The innate and adaptive immune systems have a pivotal role in the fate of viral infections, such as COVID-19 pandemic. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known as short noncoding RNA molecules and appear as indispensable governors of almost any cellular means. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that miRNAs participate in essential mechanisms of cell biology, regulation of the immune system, and the onset and progression of numerous types of disorders. The immune responses to viral respiratory infections (VRIs), including influenza virus (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus (RV), are correlated with the ectopic expression of miRNAs. Alterations of the miRNA expression in epithelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic and acute airway infections. Hence, analyzing the role of these types of nucleotides in antiviral immune responses and the characterization of miRNA target genes might contribute to understanding the mechanisms of the interplay between the host and viruses, and in the future, potentially result in discovering therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of acute COVID-19 infection. In this article, we present a general review of current studies concerning the function of miRNAs in different VRIs, particularly in coronavirus infection, and address all available therapeutic prospects to mitigate the burden of viral infections.","Mirzaei, Rasoul; Mahdavi, Farzad; Badrzadeh, Fariba; Hosseini-Fard, Seyed Reza; Heidary, Maryam; Jeda, Ali Salimi; Mohammadi, Tayeb; Roshani, Mahdane; Yousefimashouf, Rasoul; Keyvani, Hossein; Darvishmotevalli, Mohammad; Sani, Melika Zarei; Karampoor, Sajad",Int Immunopharmacol,582,1

This technique has been utilized for the sequencing of the VSIV genome, but our study is the first for the application of this technique for the profiling of the VSIV transcriptome. Since LRS is able to sequence full-length RNA molecules, it thereby provides more accurate annotation of the transcriptomes than the traditional short-read sequencing methods. The objectives of this study were to assemble the complete transcriptome of using nanopore sequencing, to ascertain cell-type specificity and dynamics of viral gene expression, and to evaluate host gene expression changes induced by the viral infection. We carried out a time-course analysis of VSIV gene expression in human glioblastoma and primate fibroblast cell lines using a nanopore-based LRS approach and applied both amplified and direct cDNA sequencing (as well as cap-selection) for a fraction of samples. Our investigations revealed that, although the VSIV genome is simple, it generates a relatively complex transcriptomic architecture. In this study, we also demonstrated that VSIV transcripts vary in structure and exhibit differential gene expression patterns in the two examined cell types.","Kakuk, Balázs; Kiss, András Attila; Torma, Gábor; Csabai, Zsolt; Prazsák, István; Mizik, Máté; Megyeri, Klára; Tombácz, Dóra; Boldogkői, Zsolt",Pathogens,582,20

The recent COVID-19 global pandemic has made wildlife consumption an issue that concerns everyone around the world. Formerly obscure practices like wet markets and commodities like pangolin scales or bear bile have gained international notoriety. Along with that attention has come increasing politicization and ideological polarization. Beyond the global fight against the pandemic, there has been another global struggle over the meaning and origin of the disease, as evidenced by the spread of terms like “Wuhan Flu” and “bat soup.” What has become obscured by the news cycle struggling to keep up with the rapid spread of the virus and the political sound and fury surrounding it is any meaningful understanding of China’s wildlife consumption and trade.

METHODS: A narrative review was conducted through a search in MEDLINE, Lilacs, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and international medical societies publications. RESULTS: Breast cancer: in high-risk patients (confirmed familial cancer syndrome or with high-risk tools scores), clinicians should act according to usual recommendations; in average-risk individuals, consider screening with mammography with a longer time span (maximum of two years). Cervical cancer: women turning 25 years old who have already been immunized and with no previous Pap test can have the test postponed during the pandemic; if there is no previous dose of Human Papillomavirus vaccination, initiation of screening should be recommended following a more rigid approach for COVID prevention; in women over 30 years of age who have never participated in cervical screening, the first screening exam is also essential. Colorectal cancer: if the individual is at elevated risk for familial cancer, the screening with colonoscopy according to usual recommendations should be supported; if at average risk consider screening with Fecal Occult Blood Test. Prostate cancer: there is a trend to postpone routine prostate cancer screening until the pandemic subsides.

AIMS: To observe the effect of combination treatment of giammonium glycyrrhizinate and vitamin C （DV）on the prognoses of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective observational study recruited 207 COVID-19 patients from Tongji Hospital, patients were assigned to DV and non-DV groups on the basis of the DV treatment. To make the results more credible, a propensity-score matching (PSM) approach was adopted at a 1:3 ratio to determine the participants. Logistic analysis was used to assess the effect of DV therapy in the progress of COVID-19. RESULTS: In the DV group, the new onset incidence rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after admission was clearly lower than that in the non-DV group (DV vs non-DV groups, 15.2% vs 35.7%; P = 0.002). Compared with the non-DV group, the DV group showed fewer new onset of complications (such as ARDS, acute liver injury and acute myocardial injury) (DV vs non-DV groups , 19.6% vs 46.1%; P = 0.000).

The study aims to assess the changes in intercity railway passenger transport on the early spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Examining the role of railway transport properties in disease transmission could help quantify the spatial spillover effects of large-scale travel restriction interventions. This study used daily high-speed railway schedule data to compare the differences in city-level network properties (destination arrival and transfer service) before and after the Wuhan city lockdown in the early stages of the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Bayesian multivariate regression was used to examine the association between structural changes in the railway origin-destination network and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the provinces with rising transfer activities after the Wuhan city lockdown had more confirmed COVID-19 cases, but changes in destination arrival did not have significant effects. The regions with increasing transfer activities were located in provinces neighboring Hubei in the widthwise and longitudinal directions. These results indicate that transfer activities enhance interpersonal transmission probability and could be a crucial risk factor for increasing epidemic severity after the Wuhan city lockdown. The destinations of railway passengers might not be affected by the Wuhan city lockdown, but their itinerary routes could be changed due to the replacement of an important transfer hub (Wuhan city) in the Chinese railway transportation network. As a result, transfer services in the high-speed rail network could explain why the provinces surrounded by Hubei had a higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than other provinces.","Chan, Chun-Hsiang; Wen, Tzai-Hung",Int J Environ Res Public Health,582,1

Under such circumstance, young people in Hong Kong may develop a negative FO. Scant research has directly examined the relationship between perceived social hardship and FO as well as the underlying mechanism among Hong Kong young people. In this study, we tested the idea that young people’s perceived social hardship would be negatively related to FO via belief in a just world, a well-known foundation for individuals to think, feel, and plan their future.

With an optimized cutoff for allelic imbalance, all 94 identity-informative SNP loci could be genotyped reliably using the MinION device, with an overall accuracy of 99.958% (1 error among 2926 genotypes). STR typing was notably error prone, and its accuracy was locus dependent. We developed a custom-made bioinformatics workflow, and finally selected 13 autosomal STRs, 14 Y-STRs, and 4 X-STRs showing high consistency between nanopore and Illumina sequencing among the tested samples. These SNP and STR loci could be candidates for panel design for forensic analysis based on nanopore sequencing.

Recently, COVID‐19 has become a pandemic by infecting more than 152 million people in over 216 countries and territories. The exponential increase in the number of infections has rendered traditional diagnosis techniques inefficient. Therefore, many researchers have developed several intelligent techniques, such as deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), which can assist the healthcare sector in providing quick and precise COVID‐19 diagnosis. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the most recent DL and ML techniques for COVID‐19 diagnosis. The studies are published from December 2019 until April 2021. In general, this paper includes more than 200 studies that have been carefully selected from several publishers, such as IEEE, Springer and Elsevier. We classify the research tracks into two categories: DL and ML and present COVID‐19 public datasets established and extracted from different countries. The measures used to evaluate diagnosis methods are comparatively analysed and proper discussion is provided. In conclusion, for COVID‐19 diagnosing and outbreak prediction, SVM is the most widely used machine learning mechanism, and CNN is the most widely used deep learning mechanism. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are the most widely used measurements in previous studies. Finally, this review paper will guide the research community on the upcoming development of machine learning for COVID‐19 and inspire their works for future development. This review paper will guide the research community on the upcoming development of ML and DL for COVID‐19 and inspire their works for future development.","Alyasseri, Zaid Abdi Alkareem; Al‐Betar, Mohammed Azmi; Doush, Iyad Abu; Awadallah, Mohammed A.; Abasi, Ammar Kamal; Makhadmeh, Sharif Naser; Alomari, Osama Ahmad; Abdulkareem, Karrar Hameed; Adam, Afzan; Damasevicius, Robertas; Mohammed, Mazin Abed; Zitar, Raed Abu",Expert Syst,582,20

In infancy, wheezing illnesses are usually viral in origin, and children with more severe wheezing episodes are more likely to develop recurrent episodes of asthma and to develop asthma later in childhood. Children who develop allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (allergic sensitization), and those who wheeze with rhinoviruses (HRV) are at especially high risk for asthma. In older children and adults, HRV infections generally cause relatively mild respiratory illnesses and yet contribute to acute and potentially severe exacerbations in patients with asthma. These findings underline the importance of understanding the synergistic nature of allergic sensitization and infections with HRV in infants relative to the onset of asthma and in children and adults with respect to exacerbations of asthma. This review discusses clinical and experimental evidence of virus/allergen interactions and evaluates theories which relate immunologic responses to respiratory viruses and allergens to the pathogenesis and disease activity of asthma. Greater understanding of the relationship between viral respiratory infections, allergic inflammation, and asthma is likely to suggest new strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma.","Gavala, Monica; Bertics, Paul J.; Gern, James E.",Immunological Reviews,582,1

To this end, the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the viral Spike (S) protein to human ACE2, has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target. Here we use murine leukemia viruses pseudotyped with Spike from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated coronavirus entry can be mitigated by heparin, a heparan sulfate-related glycan, or by genetic ablation of biosynthetic enzymes for the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A drug repurposing screen targeting HSPG-dependent endocytosis identifies pharmacologically active endocytosis inhibitors that also abrogate coronavirus cell entry. Among them, Mitoxantrone (EC(50)=~10 nM) targets HSPGs directly, whereas Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to impair HSPG-assisted viral entry. Gene expression profiling suggests potential combination regimens that optimally target HSPG-dependent viral entry. Altogether, our study establishes HSPGs as an assisting factor for ACE2 in endocytosis-mediated coronavirus entry and identifies drugs that can be repurposed to target this important stage in the viral life cycle.","Zhang, Qi; Chen, Catherine Z.; Swaroop, Manju; Xu, Miao; Wang, Lihui; Lee, Juhyung; Pradhan, Manisha; Shen, Min; Luo, Zhiji; Xu, Yue; Huang, Wenwei; Zheng, Wei; Ye, Yihong",bioRxiv,582,1

In the light of the very promising voluntary mass vaccination, which will start in January 2021, it is of utmost importance for the country to plan to complement vaccination with mid-term Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). The objective is to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until February 15th, 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from February 15th, 2021 to June 30th, 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed in the first phase: (a) a baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs on January 2021, (b) a 'semi-lockdown' scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing and social distancing/teleworking on January 2021 and (c) a 'rolling lockdown' scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third imposed nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some preliminary first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the 'semi-lockdown' scenario outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities), whereas in the second phase it is of great importance to ensure a sufficient vaccine supply and high vaccination rates.","Rachaniotis, N.

This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population. In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R(0)) – this also enables us to estimate the initial daily transmission rate (β(0)). We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on COVID-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 2.29. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from 13 April till 7 May 2020. The R(0) is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37–2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below 1. Also, the estimated fraction of reported symptomatic cases is between 10 and 50%. Our analysis has shown evidence that the existing control measures are not enough to end the epidemic and more stringent measures are needed.","Adekunle, A I; Adegboye, O A; Gayawan, E; McBryde, E S",Epidemiology and infection,582,21

Cancer and its treatment affect many haematological and biochemical parameters, therefore we analysed these prior to and during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and correlated them with outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with cancer testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in centres throughout the United Kingdom were identified and entered into a database following local governance approval. Clinical and longitudinal laboratory data were extracted from patient records. Data were analysed using Mann–Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, logistic regression, or linear regression for outcomes. Hierarchical clustering of heatmaps was performed using Ward's method. RESULTS: In total, 302 patients were included in three cohorts: Manchester (n = 67), Liverpool (n = 62), and UK (n = 173). In the entire cohort (N = 302), median age was 69 (range 19-93 years), including 163 males and 139 females; of these, 216 were diagnosed with a solid tumour and 86 with a haematological cancer. Preinfection lymphopaenia, neutropaenia and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were not associated with oxygen requirement (O(2)) or death. Lymphocyte count (P < 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.03), LDH (P < 0.0001) and albumin (P < 0.0001) significantly changed from preinfection to during infection. High rather than low neutrophils at day 0 (P = 0.007), higher maximal neutrophils during COVID-19 (P = 0.026) and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; P = 0.01) were associated with death. In multivariable analysis, age (P = 0.002), haematological cancer (P = 0.034), C-reactive protein (P = 0.004), NLR (P = 0.036) and albumin (P = 0.02) at day 0 were significant predictors of death. In the Manchester/Liverpool cohort 30 patients have restarted therapy following COVID-19, with no additional complications requiring readmission. CONCLUSION: Preinfection biochemical/haematological parameters were not associated with worse outcome in cancer patients. Restarting treatment following COVID-19 was not associated with additional complications. Neutropaenia due to cancer/treatment is not associated with COVID-19 mortality. Cancer therapy, particularly in patients with solid tumours, need not be delayed or omitted due to concerns that treatment itself increases COVID-19 severity.","Lee, R.J.; Wysocki, O.; Bhogal, T.; Shotton, R.; Tivey, A.; Angelakas, A.; Aung, T.; Banfill, K.; Baxter, M.; Boyce, H.; Brearton, G.; Copson, E.; Dickens, E.; Eastlake, L.; Gomes, F.; Hague, C.; Harrison, M.; Horsley, L.; Huddar, P.; Hudson, Z.; Khan, S.; Khan, U.T.; Maynard, A.; McKenzie, H.; Palmer, D.; Robinson, T.; Rowe, M.; Thomas, A.; Tweedy, J.; Sheehan, R.; Stockdale, A.; Weaver, J.; Williams, S.; Wilson, C.; Zhou, C.; Dive, C.; Cooksley, T.; Palmieri, C.; Freitas, A.; Armstrong, A.C.",ESMO Open,582,21

The secondary objective was to develop recommendations and identify the risk factors associated with presenting potential interactions with LPV/r. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional and multicenter study with the participation of 2 hospitals. COVID 19 patients over 18 years of age, admitted to hospital and under treatment with LPV/r were included. A screening of potential interactions related to LPV/r and home and hospital medication was carried out. Lexicomp® (Uptodate), HIV-drug interactions and COVID-drug interactions were used as the query database. RESULTS: 361 patients with a mean age of 62.77 ± 14.64 years were included, where 59.6% (n = 215) were men. 62.3% (n = 225) had 1 or more potential interactions and 26, 87% (n = 97) 2 or more. The independent variables associated with presenting ≥1 potential interactions were age (> 65) (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.06-3.59, P = 0.033), ICU admission (OR 9.22; CI 95% 1.98-42.93; P = 0.005), previous respiratory pathology (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.15-7.36; P = 0.024), psychiatric (OR 4.14; 95 CI % 1.36-12.61; P = 0.013), dyslipidemia (OR 3.21; 95% CI 1.63-6.35; P = 0.001) and the number of drugs prescribed (OR 4.33; 95% CI 2.40-7.81; P = 0.000).

Acute cholecystitis is a serious condition that accounts for a considerable percentage of general surgical acute admissions. Therefore, the Royal College of Surgeons' Commissioning guidance' recommended urgent admission to secondary care and early cholecystectomy. During the first wave of hospital admissions associated with COVID-19, most guidelines recommended conservative treatment in order to limit the admission rates and free up spaces for COVID-19-infected patients. However, reviews of this approach have not been widely done to assess the results and, in turn, planning our future management approach when future pressures on in-patient admissions are inevitable. METHODS Our study included all acute cholecystitis patients who needed surgical intervention in one Centre in the UK over three distinct periods (pre-COVID-19, during the first lockdown, and lockdown ease). Comparison between these groups were done regarding intraoperative and postoperative results. RESULTS The conservative management led to a high rate of readmission. Moreover, delayed cholecystectomy was associated with increased operative difficulties such as extensive adhesions, intraoperative blood loss, and/or complicated gall bladder pathologies such as perforated or gangrenous gall bladder (29.9%, 16.7%, and 24.8%, respectively). The resulting postoperative complications of surgical and nonsurgical resulted in a longer hospital stay (13.5 d). CONCLUSION The crisis approach for acute cholecystitis management failed to deliver the hoped outcome. Instead, it backfired and did the exact opposite, leading to longer hospital stays and extra burden to the patient and the healthcare system.","Fouad, Mina M B; Rezk, Samuel S S; Saber, Arsany T; Khalifa, Ahmed; Ibraheim, Peter; Ibraheim, Sandy M N",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,582,30

South America is among the last regions hit by COVID-19 pandemic. In Uruguay, first cases were detected on March 13 th 2020 presumably imported by travelers returning from Europe. Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Results Our phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain. Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20th. Identification of specific mutations showed rapid local genetic differentiation. Conclusions We evidenced early independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 that likely occurred before first cases were detected. Our analysis set the bases for future genomic epidemiology studies to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay and the Latin America and the Caribbean region.","Salazar, Cecilia; Díaz-Viraqué, Florencia; Pereira-Gómez, Marianoel; Ferrés, Ignacio; Moreno, Pilar; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Iraola, Gregorio",bioRxiv,582,26

One component of this selectivity is the MHV packaging signal (PS), an RNA structure found only in genomic RNA and not in subgenomic RNAs. It was previously shown that a major determinant of PS recognition is the second of the two RNA-binding domains of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. We have now found that PS recognition additionally depends upon a segment of the carboxy-terminal tail (domain N3) of the N protein. Since domain N3 is also the region of N protein that interacts with the membrane (M) protein, this finding suggests a mechanism by which selective genome packaging is accomplished, through the coupling of genome encapsidation to virion assembly.","Kuo, Lili; Koetzner, Cheri A.; Masters, Paul S.",Virology,582,3

Methods: From June 15th-July 1st 2020, SGO members received a web-based survey consisting of the following validated measures: Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI); Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2 screener and PHQ-7); Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 screener and PHQ-9) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-6). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with professional fulfillment, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Results: Among the 254 SGO member respondents (approximately 12%), 58% (147) were ≤45 years, 73% (183) identified as female, and 76% (192) were gynecologic, medical, or radiation oncologists. COVID-19 institutional burden was reported as high/very high (23%, 59), moderate (44%, 110), or low (31%79). Most respondents provided direct patient care (96%, 242), including 22% (52) reported caring for COVID-19 patients. Personal history of COVID-19 infection was reported in 16% (41) of repondents. Among 232 PFI respondents, 58% (134) and 41% (95), respectively, met cutoff values for decreased professional fulfillment and burnout. Of those who completed the GAD (246) and PHQ (251) ultrascreeners, 25% (62) and 17% (42) screened positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Among these, 41% (21/51) and 27% (10/37) reported potentially clinically significant anxiety and depression, while 18% (9/51) and 32% (12/37) of participant scores correlated with potentially severe depression. A total of 37% (97) reported significant trauma-related stress based on IES-6 scores predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After multivariate adjustment, decreased professional fulfillment and burnout were significantly associated with screening positive for depression (p=0.005, p=<0.001) and anxiety (p=<0.0001, p=<0.001). Positive depression screening was significantly associated with male gender (p=.027), while positive anxiety screening was associated with female gender (p=0.007). Nurses, physician assistants and other non-physician health care professionals were more likely to screen positive for depression in comparison to physician oncologists (p=.022). When adjusted by demographic variables such as age, race, gender, burden of COVID infection, caring for COVID-19 patients, profession, history of anxiety or depression), no association was found with respect to levels of professional fulfillment or burnout. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that the majority of SGO members are not professionally fulfilled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents data that differs from pre-COVID era findings, and indicates a significant impact on professional well-being. Though we observed no association between burden of COVID-19 infection or caring for COVID-19 patients with anxiety, depression, professional fulfillment, or burnout, respondents scores indicated moderate to severe anxiety and depression, and over one-third met IES-6 criteria shown to be correlative to the diagnosis of PTSD. The longevity of these effects is of particular concern. The next phase of our study will re-survey SGO members during the second wave of the pandemic. Findings from this work can target interventions to improve SGO member well-being during current and future threats to psychological resilience.","Carr, Caitlin; Layne, Tracy; Zeligs, Kristen; Qin, Lei; Flatow, Virginia; Kaplowitz, Elianna; Tomita, Shannon; Papatla, Katya; Kolev, Valentin; Hayes, Monica Prasad; Blank, Stephanie",Gynecologic Oncology,582,17

The relationships between pain and physical activity (PA) and exercise capacity are poorly understood. METHODS: This retrospective secondary analysis includes three cohorts of Veterans with COPD who participated in longitudinal studies evaluating PA and exercise capacity with objective measures of daily step counts and 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance, respectively. Pain was assessed using the bodily pain domain of the Veterans RAND-36. In two cohorts, participants were randomly assigned to a web-based, pedometer-mediated PA intervention which has previously been demonstrated to improve PA. RESULTS: Three-hundred and seventy-three (373) unique study participants were included in this analysis. Eighty-three percent (n = 311) of the population reported at least mild pain and/or at least a little bit of interference due to pain at baseline. Cross-sectionally, greater bodily pain was associated with lower 6MWT distance (β = 0.51; 95% CI 0.20, 0.82; p = 0.0013). Longitudinally, worsening bodily pain was associated with a decline in 6MWT distance (β = 0.30; 95% CI 0.03, 0.58; p = 0.0312). There was no association between baseline bodily pain and baseline daily step counts, baseline bodily pain and change in PA, or change in bodily pain and change in PA. Compared to usual care, our PA intervention improved bodily pain scores (β = 6.17; 95% CI 1.84, 10.45; p = 0.0054). Bodily pain scores did not affect the impact of the intervention on daily step counts. CONCLUSION: Pain is highly prevalent and significantly associated with lower exercise capacity among Veterans with COPD. Worsening pain co-occurred with decline in exercise capacity but not PA. Our intervention reduced pain, although pain did not affect the impact of the intervention on PA.","Raphaely, Rebecca A.; Mongiardo, Maria A.; Goldstein, Rebekah L.; Robinson, Stephanie A.; Wan, Emily S.; Moy, Marilyn L.",BMC Pulm Med,582,20

DESIGN: This study used panel data of the Indonesian Family Life Survey conducted in 2007 (Wave 4) and 2014 (Wave 5). SETTING: The original sampling frame was based on 13 out of 27 provinces in 1993, representing 83% of the Indonesian population. PARTICIPANTS: We included respondents aged 50 years and above in 2007, excluding those who did not participate in both Waves 4 and 5. The total number of participants in this study are 3678 respondents. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined three main outcomes; health service use (outpatient and inpatient care), financial burden (catastrophic health expenditure) and productivity loss (labour participation, days primary activity missed, days confined in bed). We applied multilevel mixed-effects regression models to assess the associations between NCD multimorbidity and outcome variables, RESULTS: Women were more likely to have NCD multimorbidity than men and the prevalence of NCD multimorbidity increased with higher socioeconomic status. NCD multimorbidity was associated with a higher number of outpatient visits (compared with those without NCD, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 4.25, 95% CI 3.33 to 5.42 for individuals with >3 NCDs) and inpatient visits (IRR 3.68, 95% CI 2.21 to 6.12 for individuals with >3 NCDs). NCD multimorbidity was also associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing catastrophic health expenditure (for >3 NCDs, adjusted OR (aOR) 1.69, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.81) and lower participation in the labour force (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33) compared with no NCD. CONCLUSIONS: NCD multimorbidity is associated with substantial direct and indirect costs to individuals, households and the wider society. Our study highlights the importance of preparing health systems for addressing the burden of multimorbidity in low-income and middle-income countries.","Marthias, Tiara; Anindya, Kanya; Ng, Nawi; McPake, Barbara; Atun, Rifat; Arfyanto, Hafiz; Hulse, Emily SG; Zhao, Yang; Jusril, Hafizah; Pan, Tianxin; Ishida, Marie; Lee, John Tayu",BMJ Open,582,1

One of such drugs is rimantadine. However, most of the circulating strains of influenza A viruses are resistant to this drug. Thus, a search for analogs effective against rimantadine-resistant viruses is of the utmost importance. Here, we examined the efficiency of two adamantane azaheterocyclic rimantadine derivatives on a mouse model of pneumonia caused by the rimantadine-resistant influenza A virus /California/ 04/2009 (H1N1). BALB/c mice inoculated with the virus were treated with two doses (15 mg and 20 mg/kg a day) of tested analogs via oral administration for 5 days starting 4 hours before the infection. The efficacy was assessed by survival rate, mean day to death, weight loss, and viral titer in the lungs. Oral treatment with both compounds in both doses protected 60–100% of the animals, significantly increased the survival rate, and abolished weight loss. The treatments also inhibited virus titer in the lungs in comparison to the control group. This treatment was more effective compared to rimantadine at the same scheme and dosage. Moreover, the study of the sensitivity of the virus isolated from the lungs of the treated mice and grown in MDCK cells showed that no resistance had emerged during the 5 days of treatment with both compounds.","Glubokova, E.

This study included 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Neurological manifestations were evaluated by well-trained neurologists, psychologists, psychiatric presentations and biochemical changes were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and electronic medical records. Eighteen (23.4%) patients presented with neurological symptoms. Patients with neurological presentations had higher urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and lower basophil counts. Among them, patients with muscle involvement had higher urea nitrogen and cystatin C levels but lower basophil counts. In addition, patients with psychiatric presentations were older and had higher interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and higher alkaline phosphatase, R-glutamate transferase, and urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, patients with anxiety had higher IL-6 and IL-10 levels than those without, and patients with moderate depression had higher CD8 + T cell counts and lower CD4 + /CD8 + ratios than other patients. This study indicates that the central nervous system may be influenced in patients with COVID-19, and the pathological mechanisms may be related to direct virus invasion of the central nervous system, infection-mediated overreaction of the immune system, and aberrant serum pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, basophils and cystatin C may also play important roles during these pathological processes. Our findings suggest that neurological and psychiatric presentations should be evaluated and managed in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","He, Xudong; Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Lei; Zheng, Xu; Zhang, Ge; Pan, Konghan; Yu, Hong; Zhang, Lisan; Hu, Xingyue",Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,582,21

METHODS: About 81,000 COVID-19 confirmed case data, Baidu migration index data, air pollutants, meteorological data, and government response strictness index data were collected from 31 provincial-level regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) and 337 prefecture-level cities. The spatio-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 were explored using spatial autocorrelation, hot spot, and spatio-temporal scanning statistics. At the same time, Spearman rank correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore the relationship between influencing factors and confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The distribution of COVID-19 in China tends to be stable over time, with spatial correlation and obvious clustering regions. spatio-temporal scanning analysis showed that most COVID-19 high incidence months were from January to March at the beginning of the epidemic, and the area with the highest aggregation risk was Hubei Province (RR = 491.57), which was 491.57 times the aggregation risk of other regions. Among the meteorological variables, the daily average temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and new COVID-19 cases were negatively correlated. The air pollution concentration and migration index were positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the government response strict index was strongly negatively correlated with confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental temperature has a certain inhibitory effect on the transmission of COVID-19, and the air pollution concentration and migration index have a certain promoting effect on the transmission of COVID-19. The strict government response index indicates that the greater the intensity of government intervention, the fewer COVID-19 cases will occur.","Wang, Qian; Dong, Wen; Yang, Kun; Ren, Zhongda; Huang, Dongqing; Zhang, Peng; Wang, Jie",Int J Infect Dis,582,24

However, the factors that influence the success of immunotherapeutics have not been as clearly seen in advanced prostate cancer, likely due to immunosuppressive factors that exist within the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment. While there have been many immunotherapeutics used for prostate cancer, the majority have targeted a single immunosuppressive mechanism resulting in limited clinical efficacy. More recent research centered on elucidating the key mechanisms of immune resistance in the prostate tumor microenvironment has led to the discovery of a range of new treatment targets. With that in mind, many clinical trials have now set out to evaluate combination immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with advanced prostate cancer, in the hopes of circumventing the immunosuppressive mechanisms. ABSTRACT: The use of immunotherapy has become a critical treatment modality in many advanced cancers. However, immunotherapy in prostate cancer has not been met with similar success. Multiple interrelated mechanisms, such as low tumor mutational burden, immunosuppressive cells, and impaired cellular immunity, appear to subvert the immune system, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and leading to lower treatment efficacy in advanced prostate cancer. The lethality of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is driven by the lack of therapeutic regimens capable of generating durable responses. Multiple strategies are currently being tested to overcome immune resistance including combining various classes of treatment modalities. Several completed and ongoing trials have shown that combining vaccines or checkpoint inhibitors with hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, antibody–drug conjugates, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, or chemotherapy may enhance immune responses and induce long-lasting clinical responses without significant toxicity. Here, we review the current state of immunotherapy for prostate cancer, as well as tumor-specific mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance, with a comprehensive look at the current preclinical and clinical immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and impaired cellular immunity that have largely limited the utility of immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.","Movassaghi, Miyad; Chung, Rainjade; Anderson, Christopher B.; Stein, Mark; Saenger, Yvonne; Faiena, Izak",Cancers (Basel),582,26

The same holds true for the significance of the unique interspecies (fish/birds vs mammals) variability in the capacity to bind lactose. In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-)GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections. Binding is no longer inhibitable by lactose, as seen for the wild-type protein. These results establish the basis for detailed structure-activity considerations and are a step to complete the structural description of all seven members of the galectin network in chicken.","Ruiz, Federico M.; Gilles, Ulrich; Ludwig, Anna-Kristin; Sehad, Celia; Shiao, Tze Chieh; García Caballero, Gabriel; Kaltner, Herbert; Lindner, Ingo; Roy, René; Reusch, Dietmar; Romero, Antonio; Gabius, Hans-Joachim",Biochimie,582,17

A key area within hospitals is their use for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSI) with concerns with timing of the first dose, which can appreciably impact on effectiveness, as well as duration with extended prophylaxis common among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is a concern as extended duration increases utilization rates and AMR as well as adverse events. Consequently, there is a need to document issues of timing and duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) among LMICs together with potential ways forward to address current concerns. METHODS: Narrative review of timings and duration of SAP among LMICs combined with publications documenting successful approaches to improve SAP to provide future direction to all key stakeholder groups. RESULTS: There were documented concerns with the timing of the first dose of antibiotics, with appropriate timing as low as 6.7% in Egypt, although as high as 81.9% in Turkey. There was also an extensive duration of SAP, ranging from long duration times in all patients in a study in Nigeria with a mean of 8.7 days and 97% of patients in Egypt to 42.9% of patients in Pakistan and 35% in Turkey. Successful interventions to improve SAP typically involved multiple approaches including education of all key stakeholder groups, monitoring of usage against agreed guidelines,as well as quality targets. Multiple approaches typically improved timing and duration as well as reduced costs. For instance, in one study appropriateness increased from 30.1% to 91.4%, prolonged duration reduced to 5.7% of patients, and mean costs of antibiotics decreased 11-fold. CONCLUSION: There are considerable concerns with the timing and duration of SAP among LMICs. Multiple interventions among LMICs can address this providing future directions.","Mwita, Julius C; Ogunleye, Olayinka O; Olalekan, Adesola; Kalungia, Aubrey C; Kurdi, Amanj; Saleem, Zikria; Sneddon, Jacqueline; Godman, Brian",Int J Gen Med,582,16

Considerable study of endemic human coronaviruses has shown that neutralizing antibody correlates with protection, but effective clinical protection is variable for subsequent virus exposure. Animal coronavirus research has emphasized the importance of local mucosal protection (especially IgA) and systemic responses. Animal model and human post-infection studies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are largely corroborative. Whether for passive therapeutic strategies or vaccination, these findings provide a template for COVID-19. Many approaches to vaccination have emerged, and there may be more than one vaccine that will be applied, but individualized obstacles and concerns for administration, efficacy, and safety are inevitable. Regardless of safeguards or promises that may be understood from laboratory or vertebrate experiments, observations from large-scale human trials will ultimately prove to shape the medical future. Focus on common mucosal immunity can be underrated, and equally or more, focus on lactogenic immunity may be underestimated. In understanding both passive immunity and protection, the body is already primed to educate us with decisions of what constitutes protection and harm.

In August 2020, I taught this course online to students studying remotely. In re‐developing the course, I spent 9 days in the field filming high definition (HD) video, 360° video, and 360° photography to best recreate the course in a short time‐frame. A 360° video records omnidirectionally, allowing viewers to “look around” in all directions, resulting in a highly immersive experience. Students expressed favorable opinions of the course, especially traditional HD and 360° video. Students generally preferred HD videos over 360°, though this was due mostly to the high bandwidth needed for 360° video and the fact that core course content was primarily conveyed as HD videos (in recognition of bandwidth challenges), with supplementary 360° videos. Students favorably noted the interactivity and immersive feel of 360° videos and photographs. This technology is financially and logistically feasible for use in a natural sciences course.

The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature, minimum temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cúcuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cúcuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable local knowledge base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.","Morgan, Jasmine; Strode, Clare; Salcedo-Sora, J.

The use of siRNA and shRNA as antiviral therapeutic is limited because of the emergence of viral escape mutants. This problem is theoretically prevented by intracellular expression of lhRNAs generating multiple siRNAs that target the virus simultaneously, thus reducing the chance of viral escape. However, gene constructs encoding lhRNA molecules face problems with delivery to the right cells in an infected individual. In order to solve this problem, we constructed an HIV-1 variant with a 300 bp long hairpin structure in the 3' part of the genome corresponding to the Nef gene (HIV-lhNef). RESULTS: Intriguingly, HIV-lhNef potently inhibited wild-type HIV-1 production in trans. However, HIV-lhNef demonstrated a severe production and replication defect, which we were able to solve by selecting spontaneous virus variants with truncated hairpin structures. Although these escape variants lost the ability to trans-inhibit HIV-1, they effectively outgrew the wild-type virus in competition experiments in SupT1 cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of the lhNef hairpin within the HIV-1 genome results in potent trans-inhibition of wild-type HIV-1. Although the mechanism of trans-inhibition is currently unknown, it remains of interest to study the molecular details because the observed effect is extremely potent. This may have implications for the development of virus strains to be used as live-attenuated virus vaccines.","Konstantinova, Pavlina; ter Brake, Olivier; Haasnoot, Joost; de Haan, Peter; Berkhout, Ben",Retrovirology,582,30

Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the US, this study examined adolescents’ motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. METHODS: Data were collected March 29(th) and 30(th) 2020, two-weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the US. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents’ motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents’ anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.

Complete recovery and rapid yet safe return to participation are critical for competitive athletes. Alterations in thermoregulation, metabolism, fluid homeostasis, muscle strength, and endurance, as well as potential complications for the athlete and others, must be considered. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched (1970-2013) for all English-language articles related to febrile illness in sport, using the keywords fever, febrile, body temperature, thermoregulation, infection, illness, disease, exercise, athlete, sport, performance, return to play, metabolism, hydration, and dehydration. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. RESULTS: Limited data confirm that febrile illness is correlated with alterations in the body’s thermoregulatory system, with increases in metabolic rate, and with effects in fluid homeostasis. Human and animal studies demonstrate a decrease in muscle strength and endurance secondary to muscle catabolism in febrile illness. However, indirect evidence suggests that regular exercise enhances the immune response. No strong clinical research has been published on return to play during or following acute febrile illness, excluding mononucleosis and myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Fever is correlated with an increase in insensible fluid losses, dehydration, metabolic demands, and dysregulation of body temperature. Fever can have detrimental effects on the musculoskeletal system, including decreasing strength and endurance, generalized muscle catabolism, and increase in perceived fatigue. Participating in strenuous exercise during febrile illness can worsen the illness and has demonstrated increased lethality in animal models. No consensus recommendations support return to activity before resolution of fever, and training should be resumed gradually once fever and dehydration have resolved.","Dick, Natalie A.; Diehl, Jason J.",Sports Health,582,9

While doomsday prepping has traditionally been reported in the context of extremists, during the COVID-19 pandemic, excessive stockpiling leading to supply shortages has been reported globally. It is unclear what psychological or demographic factors are associated with this stockpiling. This study investigated doomsday prepping beliefs and behaviors in relation to COVID-19 proximity, demographics, coping strategies, psychopathology, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and personality in 384 participants (249 female) in an online study. Participants completed a number of questionnaires including the Post-Apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs Scale and a scale designed for the current study to measure prepping in the context of COVID-19. These were analyzed using ANOVAs, correlational, and mediation analyses to examine relationships between psychometric variables and stockpiling. Prepping beliefs and behaviors were higher in males than females and positively associated with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, IU, and traditional masculinity traits. Older age, male gender, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and traditional masculinity predicted unique variance in prepping. The relationship between gender and stockpiling was mediated by social learning (witnessing other people panic buying) and the perceived threat of COVID-19 (doomsday interpretations) while proximity and personal vulnerability to COVID-19 were non-significant.

The new distribution has many interesting properties that make it superior to many other discrete distributions, particularly in analyzing over-dispersed count data. Several statistical properties of the introduced distribution have been established including moments and moment generating function, residual moments, characterization, entropy, estimation of the parameter by the maximum likelihood method. A bias reduction method is applied to the derived estimator; its existence and uniqueness are discussed. Applications of the goodness of fit of the proposed distribution have been examined and compared with other discrete distributions using three real data sets from biological sciences.","Al-Babtain, Abdulhakim A.; Ahmed, Abdul Hadi N.; Afify, Ahmed Z.",Entropy (Basel),582,29

We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17th and 18th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%+ ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts decisions were the most important predictors.

We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, propensity score matched (PSM) cohort study to determine whether COVID-19 parturients have an increased risk of hypotension after neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Methods: Clinical data of COVID-19 parturients were collected from the electronic medical records from 1th January to 31th May, 2020 in three hospitals of Hubei Province, China. Information of Control parturients (without COVID-19) were obtained at the same institutions over a similar period in 2019. All American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status II full termed pregnant women who received cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia were included. The primary objective was to obtain and compare the incidence of neuraxial anesthesia-related hypotension. Secondary objectives were the analysis of anesthetic implementation and administration, intraoperative maternal vital signs and adverse reactions, and neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min after delivery. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 parturients were also analyzed. PSM was derived to balance the predictors for neuraxial anesthesia-related hypotension based on previous studies. Results: In present study, 101 COVID-19 parturients and 186 Control parturients were derived from 1,403 cases referenced to propensity score matching. The incidence of neuraxial anesthesia-related hypotension was 57.4% in COVID-19 parturients and 41.9% in Control parturients with an incidence risk ratio (IRR) of 1.37 (95% CI 1.08–1.74; P = 0.012; post-hoc Cramér's V = 0.15) in the PSM cohort. The incidences of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and shaking were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than Control group (48.5 vs. 17.2%, P < 0.001; 10.9 vs. 4.3%, P = 0.03; 18.8 vs. 3.2%, P < 0.001; 51.5 vs. 18.3%, P < 0.001; respectively). The Apgar scores at 1 min was significantly lower in newborns from COVID-19 parturients than that in Control babies (P = 0.04).

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from psychiatric professionals in 34 hospitals between 29 January and 7 February 2020, in China. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or deployed on wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. PRIMARY OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress were assessed by the Chinese versions of 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 610 psychiatric professionals were included. 29.8% were employed in Wuhan, and 22.5% were frontline workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (461 (75.6%)), anxiety (282 (46.2%)), insomnia (336 (55.1%)) and mental stress (481 (78.9%)). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with worrying about infection (eg, OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.39) for anxiety), risks of exposure to COVID-19 (eg, having inadequate personal protection equipment, OR 2.43 (1.32 to 4.47) for depression) and self-perceived physical health (eg, OR 3.22 (2.24 to 4.64) for mental stress). Information sources of COVID-19 were also found to be both positively (eg, information from relatives, OR 2.16 (1.46 to 3.21) for mental stress) and negatively (eg, information from TV, OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.77) for mental stress) associated with mental stress. There is preliminary evidence that mental health might benefit from greater availability of mental healthcare services. The structural equation model analysis indicated that worrying about infection may be the primary mediator via which risk of exposure to COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of psychiatric professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrate several pathways via which the COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively affected the mental health of psychiatric professionals in China.","Guo, Xin; McCutcheon, Robert; Pillinger, Toby; Arumuham, Atheeshaan; Chen, Jianhua; Ma, Simeng; Yang, Jun; Wang, Ying; Hu, Shaohua; Wang, Gaohua; Liu, Zhong-Chun",BMJ Open,582,24

With concerns that this vulnerable group could be at higher risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to others, the implementation of health promotion activities appropriate to this group was considered to be essential during the epidemic. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of delivering a telephone health education programme dealing with anxiety levels, and knowledge and practice of measures to prevent transmission of SARS among a group of older adults with low SES. DESIGN: Pretest/posttest design. SETTINGS: Subjects were recruited from registered members of a government subsidized social service center in Hong Kong and living in low-cost housing estates. PARTICIPANTS: The eligibility criteria were: (1) aged 55 or above; (2) able to speak Cantonese; (3) no hearing impairment, and (4) reachable by telephone. Of the 295 eligible subjects, 122 older adults completed the whole study. METHODS: The interviewers approached all eligible subjects by telephone during the period of 15–25 May 2003. After obtaining the participants’ verbal consent, the interviewer collected baseline data by use of a questionnaire and implemented a health education programme. A follow-up telephone call was made a week later using the same questionnaire. RESULTS: The level of anxiety was lowered (t=3.28, p<0.001), and knowledge regarding the transmission routes of droplets (p<0.001) and urine and feaces (p<0.01) were improved after the intervention. Although statistical significant difference was found in the practice of identified preventive measures before and after intervention, influence on behavioral changes needed further exploration. CONCLUSION: The telephone health education seemed to be effective in relieving anxiety and improving knowledge of the main transmission routes of SARS in this group, but not the practice of preventing SARS. Telephone contact appears to be a practical way of providing health education to vulnerable groups when face-to-face measure is not feasible and may be useful in raising health awareness during future outbreaks of emerging infections.","Chan, Sophia S.C.; So, Winnie K.W.; Wong, David C.N.; Lee, Angel C.K.; Tiwari, Agnes",Int J Nurs Stud,582,20

Although a viral aetiological agent is estimated to be involved in up to 80% of cases, the majority of these agents have never been specifically identified. Since 2009, diagnostic and surveillance efforts for influenza virus have been applied worldwide. However, insufficient epidemiological information is available for the many other respiratory viruses that can cause Acute respiratory infections. METHODS: This study evaluated the presence of 14 non-influenza respiratory viruses in 872 pharyngeal exudate samples using RT-qPCR. All samples met the operational definition of a probable case of an influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infection and had a previous negative result for influenza by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The presence of at least one non-influenza virus was observed in 312 samples (35.8%). The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus (RV; 33.0%), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; 30.8%) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV; 10.6%). A total of 56 cases of co-infection (17.9%) caused by 2, 3, or 4 viruses were identified. Approximately 62.5% of all positive cases were in children under 9 years of age. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 13 non-influenza respiratory viruses that could occur in any season of the year. This study provides evidence for the prevalence and seasonality of a wide range of respiratory viruses that circulate in Mexico and constitute a risk for the population. Additionally, our data suggest that including these tests more widely in the diagnostic algorithm for influenza may reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, reduce the hospitalisation time, and enrich national epidemiological data with respect to the infections caused by these viruses.","Fernandes-Matano, Larissa; Monroy-Muñoz, Irma Eloísa; Angeles-Martínez, Javier; Sarquiz-Martinez, Brenda; Palomec-Nava, Iliana Donají; Pardavé-Alejandre, Hector Daniel; Santos Coy-Arechavaleta, Andrea; Santacruz-Tinoco, Clara Esperanza; González-Ibarra, Joaquín; González-Bonilla, Cesar Raúl; Muñoz-Medina, José Esteban",PLoS One,582,5

We sought to quantify the carbon offset and cost savings achieved during the 2021 match cycle based on the nature of the virtual format. METHODS Applicants registered for the 2021 American Urologic Association match were surveyed to gather information regarding interview geography. A validated carbon emissions calculator was used to determine the associated carbon offset by forgoing travel. The cost savings were estimated using Google flights. RESULTS 73 applicants, representing 14% of the applicant pool, applied to an average of 74 programs and took an average of 13 interviews. The estimated carbon offset was 6.26 metric tons of CO2 per applicant and 0.492 metric tons of CO2 per interview. The estimated 3011 metric tons of CO2 generated by all applicants are equivalent to 655 passenger vehicles driven for 1 year, and would take 3689 acres of forest to sequester over one year. The estimated average cost savings on travel were $2,198 per applicant and $172 per interview, totaling $1.06 million for the applicant pool. In the future, 72.6% of applicants are either very likely or somewhat likely to recommend using a virtual format for residency interviews. CONCLUSION Converting interviews to a virtual format during the 2021 urology residency match resulted in a reduced carbon footprint and substantial cost savings for applicants.

Greasy grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) were investigated for their apoptotic activity in culture cells. GGNNV infection of sea bass (SB) cells appeared to induce a typical cytopathic effect (CPE), i.e., cytoplasmic vacuolation, thinning, rounding up, detachment of infected cells from the cultured dish, and eventually cell lysis and death. The infected SB cells underwent DNA fragmentation and stained positive in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, suggesting that GGNNV infection induced apoptosis in SB cells. In addition, GGNNV-infected SB cells showed an increased activity of caspase-8-like proteases (IETDase) and caspase-3-like proteases (IETDase), whereas inhibitor of caspase-8 and caspase-3 reduced GGNNV-induced apoptosis. This suggests that GGNNV may promote apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in SB cells. Protein α, the precursor of GGNNV capsid proteins, was transiently expressed in SB and Cos-7 cells. The DNA fragmentation and TUNEL positive signal were apparent in SB and Cos-7 cells expressing protein α, suggesting that protein α may serve as an apoptotic inducer in these cells. Moreover, expression of protein α resulted in the activation of caspase-3-like proteases in both cells, which could be inhibited by a caspase-3-like protease specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO peptide. These results suggest that fish caspases are important elements in GGNNV-meditated apoptosis.","Guo, Yan Xiang; Wei, Ting; Dallmann, Klara; Kwang, Jimmy",Virology,582,20

There is a need to examine physiological predictors from the pre‐pandemic period to identify and treat individuals at‐risk. In this study, our aim was to use pre‐pandemic markers of autonomic nervous system (ANS) parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation to predict individuals' psychological well‐being during the crisis. We also assessed the role of mood regulation expectancies as a mediator of the association between pre‐pandemic physiological measures and COVID‐related well‐being. In May to June 2020, 185 Israeli adults completed online questionnaires assessing their mood regulation expectancies since COVID‐19 began, and their current well‐being. These individuals had participated in lab studies 1.5–3 years prior to this assessment, where their physiological measures were taken, including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance level (SCL). RSA was positively related to mood regulation expectancies during COVID‐19 (b = 3.46, 95% CI [0.84, 6.05]). Mood regulation expectancies, in turn, positively predicted well‐being during the crisis (b = 0.021, 95% CI [0.016, 0.027]). The mediation was significant and moderated by SCL (index = −0.09, 95% CI [−0.02, −0.0001]), such that it was strongest for individuals with low SCL. We point to pre‐pandemic physiological mechanisms underlying individuals' mental well‐being during the COVID‐19 pandemic. These findings have theoretical, diagnostic, and clinical implications that may refine our understanding of the physiological basis of resilience to the COVID‐19 pandemic and thus may be implemented to identify and assist individuals in these times.","Gordon, Ilanit; Horesh, Danny; Milstein, Nir; Tomashin, Alon; Mayo, Oded; Korisky, Adi",Psychophysiology,582,1

METHODS: Using cases and death data from the national population-based surveillance system of Peru, we estimated incidence, mortality and fatality, stratified by sex, age and geographic distribution (per 100,000 habitants) from March 16 to November 27, 2020. At the same time, we calculated the risk of COVID-19 death. RESULTS: During the study period, 961894 cases and 35913 deaths were reported in Peru. Men had a twofold higher risk of COVID-19 death within the overall population of Peru (odds ratio (OR), 2.11; confidence interval (CI) 95%; 2.06–2.16; p<0.00001), as well as 20 regions of Peru, compared to women (p<0.05). There were variations in incidence, mortality and fatality rates stratified by sex, age, and region. The incidence rate was higher among men than among women (3079 vs. 2819 per 100,000 habitants, respectively). The mortality rate was two times higher in males than in females (153 vs. 68 per 100,000 habitants, respectively). The mortality rates increased with age, and were high in men 60 years of age or older. The fatality rate was two times higher in men than in women (4.96% vs. 2.41%, respectively), and was high in men 50 years of age or older. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the higher incidence, mortality and fatality rates among men than among women from Peru. These rates vary widely by region, and men are at greater risk of COVID-19 death. In addition, the mortality and fatality rates increased with age, and were most predominant in men 50 years of age or older.","Ramírez-Soto, Max Carlos; Arroyo-Hernández, Hugo; Ortega-Cáceres, Gutia",PLoS One,582,30

However, these systems also cause serious problems in terms of eutrophication in waterbodies. This study analysed the nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami in floating cages in Lake Maninjau. Method A total of 20 floating cages were used to record these nutrients in feed supply, female and male juvenile fish, dead fish and harvested fish to estimate nutrient loading. Data on the harvested fish, production cycle, stock number and cage capacity were used to estimate the stocking density, feeding rate, feed efficiency, and net fish yield, and the relationship between feed supply and nutrient loading and farm characteristics was analysed by least squares regression methods. Results A total of 20 floating cages released nutrients into waterbodies at an average rate of 236.27±60.44 kg/cycle for C, 84.52±20.86 kg/cycle for N and 8.70±3.63 kg/cycle for P. On average, fish production for each floating cage (±SD) was 1226±282 kg wet weight/cycle, and the net fish yield was 12.63±2.82 kg/m (3)/cycle. Survival rates ranged from 86.33 to 95.27%/cycle. The production cycles varied from 160 to 175 days with feed conversion ratios between 1.60 and 1.75, feed conversion efficiencies were between 0.58 and 0.63. The production parameters that had strong relationships with the net fish yield were feed supply ( r (2)=0.960), stocking rates ( r (2)=0.924) and feeding rates ( r (2)=0.961). In contrast, the length of the production cycle was not strongly related to the net fish yield ( r (2)=0.187). Conclusion Nutrient loading from the supplied feed was greater than that from the harvested fish, juvenile fish and dead fish. Increasing the net fish yield in floating cages was better predicted by the stocking densities and feeding levels than by the other factors.","Syandri, Hafrijal; Azrita, Azrita; Sumiarsih, Eni; undefined, Elfiondri",F1000Res,582,20

Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in this age-group. Objective: The objective was to investigate and compare the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in three age groups (1–6 years, 7–10 years, 11–19 years) and to examine the associations with psychological factors. Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted from 9 April to 11 May 2020 during the acute phase of major lockdown measures. In this cross-sectional study, children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19 years were recruited as a population-based sample. They were eligible if they were residents in Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, were parents/caregivers of a child aged between 1 and 10 years or adolescents ≥11 years, had sufficient German language skills and provided informed consent. Results: Among 5823 participants, between 2.2% and 9.9% reported emotional and behavioural problems above the clinical cut-off and between 15.3% and 43.0% reported an increase in these problems during the pandemic. Significant age-related effects were found regarding the type and frequency of problems (χ(2)((4))≥50.2, P ≤ 0.001). While preschoolers (1–6 years) had the largest increase in oppositional-defiant behaviours, adolescents reported the largest increase in emotional problems. Adolescents experienced a significantly larger decrease in emotional and behavioural problems than both preschoolers and school-children. Sociodemographic variables, exposure to and appraisal of COVID-19, psychotherapy before COVID-19 and parental mental health significantly predicted change in problem-scores (F ≥ 3.69, P ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of children and adolescents experience age-related mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. These problems should be monitored, and support should be offered to risk-groups to improve communication, emotion regulation and appraisal style.","Schmidt, Stefanie J.; Barblan, Lara P.; Lory, Irina; Landolt, Markus A.",European journal of psychotraumatology,582,15

DESIGN: We associated serial plasma soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 levels and markers of systemic inflammation including d-dimer, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate with 30-day mortality and ventilator dependence. SETTING: Adult medical ICUs and general medicine wards at an academic teaching hospital in Boston, MA. PATIENTS: Adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted to the ICU (n = 72) and non-ICU patients managed with supplemental oxygen (n = 77). INTERVENTIONS: Observational study from April 25 to June 25, 2020. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ICU patients had a higher baseline body mass index and median soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2, d-dimer, and C-reactive protein concentrations compared with non-ICU patients. Among ICU patients, elevated baseline modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and log (soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2) were associated with 30-day mortality, whereas initial Pao(2)/Fio(2) and markers of systemic inflammation were similar between groups. Only log (soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2) associated with ventilator dependence over time, with the last measured log (soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2) concentration obtained on ICU day 11.5 (interquartile range [7–17]) higher in patients who required reintubation or tracheostomy placement compared with patients who were successfully extubated (2.10 [1.89–2.26] vs 1.87 ng/mL [1.72–2.13 ng/mL]; p = 0.03). Last measured systemic inflammatory markers, modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and Pao(2)/Fio(2) were not different between patients who were successfully extubated compared with those with continued ventilator dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 is a biomarker readily measured in blood that can provide dynamic information about the degree of a patient’s lung injury and real-time assessment of the likelihood of extubation success. Measures of systemic inflammation, illness severity, and oxygenation did not associate with ventilator outcomes.","Alladina, Jehan W.; Giacona, Francesca L.; White, Emma B.; Brait, Kelsey L.; Abe, Elizabeth A.; Michelhaugh, Sam A.; Hibbert, Kathryn A.; Januzzi, James L.; Thompson, B.

However, the NAAT technique is lengthy and nasopharyngeal sampling requires trained personnel. Saliva NAAT represents an interesting alternative but diagnostic performances vary widely between studies. Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of a nasopharyngeal point-of-care antigen (Ag) test and of saliva NAAT for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), as compared to nasopharyngeal NAAT. Design: Prospective participant enrollment from 19 October through 18 December 2020. Setting: Two community COVID-19 screening centers in Paris, France. Participants: 1452 ambulatory children and adults referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Interventions: NAAT on a saliva sample (performed with three different protocols for pre-processing, amplification and detection of SARS-CoV-2) and Ag testing on a nasopharyngeal sample. Measurements: Performance of saliva NAAT and nasopharyngeal Ag testing. Results: Overall, 129/1443 (9%) participants tested positive on nasopharyngeal NAAT (102/564 [18%] in symptomatic and 27/879 [3%] in asymptomatic participants). Sensitivity was of 94% (95% CI, 86% to 98%), 23% (CI, 14% to 35%), 94% (CI, 88% to 97%) and 96% (CI, 91% to 99%) for the nasopharyngeal Ag test and the three different protocols of saliva NAAT, respectively. Estimates of specificity were above 95% for all methods. Diagnostic accuracy was similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Limitations: Few children (n=122, 8%) were included. Conclusion: In the ambulatory setting, diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal Ag testing and of saliva NAAT seems similar to that of nasopharyngeal NAAT, subject to strict compliance with specific pre-processing and amplification protocols.

Several factors are thought to predispose young dogs to microbiological infections. Identifying the cause of death is often a challenge, and broad diagnostic analysis is often needed. Here, we aimed to determine the infectious causes of death in young dogs aged up to 1 year, examining how it relates to age (under and over 6 months), lifestyle (owned versus ownerless), breed (purebred and crossbreed), and gender. A retrospective study was conducted in a 3-year period (2015–2017) on 138 dead dogs that had undergone necropsy and microbiological diagnostics. Enteritis and pneumonia were the most commonly observed lesions. Polymicrobism was more prevalent (62.3%) than single-agent infections and associated with a higher rate of generalised lesions. Ownerless dogs showed over a three-fold higher predisposition to viral coinfections than owned dogs. Above all, canine parvovirus was the most prevalent agent (77.5%), followed by canine coronavirus (31.1%) and canine adenovirus (23.9%); ownerless pups had a higher predisposition to these viruses. Escherichia coli (23.9%), Clostridium perfringens type A (18.1%), and Enterococcus spp. (8.7%) were the most commonly identified bacteria, which mostly involved in coinfections. A lower prevalence of CDV and Clostridium perfringens type A was observed in puppies under 6 months of age. In conclusion, this study is the first comprehensive survey on a wide panel of microbiological agents related to necropsy lesions. It lays the groundwork for future studies attempting to understand the circulation of infectious agents in a determined area.","Cardillo, Lorena; Piegari, Giuseppe; Iovane, Valentina; Viscardi, Maurizio; Alfano, Flora; Cerrone, Anna; Pagnini, Ugo; Montagnaro, Serena; Galiero, Giorgio; Pisanelli, Giuseppe; Fusco, Giovanna",Vet Med Int,582,11

Besides, poultry processing plants' conditions exacerbate the risks due to the proximity on the line, cold, and humidity. Most workers do not have access to paid sick time or adequate health care, and because of the low wages, they have limited reserves to enable them to leave steady employment.

Aptamers as potential alternatives for antibodies could be directed against any protein in infected cells and any components of viral particles. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis based on aptamer technology. In recent years, various types of aptamers including RNA and DNA were introduced against viral hepatitis. Some of these aptamers can be utilized for early and precise diagnosis of hepatitis infections and other group selected as therapeutic tools against viral targets. Designing diagnostic and therapeutic platforms based on aptamer technology is a promising approach in viral infections. The obtained aptamers in the recent years showed obvious potential for use as diagnostic and therapeutic tools against viral hepatitis.

However, the latter may be undercounted, as it is limited to only those who were tested for viral infection. In addition, comorbidity information for people not hospitalized may not always be readily available for traditional biostatistical analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a Bayesian approach that only requires the observed frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population.

Mice immunized with the unconjugated composite peptide developed antibody responses earlier than mice immunized with conjugated peptides, and the IgG antibodies were broadly reactive and neutralizing across Groups 1 and 2 influenza viruses. Multi-epitope unconjugated influenza composite peptides formulated with ALFQ provide a novel strategy for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. These synthetic peptide vaccines avoid the pitfalls of egg-produced influenza vaccines and production can be scaled up rapidly and economically.","Sei, Clara J.; Rao, Mangala; Schuman, Richard F.; Daum, Luke T.; Matyas, Gary R.; Rikhi, Nimisha; Muema, Kevin; Anderson, Alexander; Jobe, Ousman; Kroscher, Kellie A.; Alving, Carl R.; Fischer, Gerald W.",Vaccines (Basel),582,1

BRSV is spread by horizontal contact causing a constant presence of seropositive animals that favors viral circulation throughout the year. Moreover, reinfections with BRSV are frequent between animals regardless of their age as BRSV does not confer long-lasting protective immunity. Several studies have demonstrated the circulation of BRSV in cattle from different regions of the world; however, little is known about the dynamics of BRSV infection in cows before and after they begin lactation. The aim of this work was to study the dynamics of BRSV neutralizing antibodies from birth up to 36 months of age in a closed dairy herd of Argentina specifically around the lactation period. Passive maternal antibodies against BRSV started to decrease monthly and became almost undetectable at 8 months of age. We detected two potential infection points at months 11 and 27 after birth, in which 30% and 45% of the animals showed seroconversion, respectively. Specifically, an increase in the proportion of seropositive cows after the start of lactation suggests that they became reinfected around the time they began lactating. We demonstrate the importance of understanding BRSV dynamics in a closed dairy herd to review the vaccination schedule of the animals to achieve protection against BRSV infection.","Ferella, Alejandra; Aguirreburualde, María Sol Perez; Sammarruco, Ayelen; Parreño, Viviana; Santos, María José Dus; Mozgovoj, Marina",Rev Argent Microbiol,582,2

This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus in history. More than 150 000 confirmed cases worldwide are reported involving the SARS-CoV2, with more than 5000 COVID-19-related deaths on March 14, 2020. Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalised myalgia, malaise, drowsiness, diarrhoea, confusion, dyspnoea, and bilateral interstitial pneumonia are the common symptoms. No therapies are available, and the only way to contain the virus spread is to regularly and thoroughly clean one’s hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water, to maintain at least 1 m [3 feet] distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing, to avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth, and to stay home if one feels unwell. No data are available on the risk of COVID-19 and outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients. Outbreak restrictions can impact on the IBD care. We aim to give a viewpoint on how operationally to manage IBD patients and ensure quality of care in the current pandemic era.","Fiorino, Gionata; Allocca, Mariangela; Furfaro, Federica; Gilardi, Daniela; Zilli, Alessandra; Radice, Simona; Spinelli, Antonino; Danese, Silvio",J Crohns Colitis,582,20
