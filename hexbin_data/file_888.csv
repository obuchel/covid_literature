When words cannot provide meaning to experience, metaphor is often utilized. CONCLUSIONS Words like ""love"" are informed autobiographically as ""growing words,"" with no rules defining their use. The significance of ""love"" to an individual is created through personal history, such that sophisticated understanding is only constructed following a lifetime of experience. ""Corona"" is perhaps a growing word; we cannot yet grasp its meaning in the face of cólera (passion) and pati (suffering) informing our collective traumatic script.

76840,Hospital pharmacy in COVID-19.,2020-06-13,"BACKGROUND In pressure-controlled (PC) ventilation, tidal volume (V T) and transpulmonary pressure (P L ) result from the addition of ventilator pressure and the patient's inspiratory effort. PC modes can be classified into fully, partially, and non-synchronized modes, and the degree of synchronization may result in different V T and P L despite identical ventilator settings. This study assessed the effects of three PC modes on V T, P L , inspiratory effort (esophageal pressure-time product, PTPes), and airway occlusion pressure, P 0.1. We also assessed whether P 0.1 can be used for evaluating patient effort. METHODS Prospective, randomized, crossover physiologic study performed in 14 spontaneously breathing mechanically ventilated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure (1 subsequently withdrew). PC modes were fully (PC-CMV), partially (PC-SIMV), and non-synchronized (PC-IMV using airway pressure release ventilation) and were applied randomly; driving pressure, inspiratory time, and set respiratory rate being similar for all modes. Airway, esophageal pressure, P 0.1, airflow, gas exchange, and hemodynamics were recorded. RESULTS V T was significantly lower during PC-IMV as compared with PC-SIMV and PC-CMV (387 ± 105 vs 458 ± 134 vs 482 ± 108 mL, respectively; p < 0.05). Maximal P L was also significantly lower (13.3 ± 4.9 vs 15.3 ± 5.7 vs 15.5 ± 5.2 cmH2O, respectively; p < 0.05), but PTPes was significantly higher in PC-IMV (215.6 ± 154.3 vs 150.0 ± 102.4 vs 130.9 ± 101.8 cmH2O × s × min-1, respectively; p < 0.05), with no differences in gas exchange and hemodynamic variables. PTPes increased by more than 15% in 10 patients and by more than 50% in 5 patients. An increased P 0.1 could identify high levels of PTPes. CONCLUSIONS Non-synchronized PC mode lowers V T and P L in comparison with more synchronized modes in spontaneously breathing patients but can increase patient effort and may need specific adjustments.

It is enhanced by both innovative port technology and technical expertise learned by developing natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). DESIGN Sigmoidectomy in a human via a single laparoscopic port. SETTING University hospital. Patient A 40-year-old woman with previously documented diverticular abscess. INTERVENTIONS The multichannel single port (Triport; Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) was placed at the umbilicus. The sigmoid was retracted by both intraluminal sigmoidoscopy and magnetic anchoring. Mesenteric dissection between the mid-descending colon and the colorectal junction was carried out close to the colon using a Ligasure Advance (Covidien, Valley lab, Norwalk Connecticut). The stapler anvil was passed retrogradely per ano to lie within the descending colon. A linear stapler effected proximal and distal sigmoidal transection. Magnetic attraction then delivered the in situ anvil pike into a colotomy placed adjacent to the proximal staple line. After its position was secured with an endoloop, the pike was mated with its stapler head positioned in the rectal stump. This allowed creation of a double-stapled colorectal anastomosis 10 cm from the anal verge. Specimen retrieval was performed via the umbilical port site. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Extent of scarring, occurrence of surgical complications, technical adequacy, and clinical outcome. RESULTS No intraoperative complications occurred during the 90-minute procedure. A total of 40 cm of sigmoid was resected. The patient convalesced without complication and went home 4 days after surgery. At the 1-month review, she was fully recovered and her single umbilical scar was well healed. CONCLUSIONS With advancing surgical technology and technique, truly minimally invasive surgical procedures are feasible. Understanding of NOTES can therefore extend beyond its experimental application into contemporary surgical practice.","Leroy, Joel; Cahill, Ronan A; Asakuma, Misuhiro; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2008.562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221330/,888

A new challenge for pharmacy services).,2020-06-12,"Background Revisional surgery is becoming a common and challenging practice in bariatric centers. The aim of this study was to evaluate resectional one anastomosis gastric bypass/mini gastric bypass (R-OAGB/MGB) as a revisional procedure. Methods From January 2016 to February 2017, data on 21 consecutive patients undergoing R-OAGB/MGB for weight loss failure after primary restrictive procedures were prospectively collected and analysed. Results Mean age was 39 ± 12 years (18-65), and 11 (52.3%) were women. The mean operative time was 96.4 ± 20.9 min (range, 122-80), and the mean postoperative stay was 47.8 ± 7.4 hours (range, 36-73). There were no deaths and no procedure-related complications. The mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 42.9 ± 6.5 at the time of R-OAGB/MGB to 28.5 ± 4 at the 12-month follow-up. At that time point, the mean percentage of BMI loss (%EBL) and the mean percentage of total body weight loss (%TWL) reached 81.6 ± 0.17% and 35 ± 0.01%, respectively. Conclusion R-OAGB/MGB was technically straightforward, effective, and safe in this at-surgical risk population. R-OAGB/MGB should be added to the armamentarium of revisional bariatric procedures considering its technical aspects and the potential advantage on weight loss.","Noun, Roger; Slim, Rita; Chakhtoura, Ghassan; Gharios, Joseph; Chouillard, Elie; Tohmé-Noun, Carla",Journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4049136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30319821/,888
124532,Specialized pharmaceutical care in social health centers in the times of COVID-19.,2020-06-12,"INTRODUCTION Falls in hospitals and care homes are a major issue of international concern. Inpatient falls are the most commonly reported safety incident in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), costing the NHS £630 million a year. Injurious falls are particularly life-limiting and costly. There is a growing body of evidence on shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention; however, no systematic review exists to inform practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically identify, appraise and summarise studies investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness, and experiences of shock-absorbing flooring in hospitals and care homes. Our search will build on an extensive search conducted by a scoping review (inception to May 2016). We will search electronic databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, MEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Scopus and Web of Science; May 2016-present), trial registries and grey literature. We will conduct backward and forward citation searches of included studies, and liaise with study researchers. We will evaluate the influence of floors on fall-related injuries, falls and staff work-related injuries through randomised and non-randomised studies, consider economic and qualitative evidence, and implementation factors. We will consider risk of bias, assess heterogeneity and explore potential effect modifiers via subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Where appropriate we will combine studies through meta-analysis. We will use the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach to evaluate the quality of evidence and present the results using summary of findings tables, and adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will follow the ethical principles of systematic review conduct, by attending to publication ethics, transparency and rigour. Our dissemination plan includes peer-reviewed publication, presentations, press release, stakeholder symposium, patient video and targeted knowledge-to-action reports. This review will inform decision-making around falls management in care settings and identify important directions for future research.

METHODS Post-hoc analyses of ENCHANTED, an international quasi-factorial randomised evaluation of intravenous alteplase-dose comparison and levels of blood pressure control in patients who had thrombolysed AIS. Multivariable logistic regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity scores were used to determine associations of self-reported smoking status and clinical outcomes, according to 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH). RESULTS Of 4540 patients who had an AIS, there were 1008 (22.2%) current smokers who were younger and predominantly male, with more comorbidities of hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus, and greater baseline neurological impairment, compared with non-smokers. In univariate analysis, current smokers had a higher likelihood of a favourable shift in mRS scores (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99; p=0.038) but this association reversed in a fully adjusted model with IPTW (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28; p=0.009). A similar trend was also apparent for dichotomised poor outcome (mRS scores 2-6: OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33; p=0.007), but not with the risk of sICH across standard criteria. CONCLUSION Smoking predicts poor functional recovery in patients who had thrombolysed AIS.

142682,Clinical research in hospital pharmacy during the fight against COVID-19.,2020-06-13,"Yield gaps in milk production are here defined as the differentials between the actual yield obtained by the dairy farmer and the potential farm yield (production achieved by the top 10% of farmers: Gap 2) as well as the differential between this potential farm yield and the yield registered in the research stations (Gap 1). Assessment of yield gaps provides valuable information on potential production enhancement and drivers behind yield gaps. Milk production can be increased by narrowing the predominant large yield gaps in resource-poor smallholder farming system. Hence, this study assessed the milk yield gap and factors affecting the yield gap in Ri-Bhoi district of Meghalaya, a state located in the north-eastern Himalayan region of India. This research paper provides a scope for exploring the possibilities for improving dairy production in the state as well as contributing to literature through incorporating crucial determinants responsible for milk yield gap. A sample of 81 respondents was drawn purposely from two blocks of the district. The results indicated that the average number of cattle per household was 9.38 in standard animal units. The total yield gap was estimated at 6.20 l (91.06%) per day, composed of 0.80 l (11.76%) per day of yield gap I and 5.40 l (79.30%) per day of yield gap II. This demonstrates that the top performing farms were achieving a production level not dissimilar to that obtained on the research stations, but many were doing far less well. The size of cattle shed, dairy farming experience, concentrate price and human labour were the important determinants of the yield gap. Hence, encouraging the right stocking density of cattle, training on the preparations of home-made concentrates, access to cheap and quality concentrates, incorporating training and experience sharing on proper dairy management practices and use of technology could benefit the dairy farmers of the region.","Kemboi, Evans; Feroze, S M; Singh, Ram; Ahmed, Jabir; Tyngkan, Hehlangki",The Journal of dairy research,https://doi.org/10.1017/s002202992100008x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594970/,888

Researchers have studied their roles numerous times, with results often informing sport procedures (e.g., athlete order in artistic sports). As the research on sport officiating spans five decades and several topics of interest, it is important that researchers periodically synthesize the literature. Purpose: The purpose of this study, therefore, was to conduct an analysis of literature on sport officiating research. Method: Guided by previous researchers, we executed four methodological steps including the article search, article retrieval, sample validity, and article coding. These steps yielded 386 articles for analysis, which ranged from 1971 to 2018. We coded the articles based on four main categories: article information, participant demographics, contextual information, and methodology. Results: Key findings from this analysis include a recent influx in sport officiating research, a vast number of publication journals, few studies dedicated to female-only participants, many studies missing relevant demographic information, an over-representation of interactors, and a reliance on quantitative studies. Conclusions: Though many researchers have conducted studies on sport officiating, several articles had poor methodological rigor (e.g., not reporting key demographic information). In the discussion and conclusion sections, we highlight strengths and weaknesses within the field and provide recommendations to guide future researchers and practitioners, to ensure robust research designs and guide applied practice.","Hancock, David J; Bennett, Samantha; Roaten, Hannah; Chapman, Kyle; Stanley, Caleb",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2020.1756198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633683/,888
179334,"Filtered Life: Air Purification, Gender, and Cigarettes in the People's Republic of China",2021,SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that has caused COVID-19 pandemic. This virus is a new variant of the SARS-CoV virus and also closely related to MERS-CoV which caused similar acute respiratory infections. All these viruses recognize target cells by binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on spike protein with receptors. This study aimed to determine the SARS-CoV-2 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV genome structure spike protein sequence differences and variations of RBDS receptor binding motif (RBM). This research was using data mining approach. Genome sequences were downloaded from NCBI except for Indonesian samples were downloaded from GISAID. Genomic structures spike sequence and RBD structure were analyzed using Bioedit followed by protein modelling using Swissmodel and Pymol applications. The result showed that the SARS-CoV-2 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV genome shared the same genes yet in different numbers and length. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence was quite similar to SARS-CoV spike protein but very different to the spike protein of MERS-CoV. There were variations of RBDS RBM structure due to the mutations occurred among these viruses. It is suggested that these differences may increase the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to its hace2 receptor which caused SARS-CoV-2 becomes more infective and spread wider than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in turn.

191879,Face masks against the background of the COVID 19 pandemic: legal considerations about their use.,2021-05-07,"Recipient airway epithelial cells are found in human sex-mismatched lung transplants, implying that circulating progenitor epithelial cells contribute to the repair of the airway epithelium. Markers of circulating progenitor epithelial cells and mechanisms for their trafficking remain to be elucidated. We demonstrate that a population of progenitor epithelial cells exists in the bone marrow and the circulation of mice that is positive for the early epithelial marker cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. We used a mouse model of sex-mismatched tracheal transplantation and found that CK5+ circulating progenitor epithelial cells contribute to re-epithelialization of the airway and re-establishment of the pseudostratified epithelium. The presence of CXCL12 in tracheal transplants provided a mechanism for CXCR4+ circulating progenitor epithelial cell recruitment to the airway. Depletion of CXCL12 resulted in the epithelium defaulting to squamous metaplasia, which was derived solely from the resident tissue progenitor epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that CK5+CXCR4+ cells are markers of circulating progenitor epithelial cells in the bone marrow and circulation and that CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated recruitment of circulating progenitor epithelial cells is necessary for the re-establishment of a normal pseudostratified epithelium after airway injury. These findings support a novel paradigm for the development of squamous metaplasia of the airway epithelium and for developing therapeutic strategies for circulating progenitor epithelial cells in airway diseases.","Gomperts, Brigitte N; Belperio, John A; Rao, P Nagesh; Randell, Scott H; Fishbein, Michael C; Burdick, Marie D; Strieter, Robert M",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424223/,888
195577,[Effect of life style interventions over quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors].,2019,"Several arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus, cause severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. No licensed vaccines are available in the United States, and currently there is no efficacious therapy to treat this viral infection. Therefore the importance of developing effective antiviral approaches to combat pathogenic arenaviruses is clear. Moreover, the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an important model for the study of viral persistence and associated diseases, as well as for exploring therapies to treat viral chronic infections. The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for the study of gene function. In addition, the successful use of siRNAs to target a variety of animal viruses has led us to consider RNAi as a potential novel antiviral strategy. We have investigated the use of RNAi therapy against LCMV. Here, we show that siRNAs targeting sequences within the viral L polymerase and Z mRNAs inhibit LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, the antiviral efficacy of RNAi-based therapy against LCMV was highly dependent on the method used to deliver effector siRNA molecules. Thus, transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA pools to L and Z was ineffective in preventing virus multiplication. In contrast, targeting of the same viral L and Z gene products with siRNAs produced inside cells using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system inhibited LCMV multiplication very efficiently. Notably, transduction with the replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system to Z and L effectively cured persistently LCMV-infected cells, suggesting the feasibility of using RNAi therapy to combat viral chronic infections by riboviruses.","Sánchez, Ana B; Perez, Mar; Cornu, Tatjana; de la Torre, Juan Carlos",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103158/,888

In dentistry, airborne particles are produced through aerosolization facilitated by dental instruments. To develop methods for reducing the risks of infection in a confined environment, understanding the nature and dynamics of these droplets is imperative and timely. This study provides the first evidence of aerosol droplet formation from an ultrasonic scalar under simulated oral conditions. State-of-the-art optical flow tracking velocimetry and shadowgraphy measurements are employed to quantitatively measure the flow velocity, trajectories and size distribution of droplets produced during a dental scaling process. The droplet sizes are found to vary from 5 µm to 300 µm; these correspond to droplet nuclei that could carry viruses. The droplet velocities also vary between 1.3 m s-1 and 2.6 m s-1. These observations confirm the critical role of aerosols in the transmission of disease during dental procedures, and provide invaluable knowledge for developing protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of both dentists and patients.","Mirbod, Parisa; Haffner, Eileen A; Bagheri, Maryam; Higham, Jonathan E",J R Soc Interface,,888

Given operational risk loss data within a time window, short-term projections are made using Loess fits to sequences of lognormal parameters. The projections can be scaled by a sequence of risk factors, derived from economic data in response to international regulatory requirements. Historic and projected loss data are combined using a lengthy nonlinear algorithm to calculate a capital reserve for the upcoming year. The model is embedded in a general framework, in which arrays of risk factors can be swapped in and out to assess their effect on the projected losses. Risk factor scaling is varied to assess the resilience and stability of financial institutions to economic shock. Symbolic analysis of projected losses shows that they are well-conditioned with respect to risk factors. Specific reference is made to the effect of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. For a 1-year projection, the framework indicates a requirement for an increase in regulatory capital of approximately 3% for mild stress, 8% for moderate stress, and 32% for extreme stress. The proposed framework is significant because it is the first formal methodology to link financial risk with economic factors in an objective way without recourse to correlations.","Mitic, Peter",Mathematical &amp; Computational Applications,,888

306903,Tratamento De Covid-19 Com Plasma Convalescente: Relato De Caso,2020,"The interactions of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) present on the cell surface with target proteins lead to cell signaling and they are considered as viral receptors. The analysis of the recognition mechanism between HSPG and its potential ligands and high-throughput screening in drug discovery thus remain important challenges. Glycidyl methacrylate-based monoliths were thus prepared in situ in miniaturized capillary columns (internal diameter 75 µm) and HSPG was grafted onto them by the use of the Schiff base method. The quantity of grafted HSPG was in the nanogram range (11 nanograms per cm of capillary length). This is of significant importance when working with less available or expensive biological material. Other advantages of our miniaturized capillary column are as follows: (i) the immobilization process of HSPG onto the organic monolithic support was reliable and reproducible. (ii) The resultant affinity capillary column showed a strong resistance to changes in temperature and pH and a negligible non-specific interaction. So as to confirm the proper functioning of our miniaturized capillary column, the molecular recognition by HSPG of five selected compounds including three ligands of interest related to SARS-CoV-2 was studied.","André, Claire; Guillaume, Yves Claude",Anal Methods,,888

We prospectively recruited HCWs from a university hospital in Turkey. Serum samples from 1072 HCWs were obtained following 28 days of the first, and 21 days of the second dose. Detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antispike antibodies were performed by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant; Abbott). Results greater than or equal to the cutoff value 50.0 AU/ml were reported as positive. After the first dose, antispike antibodies were detected in 834 of 1072 (77.8%) HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among females (84.6%) than males (70.6%) (p < 0.001) and was found to be highest in both women and men between the ages of 18-34. After the second dose, antibodies were detected in 1008 of 1012 (99.6%) HCWs. Antibody titers were significantly higher in those who had coronavirus disease-2019 before vaccination than those who did not (p < 0.001). Antibody positivity and median antibody titers were significantly less in HCWs with chronic diseases compared to those without (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicated that a relatively high frequency (99.6%) of humoral immunity was produced in HCWs aged 18-59 after two doses of CoronaVac. Quantitation of antibodies may help facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response, which will be especially useful in deciding the dose of the vaccine in vulnerable groups such as those over 60 years of age and those with chronic diseases.","Bayram, Aysen; Demirbakan, Hadiye; Günel Karadeniz, Pinar; Erdogan, Merve; Koçer, Ipek",J Med Virol,,888

Timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention for such patients may improve their prognoses. However, its relative effectiveness has not been proved. Therefore, this study is purposed to determine the effect of respiratory rehabilitation on elderly patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study will search the following electronic databases: Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, China national knowledge infrastructure database, Wan Fang database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, with the retrieval period running from their inception to August 2020. All randomized controlled trials of respiratory rehabilitation training on elderly patients with COVID-19 are collected, and the data are selected and extracted independently according to the pre-designed inclusion/exclusion criteria. Cochrane bias risk assessment tool is used to evaluate the method quality and bias risk. All data analyses will be implemented by using Revman5.3 and Stata14 software. RESULTS: This study will make a high-quality and comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of respiratory rehabilitation training on elderly patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The conclusions of this systematic review will deliver more convincing evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The private information collected from individuals will not be published. And this systematic review will also not involve impairing the participants' rights. Ethical approval is not required.

There are few studies that relate the attendance of children at the PC to the pandemic of COVID-19. The aim of our study is to describe the impact of the two Spanish states of alarm on the care of children at de PC level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study. The PC visits corresponding to pediatric patients (<14 years) from a health area in northern Spain during the first and second states of alarm were analyzed, and compared with their equivalent periods in 2019. RESULTS: During the first state of alarm, home lockdown and school closure were established, and a large decrease in pediatric visits to the health centres was observed (758 vs. 1381 in 2019) at the expense of health check-ups and infectious diseases. This decrease was not observed in the second state of alarm (1375 vs. 1233 in 2019). In both states of alarm, the percentage of telephone assistance increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of alarm states has meant a decrease on the demand of medical care, especially during the first state of alarm, may be owing to the fear of the families of going to the health center and the decrease in the transmissibility of viruses due to home lockdown. The increase of the telematic assistance has been on account of the need of reorganization of health care, wich has proven to be effective.","Laso-Alonso, A E; Mata-Zubillaga, D; González-García, L G; Rodríguez-Manchón, S; Corral-Hospital, S; García-Aparicio, C","SEMERGEN, Soc.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical characteristics, reperfusion therapy modalities, COVID-19 status and in-hospital mortality of consecutive STEMI patients who were admitted to Belgian hospitals for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were recorded during a three-week period starting at the beginning of the lockdown period on 13 March 2020. Similar data were collected for the same time period for 2017-2019. An evaluation of air quality revealed a 32% decrease in ambient NO2 concentrations during lockdown (19.5 µg/m³ versus 13.2 µg/m³, p < .001). During the three-week period, there were 188 STEMI patients admitted for PCI during the lockdown versus an average 254 STEMI patients before the lockdown period (incidence rate ratio = 0.74, p = .001). Reperfusion strategy was predominantly primary PCI in both time periods (96% versus 95%). However, there was a significant delay in treatment during the lockdown period, with more late presentations (>12 h after onset of pain) (14% versus 7.6%, p = .04) and with longer door-to-balloon times (median of 45 versus 39 min, p = .02). Although the in-hospital mortality between the two periods was comparable (5.9% versus 6.7%), 5 of the 7 (71%) COVID-19-positive STEMI patients died. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a 26% reduction in STEMI admissions and a delay in treatment of STEMI patients. Less exposure to external STEMI triggers (such as ambient air pollution) and/or reluctance to seek medical care are possible explanations of this observation.","Claeys, Marc J; Argacha, Jean-François; Collart, Philippe; Carlier, Marc; Van Caenegem, Olivier; Sinnaeve, Peter R; Desmet, Walter; Dubois, Philippe; Stammen, Francis; Gevaert, Sofie; Pourbaix, Suzanne; Coussement, Patrick; Beauloye, Christophe; Evrard, Patrick; Brasseur, Olivier; Fierens, Frans; Marechal, Patrick; Schelfaut, Dan; Floré, Vincent; Hanet, Claude",Acta Cardiol,,888

To our knowledge, no study has examined the association between NSAID use and the risk of COVID-19-related outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using South Korea's nationwide healthcare database, which contains data of all subjects who received a test for COVID-19 (n=69,793) as of April 8, 2020. We identified adults hospitalized with COVID-19, where cohort entry was the date of hospitalization. NSAIDs users were those prescribed NSAIDs in the 7 days before and including cohort entry and non-users were those not prescribed NSAIDs during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular complications and acute renal failure. We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize confounding. RESULTS: Of 1,824 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 49.0 years; female 59%), 354 were NSAIDs users and 1,470 were non-users. Compared with non-use, NSAIDs use was associated with increased risks of the primary composite outcome (OR 1.54 [95% CI 1.13-2.11]) but insignificantly associated with cardiovascular complications (1.54 [0.96-2.48]) or acute renal failure (1.45 [0.49-4.14]). CONCLUSION: While awaiting the results of confirmatory studies, we suggest NSAIDs be used with caution among patients with COVID-19 as the harms associated with their use may outweigh their benefits in this population.","Jeong, Han Eol; Lee, Hyesung; Shin, Hyun Joon; Choe, Young June; Filion, Kristian B; Shin, Ju-Young",Clin. infect. dis,,888

430164,Imunopatologia Da Infecção Por Sars-cov-2 Em Pacientes Onco-hematológicos,2020,"Researchers often use theoretical models which provide a relatively simple, yet concise and effective way of modelling various phenomena. However, it is a well-known fact that the more complex the model, the more complex the mathematical description is. For this reason, theoretical models generally avoid large complexity and aim for the simplest possible definition, which although makes models mathematically more manageable, in practice it also often leads to sub-optimal performance. Furthermore, the data collected during the observations usually contain confounding factors, for which a simple theoretical model can not be prepared. Overall, mathematical models are usually too rigid and sophisticated, and therefore cannot really deal with sudden changes in the environment. The application of artificial intelligence, however, provides a good opportunity to develop complex models that can combine the basic capabilities of the theoretical models with the ability to learn more complex relationships. It has been shown [16] that with neural networks, we can build such models that can approximate mathematical functions. Trained artificial neural networks are thus able to behave like theoretical models developed for different fields, while still retaining their overall flexibility, which guarantees an overall better performance in a complex real-world environment. The aim of our study is to show our notion that we can create an architecture using neural networks, which is able to approximate a given theoretical model, and then further improve it with the help of real data to suit the real world and its various aspects better. In order to validate the functionality of the architecture developed by us, we have selected a simple theoretical model, namely the Kermack-McKendrick one [4] as the base of our research. This is an SIR [2] model, which is a relatively simple compartmental epidemic model, based on differential equations that can be used well for infections that spread very similarly to influenza or COVID. However, on one hand, the SIR model relies too heavily on its parameters, with slight changes in them leading to drastic overall changes of the S, I and R curves, and on the other hand, the simplicity of the SIR model distorts its accuracy in many cases. In our paper, by using the SIR model, we will show that the architecture described above can be a valid approach to modeling the spread of a given disease (such as influenza or COVID-19). To this end, we detail the accuracy of our models with different settings and configurations and show that it performs better than both a simple mathematical model and a plain neural network with randomly initialized weights.","Bogacsovics, G.; Hajdu, A.; Lakatos, R.; Beregi-Kovacs, M.; Tiba, A.; Toman, H.",Annales Mathematicae Et Informaticae,,888

The fact that the COVID-19 cases and mortalities are reported in globally and the WHO has declared this outbreak as the pandemic. The international health authorities have focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as search for therapies able to counter the disease severity. Due to the lack of known specific, effective and proven therapies as well as the situation of public-health emergency, drug repurposing appears to be the best armour to find therapeutic solution against 2019-nCoV infection. Repurposing anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine (CQ)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy to inhibit most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus.

With more than 1,000,000 infections around the world, SARS-Cov 2 is responsible for the most severe healthcare crisis in the last 100 years. Aim. The paper analyzes the impact of COVID 19 pandemic upon the current ophthalmological clinical activity. Materials and Method. A comparative analyses was carried regarding the clinical activity in March 2019 and March 2020: the number of one day hospitalizations, of continuous hospitalizations, the percentage of emergencies, the number of surgeries, bed turn over, mean hospital stay. The protocols for the health care personnel protection and decontamination were analyzed. Results. During March 2019, 381 patients were treated in the day hospitalization and 297 patients in the continuous hospitalization regime, with an average length of hospitalization of 3.2 days, and a bed turnover of 6.05. Of these, 76.43% underwent ophthalmic surgery and 14.1% represented ophthalmological emergencies. The comparative analysis shows that in March 2020, the number of one day hospitalizations decreased by 87.4%, and that of the hospitalizations continued with 89.2%. Of the patients admitted, 46.8% were in emergency. Clinical ophthalmological practice has been deeply changed in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic in order to prevent contamination both for patients and medical personnel. Conclusions. The ocular manifestations associated to SARS-Cov 2 infection are self-limited, but the possibility of infection due to the presence of the virus at the level of the tear secretion is an aspect that we must consider in the ophthalmological clinical practice.","Dascalu, Ana-Maria; Tudosie, Mihail Silviu; Smarandache, Gabriel Catalin; Serban, Dragos",Rom.

The rise of environmental concerns and the wish for more cooperation between scientists within Europe, plus the drive of a few highly motivated people, led to the foundation of this academic institution. This article aims at clarifying the initial steps and the development of this highly successful association. The relationship between economics and the environment is core for the future of our world, and the EAERE was crucial in developing this field. The EAERE has been a stimulus and a home for many scientists who were interested to work in this field and who would otherwise have been quite isolated. The future of the EAERE is bright if it manages to bridge new developments in economics and in the natural sciences, and between academics and policy.","de Zeeuw, Aart",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,888

The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the key protein used by SARS-CoV-2 for host cell entry. In their recent work, Lindskog and colleagues (Hikmet et al, 2020) report that ACE2 is expressed at very low protein levels-if at all-in respiratory epithelial cells. Severe COVID-19, however, is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome and extensive damage to the alveoli in the lung parenchyma. Then, what is the role of the airway epithelium in the early stages of COVID-19, and which cells need to be studied to characterize the biological mechanisms responsible for the progression to severe disease after initial infection by the novel coronavirus?","Nawijn, Martijn C; Timens, Wim",Mol Syst Biol,,888

Based on the analysis of complex networks and visibility graph theory, a new time series forecasting method is proposed. In time series analysis, visibility graph theory transforms time series data into a network model. In the network model, the node similarity index is an important factor. On the basis of directly using the node prediction method with the largest similarity, the node similarity index is used as the weight coefficient to optimize the prediction algorithm. Compared with the single-node sampling node prediction algorithm, the multi-node sampling prediction algorithm can provide more accurate prediction values when the data set is sufficient. According to results of experiments on four real-world representative datasets, the method has more accurate forecasting ability and can provide more accurate forecasts in the field of time series and actual scenes.","Zhan, Tianxiang; Xiao, Fuyuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13870v5.pdf,888
524270,Infecção Por Sars-cov-2 Na Doença Falciforme – Relato Da Experiência Em Um Centro De Referência No Brasil,2020,"Lack of microbial contamination is of great significance to drinking water safety and water reclamation. In this work, foam fractionation was employed to remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) from aqueous solution and dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS12) was used as the collector. Since the attachment of strain cells on the bubble surface would impede the reflux of interstitial liquid in the plateau borders (PBs), a novel strategy in strengthening foam drainage was developed through artificially inducing foam evolution. Two gas distributors with different pore diameters had been mounted at the bottom of the column for regulating the radial distribution of bubble size in the foam phase. Experimental results indicated that gas diffuse and bubble coarsening could be significantly promoted by increasing the size difference among the adjacent bubbles. Bubble coalescence contributed to broadening the width of plateau borders, thereby avoiding the borders blockage by strain cells. During bubble coalescence, surfactant molecules would be partially shifted from the surface of small bubble towards that of large bubble due to the molecule density difference. The increase in surface excess of surfactant molecules on gas-liquid interface was conducive to improving foam stability. Under the suitable conditions of air flow rates of gas distributor with 0.125 mm of pore diameter 75 mL/min and gas distributor with 0.425 mm of pore diameter 125 mL/min, BS12 concentration 0.1 g/L, and P. aeruginosa concentration 2.0 × 104 CFU/mL, the removal percentage and enrichment ratio of P. aeruginosa were 99.6% and 10.6, respectively. This work is expected to provide some new light for strengthening foam drainage in the presence of solid particles and to facilitate the industrialization of foam fractionation in water treatment.","Jia, Lei; Liu, Wei; Cao, Jilin; Wu, Zhaoliang; Yang, Chunyan",J Environ Manage,,888

The proper attribution of deaths to this pandemic has a range of societal, legal, mortuary, and public health consequences. This article discusses the current difficulties of disaster death attribution and describes the strengths and limitations of relying on death counts from death certificates, estimations of indirect deaths, and estimations of excess mortality. Improving the tabulation of direct and indirect deaths on death certificates will require concerted efforts and consensus across medical institutions and public health agencies. In addition, actionable estimates of excess mortality will require timely access to standardized and structured vital registry data, which should be shared directly at the state level to ensure rapid response for local governments. Correct attribution of direct and indirect deaths and estimation of excess mortality are complementary goals that are critical to our understanding of the pandemic and its effect on human life.","Kiang, Mathew V.; Irizarry, Rafael A.; Buckee, Caroline O.; Balsari, Satchit",Ann Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.7326/m20-3100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915654/,888

Epicatechins derivatives, determined by RP-HPLC/PDAD, presented higher values in GTs with respect to WTs, decreasing as follows: epigallocatechin-3-gallate > epicatechin-3-gallate ≫ epicatechin ≫ epigallocatechin, and higher values in summer and early autumn than in spring. This was also accompanied by an in consistent withering time pattern. Esterified catechins were higher in all samples (100.8–312.3 mg/g) with respect to non-esterified catechins (15.1–37.7 mg/g). Caffeine (6.2–27.7 mg/g) decreased as follows: WTs > GTs ≫ Fl, and inconsistent seasonal and withering patterns were observed among the WTs. Total phenolics (125.9–295.4 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dried extract) and total flavonoids (35.2–69.7 mg rutin equivalents/g dried extract), determined by Folin–Ciocalteu and colorimetric methodologies, were higher in GTs than in WTs and Fl. Concerning the antioxidant patterns, the free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) presented EC(50) values ranges from 3.6 to 17.3 µg/mL and 4.8 to 16.5 µg/mL, respectively, and ferrous ion-chelating (FIC) activity ranged from 47.1 to 82.8%, highlighting that FRSA was better than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Tea leaves exhibited, in general, higher activities with respect to tea Fl, and the WT sample plucked in summer and withered for 23 h showed the highest FRAP and FIC activity. In conclusion, this study shows the characteristic variation of GTs, WTs, and Fl of two tea varieties and may support crop quality improvement and promote the valorization of tea Fl.","Paiva, Lisete; Rego, Clara; Lima, Elisabete; Marcone, Massimo; Baptista, José",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10020183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514043/,888
