306,306,306,Peptide-Mediated Cellular Delivery of Oligonucleotide-Based Therapeutics In Vitro: Quantitative Evaluation of Overall Efficacy Employing Easy to Handle Reporter Systems,13.711473,6.72636,2008-12-11,"Cellular uptake of therapeutic oligonucleotides and subsequent intracellular trafficking to their target sites represents the major technical hurdle for the biological effectiveness of these potential drugs. Accordingly, laboratories worldwide focus on the development of suitable delivery systems. Among the different available non-viral systems like cationic polymers, cationic liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) represent an attractive concept to bypass the problem of poor membrane permeability of these charged macromolecules. While uptake per se in most cases does not represent the main obstacle of nucleic acid delivery in vitro, it becomes increasingly apparent that intracellular trafficking is the bottleneck. As a consequence, in order to optimize a given delivery system, a side-by-side analysis of nucleic acid cargo internalized and the corresponding biological effect is required to determine the overall efficacy. In this review, we will concentrate on peptide-mediated delivery of siRNAs and steric block oligonucleotides and discuss different methods for quantitative assessment of the amount of cargo taken up and how to correlate those numbers with biological effects by applying easy to handle reporter systems. To illustrate current limitations of non-viral nucleic acid delivery systems, we present own data as an example and discuss options of how to enhance trafficking of molecules entrapped in cellular compartments.","Laufer, S.D; Restle, T",Curr Pharm Des,143,1
598,598,598,Geometry and Adhesion of Extracellular Domains of DC-SIGNR Neck Length Variants Analyzed by Force–Distance Measurements,13.694406,6.1507916,2011-06-08,"[Image: see text] Force–distance measurements have been used to examine differences in the interaction of the dendritic cell glycan-binding receptor DC-SIGN and the closely related endothelial cell receptor DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN) with membranes bearing glycan ligands. The results demonstrate that upon binding to membrane-anchored ligand, DC-SIGNR undergoes a conformational change similar to that previously observed for DC-SIGN. The results also validate a model for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR derived from crystallographic studies. Force measurements were performed with DC-SIGNR variants that differ in the length of the neck that result from genetic polymorphisms, which encode different numbers of the 23-amino acid repeat sequences that constitute the neck. The findings are consistent with an elongated, relatively rigid structure of the neck repeat observed in crystals. In addition, differences in the lengths of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains with equivalent numbers of neck repeats support a model in which the different dispositions of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR result from variations in the sequences of the necks.","Leckband, Deborah E.; Menon, Sindhu; Rosenberg, Kenneth; Graham, Sarah A.; Taylor, Maureen E.; Drickamer, Kurt",Biochemistry,143,1
668,668,668,"In China, Students in Crowded Dormitories with a Low Ventilation Rate Have More Common Colds: Evidence for Airborne Transmission",13.610921,6.4116874,2011-11-16,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether the incidence of common colds among college students in China is associated with ventilation rates and crowdedness in dormitories. METHODS: In Phase I of the study, a cross-sectional study, 3712 students living in 1569 dorm rooms in 13 buildings responded to a questionnaire about incidence and duration of common colds in the previous 12 months. In Phase II, air temperature, relative humidity and CO(2) concentration were measured for 24 hours in 238 dorm rooms in 13 buildings, during both summer and winter. Out-to indoor air flow rates at night were calculated based on measured CO(2) concentrations. RESULTS: In Phase I, 10% of college students reported an incidence of more than 6 common colds in the previous 12 months, and 15% reported that each infection usually lasted for more than 2 weeks. Students in 6-person dorm rooms were about 2 times as likely to have an incidence of common colds ≥6 times per year and a duration ≥2 weeks, compared to students in 3-person rooms. In Phase II, 90% of the measured dorm rooms had an out-to indoor air flow rate less than the Chinese standard of 8.3 L/s per person during the heating season. There was a dose-response relationship between out-to indoor air flow rate per person in dorm rooms and the proportion of occupants with annual common cold infections ≥6 times. A mean ventilation rate of 5 L/(s•person) in dorm buildings was associated with 5% of self reported common cold ≥6 times, compared to 35% at 1 L/(s•person). CONCLUSION: Crowded dormitories with low out-to indoor airflow rates are associated with more respiratory infections among college students.","Sun, Yuexia; Wang, Zhigang; Zhang, Yufeng; Sundell, Jan",PLoS One,143,1

However, the potential of such data can only be harnessed using a number of different, complementary approaches and tools, and a unified platform for the analysis of disease outbreaks is still lacking. In this paper, we present the new R package OutbreakTools, which aims to provide a basis for outbreak data management and analysis in R. OutbreakTools is developed by a community of epidemiologists, statisticians, modellers and bioinformaticians, and implements classes and methods for storing, handling and visualizing outbreak data. It includes real and simulated outbreak datasets. Together with a number of tools for infectious disease epidemiology recently made available in R, OutbreakTools contributes to the emergence of a new, free and open-source platform for the analysis of disease outbreaks.","Jombart, Thibaut; Aanensen, David M.; Baguelin, Marc; Birrell, Paul; Cauchemez, Simon; Camacho, Anton; Colijn, Caroline; Collins, Caitlin; Cori, Anne; Didelot, Xavier; Fraser, Christophe; Frost, Simon; Hens, Niel; Hugues, Joseph; Höhle, Michael; Opatowski, Lulla; Rambaut, Andrew; Ratmann, Oliver; Soubeyrand, Samuel; Suchard, Marc A.; Wallinga, Jacco; Ypma, Rolf; Ferguson, Neil",Epidemics,143,17
1666,1666,1666,"Emergence of travel: Associated dengue fever in a non-endemic, hilly state",13.910051,6.474789,2014-11-29,"BACKGROUND: We assessed the occurrence of dengue fever in association with travel in a non-endemic hilly region. The clinical presentation and laboratory parameters of febrile patients with a travel history to an endemic region were studied, and the role of the laboratory in the diagnosis was affirmed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Febrile patients presenting with clinical features defining dengue with a history of travel to an endemic area constituted the study group. Serum samples were tested for dengue-specific NS1 antigen and IgM, IgG antibodies. The demographic data were retrieved from the hospital information system. A hematological and biochemical workup was done and the results analyzed using percentage, proportion, mean, and median. RESULTS: Out of 189 febrile patients, 58 were reactive to serological tests for dengue, with 47 (81%) males. The presenting features were chills and rigors, myalgia, cough, sweating, and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia (74.35%), lymphopenia (52.94%), and leucopenia (47.05%) were present in early disease, with AST >34 IU/L in 58.97% of the patients. The NS1 antigen was detectable between three and seven days of fever and the IgM antibodies after five days. The positivities to only NS1, both NS1 and IgM, and IgM alone were 60.34, 27.58, and 10.34%, respectively, and the median duration of fever was five, seven, and ten days, respectively. One case of dengue hemorrhagic fever and one of probable secondary dengue infection with detectable IgG were encountered. CONCLUSION: Dengue fever remains unsuspected in febrile cases in non-endemic regions. History of travel is an essential criterion to suspect dengue. A non-specific clinical presentation eludes diagnosis. Serological tests for antigen and antibodies, and hematological and biochemical markers are vital for distinguishing the diagnosis.","Verma, Santwana; Kanga, Anil; Singh, Digvijay; Verma, Ghanshyam K; Mokta, Kiran; Ganju, Sunite A; Sharma, Vineeta",Adv Biomed Res,143,1

As the focus now shifts from characterizing genomes to making personalized disease associations, in combination with the availability of other omics technologies, the next big push will be not only to obtain a personalized genome, but to quantitatively follow other omics. This will include transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, antibodyomes, and new emerging technologies, enabling the profiling of thousands of molecular components in individuals. Furthermore, omics profiling performed longitudinally can probe the temporal patterns associated with both molecular changes and associated physiological health and disease states. Such data necessitates the development of computational methodology to not only handle and descriptively assess such data, but also construct quantitative biological models. Here we describe the availability of personal genomes and developing omics technologies that can be brought together for personalized implementations and how these novel integrated approaches may effectively provide a precise personalized medicine that focuses on not only characterization and treatment but ultimately the prevention of disease.","Mias, George I.; Snyder, Michael",Quantitative Biology,143,19

2646,2646,2646,Ambra1 spatially regulates Src activity and Src/FAK-mediated cancer cell invasion via trafficking networks,13.908459,6.654011,2017-03-31,"Here, using mouse squamous cell carcinoma cells, we report a completely new function for the autophagy protein Ambra1 as the first described ‘spatial rheostat’ controlling the Src/FAK pathway. Ambra1 regulates the targeting of active phospho-Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that cancer cells use to survive adhesion stress. Ambra1 binds to both FAK and Src in cancer cells. When FAK is present, Ambra1 is recruited to focal adhesions, promoting FAK-regulated cancer cell direction-sensing and invasion. However, when Ambra1 cannot bind to FAK, abnormally high levels of phospho-Src and phospho-FAK accumulate at focal adhesions, positively regulating adhesion and invasive migration. Spatial control of active Src requires the trafficking proteins Dynactin one and IFITM3, which we identified as Ambra1 binding partners by interaction proteomics. We conclude that Ambra1 is a core component of an intracellular trafficking network linked to tight spatial control of active Src and FAK levels, and so crucially regulates their cancer-associated biological outputs.

2693,2693,2693,Animal models to improve our understanding and treatment of suicidal behavior,13.899901,6.489397,2017-04-11,"Worldwide, suicide is a leading cause of death. Although a sizable proportion of deaths by suicide may be preventable, it is well documented that despite major governmental and international investments in research, education and clinical practice suicide rates have not diminished and are even increasing among several at-risk populations. Although nonhuman animals do not engage in suicidal behavior amenable to translational studies, we argue that animal model systems are necessary to investigate candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behavior and the neurobiology underlying these endophenotypes. Animal models are similarly a critical resource to help delineate treatment targets and pharmacological means to improve our ability to manage the risk of suicide. In particular, certain pathophysiological pathways to suicidal behavior, including stress and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction, neurotransmitter system abnormalities, endocrine and neuroimmune changes, aggression, impulsivity and decision-making deficits, as well as the role of critical interactions between genetic and epigenetic factors, development and environmental risk factors can be modeled in laboratory animals. We broadly describe human biological findings, as well as protective effects of medications such as lithium, clozapine, and ketamine associated with modifying risk of engaging in suicidal behavior that are readily translatable to animal models. Endophenotypes of suicidal behavior, studied in animal models, are further useful for moving observed associations with harmful environmental factors (for example, childhood adversity, mechanical trauma aeroallergens, pathogens, inflammation triggers) from association to causation, and developing preventative strategies. Further study in animals will contribute to a more informed, comprehensive, accelerated and ultimately impactful suicide research portfolio.","Gould, T D; Georgiou, P; Brenner, L A; Brundin, L; Can, A; Courtet, P; Donaldson, Z R; Dwivedi, Y; Guillaume, S; Gottesman, I I; Kanekar, S; Lowry, C A; Renshaw, P F; Rujescu, D; Smith, E G; Turecki, G; Zanos, P; Zarate, C A; Zunszain, P A; Postolache, T T",Transl Psychiatry,143,1

Charonia species have large salivary glands (SGs) that are suspected to produce either a venom and/or sulphuric acid which can immobilize their prey and neutralize the intrinsic toxic properties of COTS. To date, there is little information on the types of toxins produced by tritons. In this paper, the predatory behaviour of the C. tritonis is described. Then, the C. tritonis SG, which itself is made up of an anterior lobe (AL) and posterior lobe (PL), was analyzed using an integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approach, to identify putative toxin- and feeding-related proteins. A de novo transcriptome database and in silico protein analysis predicts that ~3800 proteins have features consistent with being secreted. A gland-specific proteomics analysis confirmed the presence of numerous SG-AL and SG-PL proteins, including those with similarity to cysteine-rich venom proteins. Sulfuric acid biosynthesis enzymes were identified, specific to the SG-PL. Our analysis of the C. tritonis SG (AL and PL) has provided a deeper insight into the biomolecular toolkit used for predation and feeding by C. tritonis.","Bose, U.; Wang, T.; Zhao, M.; Motti, C.

3118,3118,3118,Skipping Multiple Exons to Treat DMD—Promises and Challenges,13.5411215,6.4033465,2018-01-02,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Antisense-mediated exon-skipping is a promising therapeutic strategy that makes use of synthetic nucleic acids to skip frame-disrupting exon(s) and allows for short but functional protein expression by restoring the reading frame. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved eteplirsen, which skips DMD exon 51 and is applicable to approximately 13% of DMD patients. Multiple exon skipping, which is theoretically applicable to 80–90% of DMD patients in total, have been demonstrated in animal models, including dystrophic mice and dogs, using cocktail antisense oligonucleotides (AOs). Although promising, current drug approval systems pose challenges for the use of a cocktail AO. For example, both exons 6 and 8 need to be skipped to restore the reading frame in dystrophic dogs. Therefore, the cocktail of AOs targeting these exons has a combined therapeutic effect and each AO does not have a therapeutic effect by itself. The current drug approval system is not designed to evaluate such circumstances, which are completely different from cocktail drug approaches in other fields. Significant changes are needed in the drug approval process to promote the cocktail AO approach.","Aslesh, Tejal; Maruyama, Rika; Yokota, Toshifumi",Biomedicines,143,1

3378,3378,3378,Population level mitogenomics of long-lived bats reveals dynamic heteroplasmy and challenges the Free Radical Theory of Ageing,13.561693,6.4208984,2018-09-11,"Bats are the only mammals capable of true, powered flight, which drives an extremely high metabolic rate. The “Free Radical Theory of Ageing” (FTRA) posits that a high metabolic rate causes mitochondrial heteroplasmy and the progressive ageing phenotype. Contrary to this, bats are the longest-lived order of mammals given their small size and high metabolic rate. To investigate if bats exhibit increased mitochondrial heteroplasmy with age, we performed targeted, deep sequencing of mitogenomes and measured point heteroplasmy in wild, long lived Myotis myotis. Blood was sampled from 195 individuals, aged between <1 and at 6+ years old, and whole mitochondria deep-sequenced, with a subset sampled over multiple years. The majority of heteroplasmies were at a low frequency and were transitions. Oxidative mutations were present in only a small number of individuals, suggesting local oxidative stress events. Cohort data showed no significant increase in heteroplasmy with age, while longitudinal data from recaptured individuals showed heteroplasmy is dynamic, and does not increase uniformly over time. We show that bats do not suffer from the predicted, inevitable increase in heteroplasmy as posited by the FRTA, instead heteroplasmy was found to be dynamic, questioning its presumed role as a primary driver of ageing.","Jebb, David; Foley, Nicole M.; Whelan, Conor V.; Touzalin, Frédéric; Puechmaille, Sebastien J.; Teeling, Emma C.",Sci Rep,143,1

Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence—measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak—helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.","Kim, Louis; Fast, Shannon M.; Markuzon, Natasha",PLoS One,143,17
3760,3760,3760,Targeted NGS Platforms for Genetic Screening and Gene Discovery in Primary Immunodeficiencies,13.58142,6.544066,2019-04-11,"Background: Primary Immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic immune disorders. While some PIDs can manifest with more than one phenotype, signs, and symptoms of various PIDs overlap considerably. Recently, novel defects in immune-related genes and additional variants in previously reported genes responsible for PIDs have been successfully identified by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), allowing the recognition of a broad spectrum of disorders. Objective: To evaluate the strength and weakness of targeted NGS sequencing using custom-made Ion Torrent and Haloplex (Agilent) panels for diagnostics and research purposes. Methods: Five different panels including known and candidate genes were used to screen 105 patients with distinct PID features divided in three main PID categories: T cell defects, Humoral defects and Other PIDs. The Ion Torrent sequencing platform was used in 73 patients. Among these, 18 selected patients without a molecular diagnosis and 32 additional patients were analyzed by Haloplex enrichment technology. Results: The complementary use of the two custom-made targeted sequencing approaches allowed the identification of causative variants in 28.6% (n = 30) of patients. Twenty-two out of 73 (34.6%) patients were diagnosed by Ion Torrent. In this group 20 were included in the SCID/CID category. Eight out of 50 (16%) patients were diagnosed by Haloplex workflow. Ion Torrent method was highly successful for those cases with well-defined phenotypes for immunological and clinical presentation. The Haloplex approach was able to diagnose 4 SCID/CID patients and 4 additional patients with complex and extended phenotypes, embracing all three PID categories in which this approach was more efficient. Both technologies showed good gene coverage. Conclusions: NGS technology represents a powerful approach in the complex field of rare disorders but its different application should be weighted. A relatively small NGS target panel can be successfully applied for a robust diagnostic suspicion, while when the spectrum of clinical phenotypes overlaps more than one PID an in-depth NGS analysis is required, including also whole exome/genome sequencing to identify the causative gene.","Cifaldi, Cristina; Brigida, Immacolata; Barzaghi, Federica; Zoccolillo, Matteo; Ferradini, Valentina; Petricone, Davide; Cicalese, Maria Pia; Lazarevic, Dejan; Cittaro, Davide; Omrani, Maryam; Attardi, Enrico; Conti, Francesca; Scarselli, Alessia; Chiriaco, Maria; Di Cesare, Silvia; Licciardi, Francesco; Davide, Montin; Ferrua, Francesca; Canessa, Clementina; Pignata, Claudio; Giliani, Silvia; Ferrari, Simona; Fousteri, Georgia; Barera, Graziano; Merli, Pietro; Palma, Paolo; Cesaro, Simone; Gattorno, Marco; Trizzino, Antonio; Moschese, Viviana; Chini, Loredana; Villa, Anna; Azzari, Chiara; Finocchi, Andrea; Locatelli, Franco; Rossi, Paolo; Sangiuolo, Federica; Aiuti, Alessandro; Cancrini, Caterina; Di Matteo, Gigliola",Front Immunol,143,1
3850,3850,3850,"Current accounts of antimicrobial resistance: stabilisation, individualisation and antibiotics as infrastructure",13.671993,6.2640853,2019-05-21,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the latest issues to galvanise political and financial investment as an emerging global health threat. This paper explores the construction of AMR as a problem, following three lines of analysis. First, an examination of some of the ways in which AMR has become an object for action—through defining, counting and projecting it. Following Lakoff’s work on emerging infectious diseases, the paper illustrates that while an ‘actuarial’ approach to AMR may be challenging to stabilise due to definitional and logistical issues, it has been successfully stabilised through a ‘sentinel’ approach that emphasises the threat of AMR. Second, the paper draws out a contrast between the way AMR is formulated in terms of a problem of connectedness—a ‘One Health’ issue—and the frequent solutions to AMR being focused on individual behaviour. The paper suggests that AMR presents an opportunity to take seriously connections, scale and systems but that this effort is undermined by the prevailing tendency to reduce health issues to matters for individual responsibility. Third, the paper takes AMR as a moment of infrastructural inversion (Bowker and Star) when antimicrobials and the work they do are rendered more visible. This leads to the proposal of antibiotics as infrastructure—part of the woodwork that we take for granted, and entangled with our ways of doing life, in particular modern life. These explorations render visible the ways social, economic and political frames continue to define AMR and how it may be acted upon, which opens up possibilities for reconfiguring AMR research and action.","Chandler, Clare I.

The disease is caused by infections with parasitic blood flukes known as schistosomes. The control of schistosomiasis over the last several decades has been centered on the mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ), which is the only drug currently available for treatment. Despite the concerted efforts of MDA programs, the prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis has remained largely unchecked due to the fact that PZQ is ineffective against juvenile schistosomes, does not prevent re-infection and the emergence of PZQ-resistant parasites. In addition, other measures such as the water, sanitation and hygiene programs and snail intermediate hosts control have had little to no impact. These drawbacks indicate that the current control strategies are severely inadequate at interrupting transmission and therefore, implementation of other control strategies are required. Ideally, an efficient vaccine is what is needed for long term protection thereby eliminating the current efforts of repeated mass drug administration. However, the general consensus in the field is that the integration of a viable vaccine with MDA and other control measures offer the best chance of achieving the goal of schistosomiasis elimination. This review focuses on the present status of schistosomiasis vaccine candidates in different phases of human clinical trials and provide some insight into future vaccine discovery and design.","Molehin, Adebayo J.",J Biomed Sci,143,11

This was made possible due to the large number of babies born with microcephaly in the Northeast region (NE) in a narrow time. We hypothesize that the fivefold difference in the rate of microcephalic neonates between the NE and other regions is partially an effect of the population prior immunity against Dengue viruses (DENV), that cross-react with ZIKV. In this ecological study, we analysed the interaction between dengue fever epidemics from 2001 to 2014 and the 2015/2016 microcephaly epidemic in 400 microregions in Brazil using random-effects models under a Bayesian approach. The estimated effect of the time lag between the most recent large dengue epidemic (>400/100,000 inhabitants) and the microcephaly epidemic ranged from protection (up to 6 years prior) to an increased risk (from 7 to 12 years). This sustained window of protection, larger than described in previous longitudinal studies, is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that could boost immunity.","Carvalho, Marilia Sá; Freitas, Laís Picinini; Cruz, Oswaldo Gonçalves; Brasil, Patrícia; Bastos, Leonardo Soares",Sci Rep,143,1

The virus caused cytopathic effect (CPE) in C6/36 cells and passaged stably. Polyacrylamide gel analysis showed that the genome of YN12243 was composed of 12 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with a distribution pattern of 6-6. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the coding region (1‒12 segments) were 17,803 bp and 5,925 amino acids in length, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 protein (RdRp) revealed that YN12243 belonged to genus Seadornavirus of family Reoviridae, and further analysis indicated that YN12243 belongs to the Banna virus (BAV) genotype A2. Additionally, YN12243 was located in the same evolutionary cluster as BAV strains isolated from different mosquito species, suggesting that the BAV isolated from Culicoides does not have species barriers. These results indicate that Culicoides can also be a vector for BAV. In view of the hematophagous habits of Culicoides on cattle, horses, deer, and other large animals, as well as the possibility of spreading and causing a variety of animal arboviral diseases, it is important to improve infection detection and monitor the BAV in large livestock.","Song, Song; Li, Yuanyuan; Fu, Shihong; Lei, Wenwen; Guo, Xiaofang; Feng, Yun; Gao, Xiaoyan; Li, Xiaolong; Yang, Zhonghua; Xu, Ziqian; He, Ying; Wang, Huanyu; Zhou, Hongning; Wang, Bin; Lu, Xiaoqing; Liang, Guodong",Sci China Life Sci,143,1

PURPOSE: To investigate the level of knowledge and attitudes towards the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak across various ethnic groups and socio-demographic backgrounds in Malaysia. METHOD: A cross-sectional, population-based, computer-assisted telephone interview exploring knowledge and attitudes regarding influenza A(H1N1) was conducted in Malaysia. Between July 11 and September 12, 2009, a total of 1,050 respondents were interviewed (response rate 69.3%). RESULTS: The mean total knowledge score for the overall sample was 7.30 (SD ± 1.961) out of a possible score of 13 (Chinese had the highest scores, followed by Indians, then Malays). Some erroneous beliefs about the modes of transmission were identified. The majority of the participants (73.8%) perceived the A(H1N1) infection as often deadly. Despite the overestimation of the severity of A(H1N1) infection, high confidence in preventing infection and low perceived susceptibility of infection were reported. Influenza A(H1N1)-related stigma was prevalent and exhibited differences across ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that provision of education and clear information are essential to correct the misconceptions, and increase perceived susceptibility to infection so that the general public will take precautions against A(H1N1) infection.","Wong, Li Ping; Sam, I-Ching",Int J Behav Med,143,1

The administration of non-cross-resistant therapies during the post-transplant phase could possibly control residual disease and delay or prevent its progression. To test this approach, 55 patients with relapsed/refractory or high-risk NHL or relapsed/refractory HD were enrolled in the following protocol: stem cell mobilization: cyclophosphamide (4.5 g/m(2)) + etoposide (2.0 g/m(2)) followed by GM-CSF or G-CSF; high-dose therapy: gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2)) on day −5, BCNU (300 mg/m(2)) + gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2)) on day −2, melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) on day −1, blood stem cell infusion on day 0; post-transplant immunotherapy (B cell NHL): rituxan (375 mg/m(2)) weekly for 4 weeks + GM-CSF (250 μg thrice weekly) (weeks 4–8); post-transplant involved-field radiotherapy (HD): 30–40 Gy to pre-transplant areas of disease (weeks 4–8); post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy (all patients): dexamethasone (40 mg daily)/cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2)/day)/etoposide (30 mg/m(2)/day)/cisplatin (15 mg/m(2)/day) by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days + gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2), day 3) (months 3 + 9) alternating with dexamethasone/paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) (months 6 + 12). Of the 33 patients with B cell lymphoma, 14 had primary refractory disease (42%), 12 had relapsed disease (36%) and seven had high-risk disease in first CR (21%). For the entire group, the 2-year Kaplan–Meier event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 30% and 35%, respectively, while six of 33 patients (18%) died before day 100 from transplant-related complications. The rituxan/GM-CSF phase was well-tolerated by the 26 patients who were treated and led to radiographic responses in seven patients; an eighth patient with a blastic variant of mantle-cell lymphoma had clearance of marrow involvement after rituxan/GM-CSF. Of the 22 patients with relapsed/refractory HD (21 patients) or high-risk T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (one patient), the 2-year Kaplan–Meier EFS and OS were 70% and 85%, respectively, while two of 22 patients (9%) died before day 100 from transplant-related complications. Eight patients received involved field radiation and seven had radiographic responses within the treatment fields. A total of 72 courses of post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy were administered to 26 of the 55 total patients. Transient grade 3–4 myelosuppression was common and one patient died from neutropenic sepsis, but no patients required an infusion of backup stem cells. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, the EFS for the cohort of HD patients was significantly better than the EFS for an historical cohort of HD patients autografted after BEAC (BCNU/etoposide/cytarabine/cyclophosphamide) without consolidation chemotherapy (P = 0.015). In conclusion, post-transplant consolidation therapy is feasible and well-tolerated for patients autografted for aggressive NHL and HD and may be associated with improved progression-free survival particularly for patients with HD.

Mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (CM) has been reported to attenuate lung injury. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), a type of multipotent stem cells, are more easily obtained than mesenchymal stem cells. We hypothesize that NCSC-CM has anti-inflammatory properties that could protect against IR-induced lung injury in rats. In this study, NCSC-CM was derived from rat NCSCs. Typical acute lung injury was induced by 30-min ischemia followed by 90-min reperfusion in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected to analyze the degree of lung injury after the experiment. NCSC-CM was administered before ischemia and after reperfusion. NCSC-CM treatment significantly attenuated IR-induced lung edema, as indicated by decreases in pulmonary vascular permeability, lung weight gain, wet to dry weight ratio, lung weight to body weight ratio, pulmonary arterial pressure, and protein level in BALF. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in the BALF were also significantly decreased. Additionally, NCSC-CM improved lung pathology and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissue, and significantly suppressed nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity and IκB-α degradation in the lung. However, heating NCSC-CM eliminated these protective effects. Our experiment demonstrates that NCSC-CM treatment decreases IR-induced acute lung injury and that the protective mechanism may be attributable to the inhibition of NF-κB activation and the inflammatory response. Therefore, NCSC-CM may be a novel approach for treating IR-induced lung injury.","Peng, Chung-Kan; Wu, Shu-Yu; Tang, Shih-En; Li, Min-Hui; Lin, Shih-Shiuan; Chu, Shi-Jye; Huang, Kun-Lun",Inflammation,143,1

This rare auto-inflammatory disease is classically described by the “Still’s triad” of fever, rash, and arthritis, although the atypical cases frequently outnumber the typical ones. The exact pathogenesis and etiologic factors responsible for the clinical features remain largely obscure, despite recent suggestive cytokine biology findings. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, following the exclusion of mimickers of infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic etiology, with the additional consideration of non-specific laboratory abnormalities such as peripheral leukocytosis and elevation of serum ferritin and other acute phase reactants. The disease manifestations are protean and can include diverse complications, affecting multiple organ systems. Moreover, the severity of the organ involvement can vary considerably, representing a wide spectrum from the self-limited to severe. The mainstay of therapy has evolved from the traditional use of corticosteroids and oral immunosupressants to the newer targeted treatments with biologic agents. The scope of this review is to alert the clinician to the existence of life-threatening AOSD complications, namely the macrophage activation syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hämatologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der Hämatologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group. In this article, a range of potentially life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients are discussed.","Juarso, Edwin; Kiehl, Malte; Buchholz, Markus; Weißinger, Florian",Onkologe (Berl),143,22

BO is a relatively rare disease, but its incidence is probably higher than generally believed and is continuously rising, partly because of better recognition, but also because of increased exposure to industrial fumes, and its occurrence in lung transplantation. BO is characterized histologically by varying degrees of obliteration of the lumen of the respiratory bronchioles by organizing connective tissue often extending into the alveoli (‘proliferative’ BO with organizing pneumoni+BOOP) or by more extensive fibrosis and scarring of the more proximal, conductive bronchioles (‘constrictive’ BO). Diverse clinical conditions have been associated with the development of BO, notably viral and mycoplasma infection, toxic fume exposure and immune reactions in the setting of a collagen vascular disease, drug reaction or organ transplantation. The clinical course and features of BO may vary considerably according to the aetiology, histological pattern and stage of the disease. The most common presentation is that of a progressive dry cough and dyspnea, associated with diffuse patchy interstitial lung infiltrates on chest X-ray. In the more advanced cases, lung function tests show either restrictive or obstructive defects, depending on the extent of alveolar involvement, and hypoxemia without CO(2) retention. The diagnosis is often possible on clinical grounds, however, in a seriously ill patient uncertainty should be resolved by tissue diagnosis, preferably by open lung biopsy. Treatment is based on symptomatic therapy. The use of corticosteroids is controversial, but common. Patients with BOOP are exceptional, in that there may be no underlying condition (‘idiopathic’ BOOP or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia—COP), a restrictive ventilatory defect is usual and the response to corticosteroids often remarkable.","EZRI, T.; KUNICHEZKY, S.; ELIRAZ, A.; SOROKER, D.; HALPERIN, D.; SCHATTNER, A.",QJM,143,1

Eighteen admissions were not associated with ARD (15 rubella infections, 3 immunization reactions). Of the remaining 131 ARD admissions, 17 were complicated by pneumonia and 114 were judged to have uncomplicated ARD. Within the latter group, evidence for infection by a single respiratory pathogen was obtained from 68 admissions; 11 admissions were associated with multiple infectious agents; and 35 admissions yielded no infectious agent(s). Despite immunization, adenoviruses, primarily ADV-4, were still the most common cause of ARD. Among non-adenovirus associated ARD admissions, rhinoviruses were the most common (10), followed by influenza A2 virus (7), group A streptococci (2) and herpesvirus hominis (2). Thus, in this initial study of ARD among recruits immunized with ADV-4 and ADV-7 vaccines, no other respiratory pathogens emerged to replace adenovirus types 4 and 7 as the major causes of ARD in military trainees.","DUDDING, BURTON A; TOP, FRANKLIN H.; SCOTTT, ROBERT M.; RUSSELL, PHILIP K.; BUESCHER, EDWARD L.",Am J Epidemiol,143,1

Functions of the BRB are to regulate fluids and molecular movement between the ocular vascular beds and retinal tissues and to prevent leakage of macromolecules and other potentially harmful agents into the retina, keeping the microenvironment of the retina and retinal neurons. These functions are mainly attributed to absent fenestrations of RCECs, tight junctions, expression of a great diversity of transporters, and coverage of pericytes and glial cells. BRB existence also becomes a reason that systemic administration for some drugs is not suitable for the treatment of retinal diseases. Some diseases (such as diabetes and ischemia-reperfusion) impair BRB function via altering tight junctions, RCEC death, and transporter expression. This chapter will illustrate function of BRB, expressions and functions of these transporters, and their clinical significances.","Liu, Li; Liu, Xiaodong","Drug Transporters in Drug Disposition, Effects and Toxicity",143,22

The TCR repertoire and relative proportions of various T cell subsets are established in the thymus, and continue to be shaped and regulated in the periphery. As the thymic function declines, peripheral homeostatic mechanisms assume increasing importance. Indeed, loss of thymic function does not lead to progressive decline of T cell numbers because peripheral mechanisms ensure that the size of the T cell population is maintained due to proliferation of residual cells. However, our current understanding of the basic mechanisms of ‘homeostatic’ or lymphopenia-induced proliferation suggests that this drive to maintain population size may be accompanied by loss of TCR diversity and emergence of auto-reactive effector T cells. This prediction is supported by experimental and clinical evidence. This consideration is important because lymphopenia is seen commonly in clinical practice as a consequence of viral infections, or medical treatment of cancer, autoimmunity, and graft rejection. Lymphopenia may be a simple link between viral infections and autoimmunity, and may be one reason for common failure of very potent, but non-specific, immunosuppressive drugs in current clinical use.","Khoruts, Alexander; Fraser, Joanne M.",Immunol Lett,143,1

Indeed, IRBG74 effectively nodulated S. cannabina and seven other Sesbania spp. that nodulate with Ensifer (Sinorhizobium)/Rhizobium strains with similar nodA genes to IRBG74, but not species that nodulate with Azorhizobium or Mesorhizobium. Light and electron microscopy revealed that IRBG74 infected Sesbania spp. via lateral root junctions under flooded conditions, but via root hairs under non‐flooded conditions. Thus, IRBG74 is the first confirmed legume‐nodulating symbiont from the Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) clade. Cross‐inoculation studies with various Sesbania symbionts showed that S. cannabina could form fully effective symbioses with strains in the genera Rhizobium and Ensifer, only ineffective ones with Azorhizobium strains, and either partially effective (Mesorhizobium huakii) or ineffective (Mesorhizobium plurifarium) symbioses with Mesorhizobium. These data are discussed in terms of the molecular phylogeny of Sesbania and its symbionts.","Cummings, Stephen P.; Gyaneshwar, Prasad; Vinuesa, Pablo; Farruggia, Frank T.; Andrews, Mitchell; Humphry, David; Elliott, Geoffrey N.; Nelson, Andrew; Orr, Caroline; Pettitt, Deborah; Shah, Gopit R.; Santos, Scott R.; Krishnan, Hari B.; Odee, David; Moreira, Fatima M.

This yields 5‐oxothiomorpholine‐3‐carboxylic acid, with the same 17 Da mass loss observed in the Gln reaction. Nineteen tryptic peptides with Cys at the N‐terminal were identified for this study, and compared with eight with N‐terminal Gln. When examined by MALDI‐QqTOF and (off‐line HPLC)/MALDI‐QqTOF measurements, these were all found to undergo the cyclization reactions. The average degree of degradation during overnight digestion was found to be ∼51 and ∼34% for Cys and Gln, respectively; more detailed information on the time course of the reactions was obtained for the peptides CCTESLVNR and QYYTVFDR.

We evaluated the use of apneic oxygenation in the pediatric ED and reported a quality improvement initiative to incorporate apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during rapid sequence intubations (RSIs). METHODS: A baseline period from June 2016 to April 2017 highlighted the practice gaps. Quality improvement interventions were subsequently developed and implemented as a care bundle consisting of a pre-intubation checklist, placing reminders and additional oxygen source in resuscitation bays, incorporating into the responsibilities of the airway doctor and the airway nurse (copiloting), education during airway workshops and simulation training for doctors and nurses, as well as enhancing documentation of the intubation process. We monitored a post-intervention observation period from May 2017 to April 2018 for the effectiveness of the care bundle. RESULTS: Apneic oxygenation was not performed in all 22 RSIs during the baseline period. Among 25 RSIs in the post-intervention observation period, providers performed apneic oxygenation in 17 (68%) cases. There was no significant difference in the utilization of apneic oxygenation among emergency physicians and pediatric anesthetists performing RSIs in the pediatric ED. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a care bundle targeted at incorporating apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during emergency intubations performed in ED. This method could be adopted by other pediatric EDs to improve airway management in critically ill children.","Pek, Jen Heng; Tan, Hui Cheng; Shen, Germac; Ong, Yong-Kwang Gene",Pediatr Qual Saf,143,1

One of these pandemics occurred in Mexico in 2009. Despite the impact of IAV on human health, there is no effective vaccine. Gene mutations and translocation of genome segments of different IAV subtypes infecting a single host cell make the development of a universal vaccine difficult. The design of immunogenic peptides using bioinformatics tools could be an interesting strategy to increase the success of vaccines. In this work, we used the predicted amino acid sequences of the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of different IAV subtypes to perform multiple alignments, epitope predictions, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation. Peptide selection was based on the following criteria: promiscuity, protein surface exposure, and the degree of conservation among different medically relevant IAV strains. These peptides were tested using immunological assays to test their ability to induce production of antibodies against IAV. We immunized rabbits and mice and measured the levels of IgG and IgA antibodies in serum samples and nasal washes. Rabbit antibodies against the peptides P11 and P14 (both of which are hybrids of NA and HA) recognized HA from both group 1 (H1, H2, and H5) and group 2 (H3 and H7) IAV and also recognized the purified NA protein from the viral stock (influenza A Puerto Rico/916/34). IgG antibodies from rabbits immunized with P11 and P14 were capable of recognizing viral particles and inhibited virus hemagglutination. Additionally, intranasal immunization of mice with P11 and P14 induced specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and nasal mucosa, respectively. Interestingly, the IgG antibodies were found to have neutralizing capability. In conclusion, the peptides designed through in silico studies were validated in experimental assays.

The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as a weaning strategy (transitioning patients who are difficult to wean to early NIV) may reduce mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the cost effectiveness of protocolised weaning, including early extubation onto NIV, compared with weaning without NIV in a UK National Health Service setting. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either protocol-directed weaning from mechanical ventilation or ongoing IMV with daily spontaneous breathing trials. The primary efficacy outcome was time to liberation from ventilation. Bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) provided estimates of the incremental cost per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) overall and for subgroups [presence/absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and operative status]. Long-term cost effectiveness was determined through extrapolation of survival curves using flexible parametric modelling. RESULTS: NIV was associated with a mean INMB of £620 ($US885) (cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY) with a corresponding probability of 58% that NIV is cost effective. The probability that NIV is cost effective was higher for those with COPD (84%). NIV was cost effective over 5 years, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £4618 ($US6594 per QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of NIV being cost effective relative to weaning without NIV ranged between 57 and 59% overall and between 82 and 87% for the COPD subgroup.

Accordingly, practice guidelines suggest medical treatment only for ulcer with a Forrest IIc lesion because it has low rebleeding risk even without endoscopic therapy, ranging from 0 to 13%. However, the risk ranges widely and it is unclear who is at risk of rebleeding with such a lesion. This study assessed whether the Rockall score, which evaluates patients holistically, could indicate the risk of recurrent bleeding among patients with a Forrest IIc lesion at the second-look endoscopy. METHODS: Patients who had peptic ulcer bleeding with Ia-IIb lesions received endoscopic hemostasis at the primary endoscopy, and they were enrolled if their Ia-IIb lesions had been fading to IIc at the second-look endoscopy after 48- to 72-h intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion. Primary outcomes were rebleeding during the 4th–14th day and 4(th)–28th day after the first bleeding episode. RESULTS: The prospective cohort study enrolled 140 patients, who were divided into a Rockall scores ≥ 6 group or a Rockall scores < 6 group. The rebleeding rates in the Rockall scores ≥ 6 group and the Rockall scores < 6 group during the 4th–14th day and the 4th–28th day were 13/70 (18.6%) versus 2/70 (2.9%), p = 0.003 and 17/70 (24.3%) versus 3/70 (4.3%), p = 0.001, respectively, based on an intention-to-treat analysis and 5/62 (8.1%) versus 0/68 (0%), p = 0.023 and 6/59 (10.2%) versus 0/67 (0%), p = 0.009, respectively, based on a per-protocol analysis. The Kaplan–Meier curves showed that the Rockall scores ≥ 6 group had a significantly lower cumulative rebleeding-free proportion than the Rockall scores < 6 group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Combined Rockall scores ≥ 6 on arrival with a Forrest IIc lesion at the second-look endoscopy can identify patients at risk of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding following initial endoscopic and intravenous PPI treatment.

This Position Paper also provides a practical guide on how TDM can be applied in routine clinical practice to improve therapeutic outcomes in critically ill adult patients. METHODS: Literature review and analysis were performed by Panel Members nominated by the endorsing organisations, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic and Critically Ill Patient Study Groups of European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), International Association for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (IATDMCT) and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC). Panel members made recommendations for whether TDM should be applied clinically for different antimicrobials/classes. RESULTS: TDM-guided dosing has been shown to be clinically beneficial for aminoglycosides, voriconazole and ribavirin. For most common antibiotics and antifungals in the ICU, a clear therapeutic range has been established, and for these agents, routine TDM in critically ill patients appears meritorious. For the antivirals, research is needed to identify therapeutic targets and determine whether antiviral TDM is indeed meritorious in this patient population. The Panel Members recommend routine TDM to be performed for aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics, linezolid, teicoplanin, vancomycin and voriconazole in critically ill patients. CONCLUSION: Although TDM should be the standard of care for most antimicrobials in every ICU, important barriers need to be addressed before routine TDM can be widely employed worldwide.

Lack of adequate treatment and preventive measures against LASV resulted in a high mortality rate in its endemic regions. In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine was designed using immunoinformatics as a prophylactic agent against the virus. Following a rigorous assessment, the vaccine was built using T-cell (N(CTL) = 8 and N(HTL) = 6) and B-cell (N(LBL) = 4) epitopes from each LASV-derived protein in addition with suitable linkers and adjuvant. The physicochemistry, immunogenic potency and safeness of the designed vaccine (~ 68 kDa) were assessed. In addition, chosen CTL and HTL epitopes of our vaccine showed 97.37% worldwide population coverage. Besides, disulphide engineering also improved the stability of the chimeric vaccine. Molecular docking of our vaccine protein with toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) showed binding efficiency followed by dynamics simulation for stable interaction. Furthermore, higher levels of cell-mediated immunity and rapid antigen clearance were suggested by immune simulation and repeated-exposure simulation, respectively. Finally, the optimized codons were used in in silico cloning to ensure higher expression within E. coli K12 bacterium. With further assessment both in vitro and in vivo, we believe that our proposed peptide-vaccine would be potential immunogen against Lassa fever.

The observed response was species-specific, dependent on the prior growth conditions, and was inhibited by oxygen. We observed attraction toward nitrate when Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB and Azospira suillum strain PS were grown with nitrate. When D. aromatica and Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB were grown with perchlorate, both responded to nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate. When A. suillum was grown with perchlorate, the organism responded to chlorate and perchlorate but not nitrate. A gene replacement mutant in the perchlorate reductase subunit (pcrA) of D. aromatica resulted in a loss of the attraction response toward perchlorate but had no impact on the nitrate response. Washed-cell suspension studies revealed that the perchlorate grown cells of D. aromatica reduced both perchlorate and nitrate, while A. suillum cells reduced perchlorate only. Based on these observations, energy taxis was proposed as the underlying mechanism for the responses to (per)chlorate by D. aromatica. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of the response behavior of perchlorate-reducing bacteria to environmental stimuli. It clearly demonstrates attraction toward chlorine oxyanions and the unique ability of these organisms to distinguish structurally analogous compounds, nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate and respond accordingly.

(Skeletal Radiol. 2009;38(9):855–62),13.815609,6.204541,2009-11-26,"The key precursors for p-hydroxybenzoate production by engineered Pseudomonas putida S12 are phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), for which the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway is an important source. Since PP pathway fluxes are typically low in pseudomonads, E4P and PEP availability is a likely bottleneck for aromatics production which may be alleviated by stimulating PP pathway fluxes via co-feeding of pentoses in addition to glucose or glycerol. As P. putida S12 lacks the natural ability to utilize xylose, the xylose isomerase pathway from E. coli was introduced into the p-hydroxybenzoate producing strain P. putida S12palB2. The initially inefficient xylose utilization was improved by evolutionary selection after which the p-hydroxybenzoate production was evaluated. Even without xylose-co-feeding, p-hydroxybenzoate production was improved in the evolved xylose-utilizing strain, which may indicate an intrinsically elevated PP pathway activity. Xylose co-feeding further improved the p-hydroxybenzoate yield when co-fed with either glucose or glycerol, up to 16.3 Cmol% (0.1 g p-hydroxybenzoate/g substrate). The yield improvements were most pronounced with glycerol, which probably related to the availability of the PEP precursor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). Thus, it was demonstrated that the production of aromatics such as p-hydroxybenzoate can be improved by co-feeding different carbon sources via different and partially artificial pathways. Moreover, this approach opens new perspectives for the efficient production of (fine) chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose that typically has a high content of both glucose and xylose and (crude) glycerol.","Meijnen, Jean-Paul; Verhoef, Suzanne; Briedjlal, Ashwin A.; de Winde, Johannes H.; Ruijssenaars, Harald J.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,143,1

Especially, knockdown of CBX7 in either embryonic cortical neurons or adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons enhances their axon growth ability. Two important transcription factors GATA4 and SOX11 are functional downstream targets of CBX7 in controlling axon regeneration. Moreover, knockdown of GATA4 or SOX11 in cultured DRG neurons inhibits axon regeneration response from CBX7 downregulation in DRG neurons.

Our research reveals a novel DNA response mechanism different from general DNA-damaging agents, and that sophoridine derivate inhibits the phosphorylation of Tyr694 and Ser780 of STAT5a to induce the lessened shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and leads to the decreased nuclear STAT5a and subsequently inhibits the expression of STAT5a target gene RAD51 that contributes to the checkpoint activation, thus inhibiting ATR activation. Meanwhile, IMB-HDC that induced the diminished expression of STAT5a target gene contributes to proliferation and leads to apoptosis. More importantly, we give the first evidence that promoting the effect of Tyr694 phosphorylation on nuclear location and subsequent STAT5a target gene transcription depends on Ser780 increased or unchanged phosphorylation and was not correlated with Ser726 phosphorylation.","Zhao, Wu-li; Xing, Yan; Ye, Cheng; Qiu, Yu-han; Li, Yi; Liu, Xiu-jun; Wang, Meng-yan; Bi, Chong-wen; Song, Dan-qing; Shao, Rong-guang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,143,11

Our study conducted an epidemiological study of psychosis in Guangdong province, with 20 million real-world follow-up records in the last decade. METHODS: Data was collected from Guangdong mental health information platform from 2010 to 2019, which had standardized disease registration and follow-up management for nearly 600,000 patients with six categories of mental diseases and 400,000 patients with schizophrenia. We conducted clinical staging for the disease course of the patients and divided the data with various factors into different stages of disease. Quantitative analysis was utilized to investigate the high relevant indicators to the disease. The results were projected on geography map for regional distribution analysis. RESULTS: The majority cases of mental disease incidence were between the age of 15 and 29, while the peak age for both male and female was between 20 to 24 years old. The disease course with the largest number of patients’ cases was between 5 to 10 years. The therapeutic effect of patients gradually decreased with the development of disease course, while the risk increased with the disease course. The analysis of influencing factors showed that poor economic conditions incurred higher risk scores, and good medication adherence was effective in improving treatment outcomes. In addition, receiving good education contributed to the reduction of the risk of schizophrenia and the improvement of the efficiency of early treatment. Through the analysis of regional distribution of schizophrenia disease, developed economic conditions and favorable resource conditions could promote the reduction of disease risk, while in economically backward regions, it often accompanied with lower therapeutic effect and higher disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: Certain demographic factors had a relatively prominent impact on the therapeutic effect and risk of schizophrenia, such as high-quality medication adherence.

The formed 2-hydroxy-cinnamic acids thereafter bind within a very particular part of the enzyme active site, at its entrance, where a high variability of amino acid residues among the different mammalian CA isoforms is present, and where other inhibitors classes were not seen bound earlier. This explains why coumarins are among the most isoform-selective CA inhibitors known to date among the many chemotypes endowed with such biological activity. As coumarins are widespread secondary metabolites in some bacteria, plants, fungi, and ascidians, many such compounds from various natural sources have been investigated for their CA inhibitory properties and for possible biomedical applications, mainly as anticancer agents targeting hypoxic tumours.","Supuran, Claudiu T.",,143,1

Therefore, generation of a universal influenza virus vaccine is an urgent need and would greatly benefit public health. Recombinant protein technology is an established vaccine platform and has resulted in several commercially available vaccines. Herein, we describe the approach for developing stable transfected human cell lines for the expression of recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and recombinant influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) proteins for the purpose of in vitro and in vivo vaccine development. HA and NA are the main surface glycoproteins on influenza virions and the major antibody targets. The benefits for using recombinant proteins for in vitro and in vivo assays include the ease of use, high level of purity and the ability to scale-up production. This work provides guidelines on how to produce and purify recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cell lines through either transient transfection or generation of stable cell lines from plasmid creation through the isolation step via Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC). Collectively, the establishment of this pipeline has facilitated large-scale production of recombinant HA and NA proteins to high purity and with consistent yields, including glycosylation patterns that are very similar to proteins produced in a human host.","Ecker, Jeffrey W.; Kirchenbaum, Greg A.; Pierce, Spencer R.; Skarlupka, Amanda L.; Abreu, Rodrigo B.; Cooper, R.

Quantitative differences in IFNAR binding correlate with antiviral activity, but whether IFN-Is exhibit qualitative differences remains controversial. Moreover, the IFN-I response is protective during acute HIV-1 infection, but likely pathogenic during the chronic stages. To gain a deeper understanding of the IFN-I response, we compared the interferomes of IFNα subtypes dominantly-expressed in HIV-1-exposed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (1, 2, 5, 8 and 14) and IFNβ in the earliest cellular targets of HIV-1 infection. Primary gut CD4 T cells from 3 donors were treated for 18 hours ex vivo with individual IFN-Is normalized for IFNAR signaling strength. Of 1,969 IFN-regulated genes, 246 ‘core ISGs’ were induced by all IFN-Is tested. However, many IFN-regulated genes were not shared between the IFNα subtypes despite similar induction of canonical antiviral ISGs such as ISG15, RSAD2 and MX1, formally demonstrating qualitative differences between the IFNα subtypes. Notably, IFNβ induced a broader interferome than the individual IFNα subtypes. Since IFNβ, and not IFNα, is upregulated during chronic HIV-1 infection in the gut, we compared core ISGs and IFNβ-specific ISGs from colon pinch biopsies of HIV-1-uninfected (n = 13) versus age- and gender-matched, antiretroviral-therapy naïve persons with HIV-1 (PWH; n = 19). Core ISGs linked to inflammation, T cell activation and immune exhaustion were elevated in PWH, positively correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and gut IFNβ levels, and negatively correlated with gut CD4 T cell frequencies. In sharp contrast, IFNβ-specific ISGs linked to protein translation and anti-inflammatory responses were significantly downregulated in PWH, negatively correlated with gut IFNβ and LPS, and positively correlated with plasma IL6 and gut CD4 T cell frequencies. Our findings reveal qualitative differences in interferome induction by diverse IFN-Is and suggest potential mechanisms for how IFNβ may drive HIV-1 pathogenesis in the gut.","Guo, Kejun; Shen, Guannan; Kibbie, Jon; Gonzalez, Tania; Dillon, Stephanie M.; Smith, Harry A.; Cooper, Emily H.; Lavender, Kerry; Hasenkrug, Kim J.; Sutter, Kathrin; Dittmer, Ulf; Kroehl, Miranda; Kechris, Katerina; Wilson, Cara C.; Santiago, Mario L.",PLoS Pathog,143,1

Our study objective was to assess the functioning of a new 13-item measure (CoG-NR) of understanding of and knowledge about normal/negative genomic screening results for three highly actionable conditions: Lynch Syndrome, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Based on our prior research and expert review, we developed CoG-NR and tested how well it functioned using hypothetical scenarios in three Qualtrics surveys. We report on its psychometric properties and performance across the three different conditions. The measure performed similarly for the three conditions. Examinations of item difficulty, internal reliability, and differential item functioning indicate that the items perform well, with statistically significant positive correlations with genomic knowledge, health literacy, and objective numeracy. CoG-NR assesses understanding of normal/negative results for each of the conditions. The next step is to examine its performance among individuals who have actually undergone such tests, and subsequent use in clinical or research situations. The CoG-NR measure holds great promise as a tool to enhance benefits of population genomic screening by bringing to light the prevalence of incorrect interpretation of negative results.","Henderson, Gail E.; Ewing, Molly; Kuczynski, Kristine J.; Cadigan, R.

Restoration of the injured nerves requires a complex cellular and molecular response to rebuild the functional axons so that they can accurately connect with their original targets. However, there is no optimized therapy for complete recovery after PNI. Supplementation with exogenous growth factors (GFs) is an emerging and versatile therapeutic strategy for promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. GFs activate the downstream targets of various signaling cascades through binding with their corresponding receptors to exert their multiple effects on neurorestoration and tissue regeneration. However, the simple administration of GFs is insufficient for reconstructing PNI due to their short half‑life and rapid deactivation in body fluids. To overcome these shortcomings, several nerve conduits derived from biological tissue or synthetic materials have been developed. Their good biocompatibility and biofunctionality made them a suitable vehicle for the delivery of multiple GFs to support peripheral nerve regeneration. After repairing nerve defects, the controlled release of GFs from the conduit structures is able to continuously improve axonal regeneration and functional outcome. Thus, therapies with growth factor (GF) delivery systems have received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we mainly review the therapeutic capacity of GFs and their incorporation into nerve guides for repairing PNI. In addition, the possible receptors and signaling mechanisms of the GF family exerting their biological effects are also emphasized.","Li, Rui; Li, Duo-hui; Zhang, Hong-yu; Wang, Jian; Li, Xiao-kun; Xiao, Jian",Acta Pharmacol Sin,143,22

It is widely believed that cannabis, or its main psychoactive component Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs working memory, i.e., the ability to temporarily hold information in mind. However, our review of the literature yielded surprisingly little empirical support for an effect of THC or cannabis on working memory. We thus conducted a study with three main goals: (1) quantify the effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample, (2) test the potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in disrupting working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and task duration reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two double-blind, randomized crossover experiments in which healthy adults (N = 23, 23) performed a reliable and validated visual working memory task (the “Discrete Whole Report task”, 90 trials) after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15 mg oral) or placebo. We also assessed self-reported “mind wandering” (Exp 1) and metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task performance (Exp 2). THC impaired working memory performance (d = 0.65), increased mind wandering (Exp 1), and decreased metacognitive accuracy about task performance (Exp 2). Thus, our findings indicate that THC does impair visual working memory, and that this impairment may be related to both increased mind wandering and decreased monitoring of task performance. Finally, we used a down-sampling procedure to illustrate the effects of task length and sample size on power to detect the acute effect of THC on working memory.","Adam, Kirsten C.

RESULTS: From January 2000 through December 2016, poison control centres in the United States received 319,508 calls for household cleaning product-related ocular exposures, averaging 18,795 exposures annually. The annual frequency of exposures decreased significantly by 28.8% during the study period. The rate of exposures per 100,000 US residents was 28.4 among young children (<6 years), 4.8 among older children (6–12 years), 4.2 among teenagers (13–19 years), and 4.2 among adults (≥20 years); children 2 years old had the highest rate of exposure (62.8).

SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all adult patients with orbital mycosis treated by the senior author (TJS) from 1986 to 2017 in a tertiary setting. RESULTS: Thirty cases of fungal infection involving the orbit were included in this case series. Of these, 26 patients had invasive disease and four patients had non-invasive disease. Causative organisms included mucormycosis (16), aspergillus (8) and other fungi (7). Common risk factors included haematological disorders or malignancy, neutropenia, corticosteroid use and diabetes mellitus. Mucormycosis in three immunocompetent patients was caused by Apophysomyces elegans. Orbital apex syndrome was observed in approximately one third of patients at initial ophthalmological assessment. Amphotericin B was used in most cases of mucormycosis, while there was a more varied spectrum of anti-fungal use in other fungal infections. Seven patients with mucormycosis proceeded to orbital exenteration with a survival rate of 43%. No patients with other orbital fungal infections were exenterated. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital mycoses are not only opportunistic but true pathogenic infections. While initial symptoms may be varied, the development of orbital apex syndrome should raise suspicion for this condition, regardless of patient immune status or age. Survival and visual outcomes are often poor with invasive disease. Multidisciplinary team management with early orbital specialist involvement is essential.","Lee, Allister S.; Lee, Princeton W.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults with a personal or family cancer history participating in a trial of a decision aid for selection of SF from genomic sequencing (GS) (www.GenomicsADvISER.com). Interviews were analyzed thematically using constant comparison. Preserving health-related and non-health-related quality of life was an overarching motivator for both learning and not learning SF. Some participants perceived that learning SF would help them “have a good quality of life” through informing actions to maintain physical health or leading to psychological benefits such as emotional preparation for disease. Other participants preferred not to learn SF because results “could ruin your quality of life,” such as by causing negative psychological impacts. Measuring health-related and non-health-related quality of life may capture outcomes related to clinical and personal utility of GS and SF, which have previously been challenging to measure. Without appropriate measures, generating and synthesizing evidence to evaluate genomic technologies such as GS will continue to be a challenge, and will undervalue potential benefits of GS and SF.","Mighton, Chloe; Carlsson, Lindsay; Clausen, Marc; Casalino, Selina; Shickh, Salma; McCuaig, Laura; Joshi, Esha; Panchal, Seema; Semotiuk, Kara; Ott, Karen; Elser, Christine; Eisen, Andrea; Kim, Raymond H.; Lerner-Ellis, Jordan; Carroll, June C.; Glogowski, Emily; Schrader, Kasmintan; Bombard, Yvonne",Eur J Hum Genet,143,1

In this study, we investigated antimicrobial-induced temporal changes in diversity, stability, and compositions of gut microbiota in neonatal veal calves, with the objective of identifying microbial markers that predict diarrhea. A total of 220 samples from 63 calves in first 8 weeks of life were used in this study. The results suggest that increase in diversity and stability of gut microbiota over time was a feature of “healthy” (non-diarrheic) calves during early life. Therapeutic antimicrobials delayed the temporal development of diversity and taxa–function robustness (a measure of microbial stability). In addition, predicted genes associated with beta lactam and cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance were more abundant in gut microbiota of calves treated with therapeutic antimicrobials. Random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that Trueperella, Streptococcus, Dorea, uncultured Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus 2, and Erysipelatoclostridium may be key microbial markers that can differentiate “healthy” and “unhealthy” (diarrheic) gut microbiota, as they predicted early life diarrhea with an accuracy of 84.3%. Our findings suggest that diarrhea in veal calves may be predicted by the shift in early life gut microbiota, which may provide an opportunity for early intervention (e.g., prebiotics or probiotics) to improve calf health with reduced usage of antimicrobials.","Ma, Tao; Villot, Clothilde; Renaud, David; Skidmore, Andrew; Chevaux, Eric; Steele, Michael; Guan, Le Luo",ISME J,143,1

Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4, also known as GPR120) is a receptor sensing polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid. In the present study, we examined whether FFA4 acted as a therapeutic target of docosahexaenoic acid for treating atopic dermatitis. Experimental atopic dermatitis was induced in mice by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) sensitization on day 0, followed by repeated DNCB challenges from D7 to D48. The mice were treated with a selective agonist compound A (30 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ip) from D19 to D48, and sacrificed on D49. We found that DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions, i.e. hypertrophy and mast cell infiltration in skin tissues, as well as markedly elevated serum IgE levels. Administration of compound A significantly suppressed the atopic responses in ears and lymph nodes, such as hypertrophy and mast cell infiltration in the ears, enlarged sizes of lymph nodes, and elevated serum IgE and levels of cytokines IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, and IFN-γ in ear tissue. The therapeutic effects of compound A were abolished by FFA4 knockout. Similarly, increased CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cell population in lymph nodes was observed in wide-type mice treated with compound A, but not seen in FFA4-deficient mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that activation of FFA4 ameliorates atopic dermatitis by increasing CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, suggesting FFA4 as a therapeutic target for atopic dermatitis.","Son, So-Eun; Park, Soo-Jin; Koh, Jung-Min; Im, Dong-Soon",Acta Pharmacol Sin,143,1

Instead, diseases in livestock and wildlife are predictable in terms of the geography, time, and species affected. Ecological niche modeling approaches have been crucial to the advancement of our understanding of diversity and diseases distributions. This contribution is an introductory overview to the field of distributional ecology, with emphasis on its application for spatial epidemiology. A new, revised modeling framework is proposed for more detailed and replicable models that account for both the biology of the disease to be modeled and the uncertainty of the data available. Considering that most disease systems need at least two organisms interacting (i.e., host and pathogen), biotic interactions lie at the core of the pathogen's ecological niche. As a result, neglecting interacting organisms in pathogen dynamics (e.g., maintenance, reproduction, and transmission) may limit efforts to forecast disease distributions in veterinary epidemiology. Although limitations of ecological niche modeling are noted, it is clear that the application and value of ecological niche modeling to epidemiology will increase in the future. Potential research lines include the examination of the effects of biotic variables on model performance, assessments of protocols for model calibration in disease systems, and new tools and metrics for robust model evaluation. Epidemiologists aiming to employ ecological niche modeling theory and methods to reconstruct and forecast epidemics should familiarize themselves with ecological literature and must consider multidisciplinary collaborations including veterinarians to develop biologically sound, statistically robust analyses.

ManN inhibits glycosylation in ECs and induces significant changes in N-glycan and O-glycan profiles. We further demonstrate that ManN and two N-glycosylation inhibitors stimulate EC proliferation via both JNK activation and the unfolded protein response caused by ER stress. ManN results in enhanced angiogenesis in a mouse skin injury model. ManN also promotes angiogenesis in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model, with accelerated limb blood flow recovery compared to controls. In addition, intraocular injection of ManN induces retinal neovascularization. Therefore, activation of stress pathways following inhibition of protein glycosylation can promote EC proliferation and angiogenesis and may represent a therapeutic strategy for treatment of ischemic disorders.","Zhong, Cuiling; Li, Pin; Argade, Sulabha; Liu, Lixian; Chilla’, Anastasia; Liang, Wei; Xin, Hong; Eliceiri, Brian; Choudhury, Biswa; Ferrara, Napoleone",Nat Commun,143,1

However, little is known about disease progression, behavioral changes, CNS cytokine concentration, and neuropathology in limbic encephalitis in experimental models. Using Cocal virus, we infected C57Bl6 adult mice and studied the neuroanatomical distribution of viral antigens in correlation with the microglial morphological response, measured the CNS cytokine concentration, and assessed behavioral changes. C57Bl6 adult mice were maintained in an impoverished environment (IE) or enriched environment (EE) for four months and then subjected to the open field test. Afterwards, an equal volume of normal or virus-infected brain homogenate was nasally instilled. The brains were processed to detect viral antigens and microglial morphological changes using selective immunolabeling. We demonstrated earlier significant weight loss and higher mortality in IE mice. Additionally, behavioral analysis revealed a significant influence of the environment on locomotor and exploratory activity that was associated with less neuroinvasion and a reduced microglial response. Thus, environmental enrichment was associated with a more effective immune response in a mouse model of limbic encephalitis, allowing faster viral clearance/decreased viral dissemination, reduced disease progression, and less CNS damage.","Freitas, Priscilla dos Santos Lieuthier; Lima, Ana Victória de Lima; Carvalho, Karina Glazianne Barbosa; Cabral, Tatyane da Silva; de Farias, Alexandre Maia; Rodrigues, Ana Paula Drummond; Diniz, Daniel Guerreiro; Picanço Diniz, Cristovam Wanderley; Diniz Júnior, José Antônio Picanço",Viruses,143,1

Nongenetic heritability of metabolic traits may be an important contributor to the diabetes epidemic. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in protein synthesis. tRNAs also have noncanonical functions through which they control a variety of biological processes. Genetic and environmental effects on tRNAs have emerged as novel contributors to the pathogenesis of diabetes. Indeed, altered tRNA aminoacylation, modification, and fragmentation are associated with β-cell failure, obesity, and insulin resistance. Moreover, diet-induced tRNA fragments have been linked with intergenerational inheritance of metabolic traits.

In the light of new knowledge, such categorizing should be overcome because a large proportion of proteins can bind both DNA and RNA. Another even more important features of nucleic acid-binding proteins are so-called sequence or structure specificities. Proteins able to bind nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner usually contain one or more of the well-defined structural motifs (zinc-fingers, leucine zipper, helix-turn-helix, or helix-loop-helix). In contrast, many proteins do not recognize nucleic acid sequence but rather local DNA or RNA structures (G-quadruplexes, i-motifs, triplexes, cruciforms, left-handed DNA/RNA form, and others). Finally, there are also proteins recognizing both sequence and local structural properties of nucleic acids (e.g., famous tumor suppressor p53). In this mini-review, we aim to summarize current knowledge about the amino acid composition of various types of nucleic acid-binding proteins with a special focus on significant enrichment and/or depletion in each category.","Bartas, Martin; Červeň, Jiří; Guziurová, Simona; Slychko, Kristyna; Pečinka, Petr",Int J Mol Sci,143,17

Antibiotic treatment is available, but intolerable side effects and an increasing rate of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may hamper successful outcomes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer an alternative strategy for treatment of infectious diseases in which conventional antibiotic treatment fails. Human serum is a rich resource for endogenous AMPs. Therefore, we screened a library generated from hemofiltrate for activity against Mtb. Taking this unbiased approach, we identified Angiogenin as the single compound in an active fraction. The antimicrobial activity of endogenous Angiogenin against extracellular Mtb could be reproduced by synthetic Angiogenin. Using computational analysis, we identified the hypothetical active site and optimized the lytic activity by amino acid exchanges. The resulting peptide-Angie1-limited the growth of extra‐ and intracellular Mtb and the fast-growing pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Toward our long-term goal of evaluating Angie1 for therapeutic efficacy in vivo, we demonstrate that the peptide can be efficiently delivered into human macrophages via liposomes and is not toxic for zebrafish embryos. Taken together, we define Angiogenin as a novel endogenous AMP and derive the small, bioactive fragment Angie1, which is ready to be tested for therapeutic activity in animal models of tuberculosis and infections with fast-growing bacterial pathogens.","Noschka, Reiner; Gerbl, Fabian; Löffler, Florian; Kubis, Jan; Rodríguez, Armando A.; Mayer, Daniel; Grieshober, Mark; Holch, Armin; Raasholm, Martina; Forssmann, Wolf-Georg; Spellerberg, Barbara; Wiese, Sebastian; Weidinger, Gilbert; Ständker, Ludger; Stenger, Steffen",Front Microbiol,143,1

To survey the infection rate and genetic diversity of BVDV in western China, a total of 1234 serum samples from 17 herds of dairy cattle, beef cattle and yak in 4 provinces were collected in 2019. RESULTS: All the 1234 serum samples were screened individually for BVDV by RT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that the average positive rate of BVDV was 7.2% (89/1234) in animals and 82.4% (14/17) in herds. Thirteen BVDV strains were isolated from RT-PCR positive clinical samples and they were all NCP biotype. BVDV-1a and 1c subgenotypes were identified from 22 selected virus isolates in 14 BVDV-positive herds. These results confirmed that BVDV-1a and BVDV-1c were circulating in western China, similar to the BVDV epidemics in cattle in other regions of China.

On the basis of the in vitro biological profiling, most of them exhibited a significant ability to inhibit amyloid aggregation, PHF6 tau sequence aggregation, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) B. In particular, naphthoquinone 2 resulted as one of the best performing multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) experiencing a high potency profile in inhibiting β-amyloid (Aβ(40)) aggregation (IC(50) = 3.2 μM), PHF6 tau fragment (91% at 10 μM), AChE enzyme (IC(50) = 9.2 μM) jointly with a remarkable inhibitory activity against MAO B (IC(50) = 7.7 nM). Molecular modeling studies explained the structure–activity relationship (SAR) around the binding modes of representative compound 2 in complex with hMAO B and hAChE enzymes, revealing inhibitor/protein key contacts and the likely molecular rationale for enzyme selectivity. Compound 2 was also demonstrated to be a strong inhibitor of Aβ(42) aggregation, with potency comparable to quercetin. Accordingly, atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the most promising naphthoquinones 2 and 5 and anthraquinones 11 and 12 were able to impair Aβ(42) fibrillation, deconstructing the morphologies of its fibrillar aggregates. Moreover, the same compounds exerted a moderate neuroprotective effect against Aβ(42) toxicity in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that these molecules may represent valuable chemotypes toward the development of promising candidates for AD therapy.","Campora, Marta; Canale, Claudio; Gatta, Elena; Tasso, Bruno; Laurini, Erik; Relini, Annalisa; Pricl, Sabrina; Catto, Marco; Tonelli, Michele",ACS Chem Neurosci,143,1

However, limited data exists on the impact of dapivirine on the vaginal microenvironment in adolescents. DESIGN: A comprehensive metaproteomics approach was used to assess host proteome and microbiome changes in cervicovaginal mucus with dapivirine ring use in adolescents enrolled in the MTN-023/IPM 030 (MTN-023) trial. METHODS: Participants were randomized 3 : 1 to use dapivirine or placebo vaginal rings monthly for 6 months. Cervicovaginal samples from a subset of 35 participants (8 placebo, 27 dapivirine) were analyzed. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis identified 405 human and 2467 bacterial proteins belonging to 15 unique genera. The host proteome belonged to many functional pathways primarily related to inflammation. When stratified by study treatment arm, 18 (4.4%) and 28 (6.9%) human proteins were differentially abundant (adjusted P < 0.05) between baseline and follow-up in the placebo and dapivirine arms, respectively.

If drying is not done to a sufficient degree of moisture during food processing and storage, where dried foods are processed, sometimes the minimum value is reached for the growth of microorganisms. In dry foods, some pathogens, yeast and molds can continue to grow during storage, transport and transportation until the sale and they causing spoilage.

Accidental factors often lead to short-term sharp fluctuations in stock markets, deviating from the original normal trend. The short-term fluctuation of stock price has high noise, which is not conducive to the prediction of stock trends. Therefore, we used discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based denoising to denoise stock data. Denoising the stock data assisted us to eliminate the influences of short-term random events on the continuous trend of the stock. The denoised data showed more stable trend characteristics and smoothness. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the effective training algorithms for fully connected single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), which possesses the advantages of fast convergence, unique results, and it does not converge to a local minimum. Therefore, this paper proposed a combination of ELM- and DWT-based denoising to predict the trend of stocks. The proposed method was used to predict the trend of 400 stocks in China.

Leptin controls the normal physiology of the female reproductive system; it interacts with the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis by a complex mechanism that connects energy homeostasis with reproduction. However, observational studies have demonstrated inconsistent results about leptin variation during normal menstrual cycle, and the mechanisms involved in the interplay between leptin and the hormones of the HPG axis are largely unknown. This review focuses on leptin variation during normal menstrual cycles and its relation to the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, and the effect of overweight/obesity on leptin during menstrual cycle is further reviewed.","Salem, Ayad Mohammed",Int J Womens Health,143,13

Here, we demonstrate the use of the rapid affinity pair identification via directed selection (RAPIDS) method to discover multiple affinity pairs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), a biomarker of COVID-19, from in vitro libraries in 10 weeks. The pair with the highest biomarker sensitivity was then integrated into a 10-minute, vertical-flow cellulose paper test. Notably, the as-identified affinity proteins were compatible with a roll-to-roll printing process for large-scale manufacturing of tests. The test achieved 40 pM and 80 pM limits of detection in 1×PBS (mock swab) and saliva matrices spiked with cell-culture generated SARS-CoV-2 viruses and is also capable of detection of N-protein from characterized clinical swab samples. Hence, this work paves the way towards the mass production of cellulose paper-based assays which can address the shortages faced due to dependence on nitrocellulose and current manufacturing techniques. Further, the results reported herein indicate the promise of RAPIDS and engineered binder proteins for the timely and flexible development of clinically relevant diagnostic tests in response to emerging infectious diseases.","Kim, Seunghyeon; Yee, Emma; Miller, Eric A.; Hao, Yining; Tay, Dousabel M.

As there is a growing interest in using large amount of image data for research purpose and acquisition of large amount of medical image is now a standard practice in the clinical setting, efficient handling and storage of large amount of image data is important in both the clinical and research setting. In this study, four classes of images were created, namely, CT (computed tomography) of abdomen, CT of brain, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain and MRI of spine. After converting these images into JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format, our proposed CNN architecture could automatically classify these 4 groups of medical images by both their image modality and anatomic location. We achieved excellent overall classification accuracy in both validation and test sets (> 99.5%), specificity and F1 score (> 99%) in each category of this dataset which contained both diseased and normal images. Our study has shown that using CNN for medical image classification is a promising methodology and could work on non-DICOM images, which could potentially save image processing time and storage space.","Chiang, Chen-Hua; Weng, Chi-Lun; Chiu, Hung-Wen",PLoS One,143,1

Despite much focus on enteral applications, there has been a lack of research focused on potential benefits of 3D printing for parenteral applications such as wound dressings, biomedical devices, and regenerative medicines. 3D printing technologies, including fused deposition modeling, vat polymerization, and powder bed printing, allow for rapid prototyping of personalized medications, capable of producing dosage forms with flexible dimensions based on patient anatomy as well as dosage form properties such as porosity. Considerations such as printing properties and material selection play a key role in determining overall printability of the constructs. These parameters also impact drug release kinetics, and mechanical properties of final printed constructs, which play a role in modulating immune response upon insertion in the body. Despite challenges in sterilization of printed constructs, additional post-printing processing procedures, and lack of regulatory guidance, 3D printing will continue to evolve to meet the needs of developing effective, personalized medicines for parenteral applications.","Ivone, Ryan; Yang, Yan; Shen, Jie",AAPS J,143,1

While shifting workers from manual to mechanical means of de-sludging remains a priority, this paper highlights that there are a number of safety issues, including exposure to sludge, faced by sanitation workers, even in a mechanised context, where de-sludging trucks are utilised to provide de-sludging services. Based on a detailed analysis of observation of stakeholders and extensive process documentation (of de-sludging process), and expert interviews, the study identified three key safety concerns: inhalation of harmful gases, contact with sludge, and physical injury, and determined the underlying cause for the same, using a systems thinking approach. These causes are varied including behaviours and practices by households such as non-compliance of septic tank construction to design standards, irregular cleaning, improper disposal of inappropriate items in toilets; inappropriate or inadequate design of decanting stations, tools and equipment, and inadequate awareness and knowledge among all stakeholders. Using the hierarchy of controls framework, a set of measures are described to increase the safety of workers. These proposed interventions go beyond the provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and range from behaviour change campaigns, improvements in decanting stations, better access to appropriately designed tools. The study highlights the need to place emphasis on eliminating, substituting and controlling the hazards as necessary steps for PPE to be relevant. Finally, the paper places the issue of occupational safety within the larger context of the informal nature of de-sludging occupation and the overall vulnerability of workers. It posits that this makes safety more complicated to address as several factors need to be taken into account, and actions are required by multiple sets of actors.","Gautam, Mamta; Wankhade, Kavita; Sarangan, Gayathri; Sudhakar, Srinithi",J Environ Manage,143,22

The short GDS versions that have four (GDS-4) and five items (GDS-5) represent alternatives for depression screening in limited-resource settings. However, their accuracy remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of the GDS-4 and GDS-5 versions for depression screening in older adults. METHODS: Until May 2020, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar; for studies that have assessed the sensitivity and specificity of GDS-4 and GDS-5 for depression screening in older adults. We conducted meta-analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of those studies that used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) as reference standard. Study quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. We performed bivariate random-effects meta-analyses to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) at each reported common cut-off. For the overall meta-analyses, we evaluated each GDS-4 version or GDS-5 version separately by each cut-off, and for investigations of heterogeneity, we assessed altogether across similar GDS versions by each cut-off. Also, we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included and meta-analyzed, assessing eleven different GDS versions. The number of participants included was 5048. When including all versions together, at a cut-off 2, GDS-4 had a pooled sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70–0.82) and a pooled specificity of 0.75 (0.68–0.81); while GDS-5 had a pooled sensitivity of 0.85 (0.80–0.90) and a pooled specificity of 0.75 (0.69–0.81). We found results for more than one GDS-4 version at cut-off points 1, 2, and 3; and for more than one GDS-5 version at cut-off points 1, 2, 3, and 4. Mostly, significant subgroup differences at different test thresholds across versions were found. The accuracy of the different GDS-4 and GDS-5 versions showed a high heterogeneity. There was high risk of bias in the index test domain. Also, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low for most of the GDS versions. CONCLUSIONS: We found several GDS-4 and GDS-5 versions that showed great heterogeneity in estimates of sensitivity and specificity, mostly with a low or very low certainty of the evidence. Altogether, our results indicate the need for more well-designed studies that compare different GDS versions.","Brañez-Condorena, Ana; Soriano-Moreno, David R.; Navarro-Flores, Alba; Solis-Chimoy, Blanca; Diaz-Barrera, Mario E.; Taype-Rondan, Alvaro",PLoS One,143,11

In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of fresh brain and lung tissues from EV71-infected mice at 7 days post infection. We detected a perturbed expression of 148 proteins in the brain and 78 proteins in the lung after EV71 expression. Further analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins in the brain are involved in a variety of fundamental biological pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades, innate and adaptive immune responses, platelet activation, and nitrogen metabolism, and those proteins in the lung participate in innate and adaptive immune responses, phagosome, arginine biosynthesis, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 signaling pathway. Our results suggested that immune activation, complement and coagulation dysfunction, platelet activation, imbalance of nitrogen metabolism, and hypoxia could be involved in the pathogenesis of EV71, which explains the major clinical manifestation of hyperinflammatory status of severe HFMD cases. Our study provides further understanding of the molecular basis of EV71 pathogenesis.","Jin, Yuefei; Li, Dong; Sun, Tiantian; Du, Yue; Gao, Yanlei; Ding, Ronghua; Ji, Wangquan; Zhang, Weiguo; Yang, Haiyan; Chen, Shuaiyin; Duan, Guangcai",Front Microbiol,143,7

Though Africa carries the highest burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, the region is only now being primed to conduct HIC relevant to its population. Given the imminent introduction of HIC in Zambia, we sought to understand potential participants’ willingness to volunteer for such studies. We used a qualitative exploratory approach to understand the potential participants’ perceptions on willingness to participate in HIC using the example of typhoid. Healthy adults, recruited using random selection and purposive sampling from higher learning institutions in Lusaka, participated in 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) respectively. Participants considered typhoid a serious disease with potential for life-long consequences and death. After sharing audio-visual materials introducing the concepts of HIC, some participants expressed open willingness to participate or alternatively the need to consult parents and professors, and expressed fear of death and illness. Though willing to be quarantined for up to six months, participants expressed concerns regarding separation from family and duties, having insufficient information to decide, inadequate access to care, severe disease, life-long injury or side-effects, death, and vaccine failure. These concerns along with possibility of underlying conditions that compromise individual immunity, competing priorities, parental refusal, and distrust of study or vaccine efficacy could lead to refusal to participate. Reasons for willingness to participate included monetary compensation, altruism and being part of a team that comes up with a vaccine. Though afraid of deliberate typhoid infection, potential participants are willing to consider participation if given adequate information, time to consult trusted persons, compensation and assurance of adequate care.","Kunda-Ngándu, Evelyn Muleba; Chirwa-Chobe, Masuzyo; Mwamba, Chanda; Chipungu, Jenala; Ng’andu, Esnart; Mwanyungwi Chinganya, Hope; Simuyandi, Michelo; Chilengi, Roma; Sharma, Anjali",PLoS One,143,1

It has been argued that disconnects between human experience and sensory inputs can be addressed better through further development of predictive processing theory. In this paper, the scope of predictive processing theory is extended through three developments. First, by going beyond previous studies that have encompassed embodied cognition but have not addressed some fundamental aspects of psychomotor functioning. Second, by proposing a scientific basis for explaining predictive processing that spans objective neuroscience and subjective experience. Third, by providing an explanation of predictive processing that can be incorporated into the planning and operation of systems involving robots and other new technologies. This is necessary because such systems are becoming increasingly common and move us farther away from the hunter-gatherer lifestyles within which our psychomotor functioning evolved. For example, beliefs that workplace robots are threatening can generate anxiety, while wearing hardware, such as augmented reality headsets and exoskeletons, can impede the natural functioning of psychomotor systems. The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new formulation of hierarchical predictive processing that is focused on psychomotor functioning.","Fox, Stephen",Entropy (Basel),143,5

Reassortment may also produce phylogenetic incongruities and weakly linked evolutionary histories across the 11 segments, obscuring reassortment-specific epistasis and changes in substitution rates. To determine the co-segregation patterns of RVA segments, we generated time-scaled phylogenetic trees for each of the 11 segments of 789 complete RVA genomes isolated from mammalian hosts and compared the segments’ geodesic distances. We found that segments 4 (VP4) and 9 (VP7) occupied significantly different tree spaces from each other and from the rest of the genome. By contrast, segments 10 and 11 (NSP4 and NSP5/6) occupied nearly indistinguishable tree spaces, suggesting strong co-segregation. Host-species barriers appeared to vary by segment, with segment 9 (VP7) presenting the weakest association with host species. Bayesian Skyride plots were generated for each segment to compare relative genetic diversity among segments over time. All segments showed a dramatic decrease in diversity around 2007 coinciding with the introduction of RVA vaccines. To assess selection pressures, codon adaptation indices and relative codon deoptimization indices were calculated with respect to different host genomes. Codon usage varied by segment with segment 11 (NSP5) exhibiting significantly higher adaptation to host genomes. Furthermore, RVA codon usage patterns appeared optimized for expression in humans and birds relative to the other hosts examined, suggesting that translational efficiency is not a barrier in RVA zoonosis.","Hoxie, Irene; Dennehy, John J.",Viruses,143,1

Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat breast cancer, reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery. However, the eradication of radioresistant cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, remains the main challenge of radiotherapy. Recently, lipid droplets (LDs) have been proposed as functional markers of cancer stem cells, also being involved in increased cell tumorigenicity. LD biogenesis is a multistep process requiring various enzymes, including Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). In this context, we evaluated the effect of PF-06424439, a selective DGAT2 inhibitor, on MCF7 breast cancer cells exposed to X-rays. Our results demonstrated that 72 h of PF-06424439 treatment reduced LD content and inhibited cell migration, without affecting cell proliferation. Interestingly, PF-06424439 pre-treatment followed by radiation was able to enhance radiosensitivity of MCF7 cells. In addition, the combined treatment negatively interfered with lipid metabolism-related genes, as well as with EMT gene expression, and modulated the expression of typical markers associated with the CSC-like phenotype. These findings suggest that PF-06424439 pre-treatment coupled to X-ray exposure might potentiate breast cancer cell radiosensitivity and potentially improve the radiotherapy effectiveness.","Nisticò, Clelia; Pagliari, Francesca; Chiarella, Emanuela; Fernandes Guerreiro, Joana; Marafioti, Maria Grazia; Aversa, Ilenia; Genard, Geraldine; Hanley, Rachel; Garcia-Calderón, Daniel; Bond, Heather Mandy; Mesuraca, Maria; Tirinato, Luca; Spadea, Maria Francesca; Seco, Joao Carlos",Int J Mol Sci,143,17

However, the immunomodulatory and symptomatic treatment options in this population group are still limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elucidate the prescription frequency of medications used in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) compared with the general population, considering the entire spectrum of medications prescribed. METHODS: Based on nationwide outpatient drug prescription data and statutory health insurance (SHI) physicians’ claims data from 2018, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in Germany. Children and adolescents aged ⩽17 years (n = 11,381,939) diagnosed with MS (n = 613), and a matched (age, sex, and health insurance sector) control group (n = 6130) were included. The prescription prevalence was measured as the proportion of MS patients with ⩾1 prescription. RESULTS: Of the 613 pediatric PwMS with a median age of 16 years, 403 (65.7%) were female. For 15 out of the 18 different active agents analyzed, PwMS had a significantly higher prescription prevalence than the control group (Fisher’s exact test: p ⩽ 0.037). The most frequently prescribed drugs in PwMS were ibuprofen (28.4%; anti-inflammatory drug), cholecalciferol (23.0%; vitamin D3), and interferon beta-1a (21.5%; disease-modifying drug, DMD). The proportions of DMD prescriptions and antibiotic prescriptions were higher among PwMS aged 15–17 years than among those ⩽14 years (DMD: 43.4% vs 34.2%, p = 0.05; antibiotic: 34.1% vs 24.8%, p = 0.031). In contrast, younger PwMS were more likely to receive a prescription for anti-inflammatory/anti-rheumatic drugs (36.6% vs 26.5%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our study analyzing real-world medication data showed that interferon beta, anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamins play an essential role in the treatment of pediatric PwMS. Future research should evaluate longitudinal treatment patterns of pediatric PwMS, paying particular attention to the time of diagnosis, time of first DMD initiation, and therapy switches.","Frahm, Niklas; Peters, Melanie; Bätzing, Jörg; Ellenberger, David; Akmatov, Manas K.; Haas, Judith; Rommer, Paulus S.; Stahmann, Alexander; Zettl, Uwe K.; Holstiege, Jakob",Ther Adv Neurol Disord,143,22

In this article, we estimate how the causal impact of the ACA on insurance coverage changed during 2017 through 2019, the first 3 years of the Trump administration, compared to 2016. Data come from the 2011–2019 waves of the American Community Survey (ACS), with the sample restricted to non-elderly adults. Our model leverages variation in treatment intensity from state Medicaid expansion decisions and pre-ACA uninsured rates. We find that the coverage gains from the components of the law that took effect nationally—such as the individual mandate and regulations and subsidies in the private non-group market—fell from 5 percentage points in 2016 to 3.6 percentage points in 2019. In contrast, the coverage gains from the Medicaid expansion increased in 2017 (7.0 percentage points) before returning to the 2016 level of coverage gains in 2019 (5.9 percentage points). The net effect of the ACA in expansion states is a combination of these trends, with coverage gains falling from 10.8 percentage points in 2016 to 9.6 percentage points in 2019.","Courtemanche, Charles; Fazlul, Ishtiaque; Marton, James; Ukert, Benjamin; Yelowitz, Aaron; Zapata, Daniela",Inquiry,143,22

Aspiration can lead to chemical pneumonitis (inflammatory reaction to the gastric contents), or aspiration pneumonia (infection caused by inhalation of microorganisms). Distinguishing between the two types is challenging. We tested the interest of using a decisional algorithm based on procalcitonin (PCT) values to guide initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapies in intubated patients. METHODS: The PROPASPI (PROcalcitonin Pneumonia/pneumonitis Associated with ASPIration) trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, superiority study comparing two strategies: (1) an intervention group where threshold PCT values were used to guide initiation and discontinuation of antibiotics (PCT group); and (2) a control group, where antibiotic therapy was managed at the physician’s discretion. Patients aged 18 years or over, intubated for coma (Glasgow score ≤ 8), with MV initiated within 48 h after admission, were eligible. The primary endpoint was the duration of antibiotic treatment during the first 15 days after admission to the ICU. RESULTS: From 24/2/2015 to 28/8/2019, 1712 patients were intubated for coma in the 5 participating centers, of whom 166 were included in the study. Data from 159 were available for intention-to-treat analysis: 81 in the PCT group, and 78 in the control group. Overall, 67 patients (43%) received antibiotics in the intensive care unit (ICU); there was no significant difference between groups (37 (46%) vs 30 (40%) for PCT vs control, p = 0.432). The mean duration of antibiotic treatment during the first 15 days in the ICU was 2.7 ± 3.8 days; there was no significant difference between groups (3.0 ± 4.1 days vs 2.3 ± 3.4 days for PCT vs control, p = 0.311). The mean number of days under MV was significantly higher in the PCT group (3.7 ± 3.6 days) than in controls (2.7 ± 2.5 days, p = 0.033). The duration of ICU stay was also significantly longer in the PCT group: 6.4 ± 6.5 days vs 4.6 ± 3.5 days in the control group (p = 0.043). After adjustment for SAPS II score, the difference in length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation between groups was no longer significant.

Community-based surveillance and control interventions have been heavily promoted but the most effective interventions have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: This review evaluated evidence for the effectiveness of community-based surveillance interventions at monitoring and identifying emerging infectious disease; the effectiveness of community-based control interventions at reducing rates of emerging infectious disease; and contextual factors that influence intervention effectiveness. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants Communities in Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. Types of intervention(s) Non-pharmaceutical, non-vaccine, and community-based surveillance or prevention and control interventions targeting rabies, Nipah virus, dengue, SARS or avian influenza. Types of outcomes Primary outcomes: measures: of infection or disease; secondary outcomes: measures of intervention function. Types of studies Original quantitative studies published in English. SEARCH STRATEGY: Databases searched (1980 to 2011): PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, WHOLIS, British Development Library, LILACS, World Bank (East Asia), Asian Development Bank. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Two independent reviewers critically appraised studies using standard Joanna Briggs Institute instruments. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: A customised tool was used to extract quantitative data on intervention(s), populations, study methods, and primary and secondary outcomes; and qualitative contextual information or narrative evidence about interventions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data was synthesised in a narrative summary with the aid of tables. Meta-analysis was used to statistically pool quantitative results. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included. Vector control interventions using copepods, environmental cleanup and education are effective and sustainable at reducing dengue in rural and urban communities, whilst insecticide spraying is effective in urban outbreak situations. Community-based surveillance interventions can effectively identify avian influenza in backyard flocks, but have not been broadly applied. Outbreak control interventions for Nipah virus and SARS are effective but may not be suitable for ongoing control. Canine vaccination and education is more acceptable than culling, but still fails to reach coverage levels required to effectively control rabies. Contextual factors were identified that influence community engagement with, and ultimately effectiveness of, interventions. CONCLUSION: Despite investment in community-based disease control and surveillance in Southeast Asia, published evidence evaluating interventions is limited in quantity and quality. Nonetheless this review identified a number of effective interventions, and several contextual factors influencing effectiveness. Identification of the best programs will require comparative evidence of effectiveness acceptability, cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Implications for practice Interventions are more effective if there are high levels of community ownership and engagement. Linkages between veterinary and public health surveillance systems are essential. Interventions are not well accepted when they fail to acknowledge the importance of animals for economic activity in communities. Implications for research Evidence is needed on functioning and outcomes of current surveillance systems and novel low-cost methods of surveillance. Evaluations of control interventions should control for confounding and report measures of disease, cost and sustainability. Translational research is needed to assess generalisability and evaluate roll-out of effective interventions as regional or national programs.","Halton, Kate; Sarna, Mohinder; Barnett, Adrian; Leonardo, Lydia; Graves, Nicholas",JBI Database System Rev Implement Rep,143,1

METHODS: We conducted active, prospective surveillance for ARIs (defined as ≥2 new signs/symptoms of respiratory illness) among all residents in three PCCFs near New York City from December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017. The parents/guardians of some residents also provided consent for research specimen collection at the start of the study. In that subset, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained ≤4 days of ARI symptom onset and weekly for 4 weeks of follow-up to assess viral shedding. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), parainfluenzavirus (PIV 1–4), metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), enterovirus, parechovirus, and M. pneumoniae were tested by the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 real-time RT-PCR panel. RESULTS: Subset with research specimen collection: Among 79 residents (aged 0–20 years, median = 8), 60 ARIs were reported in 37 (47%) residents. Swabs were obtained at illness onset for 53/60 ARI episodes; among these, there were 25 single-virus detections and five co-detections. An additional 33 single- and five co-detections occurred in 175 follow-up swabs (table). Molecular typing of 32 RV+ specimens identified 13 RV types. All residents: During the 2016–2017 influenza season, 308/322 (96%) age-eligible residents received influenza vaccine and 168/364 (46%) received prophylactic antivirals for influenza exposures. Although influenza was not detected in research swabs, it was detected in 3/200 tests conducted for clinical purposes. CONCLUSION: ARIs were common among residents of three PCCFs, and a variety of respiratory viruses were detected. The rarity of influenza may reflect strong infection control practices in these facilities, including vaccination and prophylactic use of antivirals.

In most cases, the pregnancy is uneventful and where infections do arise, these are often relatively minor and easily treatable, e.g. urinary tract infection and vaginal thrush. However, sepsis is now the leading cause of maternal deaths in the UK accounting for 26 deaths between 2006 and 2008 and there has been an increase in death due to community-acquired Group A streptococcal (GAS) (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) disease [1]. A literature review of 55 pregnancies with symptomatic Groups A streptococcal infection since 1966 recorded early onset septic shock in 91 % with a maternal mortality rate of 58 % but the mortality has improved to 32 % in recent years [2]. Furthermore, when toxic shock syndrome due to Group A streptococci (can also be caused by Staphylococcus aureus) occurs during pregnant, it can have devasting consequences with multi-organ failure and a mortality of over 50 % in reported cases [3]. A recent review from the UK covers many of the important issues associated with GAS in the obstetrical setting including the its diverse manifestations, the need to manage puerperal sepsis caused by GAS quickly, suggested initial antibiotic therapy (e.g. cefuroxime and metronidazole until confirmed), and issues such as prophylaxis for contacts and the possible role of intravenous immunoglobulins [4].","Humphreys, Hilary; Winter, Bob; Paul, Mical",Infections in the Adult Intensive Care Unit,143,17

This chapter draws on four studies that examine Hong Kong secondary students’ informal reasoning for decision-making about socioscientific issues in the areas of health and ecology. While some of these studies involved decision-making about issues within the context of Hong Kong, others engaged students in reasoning on regional or global issues with due consideration to the decision of their counterparts in other contexts or cultures. Three distinctive patterns of reasoning among Hong Kong students emerge from this review. These include their general ability to reason from multiple perspectives, insufficient use of scientific evidence to inform decision-making, and the tendency to change their decision through interactions with peers. Furthermore, the use of a decision-making framework to guide students’ decision-making and the impacts of interpersonal exchanges both within and across contextual or cultural groups on students’ decisions were discussed.","Lee, Yeung Chung","Chinese Science Education in the 21st Century: Policy, Practice, and Research",143,1

Organophosphates are the most common agrochemical poisons followed closely by herbicides. Many agricultural poisons, such as parathion and paraquat are now mixed with a coloring agent such as indigocarmine to prevent their use criminally. In addition, paraquat is fortified with a “stenching” agent. Organo-chlorines have an entirely different mechanism of action. Whereas organophosphates have an anticholinesterase activity, organochlorines act on nerve cells interfering with the transmission of impulses through them. A kerosene-like smell also emanates from death due to organochlorines. The diagnosis lies in the chemical identification of organochlorines in the stomach contents or viscera. Organochlorines also resist putrefaction and can be detected long after death. Paraquat has been involved in suicidal, accidental, and homicidal poisonings. It is mildly corrosive and ulceration around lips and mouth is common in this poisoning. However, the hallmark of paraquat poisoning, especially when the victim has survived a few days, are the profound changes in lungs. Other agrochemicals such as algicides, aphicides, herbicide safeneres, fertilizers, and so on, are less commonly encountered. Governments in most countries have passed legislations to prevent accidental poisonings with these agents. The US government passed the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) in 1962 and the Indian government passed The Insecticides Act in 1968. Among other things, these acts require manufacturers to use signal words on the labels of insecticides, so the public is warned of their toxicity and accompanying danger.","Aggrawal, Anil",Forensic Pathology Reviews,143,1

Prior to that time, the biological actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) were being investigated as it relates to cardiovascular function, including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and failure, as well as biological actions in the brain and kidney. We now know that Ang II elicits a whole host of actions both within and outside of the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, the discovery of Ang-(1-7) by our laboratory was also the first indication of a biologically active angiotensin peptide that further studies revealed served to counter-balance the actions of Ang II. This chapter reviews the data demonstrating the role of the vasodepressor axis of the renin angiotensin system in the regulation of cardiovascular function and the new data that shows the existence of angiotensin-(1-12) as a novel alternate substrate for the production of angiotensin peptides. The ultimate role of this discovery, as well as the continuing elucidation of mechanisms pertaining to RAS physiology, will likely be clarified in the coming years, in hopes of improving the treatment of cardiovascular disease.","Trask, Aaron J.; Varagic, Jasmina; Ahmad, Sarfaraz; Ferrario, Carlos M.",Renin Angiotensin System and Cardiovascular Disease,143,1

The most common causes are childhood lower respiratory tract infection, hematopoietic stem cell or lung and heart-lung transplantation, and toxic fume inhalation. The most frequent clinical manifestations are progressive dyspnea and dry cough. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate airflow obstruction and air trapping. Radiographic manifestations include reduction of the peripheral vascular markings, increased lung lucency, and overinflation. The chest radiograph, however, is often normal. High-resolution CT is currently the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of patients with suspected or proven OB. The characteristic findings on high-resolution CT consist of areas of decreased attenuation and vascularity (mosaic perfusion pattern) on inspiratory scans and air trapping on expiratory scans. Other CT findings of OB include bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, bronchial wall thickening, small centrilobular nodules, and three-in-bud opacities. Recent studies suggest that hyperpolarized (3)He-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging may allow earlier recognition of obstructive airway disease and therefore may be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with OB.","Silva, C.

The common imaging finding is usually as a lung infiltrate or consolidation of some type of distribution or another. Trying to find the putative cause for the imaging pattern is a good first step in narrowing the differential diagnosis and answering the question: what accounts for this pattern on imaging studies? Most of these diseases have an acute or subacute onset and exhibit restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. When treated promptly, they resolve completely with little or no residual injury to the lung architecture. On a small biopsy it is important to have a clinical history and imaging results before embarking on a descriptive rather than a definitive diagnosis. The smaller the sample, the more information is needed to complete the picture. Pulmonologists should be advised to target the part of the lung that should provide the most information related to the process under investigation. An endobronchial wall biopsy is not suitable in the setting of investigating a lung infiltrate as part of the alveolated lung has to be included. The category of airspace-occupying diseases of the lung includes: 1. Acute lung infections such as bacterial and viral pneumonias. 2. Acute lung injury pattern which includes bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. 3. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage. 4. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 5. Pulmonary edema. 6. Pneumocystis pneumonia. 7. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis. In all of these instances, there are ground-glass opacities obscuring the air space. Most clinicians would describe the imaging as “infiltrate” or “consolidation.” The task for the pathologist is to find the pertinent finding that could account for the imaging.","Fraig, Mostafa M.",Diagnosis of Small Lung Biopsy,143,1

It starts with the meaning of sociology and its links to health studies—a definition and brief history of medical sociology and topic description of the discipline. All health problems are conceived as social problems, which are the core focus of sociological studies. This chapter explains the characteristics of social problems with regard to health issues. Health problems are viewed as parts of social pathologies by advancing the sociological dimensions of health problems. The chapter then attempts to re-explain the topical description of medical sociology (first advanced by David Mechanic in 1968) and includes some current issues. The topical descriptions specifically include social aetiology of disease, cultural beliefs and social response to illness, sociology of medical care and hospitals, sociology of psychiatry, social transition and health care, traditional medicine (alternative medicine), sociology of bioethics, health policy and politics, social epidemiology, sociology of dying and death, and medical education.","Amzat, Jimoh; Razum, Oliver",Medical Sociology in Africa,143,1

The prevalence of POTS has been estimated as 500,000–3,000,000 patients in the USA. Because it affects mainly women between 13 and 50 years of age, the impact on productivity at work and lifestyle can be devastating. Considerable clinical overlap exists between POTS and vasovagal syncope (VVS) with patients experiencing similar orthostatic symptoms related to insufficient adaptation to blood volume shifts during upright posture. Nevertheless, differences emerge during head up tilt table testing. In patients with POTS, during upright tilt, sympathetic tone increases, there is an early and sustained tachycardia, and patients complain of presyncope without frank syncope. In contrast, patients with VVS experience delayed symptoms and abrupt drops in BP and HR and are more likely to lose consciousness. Treatment of POTS includes exercise and medications directed at decreasing sympathetic tone or increasing blood volume.","Garland, Emily M.; Raj, Satish R.",Vasovagal Syncope,143,1

After cardiovascular disease, infection is the second leading cause of death in recipients with allograft function (Snyder et al. 2009). The immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent organ rejection places the kidney transplant recipient at increased risk for donor-derived, nosocomial, and community-acquired infections as well as reactivation of latent pathogens. Pretransplant screening, immunizations, and optimal antibacterial and antiviral prophylaxis can help to reduce the impact of infection. Awareness of the approach to infection in the transplant recipient including diagnostic and management strategies is essential to optimizing outcomes.","Nambiar, Puja; Silibovsky, Randi; Belden, Katherine A.",Contemporary Kidney Transplantation,143,19

Emphasis has been placed on publicly available tools and particularly on KNIME (Konstanz Information Miner), the most widely used freely available platform for data processing and analysis. Among a multitude of studies that have demonstrated the usefulness of chemoinformatics tools to chemical and medicinal applications, herein we present indicative cases of five successful KNIME-based approaches. The first two studies include the risk assessment of nanoparticles (NPs) through the Enalos InSilicoNano platform, namely, (1) the prediction of the toxicity of iron oxide NPs and (2) the cellular uptake prediction of computationally designed NPs with the aid of reliable quantitative nanostructure–activity relationships (QNAR) models. The third case study deals with the recognition of organic substances as corrosion inhibitors though the construction of predictive quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR) models with Enalos KNIME nodes. Finally, two more cases are briefly described and involve the accurate prediction of yellow fever inhibitors from the ChEMBL database and the de novo design of compounds with the reaction vectors methodology. The aim of this work is to familiarize the interested reader with the freely available in silico tools in KNIME analytics platform and to demonstrate their value and effectiveness toward specific computational applications.","Leonis, Georgios; Melagraki, Georgia; Afantitis, Antreas",Handbook of Computational Chemistry,143,1

Although, probably not as frequent in laboratory mouse colonies as it used to be, LDV infection may affect experimental results, primarily through its effects on the host immune responses. On the other hand, because of its unique properties, LDV infections serve as a good animal model for viral persistence, virally induced immunomodulation, and pathogenic infection of neurons in the central nervous system. However, the inability of LDV to infect in transformed cell lines and to cause a detectable cytopathic effect in cell cultures in which it replicates, such as mouse peritoneal exudate cells, represents technical obstacles to the further analysis of this virus. Identification of the cell receptor utilized by LDV would constitute a major advance, since this might lead to the creation of a cell line permissive to LDV infection. Whereas LDV is a natural and sometimes pathogenic infectious agent of the mouse, it does not currently represent a major threat to animal facilities. The virus is not very contagious and there are a number of easy methods available to detect infected mice. Moreover, further study of the interaction between relatively silent viruses, such as LDV, and their host species should lead to new insights into the mechanisms by which viruses can establish and maintain relatively harmless, persistent infections in their hosts.","Coutelier, Jean-Paul; A.

This paper summarizes the results of an infectious disease surveillance program, initially designed to monitor the infectious agents associated with clinically normal and clinically ill cheetahs in captivity, but subsequently supplemented with data from free‐living cheetahs. The focus was on two viral infections, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and feline rhinotracheitis virus. Results indicated that between 1989 and 1991, there was an increase in the seroprevalence (number antibody‐positive animals) of cheetahs to feline coronavirus from 41% to 64% in captivity. During this same time period, there were only two documented cases of FIP in cheetahs in the United States. The results suggest that feline coronavirus (feline enteric coronavirus‐‐feline infectious peritonitis group) or a closely related coronavirus of cheetahs is becoming endemic in the captive cheetah population. Further serologic results from 39 free‐living cheetahs demonstrated that there was a high seroprevalence (61%) to feline coronavirus, although serum antibody titers were considerably lower than those encountered in captive cheetahs. The observation of a high percentage of free‐living cheetahs, which were seropositive to feline herpesvirus (44%), was unexpected, since it has been generally regarded that this infection is primarily associated with cheetahs in captivity. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","Evermann, James F.; Laurenson, M.

The epidemiological occurrence of different virus diseases shows marked variations. These concern seasonal and geographical distribution, in addition to the occurrence of diseases in different ages, sexes, and races. The distribution of a disease in a population can also be determined by measurements of immunity to the infectious agent in different age groups, so called seroepidemiology. A prerequisite for such studies is that suitable serological methods are used and that samples are collected from a representative fraction of the population. In the beginning of an acute epidemic, it is particularly important to identify the causative agent. To understand the mechanisms of the spread of infections, three basic circumstances must be taken into consideration, namely, the reservoir and source of infection, the transmission from this source, and the availability of susceptible hosts.","Böttiger, Margareta; Norrby, Erling",Textbook of Medical Virology,143,17

The present study uses bibliometric and network embeddedness indicators to analyze the scientific activity on ventilator-associated pneumonia and the roles of 17 research communities and 30 cut-points therein. In addition to fostering network connectivity and cohesion, cut-points are characterized by other differential features compared to other authors, including a much higher level of productivity and greater participation in leadership positions, higher betweenness values, lower clustering coefficients and higher levels of constraint. The cut-points identified have different characteristics in terms of the connectivity they facilitate between research communities: some cut-points have established weak intercommunity ties in the form of bridges with a single author from a different community; in other cases, they serve as gatekeepers due to their connection with different authors of a community that they link with their own; cut-points may also act as structural folds, that is, actors with an overlapping role between two cohesive communities. The cut-points present very diverse connectivity degrees, with some cut-points whose elimination would provoke severe network fragmentation and others who are responsible for linking far fewer external authors to their network. The cut-points that present both the main mechanisms for obtaining social capital—that is, filling structural holes and participating in cohesive network structures—can be considered key actors/players because their participation is crucial for ensuring both integration into the main research focus of some communities with high research performance and the overall cohesion of a co-authorship network.","González-Alcaide, Gregorio; Pinargote, Héctor; Ramos, José M.",Scientometrics,143,1

However, although this increased attention has led to an enhancement of the software and algorithms behind this recognition process, the majority of research has still not addressed the issues of incorrect rotation or proximity between the finger and the device. Current systems assume that the direction of the imprinted finger will align with that of the target fingerprint image; this decreases the accuracy of fingerprint recognition across a variety of finger orientations and scenarios. In response to this use-case dilemma, this paper proposes a new technique of pattern matching that can account for this natural range of fingerprint orientations. This is achieved first through a preliminary stage of orientation identification, whereby the fingerprint image can be stored under multiple permutations by using approximate circular string-matching algorithms. This enables the database of images for each approximate permutation of orientation to be stored in advance. It can then be matched against the strong information of the fingerprint at its exact relative rotation of input. The improved accuracy of recognition demonstrated through the results of this study may enable the functionality of fingerprint recognition to adapt to challenging device form-factors and provide the accuracy needed for military and medical applications.","Alshammary, Miznah H.; Iliopoulos, Costas S.; Khan, Mujibur R.",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,143,1

Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. – We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. – We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. – We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. – The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. – Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),143,1

Therefore, improving their knowledge and practices would contribute significantly to infection control. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the level of understanding of senior dental students regarding the infection control in the dental practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental students (3rd year and 4th year) of the Foundation University Dental College, Pakistan. The sample consisted of 100 third year dental students and 88 fourth year students. A self-administrated questionnaire was used for data collection which consisted of fourteen close-ended items. Frequencies of knowledge, attitudes, and practice were calculated separately by using SPSS 21.0 software. RESULTS: Almost half of the students would not use any antiseptic for sterilizing their hands, and only two-third would ask their patient to use an oral mouth rinse before starting the treatment. Many students did not the optimal temperature of the autoclave for sterilization of the instruments. Only one-third would wear the personal protective equipment during a procedure. Around one-third of the study participants reported that ineffective sterilization during clinical practice can transmit infection from one patient to another. CONCLUSION: Knowledge on infection control among the dental students is though weak, practices are not as per standards but attitudes are positive and encouraging for taking steps and complying with measures on infection control.","Qamar, Mariam Khan; Shaikh, Babar Tasneem; Afzal, Aamir",Biomed Res Int,143,1

In our analysis, we report an iterated truncated differential leveraging on a particular property of the AES S-box that becomes useful due to the particular nature of the diffusion layer of the round function. The differential holds with a low probability of [Formula: see text] for one round which allows it to penetrate the same number of rounds as claimed by the designers, but with a much lower complexity. Moreover, it can be easily extended to a key-recovery attack at a little extra cost. We further report a Super-Sbox construction in the internal permutation, which is exploited using the Yoyo game to devise a 6-round deterministic distinguisher and a 7-round key recovery attack for the 128-bit internal permutation. Similar attacks can be mounted for the 64-bit and 256-bit variants. All these attacks outperform the existing results of the designers as well as other third-party results. The iterated truncated differentials can be tweaked to mount forgery attacks similar to the ones given by Eichlseder [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] Success probabilities of all the reported distinguishing attacks are shown to be high. All practical attacks have been experimentally verified.

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose [Formula: see text], a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. [Formula: see text] views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that [Formula: see text] significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, [Formula: see text] solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.","Golia, Priyanka; Roy, Subhajit; Meel, Kuldeep S.",Computer Aided Verification,143,1

This mood change is part of a set of behavioral symptoms called sickness behavior and has features in common with core symptoms of depression. Therefore, the physiological changes induced by immune activation, for example following infection, are in the spotlight for explaining mechanisms behind mental health challenges such as depression. While humans may take a day off and isolate themselves until they feel better, farm animals housed in groups have only limited possibilities for social withdrawal. We suggest that immune activation could be a major factor influencing social interactions in pigs, with outbreaks of damaging behavior such as tail biting as a possible result. The hypothesis presented here is that the effects of several known risk factors for tail biting are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteins produced by the immune system, and their effect on neurotransmitter systems. We describe the background for and implications of this hypothesis.","Nordgreen, Janicke; Edwards, Sandra A.; Boyle, Laura Ann; Bolhuis, J.

Many of these products are offered in single use packaging. Consequently, the waste produced by convenience food consumption is also growing. Information from literature and available data from companies provide are used to provide an overview of this waste. Even though plastics contribute a significant part to this waste, it is just a part of it. Additionally, the substitutes used instead of plastics nowadays are mostly designed for single-use application. In terms of resource sustainability, the avoidance of waste production should be imperative. With this respect re-use containers gain a growing interest and are discussed as a good future option for some convenience food sectors. Examples reveal that the annual waste production linked to takeaway food could be reduced by over 90% by implementation of re-use containers. Furthermore, they also reduce the cost of waste management, and create new job opportunities. However, besides opportunities there are challenges. The theoretical waste reduction potential is high, the one gained in practice, however, is rather low. This is due to customers and sales stuff alike. Furthermore, the infrastructure required for such systems to work smoothly is not available everywhere. Especially space for cleaning, drying and storage of the re-use containers is sparse, depending on the type of facility. Finally, questions concerning the material used for re-use containers remain unanswered yet.

Thus, although early re-laparotomy tends to be recommended, we conducted this study to evaluate the feasibility of performing definite laparotomy within ≤ 48 h in this clinical population. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 65 patients (n = 24, ≤ 48-h group; n = 41, > 48-h group) who underwent DCS and perihepatic packing. The primary outcome was the rate of repacking for bleeding during re-laparotomy and the secondary outcomes were mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The ≤ 48-h group had a higher rate of angioembolization and transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, but the rates of repacking and mortality were not significantly different between the groups. However, the incidence of pneumonia and ventilation support requirement were significantly lower in the ≤ 48-h group than in the > 48-h group. CONCLUSION: The re-laparotomy performed within ≤ 48 h after DCS and perihepatic packing is feasible for patients with high grade liver injury, using angioembolization and aggressive transfusion, as required. Early re-laparotomy reduces the need for prolonged ventilator support and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.","Kang, Byung Hee; Jung, Kyoungwon; Choi, Donghwan; Kwon, Junsik",Surg Today,143,20

This paper presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19 infection using the healthcare dataset. In the present work, a prognostic model using random forest classifier and support vector regression is developed for predicting the infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19, and it is applied on an open healthcare dataset containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the healthcare dataset include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, and marital status along with medical data like coma score, pulmonary score, blood glucose level, HDL cholesterol, etc. An effective preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical and categorical values (non-numerical) and missing data in the healthcare dataset. The correlation between the variables in the healthcare data is analyzed using the correlation coefficient, and heat map with a color code is used to identify the influencing factors on the infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. Based on the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-scores, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides an improved classification performance as compared to support vector regression for the given healthcare dataset. Android-based mobile application software platform is developed using the proposed prognostic approach for enabling the healthy individuals to predict the susceptibility infection score of COVID-19 to take the precautionary measures. Based on the results of the proposed method, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread. METHODS: In the present work, random forest classifier and support vector regression techniques are applied to a medical healthcare dataset containing 27 variables for predicting the susceptibility score of an individual towards COVID-19 infection, and the accuracy of prediction is compared. An effective preprocessing is carried for handling the missing data in the healthcare dataset. Correlation analysis using heat map is carried on the healthcare data for analyzing the influencing factors of infection susceptibility probability (ISP) score of COVID-19. A confusion matrix is calculated for understanding the performance of classification based on the number of true-positives, true-negatives, false-positives, and false-negatives. These values further used to calculate the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-scores. RESULTS: From the classification results, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides a classification accuracy of 99.7%, precision of 99.8%, sensitivity of 98.8%, and F-score of 99.29% for the given medical dataset. CONCLUSION: Proposed machine learning approach can help the individuals to take additional precautions for protecting people from the COVID-19 infection, and clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread.","Srivatsan, R.; Indi, Prithviraj N.; Agrahari, Swapnil; Menon, Siddharth; Ashok, S.

Phagocytosis or invasion by pathogens can affect mitochondrial metabolism in macrophages by diverse mechanisms and shape the macrophage response (proinflammatory vs. immunomodulatory) against pathogens. Besides β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate, reduced (NADPH) oxidase, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes release superoxide for direct killing of the pathogen. Mitochondria that are injured are removed by mitophagy, and this process can be critical for regulating macrophage activation. For example, impaired mitophagy can result in cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that can lead to activation of cGAS–STING signaling pathway of macrophage proinflammatory response. In this review, we will discuss how metabolism, mtDNA, mitophagy, and cGAS–STING pathway shape the macrophage response to infectious agents.","Choudhuri, Subhadip; Chowdhury, Imran Hussain; Garg, Nisha Jain",Front Immunol,143,0

First, exposure to a news item that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps.

Due to the unique challenges that they face, afflicted patients and their families benefit from support groups that provide psychosocial support. Hospitals have traditionally preferred in-person support group meetings, but there has recently been a great increase in the need for online meetings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. With increasing usage of the Internet for health advice and assistance, it is important to assess the availability of information on support groups online. METHODS: Two independent investigators queried the terms “Crohn’s support group” using the Google search engine. The first 100 websites were analyzed and categorized into either informational websites (IW) or professional websites (PW) depending on their association. The mode of support group meetings was categorized as either online or in-person. Websites that included outdated events, were inaccessible, did not specify the mode of meeting, required additional contact, or were irrelevant were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-squared test of independence with significance level at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 56 websites (33 IW, 23 PW) met our inclusion criteria. IW offered online meetings more often than PW (60.6% and 39.1%, respectively; p=0.11). In contrast, PW offered in-person meetings more often than IW (73.9% and 69.7%, respectively; p=0.73). Excluded websites (30 IW, 14 PW) were further analyzed for their reason for elimination. For IW, the most frequent causes of exclusion in descending order were as follows: irrelevance (30.0%), outdated (26.7%), inaccessible (20.0%), did not specify the mode of meeting (13.3%), and redirected for further information (10.0%). Listing of outdated sessions was the most common reason for exclusion of PW from the study (57.1%), and the proportion was significantly higher than IW (26.7%) (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Crohn’s disease patients face unique challenges that require special attention. Support groups are an important means of alleviating stress, depression, and anxiety in order to improve their QOL. Yet, due to the COVID-19 social distancing policies, many are refrained from participating in in-person sessions. This study illustrates that more online support group meetings are needed and that professional websites should improve on making regular updates for future meeting sessions.

Mediator release from mast cells may occur via cross-linking of cell-bound IgE by di-(multi)valent free drug. The FcεRI high affinity receptor on mast cells has a central role in IgE-mediated allergic release of inflammatory mediators leading to the symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. The low affinity IgE receptor FcεRII (CD23) has multiple functions including the up- and downregulation of IgE synthesis by B cells. Physiological and pharmacological effects of histamine are mediated through four receptors, H(1), H(2,) H(3), and H(4.) Cysteinyl leukotrienes and PAF are powerful mediators of anaphylaxis, asthma, and shock. Sphingosine-1-phosphate, elevated in the lungs of asthmatics, regulates pulmonary epithelium permeability and contributes to the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis. Urticaria is a heterogeneous disease with many subtypes. Both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may cause angioedema. Abacavir changes the shape of the HLA antigen-binding cleft producing an alteration in the repertoire of self-peptides that bind HLA-B*57:01 and a T cell response to self-proteins.

Of the remaining 27 patients, 11 (40.7%) were readmitted with recurrent pancreatitis (6); biliary sepsis (2); obstructive jaundice (1); spontaneous splenic haemorrhage (1) (died); recurrent biliary colic (1). The median time to readmission was 40 days (6 -89). CONCLUSIONS: Delaying cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis to 3 months is associated with significant readmission rates and serious complications. Cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis should be categorised as 1B or 2 during Covid-19 period.","Ayoub, N; Aboelkhair, A; Mlotshwa, M",Br J Surg,143,24

INTRODUCTION: Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR-HB) models have been shown to be effective, however, there is a large variation of protocols and minimal evidence of effectiveness in higher risk populations, in which exercise at distance might be concerning. In addition, lack of reimbursement models has discouraged the widespread adoption of CR-HB. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an even greater gap in CR care has emerged due to the decreased availability of on-site services. PURPOSE: Evaluation of the safety of a CR-HB program during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Prospective cohort study which included patients (pts) who were participating in a centre-based CR program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB after the centre-based CR program closure due to COVID-19. The CR-HB consisted in a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including: 1.pts regular clinical and exercise risk assessment; 2.psychological tele-appointments and group sessions; 3. online exercise training sessions, which consisted of recorded videos and real time online exercise training sessions (each session recommended 3 times per week, during 60 minutes); 4.structured online educational program for pts and family members/caregivers, including educational videos and webinars; 5. follow-up fortnightly questionnaire to evaluate risk factors control and need for appointments or directing to hospital; 6. nutrition tele-appointments; 7. physician tele-appointments, scheduled according to follow-up questionnaire or at patients request (e-mail or telephone) to avoid unnecessary exposure and overload in the hospital. Minor and major adverse events such as hospitalizations due to cardiac event or other non CV reason, cardiac or noncardiac death, during or immediately after the exercise sessions, were collected. RESULTS: 116 cardiovascular disease (CVD) pts (62.6 ± 8.9 years, 95 males) who were attending a Centre-based CR program were included in a CR-HB program. Almost 90% (n = 103) of the participants had coronary artery disease; 13.8% pts had heart failure. The mean LVEF was 52 ± 11%; 31,1% of the population had at least moderate risk. Regarding risk factors, obesity was the most common risk factor (74.7%) followed by hypertension (59.6%), family history (41.8%), dyslipidaemia (37.9%), diabetes (18.1%), and smoking (12.9%). 98 CVD pts (85.5%) successfully completed all the online assessments. Three male participants dropped out for hospitalization due to knee surgery, pacemaker implantation and in-stent restenosis without relation to exercise sessions. No major events were registered during the exercise training sessions and only one minor adverse event, sprained ankle, was reported during the training sessions. CONCLUSIONS: This CR-HB program, originated by the need of social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic, revealed to be a valuable and safe strategy to reach at distance most patients previously in a Centre-based CR program.","Couto Pereira, S; Aguiar-Ricardo, I; Pinto, R; Cunha, N; Alves Da Silva, P; Rodrigues, T; Silverio Antonio, P; Valente Silva, B; Brito, J; Borges, M; Lemos Pires, M; Miguel, S; Salazar, F; Pinto, FJ; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,143,17

In this contribution, we discuss the importance of free trade and value chain integration with special focus on the role of global final demand for Austria and Germany. We show that Germany and Austria are deeply integrated in global value chains and hold a relatively central position. Furthermore, roughly a third of value added of the two countries is eventually consumed or invested abroad. While the share of value added consumed or invested abroad accrues to more than 80% in some manufacturing industries, specific services industries are also deeply integrated in global value chains, most notably wholesale trade and financial services. Nevertheless, most services industries’ value added is predominantly consumed or invested domestically. Due to large economic welfare costs of reshoring global value chains, specifically because of retaliation measures as well as potential losses of comapartive advantages, the COVID-19 pandemic should not be used as a justification for a return to a more protectionist international trade regime. Thus, it is central for economic policy in Austria and Germany to support and promote the presence of their companies in international value chains by fostering their productivity and to spur the advancement of European and global economic integration.","Schwarzbauer, Wolfgang; Koch, Philipp",List Forum,143,1

However, due to the diversity of data types, it is difficult for traditional time series prediction models to have good prediction effects on different types of data. To improve the versatility and accuracy of the model, this paper proposes a novel hybrid time-series prediction model based on recursive empirical mode decomposition (REMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM). In REMD-LSTM, we first propose a new REMD to overcome the marginal effects and mode confusion problems in traditional decomposition methods. Then use REMD to decompose the data stream into multiple in intrinsic modal functions (IMF). After that, LSTM is used to predict each IMF subsequence separately and obtain the corresponding prediction results. Finally, the true prediction value of the input data is obtained by accumulating the prediction results of all IMF subsequences. The final experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed model is improved by more than 20% compared with the LSTM algorithm. In addition, the model has the highest prediction accuracy on all different types of data sets. This fully shows the model proposed in this paper has a greater advantage in prediction accuracy and versatility than the state-of-the-art models.

In this study, we aim to compare the reintubation rate in preterm babies with RDS who were extubated to Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) versus those extubated to Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV). METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Women’s Wellness and Research Center (WWRC), Doha, Qatar. The medical files (n = 220) of ventilated preterm infants with gestational age ranging between 28 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks + 6 days gestation and extubated to non-invasive respiratory support (whether NCPAP, NIPPV, or Nasal Cannula) during the period from January 2016 to December 2017 were reviewed. RESULTS: From the study group of 220 babies, n = 97 (44%) babies were extubated to CPAP, n = 77 (35%) were extubated to NIPPV, and n = 46 (21%) babies were extubated to Nasal Cannula (NC). Out of the n = 220 babies, 18 (8.2%) were reintubated within 1 week after extubation. 14 of the 18 (77.8%) were reintubated within 48 h of extubation. Eleven babies needed reintubation after being extubated to NCPAP (11.2%) and seven were reintubated after extubation to NIPPV (9.2%), none of those who were extubated to NC required reintubation (P = 0.203). The reintubation rate was not affected by extubation to any form of non-invasive ventilation (P = 0.625). The mode of ventilation before extubation does not affect the reintubation rate (P = 0.877). The presence of PDA and NEC was strongly associated with reintubation which increased by two and four-folds respectively in those morbidities. There is an increased risk of reintubation with babies suffering from NEC and BPD and this was associated with an increased risk of hospital stay with a P-value ranging (from 0.02–0.003). Using multivariate logistic regression, NEC the NEC (OR = 5.52, 95% CI 1.26, 24.11, P = 0.023) and the vaginal delivery (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.07, 0.78, P = 0.018) remained significantly associated with reintubation. CONCLUSION: Reintubation rates were less with NIPPV when compared with NCPAP, however, this difference was not statistically significant. This study highlights the need for further research studies with a larger number of neonates in different gestational ages birth weight categories. Ascertaining this information will provide valuable data for the factors that contribute to re-intubation rates and influence the decision-making and management of RDS patients in the future.","Masry, Alaa; Nimeri, Nuha A.

RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic and treatment options for managing neurologic emergencies in pregnant patients have expanded with both greater understanding of the effects of imaging modalities and medications on pregnancy and application of standard treatments for non-pregnant patients to pregnant populations. Specifically, this includes cerebrovascular diseases (pregnancy-associated ischemic stroke, pregnancy-associated intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), post-maternal cardiac arrest care, seizures and status epilepticus, myasthenia gravis, and fetal somatic support in maternal death by neurologic criteria. SUMMARY: With the exception of direct abdominal computed tomography (CT), most imaging studies are reasonably safe in pregnancy. When emergent imaging is needed to prevent maternal morbidity or mortality, any CT sequence with or without contrast is appropriate to pursue. Though new safety data on antiplatelets, antihypertensives, thrombolytics, and antiepileptic drugs have increased options for disease management in pregnancy, unfractionated and low-molecular weight heparin remain the safest options for anticoagulation. Early studies on hypothermia, ketamine, and immunomodulating therapies in pregnancy are promising. In myasthenia gravis, new data on adjunct devices may allow more patients to undergo safe vaginal delivery, avoiding cesarean section and the associated risk of crisis. When difficult decisions regarding preterm delivery arise, recent outcome studies can help inform discussion. Lastly, when the feared complication of maternal death by neurologic criteria occurs, fetal somatic support may help to save at least one life.","Malaiyandi, Deepa; James, Elysia; Peglar, Lindsay; Karim, Nurose; Henkel, Nicholas; Guilliams, Kristin",Curr Treat Options Neurol,143,1

In this meta-analysis the incidences of STEMI and NSTEMI patient admissions in Germany during and before the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed through PubMed, Embase and Web of Science using combinations of the keywords “COVID”, and “myocardial infarction”, or “STEMI”, or “NSTEMI”, and “Germany”. RESULTS: Based on our search strategy out of 40 identified studies 5 were included in the meta-analysis. The hospital admission rates of patients with acute myocardial infarction in Germany significantly declined during the pandemic (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 0.849, 95% confidence interval 0.827–0.872). This was the same for patients with STEMI (IRR = 0.875, 95% confidence interval 0.837–0.914) and NSTEMI (IRR = 0.760, 95% confidence interval 0.633–0.911). DISCUSSION: In this meta-analysis we could show that in Germany the frequency of hospital admissions of patients with myocardial infarction significantly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, during the ongoing pandemic it is crucial to continue informing and educating the public on the symptoms of a heart attack and the necessity of timely medical care to avoid potential endangerment of patients with myocardial infarction.","Rattka, Manuel; Dreyhaupt, Jens; Winsauer, Claudia; Stuhler, Lina; Baumhardt, Michael; Rottbauer, Wolfgang; Imhof, Armin",Kardiologe,143,1

Intestinal permeability is an index for intestinal barrier integrity. Intestinal permeability has been shown to increase in various diseases—not only intestinal inflammatory diseases, but also systemic diseases, including diabetes, chronic kidney dysfunction, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic increase of intestinal permeability is termed ‘leaky gut’ which is observed in the patients and animal models of these diseases. This state often correlates with the disease state. In addition, recent studies have revealed that gut microbiota affects intestinal and systemic heath conditions via their metabolite, especially short-chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides, which can trigger leaky gut. The etiology of leaky gut is still unknown; however, recent studies have uncovered exogenous factors that can modulate intestinal permeability. Nutrients are closely related to intestinal health and permeability that are actively investigated as a hot topic of scientific research. Here, we will review the effect of nutrients on intestinal permeability and microbiome for a better understanding of leaky gut and a possible mechanism of increase in intestinal permeability.","Usuda, Haruki; Okamoto, Takayuki; Wada, Koichiro",Int J Mol Sci,143,1

It starts from Raewyn Connell’s account of the good university, and develops four main ideas. Connell’s insistence on thinking about universities as real workplaces, with real workforces doing real work that has real consequences, provides a disciplining foundation. On this basis, we must acknowledge that although changes are often set in motion outside a university, their realisation always depends on the work of university staff and students. Secondly, research on learning and teaching and the spaces in which they unfold can contribute to real change by providing stronger concepts and clearer language in which to imagine, discuss and plan. Thirdly, course and curriculum redesign, oriented to the great challenges that our students will be tackling in the next few decades, would benefit from an infusion of practices and values from the fields of social innovation and participatory design, and that design for social innovation needs a grounding in design justice. Finally, I outline some of the implications that we can infer for better learning spaces — understood from both a postdigital and a postcritical perspective. A connecting theme within this exploration is the realisation of care as thoughtful work.","Goodyear, Peter",Postdigit Sci Educ,143,1

Two hundred and nine students responded to an online questionnaire administered via Google Survey. In addition to descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests for comparing means, medians and distributions were used to assess differences in activity traits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that the occurrence of COVID-19 has significantly reduced the practice of walking and physical activities among the students. They are commonly motivated by introjected regulation. Father’s occupation and the type of family of a student have significant influences on the total physical activity in either situation. Bangladeshi university students have, particularly, been perceived as not generally used to vigorous physical activities. They are inactive compared to students from other countries. Thus, the public health policymakers and the corresponding authority should inspire the students to be more physically active by implementing different strategies such as increasing bicycling and walking facilities on the campus.","Rahman, Khalidur; Vandoni, Matteo; Cheval, Boris; Asaduzzaman, Md; Hasan, Mohammad Nayeem; Rahman, Sabbir Tahmidur",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,143,5

Purpose: To determine the feasibility of functional connectivity measures and examine the association of functional connectivity to a multifaceted battery of outcomes in survivors of ARF. Methods: Eight ARF patients (age:58±3.7, ICU days:10.4±8.6) completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive, physical-function, anxiety, depression, and driving simulator tests at one month post-hospital discharge. Pearson’s correlations assessed the relationship between functional connectivity within the default mode network (FPN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and frontoparietal network (FPN) to outcomes. Results: Low physical-function (r=0.75, p=0.03) and divided-attention (r=-0.86, p=0.03) during the driving simulator task correlated with low FPN connectivity. Low SMN connectivity demonstrated relationships to slower gait speed (r=0.82, p=0.01) and low short physical performance battery (SPPB) scores (r=0.81, p=0.01). Conclusions: fMRI is feasible to assess ARF patients’ post-ICU limitations, as low post-ARF brain connectivity may be linked to low physical function, providing potential development of therapeutic interventions.","Morelli, Nathan; Johnson, Nathan F; Cassity, Evan P; Kalema, Anna G; Morris, Peter E; Montgomery-Yates, Ashley A; Mayer, Kirby P",,143,1

Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV encodes at least three accessory or species-specific proteins; however, the biological roles of these proteins in PDCoV replication remain undetermined. As a first step toward understanding the biology of the PDCoV accessory proteins, we established a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PDCoV NS7 protein in order to investigate the functional characteristics of NS7 for viral replication. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation revealed that the NS7 protein was extensively distributed in the mitochondria. Proteomic analysis was then conducted to assess the expression dynamics of the host proteins in the PDCoV NS7-expressing cells. High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis initially identified 48 protein spots which were differentially expressed in the presence of NS7. Seven of these spots showed statistically significant alterations, including two up-regulated and five down-regulated protein spots, and were selected for subsequent protein identification. The affected cellular proteins identified in this study were classified into functional groups involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeleton networks and cell communication, metabolism, and protein biosynthesis. A substantial down-regulation of α-actinin-4 was confirmed in NS7-expressing and PDCoV-infected cells. These proteomic data will provide insights into the understanding of specific cellular responses to the accessory protein during PDCoV infection.","Choi, Subin; Lee, Changhee",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,143,1

METHODS This was a retrospective review of children treated with percutaneous thermal ablation for pulmonary osteosarcoma metastasis after prior surgical metastasectomy and chemotherapy. Selection criteria included number of pulmonary nodules <5 and nodule size smaller than 2 cm. Indications were discussed at multidisciplinary meetings. The goal was to achieve complete remission using percutaneous thermal ablation, thereby avoiding additional thoracotomies. RESULTS A total of 26 pulmonary nodules (mean size 6.7 mm, range 2-16 mm) were successfully treated by percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation in 11 children with osteosarcoma between the ages of 7 and 17 years (median 12.5). Patients denied post-procedure pain. Complications were limited to three pneumothoraxes (two minor, one major), and median hospitalization duration was 2.0 days. One patient died of rapidly progressive lumbar metastasis discovered 20 days post-ablation. Of the remaining 10 patients, local control at the ablation site was achieved, with median follow up of 16.7 months (range 4.1-41.8). Five patients remained in complete remission after median follow-up of 37.5 months, and five patients developed new metastases (one osseous, four pulmonary), of which two are in remission after subsequent treatment. CONCLUSION Percutaneous thermal ablation is a safe and effective minimally-invasive curative local treatment alternative for children with oligometastatic pulmonary osteosarcoma in whom surgical intervention is clinically contraindicated or unappealing.","Yevich, Steven; Gaspar, Natalie; Tselikas, Lambros; Brugières, Laurence; Pacquement, Hélène; Schleiermacher, Gudren; Tabone, Marie-Dominique; Pearson, Ernesto; Canale, Sandra; Muret, Jane; de Baere, Thierry; Deschamps, Frederic",Annals of surgical oncology,143,20

We designed CombYplex around two sub-panels M1 and M2 characterized by average and high-mutation STR panels. Using these two sub-panels, we tested how our program PredYmale reacts to mutability when considering basal branches and, moving down, terminal branches. We tested first the discrimination capacity of CombYplex on 996 human samples using various forensic and statistical parameters and showed that its resolution is sufficient to separate haplogroup classes. In parallel, PredYMaLe was designed and used to test whether a ML approach can predict haplogroup classes from Y-STR profiles.

We observe heterogeneity in haplogroup assignation accuracy among classes, with most haplogroups having high prediction scores (99-100 %) and two (E1b1b and G) having lower scores (67 %). The small sample sizes of these classes explain the high tendency to misclassify the Y-profiles of these haplogroups; results were measurably improved as soon as more training data were added. We provide evidence that our ML approach is a robust method to accurately predict haplogroups when it is combined with a sufficient number of markers, well-balanced mutation rate Y-STR panels, and large ML training sets. Further research on confounding factors (such as CNV-STR or gene conversion) and ideal STR panels in regard to the branches analysed can be developed to help classifiers further optimize prediction scores.","Bouakaze, Caroline; Delehelle, Franklin; Saenz-Oyhéréguy, Nancy; Moreira, Andreia; Schiavinato, Stéphanie; Croze, Myriam; Delon, Solène; Fortes-Lima, Cesar; Gibert, Morgane; Bujan, Louis; Huyghe, Eric; Bellis, Gil; Calderon, Rosario; Hernández, Candela Lucia; Avendaño-Tamayo, Efren; Bedoya, Gabriel; Salas, Antonio; Mazières, Stéphane; Charioni, Jacques; Migot-Nabias, Florence; Ruiz-Linares, Andres; Dugoujon, Jean-Michel; Thèves, Catherine; Mollereau-Manaute, Catherine; Noûs, Camille; Poulet, Nicolas; King, Turi; D'Amato, Maria Eugenia; Balaresque, Patricia",Forensic science international.

This is because RFID can stimulate the reuse of construction components and reduce their wastage, hence addressing sustainability issues in the construction sector. To test the plausibility of that idea, this study explores the potential pre-conditions for RFID to facilitate construction components reuse, and develops a guidance for promoting their redistribution back to the supply chain. It also looks at how integrating RFID with Building Information Modelling (BIM) can possibly be a valuable extension of its capabilities, providing the opportunity for tracked components to be incorporated into new structures in an informed, sound way. A preliminary assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the RFID technology is presented in order to depict its current and future potential in promoting construction components' sustainable lifecycle management, while emphasis has been laid on capturing their technical, environmental, economic and social value. Findings suggest that the collection of the right amount of information at the design-construction-deconstruction-reuse-disposal stage is crucial for RFID to become a successful innovation in the construction sector. Although a number of limitations related to the technical operability and recycling of RFID tags seem to currently hinder its uptake for structural components' lifecycle management, future technological innovations could provide solutions that would enable it to become a mainstream practice. Taken together these proposals advocate that the use of RFID and its integration with BIM can create the right environment for the development of new business models focused on sustainable resource management. These models may then unlock multiple values that are otherwise dissipated in the system. If the rapid technological development of RFID capability can be allied to policy interventions that control and manage its uptake along the supply chain, the sustainable lifecycle management of construction components could be radically enhanced.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Purnell, Phil; Lim, Ming K",Journal of environmental management,143,1

We herein present the case of a 74-year-old female who suffered complete rectal prolapse with a pedunculated polyp (20 mm) in the sigmoid colon; the stalk of the polyp was too thick to perform endoscopic mucosal resection, which is associated with a high risk of bleeding. The patient was successfully managed using single-incision laparoscopic rectopexy (Wells) with simultaneous sigmoidectomy, a procedure that has not been reported in the literature to date. There were no perioperative complications. The patient's constipation caused by the rectal prolapse improved, and no recurrence was observed for 2 months after the operation.

In this experimental work, the resilience of anastomotic techniques to pressure and tensile stress was studied. Study Design Ex vivo pig model. Setting Experimental. Subjects and Methods The trachea with the 2 main bronchi in freshly slaughtered pigs was isolated and intubated (CH 8.0). Both main bronchi were closed distally by a stapler. After resection of the trachea, an anastomosis (n = 15 per group) was created: group 1, single interrupted sutures; group 2, continuous running suture; group 3, mixed technique. A continuous tensile stress of 0, 500, 1000, or 1500 g was applied to the preparations. Mechanical ventilation with a maximum pressure of 70 mbar was initiated. The airtightness of the anastomosis was verified by submerging the entire preparation under water. Results At tensile loads of 0.5 and 1.0 kg, all anastomoses created in the single-stitch technique were airtight; at 1.5 kg, 93.3% were without leaks. In the continuous suture technique, the airtightness of anastomoses decreased with increasing tensile load: from 93.3% at 500 g to 73.3% at 1 kg and 66.6% at 1.5 kg ( P = .02 at 1.5 kg). Anastomoses in the mixed technique were airtight in 80% at 500 g, 66.6% at 1 kg, and 46.6% at 1.5 kg ( P = .01 in comparison with single stitches). Conclusion Anastomoses created with single interrupted sutures showed the highest resilience against combined pressure and tensile stress.","Kirschbaum, Andreas; Abing, Helen; Mirow, Nikolas",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,143,14

We therefore investigated the association of ΔWED with Δ HRCT score and predictors of a worse Δ HRCT score in those patients. METHODS We used an inception cohort of early SSc-ILD patients with availability for two HRCT records at enrollment and 1-year follow-up.The extent of ground glass, reticulation, bronchiectasis, and honeycombing was scored and then aggregated to produce a total HRCT score. The WED was measured at four levels and the maximum value was used. The Δ maximum WED, Δ mean WED, and Δ tHRCT score were analyzed. RESULTS We recruited 75 early SSc-ILD patients and found a significant correlation of Δ tHRCT score with a Δ maximum WED (rho = 0.34, p < 0.01) and Δ mean WED (rho = 0.26, p < 0.05). There were 34 patients with a worsening Δ tHRCT (Δ > 0), 17 with stability (Δ = 0), and 24 with improvement (Δ < 0). Patients with a worsening ILD had a significantly shorter disease duration, lower prevalence of tendon friction rub, higher cumulative prednisolone dose, and larger ΔWED than those with stable and improved Δ tHRCT scores. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression identified a larger Δ mean WED (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.42, p = 0.02) as a predictor of worsening HRCT score, while presence of tendon friction rub was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.77, p = 0.021). CONCLUSION Our study cohort found that a worsening esophageal diameter was a predictor of progression of lung fibrosis determined by HRCT score in early SSc-ILD. A further study regarding esophageal dilation progression different in early versus longstanding SSc-ILD is needed. Key Points •In early SSc-ILD patients, we demonstrated that a worsening esophageal diameter was a predictor of progression of HRCT score at 1-year follow-up. •Further study regarding the association of worsening of the esophageal dilatation with the progression of ILD comparing between early versus late SSc-ILD is needed.","Wangkaew, Suparaporn; Losuriya, Phumiphat; Euathrongchit, Juntima",Clinical rheumatology,143,16

We aimed to assess its frequency and possible relationship with the severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS We prospectively analyzed data from consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with magnetic resonance imaging and IVT. WMH volume was quantitatively measured. rICH was defined as intracranial hemorrhage that appears in brain regions without visible ischemic changes on 24-h follow-up imaging. Unfavorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 3-6 at 3 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the impact of WMH volume on hemorrhage, including rICH and local parenchymal hemorrhage, as well as clinical outcome. RESULTS Of a total of 503 patients analyzed, 17 (3.4%) patients developed rICH. Logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with rICH had significantly larger whole-brain corrected WMH volume (cWMHv) than those without rICH (22.90 vs. 4.42 mL; odds ratio, 1.562/10 mL; 95% confidence interval, 1.215-2.009; P = 0.001). Not only the corrected peri-ventricular WMH volume (P = 0.001), but also the corrected deep WMH volume (P = 0.013) was associated with the occurrence of rICH. cWMHv was also independently associated with local parenchymal hemorrhage (P = 0.025). rICH was not related to unfavorable outcome (P = 0.323), whereas cWMHv (P = 0.006) was associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION An increased occurrence rate of rICH after IVT is related to more extensive WMH, which may suggest underlying whole-brain vascular injury in patients with WMH.","Chen, Y; Yan, S; Xu, M; Zhong, G; Liebeskind, D S; Lou, M",European journal of neurology,143,8

And we have also proved HBeAg can obviously induce the production of macrophage inflammatory cytokines compared with HBsAg and HBcAg. However, the receptor and functional domain of HBeAg in macrophage activation and its effects and mechanisms on hepatic fibrosis remain elusive. METHODS The potentially direct binding receptors of HBeAg were screened and verified by Co-IP assay. Meanwhile, the function domain and accessible peptides of HBeAg for macrophage activation were analyzed by prediction of surface accessible peptide, construction, and synthesis of truncated fragments. Furthermore, effects and mechanisms of the activation of hepatic stellate cells induced by HBeAg-treated macrophages were investigated by Transwell, CCK-8, Gel contraction assay, Phospho Explorer antibody microarray, and Luminex assay. Finally, the effect of HBeAg in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis was evaluated in both human and murine tissues by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and detection of liver enzymes. RESULTS Herein, we verified TLR-2 was the direct binding receptor of HBeAg. Meanwhile, C-terminal peptide (122-143 aa.) of core domain in HBeAg was critical for macrophage activation. But arginine-rich domain of HBcAg hided this function, although HBcAg and HBeAg shared the same core domain. Furthermore, HBeAg promoted the proliferation, motility, and contraction of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in a macrophage-dependent manner, but not alone. PI3K-AKT-mTOR and p38 MAPK signaling pathway were responsible for motility phenotype of HSCs, while the Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling pathway for proliferation and contraction of them. Additionally, multiple chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, and TNF-α, might be key mediators of HSC activation. Consistently, HBeAg induced transient inflammation response and promoted early fibrogenesis via TLR-2 in mice. Finally, clinical investigations suggested that the level of HBeAg is associated with inflammation and fibrosis degrees in patients infected with HBV. CONCLUSIONS HBeAg activated macrophages via the TLR-2/NF-κB signal pathway and further exacerbated hepatic fibrosis by facilitating motility, proliferation, and contraction of HSCs with the help of macrophages.","Xie, Xiaoyu; Lv, Huanran; Liu, Chenxi; Su, Xiaonan; Yu, Zhen; Song, Shouyang; Bian, Hongjun; Tian, Miaomiao; Qin, Chengyong; Qi, Jianni; Zhu, Qiang",BMC medicine,143,31

Here, we describe the identification of a group of human cardioviruses that have been cloned directly from patient specimens, the first of which was detected using a pan-viral microarray in respiratory secretions from a child with influenza-like illness. Phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete viral genome (7961 bp) revealed that this virus belongs to the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) subgroup of cardioviruses and is most closely related to Saffold virus. Subsequent screening by RT-PCR of 719 additional respiratory specimens [637 (89%) from patients with acute respiratory illness] and 400 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients with neurological disease (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis) revealed no evidence of cardiovirus infection. However, screening of 751 stool specimens from 498 individuals in a gastroenteritis cohort resulted in the detection of 6 additional cardioviruses (1.2%). Although all 8 human cardioviruses (including Saffold virus) clustered together by phylogenetic analysis, significant sequence diversity was observed in the VP1 gene (66.9%-100% pairwise amino acid identities).

The variety of published techniques itself can be seen as an indicator for the often low level of satisfaction reached with the surgical procedures. METHODS From January 1999 to January 2014, we assessed all cases of PSH repair performed at the three participating surgical departments in a retrospective analysis. The results were evaluated with regard to different surgical techniques focusing on complications and recurrences. RESULTS One hundred and thirty-five individuals could be included in the analysis. They were operated on with eight different surgical techniques. Laparoscopic procedures were carried out in 46.7 % (63/135) of the cases. Median follow-up was 54 months (12-146 months). We found 44 cases of recurrence (32.6 %) and 24 (17.8 %) of the patients experienced perioperative complications and 12 of them needed to return to theater. Fourteen of the 135 patients (10.4 %) were operated as emergency cases which were associated with a mortality of 28.6 % (4/14). In case of elective PSH repair, no mortality occured. CONCLUSION The results achieved by direct suture or the use of incised flat meshes for the repair of PSH were poor with these procedures having unacceptably high recurrence rates. With regard to the latter ostomy revision through three-dimensional funnel-shaped meshes and the laparoscopic sandwich technique showed the best results. Emergency procedures were linked to a dramatic increase in morbidity and mortality (p < 0.001).","Köhler, Gernot; Mayer, Franz; Wundsam, Helwig; Schrittwieser, Rudolf; Emmanuel, Klaus; Lechner, Michael",World journal of surgery,143,16

HIV+ children performed worse than HIV - controls on two composite scores: Nonverbal IQ (p < .001) and Processing Speed (p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed on core subtests. Multiple linear regression models revealed that age, socioeconomic status, and school attendance predicted all Leiter-3 test composites.

While age, SES, and school attendance predicted Leiter-3 performance, HIV status improved prediction capabilities when added to the model. The Leiter-3 may offer a viable measure of cognitive ability in non-Western settings that can be used in its original form without translation.","Lichtenstein, Jonathan; Bowers, Caitlin; Amato, Jennifer; Niemczak, Christopher; Fellows, Abigail; Magohe, Albert; Haile, Hannah; White-Schwoch, Travis; Kraus, Nina; Massawe, Enica; Moshi, Ndeserua; Buckey, Jay",Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence,143,17

Risk categories were classified as high risk (cat-1) when the immunodeficiency scoring index was ≥3 and/or ≥3 RFs and/or ≥1 co-infective virus(es) were present; the remaining cases were classified as low risk (cat-0). The presence of two or more signs or symptoms including fever (T>38 °C), sinusitis, otitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, or baseline C-reactive protein increased by >2-fold at the time of the RVI, was considered a clinically-intense episode (CIE). Overall, 34 out of 52 episodes (65%) were limited to upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Overall, 26 (50%) received oral ribavirin. Twenty-four of 40 (60%) cat-1 episodes were treated, compared to 2 of 12 (17%) cat-0 RVIs (P=.01), while 17 of the 25 (68%) CIEs were treated compared to 9 of the remaining 27 (33%) episodes (P=.02). Regardless of antiviral therapy, the overall resolution rate was 100% for URTI and 95% for lower respiratory tract infection; the virus-related mortality was low (4%). In conclusion, the use of a risk-adapted protocol to guide therapeutic decisions for allo-HSCT recipients with RSV or HPIV RVIs is feasible and may limit unnecessary antiviral therapy.","Piñana, José Luis; Hernández-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Calabuig, Marisa; Ballester, Isabel; Marín, Manuela; Madrid, Silvia; Teruel, Anabel; Terol, María-José; Navarro, David; Solano, Carlos",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,143,30

METHODS A search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from 1 December 2019 to 12 May 2020, by combining the terms 'coronavirus' OR 'covid' OR 'SARS-CoV-2') AND ('neonat*' OR 'newborn') in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, MedRxiv, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review and the WHO COVID-19 database, with no language restrictions. Quality of studies was evaluated by using a specific tool for assessment of case reports and/or case series. RESULTS Twenty-six observational studies (18 case reports and 8 case series) with 44 newborns with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Studies were mainly from China and Italy. Half of neonates had a documented contact with the infected mother and one out of three infected neonates was admitted from home. Median age at diagnosis was 5 days. One out of four neonates was asymptomatic, and the remaining showed mild symptoms typical of acute respiratory infections and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of neonates were left in spontaneous breathing (room air) and had good prognosis after a median duration of hospitalisation of 10 days. CONCLUSIONS Most neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic or presented mild symptoms, generally were left in spontaneous breathing and had a good prognosis after median 10 days of hospitalisation. Large epidemiological and clinical cohort studies, as well as the implementation of collaborative networks, are needed to improve the understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.","Trevisanuto, Daniele; Cavallin, Francesco; Cavicchiolo, Maria Elena; Borellini, Martina; Calgaro, Serena; Baraldi, Eugenio",Archives of disease in childhood.

We conducted this study to compare the trends of domperidone prescription in pediatrics before and after the MFDS safety warning. MATERIALS This study included patients < 18 years old who used national health insurance services within the year 2011 and the year 2016, sampled from Health Insurance Review Agency data. METHODS We analyzed domperidone prescribing patterns including prescribed daily dosage, maximum period of continuous prescription, and number and types of co-prescribed medications and compared two different years pre and post safety warning. RESULTS A total of 16,614 pediatric patients (1.74%) received domperidone prescriptions in 2011, and 11,317 patients (1.23%) in 2016. The probability of receiving at least one prescription in 2016 has been reduced by 30% compared to 2011. Gastritis was the most common indication in both years. The number of prescriptions containing a maximum daily dosage of over 30 mg was significantly lower in 2016. In the same time period, the number of cases with a maximum continuous prescription period of more than 7 days significantly decreased (p < 0.001). In addition, from 2011 to 2016, comorbid diseases of domperidone-treated patients were similar, but the number of co-prescriptions of interacting medication to domperidone decreased (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION After the 2014 safety letter was released, the pattern of prescribing domperidone in pediatrics has enhanced drug safety for children in terms of frequency of prescriptions, maximum duration of domperidone use, and the prescription of drugs interacting with domperidone.","Rhew, Kiyon; Han, Nayoung; Goodin, Amie J; Oh, Jung Mi",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,143,12

Plasma levels of soluble membrane-bound ST2 (ST2) are elevated in human and murine aGVHD and correlated to type 1 T cells response. ST2 signals through the adapter protein MyD88. The role of MyD88 in T cells during aGVHD has yet to be elucidated. We found that knocking out MyD88 in the donor T cells protected against aGVHD independent of IL-1R and TLR4 signaling in two murine HCT models. This protection was entirely driven by MyD88-/- CD4 T cells. Transplanting donor MyD88-/- conventional T cells (Tcons) with wild-type (WT) or MyD88-/- regulatory T cells (Tregs) lowered aGVHD severity and mortality. Transcriptome analysis of sorted MyD88-/- CD4 T cells from the intestine 10 d post-HCT showed lower levels of Il1rl1 (gene of ST2), Ifng, Csf2, Stat5, Batf, and Jak2 Transplanting donor ST2-/- Tcons with WT or ST2-/- Tregs showed a similar phenotype with what we observed when using donor MyD88-/- Tcons. Decreased ST2 was confirmed at the protein level with less secretion of soluble ST2 and more expression of ST2 compared with WT T cells. Our data suggest that Treg suppression from lack of MyD88 signaling in donor Tcons during alloreactivity uses the ST2 but not the IL-1R or TLR4 pathways, and ST2 represents a potential aGVHD therapeutic target sparing Tregs.","Griesenauer, Brad; Jiang, Hua; Yang, Jinfeng; Zhang, Jilu; Ramadan, Abdulraouf M; Egbosiuba, Jane; Campa, Khaled; Paczesny, Sophie",Journal of immunology,143,20

Objectives In our study, the senior author described a novel technique of skin incision and wound closure based on de-epithelization and bi-layer tension-free closure that minimizes complications. Methods In this retrospective study, the authors reviewed the evolution of wound healing for the novel technique developed by the senior author by analyzing clinical reports of 817 patients who underwent surgery for abdominoplasty or breast reduction utilizing power-assisted liposuction mammaplasty with the new incision and closure technique. In addition, three separate plastic surgeons reviewed the wound characteristics and overall appearance by analyzing photographs that were taken over the course of 12 months to document the healing process. Results The overall complication rate was 14.1%, with 0.4% hematoma, 1.25% infection, 0.8% seroma, 1.5% necrosis, 3.75% erythema, 3.3% delayed wound healing, and 3.1% suture extrusion. The authors reported the rate of step-off border (9%), contour irregularities (6.5%), margin separation (1.25%), edge inversion (3.2%), excessive distortion (0.9%), and bad overall appearance (6.4%) of the cases.

METHODS In a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 99 subjects with TRD were randomized to one of five arms: a single dose of intravenous ketamine 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg, or midazolam 0.045 mg/kg. The primary outcome measure was change in the six-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD6). A linear mixed effects model was used to examine the effect of anxious depression baseline status (defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Anxiety-Somatization score ≥7) on response to ketamine versus midazolam at 1 and 3 days postinfusion. RESULTS N = 45 subjects had anxious TRD, compared to N = 54 subjects without high anxiety at baseline. No statistically significant interaction effect was found between treatment group assignment (combined ketamine treatment groups versus midazolam) and anxious/nonanxious status on HAMD6 score at either days 1 or 3 postinfusion (Day 1: F(1, 84) = 0.02, P = 0.88; Day 3: F(1, 82) = 0.12, P = 0.73).

We aimed to study predictors of in-hospital death, characteristics of arrhythmias and the effects of QT-prolonging therapy in patients with cardiac injury. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between Jan. 29 and Mar. 8, 2020. Among patients who had cardiac injury, which we defined as an elevated level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), we identified demographic and clinical characteristics associated with mortality and need for invasive ventilation. RESULTS Among 1284 patients with severe COVID-19, 1159 had a cTnI level measured on admission to hospital, of whom 170 (14.7%) had results that showed cardiac injury. We found that mortality was markedly higher in patients with cardiac injury (71.2% v. 6.6%, p < 0.001). We determined that initial cTnI (per 10-fold increase, hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.66) and peak cTnI level during illness (per 10-fold increase, HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.38-2.10) were associated with poor survival. Peak cTnI was also associated with the need for invasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.02, 95% CI 1.92-4.98). We found arrhythmias in 44 of the 170 patients with cardiac injury (25.9%), including 6 patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, all of whom died. We determined that patients who received QT-prolonging drugs had longer QTc intervals than those who did not receive them (difference in medians, 45 ms, p = 0.01), but such treatment was not independently associated with mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.69-1.57). INTERPRETATION We found that in patients with COVID-19 and cardiac injury, initial and peak cTnI levels were associated with poor survival, and peak cTnI was a predictor of need for invasive ventilation. Patients with COVID-19 warrant assessment for cardiac injury and monitoring, especially if therapy that can prolong repolarization is started.

In March 2020 all elective surgery and elective outpatient clinics were cancelled in our institution, a regional hospital in Northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. With regard to orthopaedic fracture clinics, a telehealth system was implemented on an emergency basis for patient and staff safety to prevent disease transmission. The aim of our study was to investigate whether rapid implementation of telehealth for orthopaedic fracture clinics resulted in an increase in complications. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of all patients with orthopaedic fracture clinic appointments at a regional NSW hospital between 17th March and 8th May 2020 was undertaken. There were 191 patients, including 390 appointments of which 23.1% were conducted via telehealth, namely by phone call. Complications requiring phone calls to the orthopaedic team, presentations to the emergency department, admission to hospital or return to theatre. RESULTS There was no increase in complications following emergent implementation of telehealth for orthopaedic fracture clinic follow up in our institution. Patients in the telehealth group were significantly older than those in the clinic group. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrates that application of telehealth fracture clinics in a regional Australian setting can be achieved without increasing complication rate and can be used to formulate a rapid telehealth implementation plan if a similar scenario occurs in the future.

Specific effects on different cell types and their mechanism of action remain unraveled.

Cytokine production by the intestinal epithelial cell line IEC18 and by primary cultures of rat splenocytes was studied. The molecular pathways involved were explored with specific inhibitors and gene knockdown. Our results indicate that both products induced GROα and MCP-1 production in IEC18 cells by a MyD88/NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of TNF production was observed in rat primary splenocyte cultures. The immunoglobulin concentrate induced IL-10 expression in primary splenocytes and lymphocytes. The effect on TNF was independent of IL-10 production or the stimulation of NF-kB, MAPKs, AKT, or RAGE. In conclusion, SDS and IC directly regulate intestinal and systemic immune response in murine intestinal epithelial cells and in T lymphocytes and monocytes.","Hernández-Chirlaque, Cristina; Aranda, Carlos J; Ocón, Borja; Polo, Javier; Martínez-Augustin, Olga; Sánchez de Medina, Fermín",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,143,16

We examined the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for IPV among women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Seven databases were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining psychosocial interventions for IPV in LMICs. Thirteen RCTs were included in random-effects meta-analyses. Risk ratios (RR) and risk difference were calculated as pooled effect sizes. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Cochrane tool accounting for cluster RCTs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk of bias and design characteristics. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Results Psychosocial interventions reduced any form of IPV by 27% at shortest (relative risk (RR) = 0.73) and 25% at longest (RR = 0.75) follow up. Physical IPV was reduced by 22% at shortest (RR = 0.78) and 27% at longest (RR = 0.73) follow up. Sexual IPV was reduced by 23% at longest follow up (RR = 0.77) but showed no significant effect at shortest follow-up. Sensitivity analyses for risk of bias led to an increase in magnitude of the effect for any form of IPV and physical IPV. The effect on sexual IPV was no longer significant. Heterogeneity was moderate to high in the majority of comparisons. Conclusions Psychosocial interventions may reduce the impact of IPV in humanitarian or low and middle income settings.

In certain situations, treatment with high oxygen concentration is necessary, e.g. after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The amount of oxygen and duration of hyperoxia causing pulmonary damage is not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate pathophysiological and metabolite changes in lung tissue during hyperoxia while the lungs were kept open under constant low pressure. Methods Seven pigs were exposed to 100% oxygen for five hours, using an apneic oxygenation technique with one long uninterrupted inspiration, while carbon dioxide was removed with an interventional lung assist. Arterial blood samples were collected every 30 minutes. Lung biopsies were obtained before and after hyperoxia. Microscopy and high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to detect possible pathological and metabolite changes, respectively. Unsupervised multivariate analysis of variance and paired sample tests were performed. A two-tailed p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results No significant changes in arterial pH, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and no clear histopathological changes were observed after hyperoxia. While blood glucose and lactate levels changed to a minor degree, their levels dropped significantly in the lung after hyperoxia (p ≤ 0.04). Reduced levels of antioxidants (p ≤ 0.05), tricarboxylic acid cycle and energy (p ≤ 0.04) metabolites and increased levels of several amino acids (p ≤ 0.05) were also detected.

The NHS Long Term Plan aims to reduce the burden on emergency hospital services through changing how pre-hospital care operates, including increased delivery of urgent care. Given the recognised potential of social prescribing to address wider determinants of health and reduce costs in other settings, this study aimed to understand the role that social prescribing can play in pre-hospital emergency and urgent care from the perspectives of staff. Semi-structured interviews (n = 15) and a focus group (n = 3) were conducted with clinical staff (n = 14) and non-clinical health advisors (n = 4) from an English Ambulance Service covering emergency (999) and non-emergency (111) calls. Data were analysed using a pre-defined framework: awareness of social prescribing; potential cohorts suitable for social prescribing; and determinants of social prescribing. Awareness and knowledge of social prescribing was limited, though when social prescribing was explained to participants they almost universally recognised its benefits for their role. Social prescribing was considered to be most beneficial to those calling for reasons relating to mental health, loneliness or social isolation, in particular older people and frequent users of 999 and 111 services. Determinants of social prescribing were identified across the micro (patient and staff acceptability of social prescribing), meso (triage and referral pathways) and macro (commissioning and funding) levels of analysis. This is the first empirical study to explore social prescribing in pre-hospital emergency and urgent care services, which suggests that it has potential to improve quality of care at the point of people accessing these services. There is a pressing need to address the micro, macro and meso level determinants identified within this study, in order to support staff within pre-hospital emergency and urgent care services to socially prescribe.","Scott, Jason; Fidler, Gayle; Monk, Daniel; Flynn, Darren; Heavey, Emily",Health & social care in the community,143,27

Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant Unit One (BNPP-1) is modeled using the KIANA software and the release of radioactive materials from the BNPP-1 stack on the members of the public through the airborne pathway is evaluated during normal operation as well as in the accident conditions including Design Basis Accidents (DBA) and Beyond Design Basis Accidents (BDBA). To verify and validate the KIANA software, the results of the KIANA are compared with the results of DOZA_M, ESTE, PC-CREAM 98, RECASS Express, and the values of the total effective dose monitored by the local detectors of BNPP-1. The KIANA is developed based on the Gaussian diffusion model written using C# programming language. In the current research, the total effective dose received by a member of the public due to the radioactive plume passage through the airborne pathway is calculated in the normal condition of BNPP-1. Moreover, the total effective dose in the case of the primary-to-secondary leakage inside the steam generators, the total effective dose in the case of Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LBLOCA) and Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA), and the equivalent dose of the thyroid gland tissue for an infant group (1-8 years old) in the case of LBLOCA in DBA conditions are evaluated. Finally, the absorbed dose of the whole body of adults at the initial stage after a BDBA, absorbed dose of the thyroid gland tissue for an infant group (1-8 years old) at the initial stage after a BDBA, and the total effective dose in the first year after the accident in the case of a BDBA are assessed. The results of the KIANA software indicate a good agreement with the results of the DOZA_M, ESTE, PC-CREAM 98, RECASS Express computer programs, and the values of the total effective dose monitored by the local detectors of BNPP-1. The developed software has the potential of calculations of concentration and radionuclide dose received through all the exposure pathways such as airborne, foodstuff, marine, soil, animals, and vegetation without any restriction in normal and accident conditions, simultaneously.","Delgarm, Navid; Sepanloo, Kamran; Shad, Ali Haghighi; Masti, Darioush","Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",143,7

We aimed to assess the presence of sleep disturbances during the lockdown in the general population. Methods Cross-sectional, online survey-based study on adults living through the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included demographics and specific questions assessing the impact of the pandemic/lockdown on sleep, daytime functioning and mental health in the general population. Identification of sleep pattern changes and specific sleep-related symptoms was the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes involved identifying sleep disturbances for predefined cohorts (participants reporting impact on mental health, self-isolation, keyworker status, suspected COVID-19 or ongoing COVID-19 symptoms). Results In total, 843 participants were included in the analysis. The majority were female (67.4%), middle aged [52 years (40-63 years)], white (92.2%) and overweight to obese [BMI 29.4 kg/m2 (24.1-35.5 kg/m2)]; 69.4% reported a change in their sleep pattern, less than half (44.7%) had refreshing sleep, and 45.6% were sleepier than before the lockdown; 33.9% had to self-isolate, 65.2% reported an impact on their mental health and 25.9% were drinking more alcohol during the lockdown. More frequently reported observations specific to sleep were 'disrupted sleep' (42.3%), 'falling asleep unintentionally' (35.2%), 'difficulties falling'/'staying asleep' (30.9% and 30.8%, respectively) and 'later bedtimes' (30.0%). Respondents with suspected COVID-19 had more nightmares and abnormal sleep rhythms. An impact on mental health was strongly associated with sleep-related alterations. Conclusions Sleep disturbances have affected a substantial proportion of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. These are significantly associated with a self-assessed impact on mental health, but may also be related to suspected COVID-19 status, changes in habits and self-isolation.","Pérez-Carbonell, Laura; Meurling, Imran Johan; Wassermann, Danielle; Gnoni, Valentina; Leschziner, Guy; Weighall, Anna; Ellis, Jason; Durrant, Simon; Hare, Alanna; Steier, Joerg",Journal of thoracic disease,143,1

METHODS We searched for, retrieved, and commented on specific literature regarding multiple functions of oxytocin with a special focus on its modulation of inflammatory, immune, and restorative functions. RESULTS Available data gathered in animals and humans support the anti-inflammatory properties of oxytocin. The multiple anti-inflammatory effects of oxytocin have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in various animal models and also in humans in response to intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Furthermore, oxytocin has been documented to activate several types of protective and restorative mechanisms and to exert positive effects on the immune system. CONCLUSIONS In addition, to being anti-inflammatory, it may be hypothesised, that oxytocin may be less suppressive on adaptive immune systems, as compared with glucocorticoids. Finally, by its restorative effects coupled with its anti-stress and healing properties, oxytocin may shorten the recovery period of the Covid-19 patients.","Buemann, Benjamin; Marazziti, Donatella; Uvnäs-Moberg, Kerstin",The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry,143,19

Two (2) adults obtained as carcasses at different times after postmortem examination were prepared to extract the bones via cold water maceration for use in the study. The appearance of the ossa coxarum and its features presented similarities to that of the horse. However, differences were evident in the convex cranial border of the ilium, small less prominent coxal tuber, and wider interval between the opposite sacral tuber and an oval obturator foramen. Common features reported in most species such as the gluteal line and psoas tubercle were absent. The long femur presented proximally; the greater trochanter connected obliquely via the trochanteric crest to the lesser trochanter. The supracondyloid fossa, obliquely directed medial condyle, and trochlea with two unequal ridges were presented distally. The fibula was absent while the tibia was typical of ruminant presentation with one popliteal line and no muscular lines on its caudal surface. The five (5) tarsals were arranged three proximally and two distally. One (1) metatarsal (3rd and 4th fused) presented two condyles that anchor two (2) digits with 3 phalanges and 3 sesamoid bones each. The total number of bones making up the hind limb was accounted to be 45.

Macrodomains are implicated in viral genome replication and interference with host cell immune responses. They are important to the infectious cycle of Coronaviridae and Togaviridae viruses. We describe crystal structures of the conserved macrodomain from the bat coronavirus (CoV) HKU4 in complex with ligands. The structures reveal a binding cavity that accommodates ADPR and analogs via local structural changes within the pocket. Using a radioactive assay, we present evidence of mono-ADPR (MAR) hydrolase activity. In silico analysis presents further evidence on recognition of the ADPR modification for hydrolysis. Mutational analysis of residues within the binding pocket resulted in diminished enzymatic activity and binding affinity. We conclude that the common structural features observed in the macrodomain in a bat CoV contribute to a conserved function that can be extended to other known macrodomains.","Hammond, Robert G; Schormann, Norbert; McPherson, Robert Lyle; Leung, Anthony K L; Deivanayagam, Champion C S; Johnson, Margaret A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,143,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Single-center, observational, retrospective study enrolling T1D patients who attended a remote visit on April 2020 at the Endocrinology division of the University Hospital Policlinico Consorziale, Bari, Italy. Lockdown-related changes in physical activity level and dietary habits were assessed on a semi-quantitative basis. Changes in general well-being were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12) with a binary scoring system. Glucose metrics were obtained from the Libreview platform for the first two weeks of February 2020 (T0) and the last two weeks before the phone visit (T1). RESULTS Out of 84 patients assessed for eligibility, 48 had sufficient FGM data to be included in the analysis. FGM data analysis revealed significant reductions in coefficient of variation (CV), number of hypoglycemic events and time below range (TBR), while no changes were found in time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), mean sensor glucose (MSG) and glucose management indicator (GMI). Moreover, the frequency of sweets consumption was inversely related to the occurrence of hypoglycemic events during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS Lockdown-related lifestyle changes, albeit unhealthy, may lead to reduction in FGM-derived measures of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability in patients with T1D.

We investigated factors associated with chronic pain in truck drivers including mental health, physical activity, and sleep, as no study has done so. METHODS Southern African male, long-distance truck drivers were recruited at truck stops in Gauteng and Free State Provinces, South Africa (n = 614). Chronic pain was defined as pain present for at least the last three months. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, post-traumatic stress disorder with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), exposure to traumatic events with the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC-5) and daytime sleepiness with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Sleep quality was measured on a four-point Likert scale. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using the Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. Associations between these factors, demographic factors and chronic pain were investigated. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that working ≥ 2 nights/week (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.55-4.68) was associated with chronic pain and physical activity was protective (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.98). In an exploratory analysis, greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.004), daytime sleepiness (p = 0.01) and worse sleep quality (p = 0.001) was associated with working ≥ 2 nights/week. Lower leisure-time physical activity was associated with worse sleep quality (p = 0.006), but not daytime sleepiness or depressive symptoms (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS There is a clear relationship between working nights and activity levels, and chronic pain, sleep quality, and depression in truck drivers.","Wadley, Antonia L; Iacovides, Stella; Roche, Johanna; Scheuermaier, Karine; Venter, W D Francois; Vos, Alinda G; Lalla-Edward, Samanta T",PloS one,143,1

However, influenza vaccination rates among EMS professionals are poorly quantified. OBJECTIVES We sought to document vaccination rates of EMS professionals and identify predictors of vaccination uptake. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey of North Carolina EMS professionals after the 2007-2008 influenza season. The survey assessed vaccination status as well as beliefs regarding influenza illness and vaccine effectiveness similar to the constructs of the Health Belief Model. Prediction of vaccine uptake was modeled using logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 601 EMS professionals completed the survey. Among the respondents, 47.9% reported receiving the influenza vaccination; vaccination rates varied among rural, suburban, and urban respondents (p = 0.01). Significant differences were found between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding employer vaccine recommendation (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6, p < 0.01), employer-offered influenza training (OR = 1.5, p < 0.01), employer-offered vaccination (OR = 3.3, p < 0.01), and belief in vaccine safety (OR = 27.5, p < 0.01) and effectiveness (OR = 9.5, p < 0.01). Most respondents believed they were at higher risk for influenza, the risk of adverse reactions was outweighed by prevention of disease, the vaccine was safe and effective, and vaccination protected themselves and their patients; however, only 9.1% supported mandatory vaccination. Those who were not vaccinated cited reasons such as belief in personal health as a protector against influenza, concerns about vaccine effectiveness, and the lack of an employer mandate. Predictors of vaccination included previous influenza diagnosis, perceived higher risk compared with that in the general population, belief in vaccine effectiveness, belief of favorable risk benefit ratio, employer vaccine recommendation, and age. CONCLUSION In this multicenter evaluation of EMS professionals, influenza vaccination rates were unacceptably low. Previous influenza infection, employer vaccine recommendation, a perception of increased risk for contracting the illness, and favorable beliefs about vaccine effectiveness were all predictive of vaccination acceptance. Emergency medical services systems should focus their efforts on combating misinformation through employee educational campaigns as well as develop policies regarding immunization requirements and working while ill.","Hubble, Michael W; Zontek, Tracy L; Richards, Michael E",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,143,22

Strategies for maximizing dose to the target tissues while sparing normal critical organs based on absorbed dose and biologic response parameters are commonly used in external-beam therapy. However, radiopharmaceuticals passing though the kidneys result in a differential dose rate to suborgan elements, presenting a significant challenge in assessing an accurate dose-response relationship that is predictive of toxicity in future patients. We have modeled the multiregional internal dosimetry of the kidneys combined with the biologic response parameters based on experience with brachytherapy and external-beam radiation therapy to provide an approach for predicting radiation toxicity to the kidneys. METHODS The multiregion kidney dosimetry model of MIRD pamphlet no. 19 has been used to calculate absorbed dose to regional structures based on preclinical and clinical data. Using the linear quadratic model for radiobiologic response, we computed regionally based surviving fractions for the kidney cortex and medulla in terms of their concentration ratios for several examples of radiopharmaceutical uptake and clearance. We used past experience to illustrate the relationship between absorbed dose and calculated biologically effective dose (BED) with radionuclide-induced nephrotoxicity. RESULTS Parametric analysis for the examples showed that high dose rates associated with regions of high activity concentration resulted in the greatest decrease in tissue survival. Higher dose rates from short-lived radionuclides or increased localization of radiopharmaceuticals in radiosensitive kidney subregions can potentially lead to greater whole-organ toxicity. This finding is consistent with reports of kidney toxicity associated with early peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and (166)Ho-phosphonate clinical investigations. CONCLUSION Radionuclide therapy dose-response data, when expressed in terms of biologically effective dose, have been found to be consistent with external-beam experience for predicting kidney toxicity. Model predictions using both the multiregion kidney and linear quadratic models may serve to guide the investigator in planning and optimizing future clinical trials of radionuclide therapy.","Wessels, Barry W; Konijnenberg, Mark W; Dale, Roger G; Breitz, Hazel B; Cremonesi, Marta; Meredith, Ruby F; Green, Alan J; Bouchet, Lionel G; Brill, A Bertrand; Bolch, Wesley E; Sgouros, George; Thomas, Stephen R","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",143,22

This has led to the development of minimally invasive vein harvesting (MIVH) techniques, such as standard bridging and endoscopic SVH (EVH). This randomized trial was established to assess immediate clinical outcome and patient satisfaction in our centre. METHODS A total of 150 consecutive patients were prospectively randomized into three groups. Group 1 consisted of 50 patients who underwent OVH, Group 2 consisted of 50 patients who underwent a standard bridging technique (SBT) and Group 3 consisted of 50 patients who underwent EVH. Each group was assessed for the incidence of wound infection, postoperative pain and satisfaction and the number of vein repairs using previously validated scoring systems. RESULTS The MIVH techniques reduced the pain at hospital (P < 0.001) and at 6 weeks (P < 0.001), and improved cosmesis (P < 0.001), compared with the OVH group. Patient satisfaction was greatest in the EVH group followed by the SBT and then the OVH group. The clinical markers of inflammation were reduced with an MIVHt. There were more vein repairs in the EVH compared with the OVH (P < 0.001) and the SBT (P = 0.04) groups. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that MIVH reduces wound morbidity. We believe that each technique has advantages and disadvantages, which should be considered during the selection of a harvesting procedure by both the patient and the surgeon.","Krishnamoorthy, Bhuvaneswari; Critchley, William R; Glover, Alex T; Nair, Janesh; Jones, Mark T; Waterworth, Paul D; Fildes, James E; Yonan, Nizar",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,143,1

First, the reality that the older population is very heterogeneous challenges ageism and age-stereotyping that has surfaced with COVID-19. Second, concepts of cumulative disadvantage and intersectionality offer clear explanations of the disparities that are being illuminated and lead us to advocate for fundamental changes to reduce disparities in later life and for people across the life course. Third, a strength-based perspective highlights the assets of the older population and the opportunities for positive developments coming out of the crisis. We can capitalize on momentum to increase advance care planning, to reduce social isolation, and expand the use of on-line technology for service provision. We can bolster our arguments to support older workers, volunteers, and caregivers. The fact that these social work perspectives are so applicable to the coronavirus situation reminds us of their fundamental relevance.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews in 3 cystic fibrosis referral centres in Paris, France. The study included 42 patients with cystic fibrosis: 24 who refused the vaccine and 18 who were vaccinated. The two groups differed quite substantially in their perceptions of vaccine- and disease-related risks. Those who refused the vaccine were motivated mainly by the fears it aroused and did not explicitly consider the 2009 A/H1N1 flu a potentially severe disease. People who were vaccinated explained their choice, first and foremost, as intended to prevent the flu's potential consequences on respiratory cystic fibrosis disease. Moreover, they considered vaccination to be an indirect collective prevention tool. Patients who refused the vaccine mentioned multiple, contradictory information sources and did not appear to consider the recommendation of their local health care provider as predominant. On the contrary, those who were vaccinated stated that they had based their decision solely on the clear and unequivocal advice of their health care provider. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results of our survey led us to formulate three main recommendations for improving adhesion to new pandemic vaccines. (1) it appears necessary to reinforce patient education about the disease and its specific risks, but also general population information about community immunity. (2) it is essential to disseminate a clear and effective message about the safety of novel vaccines. (3) this message should be conveyed by local health care providers, who should be involved in implementing immunization.","d'Alessandro, Eugenie; Hubert, Dominique; Launay, Odile; Bassinet, Laurence; Lortholary, Olivier; Jaffre, Yannick; Sermet-Gaudelus, Isabelle",PloS one,143,25

However, the risks of physical activity are less well documented. The fear of exacerbating symptoms and causing adverse events is a persuasive barrier to physical activity in this population.This work aimed to agree clear statements for use by healthcare professionals about medical risks of physical activity for people living with LTCs through expert consensus. These statements addressed the following questions: (1) Is increasing physical activity safe for people living with one or more LTC? (2) Are the symptoms and clinical syndromes associated with common LTCs aggravated in the short or long term by increasing physical activity levels? (3) What specific risks should healthcare professionals consider when advising symptomatic people with one or more LTCs to increase their physical activity levels? METHODS Statements were developed in a multistage process, guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool. A patient and clinician involvement process, a rapid literature review and a steering group workshop informed the development of draft symptom and syndrome-based statements. We then tested and refined the draft statements and supporting evidence using a three-stage modified online Delphi study, incorporating a multidisciplinary expert panel with a broad range of clinical specialties. RESULTS Twenty-eight experts completed the Delphi process. All statements achieved consensus with a final agreement between 88.5%-96.5%. Five 'impact statements' conclude that (1) for people living with LTCs, the benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks, (2) despite the risks being very low, perceived risk is high, (3) person-centred conversations are essential for addressing perceived risk, (4) everybody has their own starting point and (5) people should stop and seek medical attention if they experience a dramatic increase in symptoms. In addition, eight symptom/syndrome-based statements discuss specific risks for musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, cardiac chest pain, palpitations, dysglycaemia, cognitive impairment and falls and frailty. CONCLUSION Clear, consistent messaging on risk across healthcare will improve people living with LTCs confidence to be physically active. Addressing the fear of adverse events on an individual level will help healthcare professionals affect meaningful behavioural change in day-to-day practice. Evidence does not support routine preparticipation medical clearance for people with stable LTCs if they build up gradually from their current level. The need for medical guidance, as opposed to clearance, should be determined by individuals with specific concerns about active symptoms. As part of a system-wide approach, consistent messaging from healthcare professionals around risk will also help reduce cross-sector barriers to engagement for this population.","Reid, Hamish; Ridout, Ashley Jane; Tomaz, Simone Annabella; Kelly, Paul; Jones, Natasha",British journal of sports medicine,143,16

We aim to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy compared to repeated surgical resection. METHODS A retrospective review was performed in 104 patients treated with curative intent for resectable recurrent colorectal liver metastases. RESULTS Sixty-one patients underwent RFA and 43 patients underwent surgery. The overall recurrence rates were 82% in the RFA group and 65.1% in the resection group (P = 0.05). The local recurrence rate on a lesion-basis was markedly higher after RFA than that after resection (16.7% versus 7.3%, P = 0.04). The difference remained significant in patients with a maximum lesion diameter >3 cm (24.5% versus 7.6%, P = 0.01). RFA treatment was independently associated with recurrence on multivariate analyses (P = 0.01). 69.7% of RFA patients and 42.6% of surgery patients with intrahepatic recurrence were amenable to repeated local treatment (P = 0.05), leading to the equivalent actuarial 3-year progression free survival rates (RFA: 29.1% versus Resection: 33.1%, P = 0.48) and 5-year overall survival rates in the two treatment groups (RFA: 33% versus Resection: 28.4%, P = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS Surgery remains the treatment of choice for resectable recurrence.

COVID-19 shows some inherent risk factors like cardiovascular comorbidities independent from age, gender, and geographic location. One of the most peculiar features of the COVID-19 pandemic is that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 respiratory infections disproportionately impact patients with hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular comorbidities rather than those with allergic respiratory diseases and immune-compromised conditions. Migraine is a complex neuro-vasculo-inflammatory disorder that is also packed frequently with certain medical conditions including vascular disorders, hypertension, allergic diseases such as asthma and systemic inflammatory disorders. Accordingly, 2 different questions arise during the pandemic: (1) Do share comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension increase the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 for migraine patients? (2) Do comorbid allergic and atopic diseases, including asthma act as opposite influencers alongside with female gender? This paper focuses on the co-existence of comorbidities of COVID-19, in comparison with migraine, based on a wide clinical dataset and available reports. Discussed mechanisms include potential strategic roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-II, and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, playing remarkable parts in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and migraine. There are also some clues about the importance of endothelial and pericyte dysfunction and neuroinflammation in COVID-19 infection, related to complications and survival of the patients. The large epidemiological studies as well as basic research, focusing on migraine patients with COVID-19 will clarify these vital questions during the upcoming periods.","Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Özge, Aynur; Uludüz, Derya; Baykan, Betül",Headache,143,1

The results showed that the 5, 8, and 7 genotypes were identified from SLA-DQA exon 2, 3, and 4, respectively, based on the single-stranded conformational polymorphism banding patterns and found a novel allele D in exon 2 and 2 novel mutational sites of allele C (c.4828T>C) and allele F (c.4617T>C) in exon 3. Polymorphism information content testing showed that exon 2 was moderately polymorphic and that exons-3 and -4 loci were highly polymorphic.

We sought to quantify how much worse and to determine if social determinants of health were associated with these differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were extracted from the electronic medical records of 2 cohorts of patients seen in the family medicine clinic of a southeastern academic health center. Three hundred patients with baseline HbA1c results as well as HbA1c results in May 2019 or May 2020 were evaluated. RESULTS The groups had similar mean baseline HbA1c (7.65, SD = 1.50 for 2019; 7.61, SD = 1.71 for 2020; P = .85). Mean May HbA1c decreased from baseline in 2019 (7.19, SD = 1.45) but rose in 2020 (7.63, SD = 1.73), a statistically significant difference (P < .01).

METHODS A retrospective database review was undertaken involving, in Part I (Belgium), 290 consecutive SILS, including 80.68% primary bariatric surgeries, and 19.32% revisional gastric bypass, followed in Part II (Lebanon), by 40 selective primary SILS. Training for and standardization of the trans-umbilical technique was done for the operating room team, and was executed in part II. RESULTS The procedure of single incision was successfully completed in all of the 330 cases part I & part II. There was a need for additional salvage for one or two trocars in respectively 3.1% and 2.75% of the cases. There were no deaths or conversions in either group. Early complications included one medically healed fistula after revisional GB, and two secondary gastric and intestinal perforation requiring reoperations. Late surgical complications were: ""3 patients (1.03%) in Part I and 2 (5%) in Part II suffered occlusions, requiring laparoscopic mesenteric defect's closure on an internal herniation.""

However, the effects of antiproliferative drugs used in current drug-eluting stents (DES) on EPC proliferative and antithrombotic function remains poorly defined. METHOD AND RESULTS Herein, we studied and compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of four antiproliferative drugs - paclitaxel, sirolimus, everolimus, and zotarolimus on several EPC properties including colony forming units (CFU), cell proliferation, apoptosis, antithrombotic and prothrombotic gene expression and nitric oxide (NO) as well as prostacyclin (PGI(2)) release. We also examined EPC migration and adhesion under flow conditions. We find that whereas all antiproliferative agents inhibited EPC proliferation and caused cell apoptosis, only paclitaxel and sirolimus reduced CFU formation. Paclitaxel treatment also resulted in the greatest down-regulation of antithrombotic gene expression and up-regulation of prothrombotic gene expression. NO release, migration, and adhesion of EPC under shear stress were inhibited by all antiproliferative drugs, most notably by paclitaxel and sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that antiproliferative drugs on DES, particularly paclitaxel, impair the proliferative and antithrombotic functions of EPC, and thereby could contribute to incomplete vascular healing and increase the risk of stent thrombosis.","Banerjee, Subhash; Xu, Hao; Fuh, Eric; Nguyen, Kytai T; Garcia, Joseph A; Brilakis, Emmanouil S; Bhatt, Deepak L",Atherosclerosis,143,1

METHODS Feasibility study of twenty patients admitted to the intensive care unit following a cardiac arrest. All patients underwent continuous rSO2 monitoring using the INVOS(®) cerebral oximeter. ICM+(®) brain monitoring software calculates the cerebral oximetry index (COx) in real-time which is a moving Pearson correlation coefficient between 30 consecutive, 10-s averaged values of MAP and correspond rSO2 signals. When rSO2 increases with increasing MAP (COx ≥0.3), cerebral autoregulation is dysfunctional. Conversely, when rSO2 remains constant or decreases with increasing MAP (COx <0.3), autoregulation is preserved. ICM+(®) fits a U-shaped curve through the COx values plotted vs. MAP. The MAPOPT is nadir of this curve. RESULTS The median age was 59 years (IQR 54-67) and 7 of 20 were female. The cardiac arrest was caused by myocardial infarction in 12 (60%) patients. Nineteen arrests were witnessed and return of spontaneous circulation occurred in a median of 15.5min (IQR 8-33). Patients underwent a median of 30h (IQR 23-46) of monitoring. COx curves and MAPOPT were generated in all patients. The mean overall MAP and MAPOPT were 76mmHg (SD 10) and 76mmHg (SD 7), respectively. MAP was outside of 5mmHg from MAPOPT in 50% (SD 15) of the time. Out of the 7672 5-min averaged COx measurements, 1182 (15%) were at 0.3 or above, indicating absence of autoregulation.

Recently, SAFV has been isolated from nasal and stool specimens of infants presenting with respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens of children with central nervous system infection. However, little is known regarding clinical characteristics of SAFV in children. METHODS We reviewed 5412 specimens from the database of the infectious agents surveillance system in Niigata prefecture, Japan, between January 2006 and December 2013, and identified SAFV-infected patients. Subsequently, we retrospectively reviewed their medical records and evaluated their clinical characteristics. RESULTS We identified 9 SAFV-infected patients (median age: 5 years; range: 2-16 years). Seven patients were diagnosed with pharyngitis, one with meningitis and one with fever of unknown origin. Dominant symptoms were high fever, appetite loss and headache. The median duration of the fevers was 2 days in patients with pharyngitis; however, the patient with meningitis remained febrile for 5 days. All blood tests available in this case series revealed leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils. CSF profiles showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. All patients recovered fully without complications. CONCLUSIONS A few clinical characteristics of SAFV infection were clarified, including high fever of short duration in patients with pharyngitis, and neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis. The clinical course and CSF profiles of a case of meningitis were similar to those of other aseptic meningitis. SAFV needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of pharyngitis or meningitis when commonly identified viruses are not identified in such patients.","Ugai, Satoko; Iwaya, Atsushi; Taneichi, Hiromichi; Hirokawa, Chika; Aizawa, Yuta; Hatakeyama, Shuji; Saitoh, Akihiko",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,143,16

This has led to clinicians having an increasing number of difficult conversations with patients and their relatives over the phone. There is a lack of published literature examining how to do this well, but it is recognised that phone communication does differ from face to face interactions, and requires specific training. What is most important to patients and their families when receiving bad news is privacy, adequate time without interruptions, clarity and honesty when delivering the information, and an empathetic and caring attitude. Much of the work done on breaking bad news has been done in oncology and focusses on face to face interaction; there has been an assumption that this is transferrable to the emergency department, and more recently that this is applicable to conversations over the phone. Multiple educational interventions to improve the delivery of bad news have been developed, with differing frameworks to help clinicians carry out this stressful task. Simulation is widely used to train clinicians to break bad news, and has solid theoretical foundations for its use. The psychological safety of participants must be considered, especially with emotive subjects such as breaking bad news. We believe there is a need for specific training in breaking bad news over the phone, and developed an innovative simulation-based session to address this.

Though it has been proven that T cells associate with inflammation in the development of ACS, the function of B cells in disease remains unclear. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to reveal the diversity of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire of patients with ACS. METHODS We conducted a pilot study to sequence the immune repertoire of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ACS, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina (UA), and quantitatively characterized BCR repertoires by bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS We found that patients with AMI and UA had lower BCR repertoire diversity compared with controls with normal coronary arteries (NCA). Lower percentages of productive unique BCR nt sequences and higher percentages of top 200 unique BCR sequences were identified in AMI and UA patients than NCA controls. Patients had various preferential usage of V and J genes from B cell clones in accordance with the disease severity of coronary arteries. AMI patients had distinct CDR3 amino acids, and their frequency differed among patients with ACS. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that differential BCR signatures represent an imprint of distinct repertoires among ACS patients. This study thereby opens up the prospect of studying disease-relevant B cells to better understand and treat ACS.","Weng, Ruiqiang; Liu, Sudong; Gu, Xiaodong; Zhong, Zhixiong",Genes & genomics,143,1

Since BVDV, dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) all belong to the Flaviviridae family, it seemed possible that a common step in their life cycle might be affected by this aminoglycoside. Here it is shown that geneticin prevented the cytopathic effect (CPE) resulting from DENV-2 infection of BHK cells, in a dose-dependent manner with an 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 3+/-0.4microg/ml. Geneticin had no detectable effect on CPE caused by YFV in BHK cells. Geneticin also inhibited DENV-2 viral yield with an EC(50) value of 2+/-0.1microg/ml and an EC(90) value of 20+/-2microg/ml. With a CC(50) value of 165+/-5microg/ml, the selectivity index of anti-DENV activity of geneticin in BHK cells was established to be 66. Furthermore, 25microg/ml of geneticin nearly completely blocked plaque formation induced by DENV-2, but not YFV. In addition, geneticin, inhibited DENV-2 viral RNA replication and viral translation. Gentamicin, kanamycin, and the guanidinylated geneticin showed no anti-DENV activity. Neomycin and paromomycin demonstrated weak antiviral activity at high concentrations. Finally, aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase activity of neomycin-resistant gene abolished antiviral activity of geneticin.","Zhang, Xianchao G; Mason, Peter W; Dubovi, Edward J; Xu, Xiaodong; Bourne, Nigel; Renshaw, Randall W; Block, Timothy M; Birk, Alexander V",Antiviral research,143,31

However, these same chemicals can exert toxic effects in non-target organisms. To determine chemical modes of action, the toxicity ratio (TR) and critical body residues (CBRs) of 57 pesticides were calculated for Daphnia magna. Results showed that the CBR values of inert compounds were close to a constant while the CBR values of pesticides varied over a wider range. Although herbicides are categorized as specifically-acting compounds to plants, herbicides did not exhibit excess toxicity to Daphnia magna and were categorized as inert compounds with an average logTR = 0.41, which was less than a threshold of one. Conversely, fungicides and insecticides exhibited strong potential for toxic effects to Daphnia magna with an average logTR >2. Many of these chemicals act via disruption of the nervous, respiratory, or reproductive system, with high ligand-receptor binding activity which leads to higher toxicity for Daphnia magna. Molecular docking using acetylcholinesterase revealed that fungicides and insecticides bind more easily with the biological macromolecule when compared with inert compounds. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed that the toxicity of fungicides was mainly dependent upon the heat of formation and polar surface area, while the toxicity of insecticides was more related to hydrogen-bond properties. This comprehensive analysis reveals that there are specific differences in toxic mechanisms between fungicides and insecticides. These results are useful for determining relative risk associated with pesticide exposure to aquatic crustaceans, such as Daphnia magna.","Wang, Jia; Yang, Yi; Huang, Ying; Zhang, Xiao; Huang, Yu; Qin, Wei C; Wen, Yang; Zhao, Yuan H",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,143,1

Unfortunately, there is a lack of thromboprophylaxis guidelines in this population. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the soft tissue and bone sarcoma VTE rate and to explore the thromboprophylaxis regimens used. METHODS The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were queried using keywords related to VTE and long bone malignancy requiring surgical intervention to 2020. Included studied reported VTE rate in patients with surgically managed extremity sarcoma. Descriptive statistics and weighted mean totals were calculated. RESULTS A total of 2082 studies were screened and 23 studies were included. The overall VTE rate was 2.9%, with a rate of 3.7% and 1.4% in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas, respectively. Low-molecular-weight heparin was the most commonly used chemoprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS There is a high VTE rate following sarcoma surgery. The VTE rate is higher in bone sarcoma surgery, which may be attributed to differences in surgery and postoperative recovery. There was no consensus on the duration or type of thromboprophylaxis used. Future research is needed to determine the most effective thromboprophylaxis regimen in patients with sarcoma and whether individualized thromboprophylaxis is required.","Krzyzaniak, Halli; You, Daniel Z; Mosca, Giulianna; Monument, Michael J; Schneider, Prism S",Journal of surgical oncology,143,1

Combining human data, mathematical and computational analysis of both spiking and mean-field models, we investigated the spectral dynamics of encephalographic (EEG) beta-alpha oscillations, observed in human patients undergoing general anaesthesia. The effect of anaesthetics can be modelled as a reduction of neural fluctuation intensity, and/or an increase in inhibitory synaptic gain in the thalamo-cortical circuit. Unlike previous work, which suggested the primary importance of gamma-amino-butryic-acid (GABA) augmentation in causing a shift to low EEG frequencies, our analysis demonstrates that a non-linear transition, triggered by a simple decrease in neural fluctuation intensity, is sufficient to explain the clinically-observed appearance - and subsequent slowing - of the beta-alpha narrowband EEG peak. In our model, increased synaptic inhibition alone, did not correlate with the clinically-observed encephalographic spectral changes, but did cause the anaesthetic-induced decrease in neuronal firing rate. Taken together, our results show that such a non-linear transition results in functional fragmentation of cortical and thalamic populations; highly correlated intra-population dynamics triggered by anaesthesia decouple and isolate neural populations. Our results are able to parsimoniously unify and replicate the observed anaesthetic effects on both the EEG spectra and inter-regional connectivity, and further highlight the importance of neural activity fluctuations in the genesis of altered brain states.","Hutt, Axel; Lefebvre, Jérémie; Hight, Darren; Sleigh, Jamie",NeuroImage,143,33

In 2012, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients resistant to endocrine therapy. Although everolimus is generally well tolerated, mTOR inhibitor-associated pneumonitis is one of the most common adverse drug events leading to treatment discontinuation. To date, the underlying pathophysiology of this toxicity is unclear, and this uncertainty may hinder the optimization of management strategies. However, experiences from breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma clinical trials indicate that mTOR inhibitor-associated pneumonitis can be effectively managed by early detection, accurate diagnosis, and prompt intervention that generally involves everolimus dose reductions, interruptions, or discontinuation. Management can be achieved by a multidisciplinary approach that involves the collaborative efforts of nurses, oncologists, radiologists, infectious disease specialists, pulmonologists, clinical pharmacists, and pathologists. Comprehensive education must be provided to all health care professionals involved in managing patients receiving everolimus therapy. Although general recommendations on the management of mTOR inhibitor-associated pneumonitis have been published, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal management of this potentially serious complication. This article provides an overview of mTOR inhibitor-associated pneumonitis, with a focus on the detection, accurate diagnosis, and optimal management of this class-related complication of mTOR inhibitor therapy.

In particular, this article provides a detailed overview of the important aspects of the detection, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate management of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor-associated pneumonitis. In addition, this article emphasizes that effective management of this adverse drug event in patients with breast cancer will require a multidisciplinary approach and collaboration among various health care professionals.","Alvarez, Ricardo H; Bechara, Rabih I; Naughton, Michael J; Adachi, Javier A; Reuben, James M",The oncologist,143,15

Influenza causes a heavy disease burden in older adults, but can be alleviated by vaccination. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a potential government-funded seasonal influenza vaccination program in older adults in China. METHODS We characterized the health and economic impact of a fully funded influenza vaccination program for older adults using China-specific influenza disease burden, and related cost data, etc. Using a decision tree model, we calculated the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of vaccination from the societal perspective, at a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to GDP per capita (US$8840). Moreover, we estimated the threshold vaccination costs, under which the fully funded vaccination program is cost-effective using GDP per capita as the willingness-to-pay threshold. RESULTS Compared to current self-paid vaccination, a fully funded vaccination program is expected to prevent 19,812 (95% uncertainty interval, 7150-35,783) influenza-like-illness outpatient consultations per year, 9418 (3386-17,068) severe acute respiratory infection hospitalizations per year, and 8800 (5300-11,667) respiratory excess deaths due to influenza per year, and gain 70,212 (42,106-93,635) QALYs per year. Nationally, the incremental costs per QALY gained of the vaccination program is US$4832 (3460-8307), with a 98% probability of being cost-effective. The threshold vaccination cost is US$10.19 (6.08-13.65). However, variations exist between geographical regions, with Northeast and Central China having lower probabilities of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the implementation of a government fully funded older adult vaccination program in China. The regional analysis provides results across settings that may be relevant to other countries with similar disease burden and economic status, especially for low- and middle-income countries where such analysis is limited.","Yang, Juan; Atkins, Katherine E; Feng, Luzhao; Baguelin, Marc; Wu, Peng; Yan, Han; Lau, Eric H Y; Wu, Joseph T; Liu, Yang; Cowling, Benjamin J; Jit, Mark; Yu, Hongjie",BMC medicine,143,1

Methods: We used the Project for Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) tele-education model as an implementation strategy. We examined the number of clinicians newly waivered, the number of patients treated with buprenorphine, the relationship between clinician engagement with ECHO training and rates of buprenorphine prescribing, and treatment retention at 180 days. Results: The number of clinicians with a waiver and number of patients treated increased during and after ECHO training. There was a moderate correlation between the number of ECHO sessions attended by a clinician and number of their buprenorphine prescriptions (r = 0.50, p = 0.01). The 180-day retention rate was 80.7%. Conclusions: Project ECHO was highly effective for increasing access to this evidence-based treatment.

However, its protective effects against aristolochic acid (AA)-induced renal injury have not been elucidated yet. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the renoprotective effect of PX on Wistar male rats via activating Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway. Experimental animals were randomized into four groups, such as control group, I/R group, AA (5 mg/kg/d; ip for 10 days), and AA-induced rats treated with PX (10 and 20 mg/kg/d; po for 20 days). At the end of the experimental period, the rats were killed, and the biochemical parameters denoting renal functions were evaluated; histological analysis displaying the renal tissue architecture, real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of Keap1-Nrf2/ARE genes were elucidated. The results demonstrated that the rats administered with AA displayed a significant increase in the blood urea nitrogen level with an increased urine creatinine and protein excretion. Also, the serum levels of urea, uric acid, and albumin levels were increased. Furthermore, the histological evaluation denoted the cellular degeneration with increased tissue lipid peroxidation levels. In contrast, rats administered with PX significantly prevented the tissue degeneration with improved antioxidant levels. Conversely, PX treatment increased the messenger RNA expression of Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 with an attenuated expression of 4HNE and NOX-4 levels in IHC analysis. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that PX could suppress AA-induced renal failure by suppressing oxidative stress through the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.","Guo, Yinxue; Hu, Maorong; Ma, Juan; Chinnathambi, Arunachalam; Alharbi, Sulaiman Ali; Shair, Omar H M; Ge, Pingyu",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,143,12

In lymph nodes, self-activated T cells produced interleukin (IL)-2, which enhanced local regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation and inhibitory functionality. The resulting micro-domains reciprocally constrained inputs required for damaging effector responses, including CD28 co-stimulation and IL-2 signaling, constituting a negative feedback circuit. Due to these local constraints, self-activated T cells underwent transient clonal expansion, followed by rapid death (""pruning"").

However, clinical practice guidelines are not all unanimous on this as a universal recommendation. Right atrial tip placement may also fail due to variations in body surface area, venous anatomy or TDC designs and lengths. Moreover, the presence of recurrent long intra-cardiac fibrin sheath or cardiac rhythm management device leads serves as contraindications. Extra-cardiac tip placement in the azygous, hepatic veins and lower segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an alternative but is invariably associated with poor blood flow and shortened patency. METHODS We report the concept of extra-cardiac tip placement into the larger calibre hepatic segment IVC via a transjugular approach in two diabetic haemodialysis patients with overestimated TDC length out of 380 insertions. RESULTS Blood flow was maintained above 250 ml/min for 5-6 months and no tip migration ensued.

However, partly due to a lack of viable lead compounds, antivirulence therapeutics have yet to reach the clinic. Here we investigate the development of an antivirulence lead targeting quorum sensing signal biosynthesis, a process that is conserved in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Some preliminary studies suggest that the small molecule ambuic acid is a signal biosynthesis inhibitor. To confirm this, we constructed a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain that decouples autoinducing peptide (AIP) production from regulation and demonstrate that AIP production is inhibited in this mutant. Quantitative mass spectrometric measurements show that ambuic acid inhibits signal biosynthesis (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 2.5 ± 0.1 μM) against a clinically relevant USA300 MRSA strain. Quantitative real-time PCR confirms that this compound selectively targets the quorum sensing regulon. We show that a 5-μg dose of ambuic acid reduces MRSA-induced abscess formation in a mouse model and verify its quorum sensing inhibitory activity in vivo Finally, we employed mass spectrometry to identify or confirm the structure of quorum sensing signaling peptides in three strains each of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and single strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis By measuring AIP production by these strains, we show that ambuic acid possesses broad-spectrum efficacy against multiple Gram-positive bacterial pathogens but does not inhibit quorum sensing in some commensal bacteria. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the promise of ambuic acid as a lead for the development of antivirulence therapeutics.","Todd, Daniel A; Parlet, Corey P; Crosby, Heidi A; Malone, Cheryl L; Heilmann, Kristopher P; Horswill, Alexander R; Cech, Nadja B",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,143,16

A number of nanoceramics, including nanostructured alumina, titania and zirconia, have been introduced for the applications in virus removal or separation. Filtration or adsorption of viruses, and thus the removal of viruses through nanoceramics, such as nanoporous/mesoporous ceramic membranes, ceramic nanofibers and ceramic nanoparticles, will make it possible to produce an efficient system for virus removal from blood and one with excellent chemical/thermal stability. Currently, nanoceramic membranes and filters based on sol-gel alumina membranes and NanoCeram nanofiber filters have been commercialized and applied to remove viruses from the blood. Nevertheless, filtration using nanoporous filters is limited to the removal of only free viruses in the bloodstream.","Zhao, Yufeng; Sugiyama, Sadahiro; Miller, Thomas; Miao, Xigeng",Expert review of medical devices,143,11

Pseudoknots occur relatively rarely in RNA but are highly overrepresented in functionally critical motifs in large catalytic RNAs, in riboswitches, and in regulatory elements of viruses. Pseudoknots are usually excluded from RNA structure prediction algorithms. When included, these pairings are difficult to model accurately, especially in large RNAs, because allowing this structure dramatically increases the number of possible incorrect folds and because it is difficult to search the fold space for an optimal structure. We have developed a concise secondary structure modeling approach that combines SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experimental chemical probing information and a simple, but robust, energy model for the entropic cost of single pseudoknot formation. Structures are predicted with iterative refinement, using a dynamic programming algorithm. This melded experimental and thermodynamic energy function predicted the secondary structures and the pseudoknots for a set of 21 challenging RNAs of known structure ranging in size from 34 to 530 nt. On average, 93% of known base pairs were predicted, and all pseudoknots in well-folded RNAs were identified.","Hajdin, Christine E; Bellaousov, Stanislav; Huggins, Wayne; Leonard, Christopher W; Mathews, David H; Weeks, Kevin M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,143,31

The secondary aim is to analyze the diagnostic value of hematologic parameters in COVID-19 complicated pregnancies. METHODS The current study is conducted in a high volume tertiary obstetrics center burdened by COVID-19 pandemics, in Turkey. In this cohort study, perinatal outcomes and complete blood count indices performed at the time of admission of 39 pregnancies (Study group) complicated by COVID-19 were compared with 69 uncomplicated pregnancies (Control group). RESULTS There was no significant difference between the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies with COVID-19 compared to data of healthy pregnancies, except the increased C-section rate (p=0.026). Monocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were significantly increased (p<0.0001, p=0.009, p=0.043, p<0.0001, respectively) whereas the MPV and plateletcrit were significantly decreased (p=0.001, p=0.008) in pregnants with COVID-19. ROC analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off value for MLR was 0.354 which indicated 96.7% specificity and 59.5% sensitivity in diagnosis of pregnant women with COVID-19. A strong positive correlation was found between the MLR and the presence of cough symptom (r=41.4, p=<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The study revealed that, pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 is not related with adverse perinatal outcomes. MLR may serve as a supportive diagnostic parameter together with the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in assessment of COVID-19 in pregnant cohort.","Erol Koç, Esin Merve; Fındık, Rahime Bedir; Akkaya, Hatice; Karadağ, Işılay; Tokalıoğlu, Eda Özden; Tekin, Özlem Moraloğlu",Journal of perinatal medicine,143,19

METHODS In the period 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2010, 181 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in our day surgery unit using DynaMesh® were entered prospectively in the National Danish Hernia Database. Data concerning abdominal reoperations after hernia repair were later collected on all 181 patients from the National Danish Health Registry. Postoperative telephone interviews were conducted estimating postoperative pain and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Six % (11 patients) were reoperated because of mesh-related complications. Three had small bowel obstruction and one had a colonic fistula with mesh infection, all causing bowel resection and mesh removal. Mesh-related cutaneous fistula was seen in one patient. Six patients had a symptomatic recurrence requiring reoperation. Abdominal wall hematomas were seen in two cases, while two other patients had symptomatic large seromas, of which one was drained surgically. After a median follow-up of 34 months (range 12-63) in 140 patients, 66 % were pain free (0 on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)). Of 26 patients with moderate to severe pain (NRS > 3) at follow-up, only 4 regretted the operation. Sixteen patients thought they had a recurrence, of these only 3 regretted the operation. CONCLUSION The use of DynaMesh® in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair was associated with a 6 % risk of mesh-related reoperation in a high volume setting. Despite chronic pain in 19 %, after 34 months follow-up patient satisfaction was high.","Sommer, T; Friis-Andersen, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,143,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 30 randomly selected clinical prostate VMAT plans were included. The used treatment planning system (TPS) was Monaco (Elekta, Crawley), and the secondary dose calculation software was SciMoCa (Scientific-RT, Munich). Monaco and SciMoCa work with a Monte Carlo algorithm. A plausibility check of Monaco and SciMoCa was performed using an ionization chamber in the BodyPhantom (BP). First, the original Monaco RT plans were verified with SciMoCa (pretreatment QA). Second, the corresponding 4-Hz log files were converted into RT log file plans and sent to SciMoCa as on-treatment QA. MLC shift errors were introduced for one prostate plan to determine the sensitivity of on-treatment QA. For pretreatment and on-treatment QA, a gamma analysis (2%/1mm/20%) was performed and dosimetric values of PTV and OARs were ascertained in SciMoCa. RESULTS Plausibility check of TPS Monaco vs. BP measurement and SciMoCa vs. BP measurement showed valid accuracy for clinical VMAT QA. Using SciMoCa, there was no significant difference in PTV Dmean between RT plan and RT log file plan. Between pretreatment and on-treatment QA, PTV metrics, femur right and left showed no significant dosimetric differences as opposed to OARs rectum and bladder. The overall gamma passing rate (GPR) ranged from 96.10% to 100% in pretreatment QA and from 93.50% to 99.80% in on-treatment QA. MLC shift errors were identified for deviations larger than -0.50 mm and +0.75 mm using overall gamma criterion and PTV Dmean. CONCLUSION SciMoCa calculations of Monaco RT plans and RT log file plans are in excellent agreement to each other. Therefore, 4-Hz log files and SciMoCa can replace labor-intensive phantom-based measurements as patient-specific QA.","Szeverinski, Philipp; Kowatsch, Matthias; Künzler, Thomas; Meinschad, Marco; Clemens, Patrick; DeVries, Alexander F",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,143,17

BACKGROUND The stress level of clinical nurses directly affects their physical and mental health and work efficiency. DESIGN This study was a cross-sectional investigation, which was performed following the STROBE checklist. The current study was conducted in February 2020 by selecting clinical nurses from the Zigong First People's Hospital for investigation. METHODS At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we assessed clinical nurses with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Specifically, the nurses were divided into three groups: (i) Nurses supporting Wuhan; (ii) Nurses in the department of treating the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (Epidemic department); and (iii) Nurses in the general department without the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (Non-epidemic department). RESULTS A total of 1092 clinical nurses were surveyed with 94 nurses in Wuhan, 130 nurses treating COVID-19 patients in our hospital and 868 nurses working without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The mean stress score of all surveyed nurses was 33.15 (SD: 25.551). There was a statistically significant difference in stress response scores between different departments. Noticeably, the nurses who went to support in Wuhan showed a weaker stress response than the nurses who stayed in our hospital (mean: 19.98 (Wuhan) vs. 32.70 (Epidemic department in our hospital) vs. 34.64 (Non-epidemic department in our hospital)). In addition, stress was negatively correlated with general self-efficacy and perceived social support. CONCLUSION The present study suggested that the stress status of second-line nurse without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients was more severe than that of first-line nurses who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Our study indicated the importance of psychological status of second-line medical staff during the global pandemic.","Liao, Changju; Guo, Linghong; Zhang, Cuicui; Zhang, Meiqi; Jiang, Wenjing; Zhong, Ying; Lin, Qingfang; Liu, Yin",Journal of clinical nursing,143,1

METHODS : We sought to determine prospectively the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in these children, using multiplexed-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS : We enrolled 253 children with upper or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) during a 1-year period. A respiratory virus was detected in 193 (76%) patients; 156 (81%) patients had upper respiratory tract infection. Human rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in 97 (62%) and 24 (65%) patients with upper respiratory tract infection and LRTI, respectively. Leukemia or lymphoma was the most common underlying diagnosis in 95 (49%) patients followed by solid tumor 47 (24%), posthematopoietic stem cell transplant 28 (15%) and brain tumor in 23 (12%) patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis, human bocavirus was the most commonly detected respiratory virus in patients with LRTI (P = 0.008; odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.48-13.79). Coinfection with >1 virus was present in 47 (24%) patients, and did not increase the risk for LRTI. Two (0.7%) patients succumbed to LRTI from parainfluenza virus-3 and respiratory syncytial virus/human rhinovirus infection, respectively. C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were detected in 4 and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS : Human rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in children with cancer and posthematopoietic stem cell transplant hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness, and was not associated with increased morbidity. Prospective studies with viral load determination and asymptomatic controls are needed to study the association of these emerging respiratory viruses with LRTI in children with cancer and posthematopoietic stem cell transplant.","Srinivasan, Ashok; Gu, Zhengming; Smith, Teresa; Morgenstern, Markus; Sunkara, Anusha; Kang, Guolian; Srivastava, Deo K; Gaur, Aditya H; Leung, Wing; Hayden, Randall T",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,143,1

The aim of the present study is to assess attitudes and perceptions of vaccine hesitant parents in Greece with a view to implementing strategies to increase vaccine uptake. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based prospective survey was conducted between September 2019 and June 2020 on parents of children attending primary education in the city of Patras in Western Greece. Data on parental attitudes and beliefs about vaccinations were collected and analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with vaccine uptake. Out of 2154 distributed questionnaires, 1227 were completed and returned (response rate 56.9%). The main vaccine information source for Greek parents was their primary care pediatrician (90.8%). Doubts still exist amongst approximately one-third of them (33.5%) regarding a possible relationship between vaccines and autism. Of note, 44% of the study participants believe that unvaccinated children could attend school. 84.6% of the parents in our cohort admitted that they had fully vaccinated their children. In the multivariable analysis, marital status (p < .002) and Greek nationality (p < .001) were found to be the most significant determinants of vaccine uptake. Overall, we found that the percentage of parents in Greece that are vaccine hesitant is small yet not negligible. Based on our results, targeted public health interventions should particularly focus on single parents and those with non-Greek nationality. Training healthcare professionals to provide adequate information is crucial to clarify misperceptions.","Gkentzi, Despoina; Tsagri, Charalampia; Kostopoulou, Eirini; Fouzas, Sotirios; Vantarakis, Apostolos; Dimitriou, Gabriel; Varvarigou, Anastasia",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,143,24

The technique is highly relevant in imaging the dynamic gut environment where different cell types interact during homeostasis and disease states. This method optimized for the mouse gut is described here, which helps to trace cell types like epithelia, enteroendocrine, neurons, glia, and the neuronal projections into the epithelia or enteroendocrine cells that mediate microbial sensing or nutrient chemo sensing respectively. The gut tissue (1-1.5 cm) is fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight on day 1. On day 2, PFA is discarded, and the tissue is washed thrice with PBS. The tissue is hydrogel embedded to preserve its integrity by incubation in 4% hydrogel (acrylamide) solution in PBS (diluted from 30% ProtoGel) overnight at 4 °C. On day 3, the tissue-hydrogel solution is incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow hydrogel polymerization. Tissue is then washed thrice gently with PBS to remove excess hydrogel. The subsequent step of delipidation (clearing) involves tissue incubation in sodium dodecyl sulfate (8% SDS in PBS) at 37 °C for 2 days (days 4 & 5) on a shaker at room temperature (RT). On day 6, the cleared tissue is thoroughly washed with PBS to remove SDS. Tissue can be immunostained by incubation in primary antibodies (diluted in 0.5% normal donkey serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100), overnight at 4°C, and subsequent incubation in appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies for 1.5 h at RT, and nuclear staining with DAPI (1: 10000).

Those who provide services designed to address MCC for Indigenous communities require synthesized information to develop interventions that meet the needs of their older adult population. This review seeks to answer the research question: What are the health and social care needs, priorities and preferences of Indigenous older adults (living outside of long-term care settings) with MCC and their caregivers? METHODS A scoping review, guided by a refinement of the Arksey & O'Malley framework, was conducted. Articles were included if the authors reported on health and social care needs and priorities of older Indigenous adults. We also included articles that focused on Indigenous conceptions of wellness, resilience, well-being, and/or balance within the context of aging, and articles where authors drew from Indigenous specific worldviews, ways of knowing, cultural safety, cultural competence, cultural appropriateness, cultural relevance and community needs. RESULTS This scoping review included 9 articles that were examined using an Indigenous determinants of health (IDH) theoretical framework to analyze the needs of older adults and CGs. Five areas of needs were identified: accessible health services; building community capacity; improved social support networks; preservation of cultural values in health care; and wellness-based approaches. CONCLUSION The review highlights key determinants of health that influenced older adults' needs: education and literacy, ethnicity, and social support/network (proximal); health promotion and health care (intermediate); and a combination of historical and contemporary structures (distal).

This study investigated expression of circular RNA (circRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) treated with a P2X7 R antagonist. METHODS Sepsis was induced by tracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the mice were then divided into two groups: without (sepsis + DMSO) or with P2X7 R antagonist treatment (sepsis + P2X7 A). Sham mice was administrated sterile normal saline. Serum levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), pathological changes, cell apoptosis, and P2X7 R expression in lung were assessed, following with RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses. RT-qPCR was used to validate circRNAs and mRNAs RESULTS: Compared with sham group, LPS-induced sepsis produced obvious pathological changes in lung tissue, increased apoptotic lung cells, serum TNF-α and IL-1β levels, and P2X7 R expression; P2X7 R antagonism significantly ameliorated these changes. RNA-seq identified many dysregulated circRNAs and mRNAs during sepsis, while changed with P2X7 R antagonism. RT-qPCR confirmed that Mus musculus (mmu)_circ_0001679, mmu_circ_0001212, Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3 expression were significantly increased in sepsis + DMSO group compared with that in the sham group but were decreased in the sepsis + P2X7 A group compared with that in the sepsis + DMSO group. circRNA-miRNA-mRNA coexpression network indicated that mmu_circ_0001679 may regulate Nprl3 and that mmu_circ_0001212 may similarly regulate Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3 as a ceRNA.

Several observational studies have also shown the effects of targeting B lymphocytes in other rare CNS inflammatory diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and autoimmune encephalitis (AE). However, some drugs targeting cytokine receptors involved in B-lymphocyte maturation and proliferation resulted in negative outcomes in MS. These apparently conflicting findings have stimulated research on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of B lymphocytes in CNS inflammatory diseases. It has been demonstrated that B-lymphocytes participate in the pathogenesis of these conditions as antigen-presenting cells, producing proinflammatory cytokines that induce Th1 and Th17 responses and producing antibodies. However, they are also able to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10, functioning as regulators of autoimmunity. Understanding these diverse effects is essential for the development of focused treatments. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms that underlie B lymphocyte involvement in MS, NMOSD, and AE, and the outcomes obtained by treatments targeting B lymphocytes.","Klein da Costa, Bruna; Brant de Souza Melo, Renata; Rodrigues Dos Passos, Giordani; Meneses Sevilha Castro, Douglas Gomes; Becker, Jefferson; Bar-Or, Amit; Sato, Douglas Kazutoshi",Neurology,143,1

Recently, it has been shown (Popov et al., 2017) that films of nematic liquid crystals doped with chiral molecules adopt biconvex lens shapes underwater. The curved shape together with degenerate planar anchoring leads to a radial variation of the optical axis along the plane of the film, providing a Pancharatnam-Berry-type phase lens that modifies geometric optical imaging. Here, we describe nematic liquid crystal microlenses formed by the addition of chiral nanoparticles. It is found that the helical twisting power of the nanoparticles, the key factor to form the lens, is about 400 μm-1, greater than that of the strongest molecular chiral dopants. We demonstrate imaging capabilities and measure the shape as well as the focal length of the chiral nanoparticle-doped liquid crystal lens. We show that measuring the shape of the lens allows one to calculate the helical pitch of the chiral nematic liquid crystal and thus determine the helical twisting power of the chiral ligand-capped nanoparticles. Such measurements require the use of only nanograms of chiral nanoparticles, which is 3 orders of magnitude less than that required by conventional techniques.

Recent studies suggest that PP in spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute respiratory failure is well tolerated and improves oxygenation. However, little is known regarding patient triggered ventilation in intubated patients with ARDS undergoing PP. We conducted a retrospective review of our experience with placing patients in the prone position in 2 cohorts of subjects with moderate and severe ARDS (ie, one cohort with ARDS related to COVID-19, the other with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19), many of whom were receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis in a single 22-bed mixed ICU. The subjects included in the analysis were ≥ 18 y old, met the Berlin definition for moderate or severe ARDS (whether related COVID-19 or not), and underwent PP during invasive ventilation. RESULTS 39 subjects were included in the analysis: 20 subjects had ARDS related to COVID-19, while 19 had ARDS related to other etiologies. A total of 113 PP episodes were analyzed: 84 during PSV and 29 during volume control continuous mandatory ventilation. PP during PSV was well tolerated and was effective in improving arterial oxygenation (ie, an increase of median PaO2 /FIO2 from 100 mm Hg [interquartile range 75-120] before PP to 135 mm Hg [interquartile range 111-161] at the end of the PP session, P < .0001). No significant difference between continuous mandatory ventilation and PSV was noted regarding arterial oxygenation during PP. Compared with continuous mandatory ventilation mode, PP during PSV was associated with a significant decrease in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (4% vs 69% of subjects, P < .001), while sedative requirements remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS In a retrospective analysis of consecutive intubated subjects with moderate or severe ARDS, related or not to COVID-19, spontaneous breathing during PP was well tolerated and achieved significant improvement in arterial oxygenation.","Wiart, Adil; Castanares-Zapatero, Diego; Wittebole, Xavier; Maerckx, Guillaume; David, Guillaume; Laterre, Pierre-François; Gerard, Ludovic",Respiratory care,143,1

The contents of five heavy metals (Cu, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) and six biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase, sodium-potassium ATPase, metallothionein, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde) in the muscles of crucians (Carassius auratus) were measured to calculate the IBR value. The results indicate that the contents of heavy metal in the fish under active monitoring and passive monitoring were rather low and did not exceed the National Food Safety Standards of China. The IBR value of day 14 of active monitoring correlated with the heavy metal Cd content in the fish, suggesting a potential risk of Cd pollution in the aquatic environment of Dianchi Lake. The IBR values obtained for different regions of the lake on day 14 can be arranged in the following order: West S3 (9.24) > East S1 (3.97) > South S2 (2.39) > North S4 (0.36).

We also investigated the association of risk management with fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection among eldercare personnel. METHODS We used cross-sectional questionnaire data collected by the Danish labour union, FOA . Data were collected 5½ weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was registered in Denmark. Data for the first aim included 2623 participants. Data for the second aim included 1680 participants. All independent variables were mutually adjusted and also adjusted for sex, age, job title and region. RESULTS Fear of infection (49%) and fear of transmitting infection from work to the private sphere (68%) was most frequent in ambulance service. Fear of transmitting infection during work was most frequent in the eldercare (55%). Not all differences in fear of infection and transmission between the five areas of work were explained by differences in risk management. Among eldercare personnel, self-reported exposure to infection and lack of access to test was most consistently associated with fear of infection and fear of transmission, whereas lack of access to personal protective equipment was solely associated with fear of transmission. CONCLUSION We have illustrated differences and similarities in COVID-19 risk management within five areas of work and provide new insights into factors associated with eldercare workers' fear of infection and fear of transmission of infection.","Nabe-Nielsen, Kirsten; Nilsson, Charlotte Juul; Juul-Madsen, Maria; Bredal, Charlotte; Hansen, Lars Ole Preisler; Hansen, Åse Marie",Occupational and environmental medicine,143,1

Although the general public usually relies on over-the-counter (OTC) medication(s) to treat cough/cold symptoms, reliable guidance is needed to help select the appropriate OTC medication for each individual. Consumers may be confused by the wide variety of products available, containing ≥ 1 active pharmaceutical ingredient. Health care professionals are in a position to help people identify the most bothersome symptom(s), evaluate underlying medical conditions and medications, and recommend the most appropriate OTC active ingredient(s) for treatment. Patients should be educated about available OTC medications to manage cough/cold symptoms and the importance of learning to read the package labeling for appropriate dosing and administration. In addition, potentially serious causes of cough/cold symptoms (eg, influenza, asthma, bronchitis) or underlying medical conditions that put the individual at increased risk for complications should be ruled out when symptoms do not resolve within a typical cold timeline. This review article discusses the active ingredients found in OTC medications and the clinical evidence supporting their use. The need to educate health care professionals and patients on the safe and effective use of OTC medications is addressed, and we offer a guide for the management of symptoms that appear during the timeline of a typical common cold.","Jackson Allen, Patricia; Simenson, Steven",Postgraduate medicine,143,1

Here, we report that acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) represents a critical mitochondrial signal to regulate aging through the chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (NuRD) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon mitochondrial stress, the impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle results in a decreased level of citrate, which accounts for reduced production of acetyl-CoA and consequently induces nuclear accumulation of the NuRD and a homeodomain-containing transcription factor DVE-1, thereby enabling decreased histone acetylation and chromatin reorganization. The metabolic stress response is thus established during early life and propagated into adulthood to allow transcriptional regulation for life-span extension. Furthermore, adding nutrients to restore acetyl-CoA production is sufficient to counteract the chromatin changes and diminish the longevity upon mitochondrial stress. Our findings uncover the molecular mechanism of the metabolite-mediated epigenome for the regulation of organismal aging.","Zhu, Di; Wu, Xueying; Zhou, Jun; Li, Xinyu; Huang, Xiahe; Li, Jiasheng; Wu, Junbo; Bian, Qian; Wang, Yingchun; Tian, Ye",Science advances,143,12

DESIGN ""Promoting Active Aging"" (PAA) was a mixed-methods randomized-controlled pilot, to test the feasibility and acceptability of a video-based PA counseling tool and implementation into practice of two mobility assessment tools. SETTING Three primary care practices affiliated with Wake Forest Baptist Health. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 65 years and older who presented for primary care follow-up and were willing and able to answer self-report questions and walk 4 meters (n = 59). INTERVENTION Video-based PA counseling intervention versus control video, ""Healthy Eating."" MEASUREMENTS Potential participants completed mobility assessments: self-report (Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf)) and performance based (4-meter walk test). We assessed PAA's implementation-feasibility, acceptability, and value-via interviews and surveys. Effectiveness was measured via participant attendance at a PA information session. RESULTS Of 92 patients approached, 89 (96.7%) agreed to mobility assessment. Eighty-nine completed MAT-sf, and 97.8% (87/89) completed 4-meter walk test. Sixty-seven (75%) met eligibility criteria, and 59 (88%) consented to be randomized either to the PA counseling intervention (Video-PA) or to active control (Video-C). Most participants viewed the walk test positively (51/59; 86.4%). Staff reported that completion of patient surveys, MAT-sf, and videos required significant staff time and support (median = 26 minutes for all), resulting in low acceptability of MAT-sf and the videos. Attendance at a PA information session did not differ by randomization group (Video-PA = 11/29 (37.9%); Video-C = 12/30 (40%); 95% confidence interval for difference in proportion = -0.29 to 0.25). CONCLUSIONS Mobility assessment, particularly a 4-meter walk test, was feasible in primary care. Tablet-based assessment (MAT-sf) and video counseling tools, selected to reduce staff effort, instead required significant time to implement. Future work to promote PA should identify effective ways to facilitate adoption of PA in sedentary older adults that do not burden staff.","Callahan, Kathryn E; Willard, James; Foley, Kristie L; Miller, Michael E; Houston, Denise K; Kritchevsky, Stephen B; Williamson, Jeff D; Applegate, William B; Girma, Feben; Whitehead, Sarah E; Rejeski, W Jack",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,143,20

These methods have been successfully combined with hierarchical clustering methods for finding phylogenetic trees. However, it may not be suitable to apply these alignment-free methods directly to existing statistical classification methods, because an appropriate statistical classification theory for integrating with the alignment-free representation methods is still lacking. In this article, we propose a discriminant analysis method which uses the discrete wavelet packet transform to classify whole genome sequences. The proposed alignment-free representation statistics of features follow a joint normal distribution asymptotically. The data analysis results indicate that the proposed method provides satisfactory classification results in real time.","Huang, Hsin-Hsiung; Girimurugan, Senthil Balaji",Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,143,31

In the present study, we evaluated the cardiovascular and physiological stress response to 12-h short-term fasting in the menstrual phases of healthy young women. METHODS We performed a randomized crossover study. Subjects were seven female university students (age: 22.3 ± 1.0 years). The experiments comprised four sessions: meal intake in the follicular phase, meal intake in the luteal phase, fasting in the follicular phase, and fasting in the luteal phase. All subjects participated in a total of four experimental sessions during two successive phases (follicular and luteal phase in the same menstrual cycle, or luteal phase and follicular phase in the next menstrual cycle) according to a randomized crossover design. R-R intervals were continuously recorded before and after meals, and power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was performed. Other physiological data were obtained before and 20, 40, 60, and 80 min after meal intake or after the corresponding time point of meal intake (fasting in the follicular or luteal phase). RESULTS Heart rate decreased during fasting in the follicular and luteal phases. High frequency power increased during fasting in the follicular and luteal phases. In addition, salivary cortisol concentrations decreased during fasting in the luteal phase. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, short-term fasting resulted in higher parasympathetic activity and lower cortisol levels in the luteal phase in these young women. These results indicate a possibility to produce an anti-stress effect in the luteal phase, which may reduce menstrual symptoms.","Ohara, Kumiko; Okita, Yoshimitsu; Kouda, Katsuyasu; Mase, Tomoki; Miyawaki, Chiemi; Nakamura, Harunobu",BMC women's health,143,31

Impact of exercise on kinetics of serum levels of protein-bound uraemic toxins, known to exert toxicity and to have kinetics dissimilar of those of urea, has so far not been explored. Furthermore, if any effect, the most optimal intensity, time point and/or required duration of intradialytic exercise to maximise removal remain obscure. We therefore studied the impact of different intradialytic cycling schedules on the removal of protein-bound uraemic toxins during haemodialysis (HD).This randomised cross-over study included seven stable patients who were dialysed with an FX800 dialyser during three consecutive midweek HD sessions of 240 min: (A) without cycling; (B) cycling for 60 min between 60th and 120th minutes of dialysis; and (C) cycling for 60 min between 150th and 210th minutes, with the same cycling load as in session B. Blood and dialysate flows were respectively 300 and 500 mL/min. Blood was sampled from the blood inlet at different time points, and dialysate was partially collected (300 mL/h). Small water soluble solutes and protein-bound toxins were quantified and intradialytic reduction ratios (RR) and overall removal were calculated per solute.Total solute removal and reduction ratios were not different between the three test sessions, except for the reduction ratios RR60-120 and RR150-210 for potassium.In conclusion, we add evidence to the existing literature that, regardless of the timing within the dialysis session, intradialytic exercise has no impact on small solute clearance, and demonstrated also a lack of impact for protein-bound solutes.","De Vos, Celine; Lemarcq, Laure; Dhondt, Annemieke; Glorieux, Griet; Van Biesen, Wim; Eloot, Sunny",The International journal of artificial organs,143,1

Recent reports have shown that the double-flap technique (DFT) provides good outcomes in terms of postoperative nutritional status and quality of life. However, no study has compared the clinical outcomes of the DFT with other reconstruction methods. Here, we evaluated and compared the clinical outcomes between the DFT and jejunal interposition (JI) after PG for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of 34 consecutive patients who had undergone PG for upper third gastric cancer between January 2011 and October 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. The main factors investigated were surgical outcomes, postoperative nutritional status, symptoms, and endoscopic findings 1 year after surgery. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were enrolled (DFT, 14; JI, 20). The operation time was similar between the two techniques (228 and 246 minutes for DFT and JI, respectively, P = 0.377), as were the rates of anastomotic complications (7% and 0% for DFT and JI, respectively, P = 0.412). Body weight loss was significantly lower in the DFT group than in the JI group (-8.1% vs -16.1%, P = 0.001). Total protein and albumin levels were higher in the DFT group than in the JI group (0% vs -2.9%, P = 0.053, and -0.3% vs -6.1%, P = 0.077, respectively). One patient in the DFT group and no patients in the JI group experienced reflux esophagitis (≥ grade B) (P = 0.393). Anastomotic strictures were not observed as postoperative complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcomes revealed that the DFT was safe and feasible, similar to JI. In terms of controlling postoperative body weight loss, the DFT is a better reconstruction technique than JI after PG.","Kumamoto, Tsutomu; Sasako, Mitsuru; Ishida, Yoshinori; Kurahashi, Yasunori; Shinohara, Hisashi",PloS one,143,16

Severe hypoxia in the absence of visible respiratory distress ('silent hypoxia') is increasingly recognised in these patients. There are no published data evaluating lowest recorded pre-hospital oxygen saturation or pre-hospital National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) as a predictor of outcome in patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective service evaluation, we included adult inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from hospital or who died in hospital between 12 March and 28 April 2020 (n = 143). Pre-hospital and in-hospital data were extracted and analysed to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality to inform local triage and emergency management. Results The lowest recorded pre-hospital oxygen saturation was an independent predictor of mortality when controlling for age, gender and history of COPD. A 1% reduction in pre-hospital oxygen saturation increased the odds of death by 13% (OR 1.13, p < 0.001). Lower pre-hospital oxygen saturation predicted mortality after adjusting for the pre-hospital NEWS2 (OR for a 1% reduction in pre-hospital oxygen saturation 1.09, p = 0.02). The pre-hospital NEWS2 was higher in those who died (Median 9; IQR 7-10; n = 24) than in those who survived to discharge (Median 6; IQR 5-8; n = 63). Conclusion This service evaluation suggests that the lowest recorded pre-hospital oxygen saturation may be an independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Lowest pre-hospital oxygen saturation should be recorded and used in the assessment of patients with suspected COVID-19 in pre-hospital and emergency department triage settings.","Dillon, Kate; Hook, Chris; Coupland, Zoe; Avery, Pascale; Taylor, Hazel; Lockyer, Andy",British paramedic journal,143,1

The concept that stem cell injection may reduce tissue injury or assist its recovery after radiation has been recently argued. Herein, we examined the effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) on radiation-induced skin damage in rats. Methods This study is an experimental case control study. ASCs were isolated from peri uterine fat tissue of the rats. Then the rats received a 30 Gy single dose radiation to their buttocks skin using gamma radiation. Next day stem cells were transplanted subcutaneously in 16 rats as the case group. A group of 16 rats was considered as control group with radiation but no transplantation of stem cells. Then rats were examined and observed by macroscopic analysis and phenotypic scores during 4 weeks of follow up. Results The wound size in control group was significantly higher than case group in the second, third and fourth weeks of evaluation (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in skin lesion severity, pathological factors, and the onset of recovery signs between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions It seems that using ASCs alone has not profound effects on reducing radiation-induced cutaneous complications, while combination of these cells with growth factors may produce more promising results.","Khademi, Bijan; Safari, Sima; Mosleh-Shirazi, Mohammad Amin; Mokhtari, Maral; Chenari, Nooshafarin; Razmkhah, Mahboobeh",Stem cell investigation,143,30

This includes both traditional US scans performed by radiology departments as well as point-of-care US (POCUS) performed by bedside clinicians. There has been significant interest in better understanding the appropriate use of imaging and where opportunities to enhance cost-effectiveness may exist. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify published evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of US in the ED and to grade the quality of that evidence. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were considered for inclusion if they were: (1) economic evaluations, (2) studied the clinical use of ultrasound, and (3) took place in an emergency care setting. Included studies were critically appraised using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. RESULTS We identified 631 potentially relevant articles. Of these, 35 studies met all inclusion criteria and were eligible for data abstraction. In general, studies were supportive of the use of US. In particular, 11 studies formed a strong consensus that US enhanced cost-effectiveness in the investigation of pediatric appendicitis and 6 studies supported enhancements in the evaluation of abdominal trauma. Across the studies, weaknesses in methodology and reporting were common, such as lack of sensitivity analyses and inconsistent reporting of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS The body of existing evidence, though limited, generally demonstrates that the inclusion of US in emergency care settings allows for more cost-effective care. The most definitive evidence for improvements in cost-effectiveness surround the evaluation of pediatric appendicitis, followed by the evaluation of abdominal trauma. POCUS outside of trauma has had mixed results.","Lentz, Brian; Fong, Tiffany; Rhyne, Randall; Risko, Nicholas",The ultrasound journal,143,31

In recent years, behavioural economic principles have been used to design novel interventions that increase physical activity. Immediate financial rewards, for instance, can motivate an individual to change physical activity behaviour by lowering the opportunity costs of exercise. This systematic review will summarise the evidence about the effectiveness of financial incentive interventions for improving physical activity in adults. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, EconLit, SPORTDiscus, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception using a comprehensive, electronic search strategy. The search strategy will include terms related to 'financial incentive' and 'physical activity'. Only randomised controlled trials that investigate the effect of financial incentives on physical activity in adult populations and that are written in the English language will be included. Two review authors will independently screen abstracts and titles, complete full text reviews and extract data on objective and self-reported physical activity outcomes. The authors will also assess the study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and provide a systematic presentation and synthesis of the included studies' characteristics and results. If more than two studies are sufficiently similar in population, settings and interventions, we will pool the data to conduct a meta-analysis. If we are unable to perform a meta-analysis, we will conduct a narrative synthesis of the results and produce forest plots for individual studies. Our subgroup analyses will examine the differential effects of an intervention in healthy populations compared to populations with disease pathology and compare the effects of interventions using financial rewards to interventions using financial penalties. DISCUSSION This systematic review will determine the effectiveness of positive and negative financial incentives on physical activity in adults. Findings will help inform the development of public health interventions and research in this field.

This review aims to describe advances in cystic fibrosis-related SRH and highlight optimal practices. RECENT FINDINGS Recent publications suggest that people with cystic fibrosis follow a similar trajectory of sexual development and activity as their noncystic fibrosis peers, although contraception use is lower. Although fertility is reduced in patients with cystic fibrosis, improved survival and assisted reproductive technologies have led to an increasing pursuit and incidence of pregnancy. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator modulators that correct the underlying cystic fibrosis defect might improve fertility and thus far appear safe in pregnancy, though data are limited.Despite medical knowledge of SRH in cystic fibrosis, patients continue to report they lack sufficient education about these aspects of their healthcare, and cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary teams are ill prepared to counsel their patients. SUMMARY Understanding of the effects of cystic fibrosis on SRH continues to improve, although many questions remain regarding optimal care from the choice of contraception to the safety of cystic fibrosis-specific medications in pregnancy. Further development of cystic fibrosis-informed interdisciplinary specialist networks and a wider framework of practice would both enhance health outcomes and better support patients.","Frayman, Katherine B; Chin, Melanie; Sawyer, Susan M; Bell, Scott C",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,143,27

The challenge of anesthesia is to maintain a calm, comfortable, and cooperative patient during the mapping phase. Response surface models (RSMs) are multidrug modeling algorithms. In this pharmacodynamic study, we investigate the first use of RSM with bispectral index (BIS) to predict patient's response to name calling (RNC) and wakefulness (complete neurological tests) during AC. METHODS The study is performed in two phases. We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) using propofol and fentanyl as the modeling group. Effect-site concentrations (Ce) and BIS values were recorded and a RSM is built from the data set. We verified the RSM retrospectively in AC patients, designated as the validation group. Corresponding BIS values were analyzed for RNC and wakefulness. RESULTS A total of 155 data sets of propofol Ce, fentanyl Ce, and BIS pairs were available for modeling. The range of propofol and fentanyl Ce were 0 to 9.95 μg/mL and 0 to 3.69 ng/mL, respectively. Observed BIS ranged from 21 to 98. The model identified an additive interaction between propofol and an opioid. RNC at BIS 64 is predicted by the model and 70 is required for wakefulness. CONCLUSION RSM built from VATS patients is verified with a separate group of AC patient. The BIS target advised for RSM-predicted wakefulness is 70. The model illustrates the timeline to wakefulness during AC under propofol and an opioid. It has implications in guiding, dosing, and estimation of time to wakefulness with propofol and an opioid.","Liou, Jing-Yang; Wang, Hsin-Yi; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Chang, Wen-Kuei; Kuo, I-Ting; Ting, Chien-Kun",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,143,1

Oncologic patients often have a central venous access (port-a-catheter) for chronic treatment. The validity of the measurement by a port-a-catheter of the absolute cardiac index and the detection of changes in cardiac index induced by fluid challenge are unknown. METHODS We conducted a monocentric prospective study. 27 patients were enrolled. 250 ml colloid volume expansions for fluid challenge were performed during ovarian cytoreductive surgery. The volume expansion-induced changes in cardiac index measured by transpulmonary thermodilution by a central venous access (CIcvc) and by a port-a-catheter (CIport) were recorded. RESULTS 23 patients were analyzed with 123 pairs of measurements. Using a Bland and Altman for repeated measurements, the bias (lower and upper limits of agreement) between CIport and CIcvc was 0.14 (-0.59 to 0.88) L/min/m2. The percentage error was 22%. The concordance between the changes in CIport and CIcvc observed during volume expansion was 92% with an r = 0.7 (with exclusion zone). No complications (included sepsis) were observed during the follow up period. CONCLUSIONS The transpulmonary thermodilution by a port-a-catheter is reliable for absolute values estimation of cardiac index and for measurement of the variation after fluid challenge.

We inserted 3.5-mm stainless steel nonlocking self-tapping cortical screws bicortically into 5 osteoporotic humeri. Each screw was first stripped by rotating it 1 full turn past maximum torque. In the control group, the screw was pulled out using an MTS machine (858; MTS Inc, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). In the treatment groups, the screw was removed, the hole was augmented with 1 of the 3 materials (stainless steel wire, polysorb suture, or polyethylene terephthalate glycol plastic sheet), and the screws were replaced and then pulled out. The effect of material on pullout strength was checked for significance (P < .05) using a general linearized latent and mixed model (Stata10; StataCorp, College Station, Texas). The mean (95% confidence interval) pullout strength for the unaugmented hole was 138 N (range 88-189), whereas the holes augmented with plastic, suture, or wire had mean pullout strengths of 255 N (range 177-333), 228 N (range 149-308), and 396 N (range 244-548), respectively. Although wire augmentation resulted in pullout strength that was significantly greater than that of the unaugmented screw, it was still below that of the intact construct.","Pechon, Pierre H M; Mears, Simon C; Langdale, Evan R; Belkoff, Stephen M",Geriatric orthopaedic surgery & rehabilitation,143,1

Factors contributing to these gender disparities must be examined. A significant body of literature indicates men and women are assessed differently in teaching evaluations. However, limited data exist on how faculty gender affects resident evaluation of faculty performance based on the skill being assessed or the clinical practice settings in which the trainee-faculty interaction occurs. OBJECTIVE Evaluate for gender-based differences in the assessment of general internal medicine (GIM) faculty physicians by trainees in inpatient and outpatient settings. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study SUBJECTS: Inpatient and outpatient GIM faculty physicians in an Internal Medicine residency training program from July 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. MAIN MEASURES Faculty scores on trainee teaching evaluations including overall teaching ability and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies (medical knowledge [MK], patient care [PC], professionalism [PROF], interpersonal and communication skills [ICS], practice-based learning and improvement [PBLI], and systems-based practice [SBP]) based on the institutional faculty assessment form. KEY RESULTS In total, 3581 evaluations by 445 trainees (55.1% men, 44.9% women) assessing 161 GIM faculty physicians (50.3% men, 49.7% women) were included. Male faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (male=4.69 vs. female=4.63, p=0.003) and in four of the six ACGME competencies (MK, PROF, PBLI, and SBP) based on our institutional evaluation form. In the inpatient setting, male faculty were rated more favorably for overall teaching (male = 4.70, female = 4.53, p=<0.001) and across all ACGME competencies. The only observed gender difference in the outpatient setting favored female faculty in PC (male = 4.65, female = 4.71, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Male and female GIM faculty performance was assessed differently by trainees. Gender-based differences were impacted by the setting of evaluation, with the greatest difference by gender noted in the inpatient setting.","Sheffield, Virginia; Hartley, Sarah; Stansfield, R Brent; Mack, Megan; Blackburn, Staci; Vaughn, Valerie M; Heidemann, Lauren; Chang, Robert; Lukela, Jennifer Reilly",Journal of general internal medicine,143,11

In this retrospective study, longitudinal survival analysis was performed. We analyzed patient/tumor characteristics and MELD, ALBI and PALBI scores as liver function tests for predicting survival outcome. Survival was analyzed from the date of liver resection until death, liver transplantation, or end of follow-up. Patients were stratified for age, cirrhosis etiology, presence of esophageal varices, hepatocellular carcinoma stage, microvascular invasion, histologic differentiation, and resection margins. We identified 38 patients (alcoholic cirrhosis in 84.2% of patients) resected over an 8-year period. Median preoperative MELD score was 8, ALBI score -2.63, and PALBI score -2.38. During the follow-up period, 24 patients died. Estimated median survival time was 36 months. Microvascular invasion was observed in 33 patients. Higher ALBI score was associated with 23.1% higher relative risk of death.

This single-centre, prospective, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study enrolled obese patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery using an enhanced recovery protocol. Patients received either lidocaine (bolus of 1.5 mg.kg-1 , then a continuous infusion of 2 mg.kg-1 .h-1 until the end of the surgery, then 1 mg.kg-1 .h-1 for 1 h in the recovery area) or identical volumes and rates of 0.9% saline. The primary outcome was the consumption of the equivalent of oxycodone consumption over the first 3 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were: postoperative pain; incidence of nausea and vomiting; bowel function recovery; and lengths of stay in the recovery area and in hospital. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine were measured. On the 178 patients recruited, data were analysed from 176. The median (IQR [range]) equivalent intravenous oxycodone consumption was 3.3 mg (0.0-6.0 [0.0-14.5]) and 5.0 mg (3.3-7.0 [3.3-20.0]) in the lidocaine and saline groups, respectively (difference between medians (95%CI): 1.7 (0.6-3.4) mg; p = 0.004). Length of stay in the recovery area, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, day of recovery of bowel function, and length of stay in hospital were not different between groups.

Many fertility clinicians currently prescribe MI for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as pre-treatment to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or for ovulation induction; however no high-quality evidence is available to support this practice. This review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of inositol in subfertile women with a diagnosis of PCOS. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral supplementation of inositol for reproductive outcomes among subfertile women with PCOS who are trying to conceive. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases (to July 2018): Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED. We also checked reference lists and searched the clinical trials registries. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose, or combination of oral inositol versus placebo, no treatment/standard treatment, or treatment with another antioxidant, or with a fertility agent, or with another type of inositol, among subfertile women with PCOS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were live birth and adverse effects; secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy rates and ovulation rates. We pooled studies using a fixed-effect model, and we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by applying GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS We included 13 trials involving 1472 subfertile women with PCOS who were receiving myo-inositol as pre-treatment to IVF (11 trials), or during ovulation induction (two trials). These studies compared MI versus placebo, no treatment/standard, melatonin, metformin, clomiphene citrate, or DCI. The evidence was of 'low' to 'very low' quality. The main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods, inconsistency, and lack of reporting of clinically relevant outcomes such as live birth and adverse events.We are uncertain whether MI improves live birth rates when compared to standard treatment among women undergoing IVF (OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.75 to 7.83; P = 0.14; 2 RCTs; 84 women; I² = 0%). Very low-quality evidence suggests that for subfertile women with PCOS undergoing pre-treatment to IVF who have an expected live birth rate of 12%, the rate among women using MI would be between 9% and 51%.We are uncertain whether MI may be associated with a decrease in miscarriage rate when compared to standard treatment (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.86; P = 0.02; 4 RCTs; 535 women; I² = 66%; very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS with an expected miscarriage rate of 9% who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, the rate among women using MI would be between 2% and 8%; however this meta-analysis is based primarily on one study, which reported an unusually high miscarriage rate in the control group, and this has resulted in very high heterogeneity. When we removed this trial from the sensitivity analysis, we no longer saw the effect, and we noted no conclusive differences between MI and standard treatment.Low-quality evidence suggests that MI may be associated with little or no difference in multiple pregnancy rates when compared with standard treatment (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.71; P = 0.89; 2 RCTs; 425 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with an expected multiple pregnancy rate of 18%, the rate among women using inositol would be between 12% and 27%.We are uncertain whether MI may be associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate when compared to standard treatment (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.85; P = 0.22; 4 RCTs; 535 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 26%, the rate among women using MI would be between 24% and 40%. Ovulation rates were not reported for this comparison.Other comparisons included only one trial in each, so for the comparisons MI versus antioxidant, MI versus an insulin-sensitising agent, MI versus an ovulation induction agent, and MI versus another DCI, meta-analysis was not possible.No pooled evidence was available for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction, as only single trials performed comparison of the insulin-sensitising agent and the ovulation induction agent. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In light of available evidence of very low quality, we are uncertain whether MI improves live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate in subfertile women with PCOS undergoing IVF pre-treatment taking MI compared to standard treatment. We are also uncertain whether MI decreases miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates for these same women taking MI compared to standard treatment. No pooled evidence is available for use of MI versus placebo, another antioxidant, insulin-sensitising agents, ovulation induction agents, or another type of inositol for women with PCOS undergoing pre-treatment to IVF. No pooled evidence is available for use of MI in women undergoing ovulation induction.","Showell, Marian G; Mackenzie-Proctor, Rebecca; Jordan, Vanessa; Hodgson, Ruth; Farquhar, Cindy",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,143,1

In many cases, this coronavirus leads to the development of the COVID-19 disease. Lung damage in the course of this disease often leads to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and may eventually lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 can develop very quickly and a small percent of those infected will die because of it. There is currently no treatment for COVID-19, therefore the key therapeutic intervention centers around the symptomatic treatment of respiratory failure. The main therapeutic goal is to main-tain gas exchange, mainly oxygenation, at an appropriate level and prevent the intensification of changes in the lung parenchyma. Depending on the severity of hypoxemia different techniques can be used to improve oxygenation. Medical staff dealing with COVID-19 patients should be familiar with both, methods used to treat respiratory failure and the epidemiological risks arising from their use. In some patients, conventional (passive) oxygen therapy alone is sufficient. In patients with worsening respiratory failure high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNOT) may be effective. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) methods can be used to a limited extent. With further disease progression, invasive ventilation must be used and in special situations, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can also be administered. The authors of this article set themselves the goal of presenting the most current knowledge about the epidemiology and patho-physiology of respiratory failure in COVID-19, as well as the methods of its treatment. Given the dynamics of the developing pandemic, this is not an easy task as new scientific data is presented almost every day. However, we believe the knowledge contained in this study will help doctors care for patients with COVID-19. The main target audience of this study is not so much pneumonologists or intensivists who have extensive experience in the application of the techniques discussed here, but rather doctors of other specializations who must master new skills in order to help patients during the time of a pandemic.","Czajkowska-Malinowska, Malgorzata; Kania, Aleksander; Kuca, Paweł Jan; Nasiłowski, Jacek; Skoczyński, Szymon; Sokołowski, Rafał; Śliwiński, Paweł Stanislaw",Advances in respiratory medicine,143,30

Depth of anaesthesia monitoring is also recommended for patients where excessive anaesthetic depth is poorly tolerated, along with cerebral oximetry in patients with proximal femoral fractures. The aims of this descriptive case series were to evaluate the impact of a multimodal intraoperative strategy and its effect on mortality and amputation rate for patients with critical leg ischaemia. In an observational case series, 120 elderly patients undergoing major infra-inguinal bypass between 2007 and 2012 were included in this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Nominal cardiac output (nCO, LiDCOrapid, LiDCO Ltd, UK), bispectral index to monitor depth of anaesthesia (BIS, Covidien, USA) and cerebral oxygenation, rSO2 (Invos, Covidien, USA) readings were obtained before induction of general anaesthesia and throughout surgery. 30 day, 1-year mortality and amputation rates were analysed. Demographics and physiological parameters including correlation with V-POSSUM, age, gender and other co-morbidities were statistically analysed. Thirty-day mortality rate was 0.8% (n = 1). V-POSSUM scoring indicated a predicted mortality of 9%. Amputation rate was less than 2% at one year.

Our aim was to evaluate the relative utility of MR imaging and MRA compared with DSA in detecting cerebral AVMs in the HHT population. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 343 consecutive patients evaluated at the University of California, San Francisco HTT Center of Excellence, 63 met the study inclusion criteria: definite or probable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia defined by meeting at least 2 Curacao criteria or positive genetic testing, as well as having at least 1 brain MR imaging and 1 DSA. MRIs were retrospectively reviewed, and the number of AVMs identified was compared with the number of AVMs identified on DSA. RESULTS Of 63 patients, 45 (71%) had AVMs on DSA with a total of 92 AVMs identified. Of those, 24 (26%) were seen only on DSA; 68 (74%), on both DSA and MR imaging; and 5 additional lesions were seen only on MR imaging. Of the 92 lesions confirmed on DSA, 49 (53.3%) were seen on the 3D-T1 postgadolinium sequence, 52 (56.5%) were seen on the 2D-T1 postgadolinium sequence, 35 (38.0%) were seen on the SWI sequence, 24 (26.1%) were seen on T2 sequence, and 25 (27.2%) were seen on MRA. The sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging as a whole in detecting AVMs then confirmed on DSA were 80.0% and 94.4%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 97.3% and 65.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study reinforces the use of MR imaging as a primary screening tool for cerebral AVMs in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and suggests that 3D-T1 postgadolinium and 2D-T1 postgadolinium performed at 3T are the highest yield sequences.","Vella, M; Alexander, M D; Mabray, M C; Cooke, D L; Amans, M R; Glastonbury, C M; Kim, H; Wilson, M W; Langston, D E; Conrad, M B; Hetts, S W",AJNR.

METHODS In a single-arm, prospective study, 21 patients (mean age 63±16 years; 16 men) with isolated popliteal artery lesions were enrolled and underwent treatment with combined DA and DEB angioplasty under filter protection between October 2009 and February 2014. The majority (18, 86%) presented with lifestyle-limiting intermittent claudication and 3 with critical limb ischemia. Fifteen (71%) target sites were de novo lesions; 4 were occlusions. The main outcome was primary patency; secondary outcomes were technical success, secondary patency, and early and midterm morbidity and mortality. RESULTS The TurboHawk atherectomy device was used in 15 (71%) patients and the SilverHawk peripheral plaque excision system in the remaining 6 patients. The In.Pact Admiral/Pacific DEB was used in the majority of cases (15, 71%). The technical success rate was 90% (n=19). One flow-limiting dissection was treated with bailout stenting. Complications included a perforation of the popliteal artery and 2 puncture site hematomas; there was no distal embolic event. The mean follow-up was 18±12 months. Two restenoses were retreated successfully. Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency at 12 and 18 months were 95% and 90%, respectively; the secondary patency was 100%. One (5%) patient died in follow-up. None of the patients had an amputation. CONCLUSION In this prospective single-arm study, the combined therapy of DA and DEB angioplasty for popliteal artery lesions showed promising midterm performance. The combination of DA and DEB may, in highly selected patients, overcome the challenges presented by the mobility of the knee joint.","Stavroulakis, Konstantinos; Bisdas, Theodosios; Torsello, Giovanni; Stachmann, Arne; Schwindt, Arne",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,143,22

METHOD Between January 2018 and January 2019, 100 patients with anterior urethral stricture planned for AU were randomized into PSG or BMG arms (CTRI/2018/07/015028). Anatomic and functional variables were compared pre-operatively and post-operatively. Primary outcome was success rate at 18 months and it was defined if any of the three criteria were met, i.e. either maximum urinary flow (Qmax) > 15 ml/s or urethral calibration of 16 French or ability to traverse the repair with 17 French cystoscope. Secondary outcomes were functional parameters such as International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Score, Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction (MSHQ-EJD), and Urethral Stricture Surgery-Patient Related Outcome Measure (USS-PROM). RESULTS Pre-operative variables were comparable between both the arms. Median duration of follow-up was 22 months (18-24 months). At 18 months, the success rates of AU with PSG and BMG were comparable (89% v/s 91%; p = 0.70, 95% CI-0.33 to 5.21). The improvements in Qmax (p = 0.06), IPSS (p = 0.43) and USS-PROM (p = 0.49) were comparable between the two arms. There was no statistically significant difference in the IIEF-Erectile domain (p = 0.07), IIEF-Orgasmic domain (p = 0.11) and MSHQ-EJD (p = 0.20) following AU at 18 months. Clavien-Dindo grade I complications were 12.7% in PSG and 16.7% in BMG. CONCLUSION This study provides level 1 evidence of no statistical significant difference in outcomes of AU using BMG or PSG.","Tyagi, Shantanu; Parmar, Kalpesh Mahesh; Singh, Shrawan Kumar; Sharma, Anuj; Shukla, Mukesh; Sharma, Aditya Prakash; Devana, Sudheer Kumar; Sharma, Gopal; Kumar, Santosh; Mandal, Arup Kumar",World journal of urology,143,23

Preference elicitation methods provide insight into client preferences that may be used to optimize products and services. Given increased utilization of such methods in HIV prevention, this article identifies and reviews these methods and synthesizes their application to HIV prevention technologies. METHODS In May 2020, we systematically searched peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science for studies employing quantitative preference elicitation methods to measure preferences for HIV prevention technologies among populations of any age, sex, or location. Quality assessment used an existing checklist (PREFS) and a novel adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (PROSPERO #CRD42018087027). RESULTS We screened 5022 titles and abstracts, reviewed 318 full texts, and included 84 studies. Common methods employed were discrete-choice experiment (33%), conjoint analysis (25%), and willingness-to-participate/try/accept (21%). Studies were conducted in 25 countries and had a mean of 768 participants (range = 26-7176), two-thirds of them male. Common HIV prevention technologies included pre-exposure prophylaxis (23%), voluntary testing and counseling (19%), HIV self-testing (17%), vaccines (15%), and topical microbicides (9%). Most attributes focused on product design (side effects, frequency), service design (provider type, location), acceptability or willingness to accept/pay; results are summarized in these categories, by prevention type. Mean quality-adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score was 4.5/8 (standard deviation = 2.1) and mean PREFS scores was 3.47/5 (standard deviation = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS This review synthesizes extant literature on quantitative measurement of preferences for HIV prevention technologies. This can enable practitioners to improve prevention products and interventions, and ultimately reduce HIV incidence.","Beckham, S Wilson; Crossnohere, Norah L; Gross, Margaret; Bridges, John F P",The patient,143,30

Immunological studies have shown that most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit substantially elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, which in turn activate protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell migration. Here we propose pentoxifylline, a drug with low cost and toxicity, as a possible treatment for COVID-19 in basis of its interesting properties.","Ghasemnejad-Berenji, Morteza; Pashapour, Sarvin; Sadeghpour, Sonia","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",143,22

Of the 15-20% patients that develop pulmonary symptoms, there is a sub-set that develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which rapidly progresses into a critical condition. Marked elevation of cytokines and chemokines is observed in these patients. Additional markers of inflammation, coagulation and organ damage such as CRP, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin, Troponin-I are also elevated. The hyperinflammatory condition leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage and dysfunction of coagulation pathway which resembles disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and may lead to multi-organ failure. Areas Covered: To focus on the role of anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibodies (mAb's), such as Itolizumab. Expert Opinion: Itolizumab is an anti-CD6 humanized IgG1 mAb that binds to domain 1 of CD-6, a receptor present on Teffector cells, responsible for priming, activation and differentiation of T-Cells. Itolizumab significantly reduces T-cell proliferation along with substantially downregulating the production of various chemokines and cytokines. It has been approved for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013 and is currently being studied for addressing COVID-19 related cytokine storm and its complications. This current opinion reviews its use in COVID-19 infections; its dose, administration protocol, contra-indications and safety in patients suffering from moderate to severe ARDS in prevention and treatment of the cytokine storm and its complications.","Loganathan, Subramanian; Athalye, Sandeep N; Joshi, Shashank R",Expert opinion on biological therapy,143,24

DATA SOURCES The electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (Ovid) and ERIC (Ovid) were searched. STUDY SELECTION Studies were considered eligible when reporting on methods to prioritise recommendations. DATA EXTRACTION Two teams of reviewers performed the data extraction which was defined prior to this phase. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS Eleven methods were identified that are designed to prioritise recommendations. After completing the data extraction, none of the methods met all the predefined criteria. Nine methods were considered user-friendly. One study validated the developed method. Five methods prioritised recommendations based on objective features, not affected by personal opinion or knowledge and expected to be reproducible by different users. CONCLUSION There are several methods available to prioritise recommendations following analyses of AEs. All these methods can be used to discuss and select recommendations for implementation. None of the methods is a user-friendly and validated method that prioritises recommendations based on objective features. Although there are possibilities to further improve their features, the 'Typology of safety functions' by de Dianous and Fiévez, and the 'Hierarchy of hazard controls' by McCaughan have the most potential to select high-quality recommendations as they have only a few clearly defined categories in a well-arranged ordinal sequence.","Bos, Kelly; van der Laan, Maarten J; Dongelmans, Dave A",BMJ open quality,143,17

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. From March 2019 to June 2020, 11 burn patients and acute or chronic wound patients (including 10 males and 1 female, aged 23 to 85 years) in the Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital were conformed to the inclusion criteria. A total of 23 specimens were collected, including 6 whole blood specimens, 1 skin tissue specimen, 1 drained pus specimen, and 15 wound secretion swab specimens. Each specimen was divided into two parts, one for microbial culture identification and the other for mNGS detection. The number and types of pathogens detected by the microbial culture and mNGS were recorded, and the consistency of the two methods were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with paired Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: With the microbial culture method, in all the 23 specimens, pathogens were not detected in 5 specimens, and 35 pathogens were detected in the remaining 18 specimens, belonging to 9 species of bacteria and 2 species of fungi. A single pathogen was detected in 5 specimens, 2 pathogens were detected in 9 specimens, and 3 pathogens were detected in 4 specimens. With the mNGS method, in all the 23 specimens, no pathogen was detected in 1 specimen, 75 pathogens were detected in the remaining 22 specimens, belonging to 28 species of bacteria, 3 species of fungi, and 3 species of viruses. A single pathogen was detected in 8 specimens, 2 pathogens were detected in 5 specimens, 3 pathogens were detected in 2 specimens, 4 pathogens were detected in 3 specimens, 6 pathogens were detected in 2 specimens, and 1 specimen each with 7 and 20 pathogens detected. The number of pathogens detected in each specimen by microbial culture method was 2(1, 2), which was significantly less than 2(1,4) by mNGS method (Z=3.359, P<0.01). In 5 specimens, no bacteria were detected by microbial culture method, while bacteria and virus were detected by mNGS method in each 2 specimens. Among the 14 specimens with two or more types of pathogens detected by mNGS method, the relative abundance of bacteria in the first place ranged from 28.8% to 95.9%. Of all the 23 specimens, 7 (30.4%) of the two methods had completely the same results, 5 (21.7%) of the results were completely inconsistent, and 11 (47.8%) of the results were not completely the same. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional microbial culture method, the mNGS method has higher detection sensitivity and stronger ability to detect pathogens, and can determine the main pathogens of mixed infections. As a supplement to the culture method, the mNGS method is expected to play an important role in the diagnosis of burn and acute or chronic wound infection.","Li, F; Yin, K N; Hu, Q; Zhang, Q X; Chen, Q; Yang, L L; Chen, X; Sun, Y J",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,143,29

Based on event system theory, we argue that the onset of the pandemic created a strong event because it was highly novel, disruptive, and critical. We test this by examining 16 weeks of job applications for 14 organizations that differ in terms of whether the jobs require employees to work from home or face-to-face. We use Bliese, Adler, and Flynn's (2017) transition framework and discontinuous random coefficient growth curve modeling to test the pandemic's effect on job search behavior both during the event onset and then the weeks following the onset. Importantly, we include a 9-week preonset baseline period to provide more rigorous tests of change. Results show that the onset of the pandemic created an immediate increase in job search behavior (job applications), and this effect endured into the postonset period. Job type moderated these trends, such that the onset and postonset applications were substantially greater for work-from-home jobs (which followed a negatively accelerated curve) compared to face-to-face jobs. These findings advance the job search literature by introducing event system theory and transition frameworks to better understand how and why events uniquely influence job search behavior over time.

This cell culture system mimics the human airway environment and facilitates culturing of various respiratory agents. The cells were inoculated with human bocavirus-positive nasopharyngeal washes from children, and virus replication was monitored by measuring apical release of the virus via real-time PCR. Furthermore, we identified different viral mRNAs in the infected cells. All mRNAs were transcribed from a single promoter but varied due to alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, similar to what has been described for bovine parvovirus and minute virus of canines, the other two members of the Bocavirus genus. Thus, transcription of human bocavirus displays strong homology to the transcription of the other bocaviruses. In conclusion, we report here for the first time that human bocavirus can be propagated in an in vitro culture system and present a detailed map of the set of mRNAs that are produced by the virus.","Dijkman, Ronald; Koekkoek, Sylvie M; Molenkamp, Richard; Schildgen, Oliver; van der Hoek, Lia",Journal of virology,143,31

We aimed to identify the pattern of substance use among high school students and its relationship with psychosocial factors. STUDY DESIGN A cross-sectional study. METHODS The study was conducted in Oct 2019 among students in the senior secondary school in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State; southwestern Nigeria. Participants were selected using random sampling, and data were collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Kessler Psychological distress scale and an adapted version of the NIDA-Modified ASSIST. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were carried out to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS Overall, 682 students participated in the study. The lifetime and current prevalence of any substance were 17.3% (95% CI: 14.7%, 20.5%) and 11.7% (95% CI: 9.0, 14.0), respectively. Although most substance use variables increases the risk of psychological distress, history of lifetime substance use AOR= 3.03 (95% CI: 1.19, 7.72, P=0.020) and absence of direct parental care AOR=2.04 (1.19, 3.48, P=0.009) significantly increases the risk of experiencing psychological distress. Parental substance use AOR=3.48 (95% CI: 1.57, 7.69, P=0.002), male gender AOR=2.97 (95% CI: 1.82, 4.83, P=0.001) significantly increased substance use risk while having married parents AOR=0.50 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.92, P=0.027) and living with parents AOR 0.39 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.75, P=0.005) were significant protective factors. CONCLUSION The prevalence of substance use among these adolescents was substantial. Drug education initiated in primary school and services aimed at promoting the mental wellbeing of adolescents may go a long way in decreasing substance use among this population.","Obadeji, Adetunji; Kumolalo, Banji F; Oluwole, Lateef O; Ajiboye, Adedotun S; Dada, Mobolaji U; Ebeyi, Rose Chidindu",Journal of research in health sciences,143,5

Such wave functions have tremendous flexibility, which makes these methods incredibly powerful but can also lead to inconsistencies in the description of the electronic structure of molecules. In this paper, the problems that can arise in vCAS calculations are illustrated by calculations on the BH and BF molecules. BH is well described by the full vCAS wave function, which accounts for molecular dissociation and 2s-2p near-degeneracy in the boron atom. The same is not true for the full vCAS wave function for BF. There is mixing of core and active orbitals at short internuclear distances and swapping of core and active orbitals at large internuclear distances. In addition, the virtual 2π orbitals, which were included in the active space to account for the 2s-2p near degeneracy effect, are used instead to describe radial correlation of the electrons in the F2pπ-like pairs. Although the above changes lead to lower vCAS energies, they lead to higher vCAS+1+2 energies as well as irregularities and/or discontinuities in the potential energy curves. All of the above problems can be addressed by using the spin-coupled generalized valence bond-inspired vCAS wave function for BF, which includes only a subset of the atomic valence orbitals in the active space.","Xu, Lu T; Dunning, Thom H",The Journal of chemical physics,143,19

Early research across the globe has found wide ranging psychological responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how different coping styles can be effective in mitigating mental ill health would enable better tailored psychological support. AIMS The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of psychosocial responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including depression, anxiety and distress, as well as effective coping styles in an Australian sample. METHOD A sample of 1,495 adults, residing in Australia between April 3rd and May 3rd 2020, completed an online survey which measured psychological distress (Impact of Events Scale-Revised), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS-21), as well as coping strategies (Brief COPE). RESULTS 47% of the respondents were experiencing some degree of psychological distress. Females experienced higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than males. Coping strategies associated with better mental health were positive reframing, acceptance and humour. Conversely, self-blame, venting, behavioural disengagement and self-distraction were associated with poorer mental health. CONCLUSION Rates of psychological symptoms amongst the Australian population are similar to those reported in other countries. Findings add to the growing literature demonstrating a gender disparity in the mental health impacts of COVID-19. Positive emotion focused coping strategies may be effective for reducing psychological symptoms. Understanding psychosocial responses including beneficial coping strategies are crucial to manage the current COVID-19 situation optimally, as well as to develop mental health response plans for future pandemics.","Gurvich, Caroline; Thomas, Natalie; Thomas, Elizabeth Hx; Hudaib, Abdul-Rahman; Sood, Lomash; Fabiatos, Kali; Sutton, Keith; Isaacs, Anton; Arunogiri, Shalini; Sharp, Gemma; Kulkarni, Jayashri",The International journal of social psychiatry,143,8

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country.","Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Anwar, Samsul; Gan, Alex Kurniawan; Setiawan, Abdul M; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Sofyan, Hizir; Vo, Trung Quang; Hadisoemarto, Panji Fortuna; Müller, Ruth; Groneberg, David A; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,143,7

In human epilepsy surgical resections as well as in animal models, an involvement of the adaptive immune system was observed. We here analyzed the presence of T cells in various subgroups of MTLE. We aimed to answer the question of how much inflammation was present and whether the presence of T cells was associated with seizures or associated with hippocampal neurodegeneration. METHODS We quantified the numbers of CD3+ T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the hippocampus of patients with gangliogliomas (GGs; intrahippocampal and extrahippocampal, with and without sclerosis), febrile seizures, and postinfectious encephalitic epilepsy and compared this with Rasmussen encephalitis, Alzheimer disease, and normal controls. RESULTS We could show that T cell numbers were significantly elevated in MTLE compared to healthy controls. CD3+ as well as CD8+ T cell numbers, however, varied highly among MTLE subgroups. By comparing GG patients with and without hippocampal sclerosis (HS), we were able to show that T-cell numbers were increased in extrahippocampal GG patients with hippocampal neuronal loss and HS, whereas extrahippocampal GG cases without hippocampal neuronal loss (i.e., absence of HS) did not differ from healthy controls. Importantly, T cell numbers in MTLE correlated with the degree of neuronal loss, whereas no correlation with seizure frequency or disease duration was found. Finally, we found that in nearly all MTLE groups, T cell numbers remained elevated even years after the inciting event. SIGNIFICANCE We here provide a detailed histopathological investigation of the involvement of T cells in various subgroups of MTLE, which suggests that T cell influx correlates to neuronal loss rather than seizure activity.","Tröscher, Anna R; Sakaraki, Eirini; Mair, Katharina M; Köck, Ulrike; Racz, Attila; Borger, Valeri; Cloppenborg, Thomas; Becker, Albert J; Bien, Christian G; Bauer, Jan",Epilepsia,143,1

The relative prevalence of pneumonia types (community acquired, hospital acquired, ventilator associated) and causative pathogens is not well described in patients with respiratory failure. METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted in the medical ICU (34 beds) of Barnes-Jewish Hospital, an academic referral center of 1,300 beds from January 2016-December 2016. All patients who were prospectively adjudicated to have respiratory failure and pneumonia (RFP) regardless of pneumonia type were classified into one of four microbiologic categories: pathogen negative, antibiotic-susceptible pathogen (according to ceftriaxone susceptibility), antibiotic-resistant pathogen, and viruses. The primary outcomes assessed were the hospital mortality rate and inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy (IIAT) for non-viral pathogens. RESULTS Among 364 consecutive patients with RFP, 63 (17.3%) had organisms that were antibiotic susceptible, 104 (28.6%) had antibiotic-resistant organisms, 118 (32.4%) were pathogen negative, and 79 (21.7%) had viral infections. For these categories, IIAT occurred in 3.2%, 21.2%, 0.8%, and 0, respectively (p < 0.001). Vasopressor-requiring shock was present in 61.9%, 72.1%, 68.6%, and 67.1%, respectively (p = 0.585), and the hospital mortality rates were 27.0%, 48.1%, 31.4%, and 36.7%, respectively (p = 0.020). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified IIAT as an independent predictor of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio 5.28; 95% confidence interval 2.72-10.22; p = 0.012). Male gender, increasing Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, greater age, and the presence of shock also predicted death. CONCLUSIONS Microbiologic categorization of patients with RFP suggests that antibiotic-resistant pathogens and viruses are associated with the highest mortality rates. Vasopressor-requiring shock was common regardless of the microbiologic categorization of RFP. Future development and use of rapid diagnostics and novel therapeutics targeting specific RFP pathogens may allow more timely administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and enhance antibiotic stewardship practices.","Fisher, Kristen; Trupka, Tracy; Micek, Scott T; Juang, Paul; Kollef, Marin H",Surgical infections,143,27

OBJECTIVE To identify patients with muscle symptoms confirmed by statin rechallenge and compare lipid-lowering efficacy for 2 nonstatin therapies, ezetimibe and evolocumab. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-stage randomized clinical trial including 511 adult patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and history of intolerance to 2 or more statins enrolled in 2013 and 2014 globally. Phase A used a 24-week crossover procedure with atorvastatin or placebo to identify patients having symptoms only with atorvastatin but not placebo. In phase B, after a 2-week washout, patients were randomized to ezetimibe or evolocumab for 24 weeks. INTERVENTIONS Phase A: atorvastatin (20 mg) vs placebo. Phase B: randomization 2:1 to subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Coprimary end points were the mean percent change in LDL-C level from baseline to the mean of weeks 22 and 24 levels and from baseline to week 24 levels. RESULTS Of the 491 patients who entered phase A (mean age, 60.7 [SD, 10.2] years; 246 women [50.1%]; 170 with coronary heart disease [34.6%]; entry mean LDL-C level, 212.3 [SD, 67.9] mg/dL), muscle symptoms occurred in 209 of 491 (42.6%) while taking atorvastatin but not while taking placebo. Of these, 199 entered phase B, along with 19 who proceeded directly to phase B for elevated creatine kinase (N = 218, with 73 randomized to ezetimibe and 145 to evolocumab; entry mean LDL-C level, 219.9 [SD, 72] mg/dL). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, LDL-C level with ezetimibe was 183.0 mg/dL; mean percent LDL-C change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.5% to -12.9%), absolute change, -31.0 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 103.6 mg/dL; mean percent change, -54.5% (95% CI, -57.2% to -51.8%); absolute change, -106.8 mg/dL (P < .001). LDL-C level at week 24 with ezetimibe was 181.5 mg/dL; mean percent change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.8% to -12.5%); absolute change, -31.2 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 104.1 mg/dL; mean percent change, -52.8% (95% CI, -55.8% to -49.8%); absolute change, -102.9 mg/dL (P < .001). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -37.8%; absolute difference, -75.8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -36.1%; absolute difference, -71.7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28.8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and 20.7% of evolocumab-treated patients (log-rank P = .17). Active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

This study describes the experience at our institution in treating tandem occlusions with a proximal to distal approach in the acute stroke setting. METHODS A retrospective review of acute strokes caused by tandem occlusions requiring thrombectomy were performed. RESULTS 16 cases were identified with a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation of 13.1 ± 3.9. The proximal occlusion was crossed initially with a microwire in all cases. All carotid occlusions were treated with stenting, and intracranial vessel thrombectomy was performed with a variety of devices. Procedure related complications occurred in two (12.5%) patients. Eight patients (50%) achieved a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). CONCLUSIONS A tandem occlusion of the carotid artery at the bifurcation with a concomitant intracranial occlusion is a relatively rare and complex presentation of acute stroke. We have found that addressing the proximal lesion first and covering it with a stent prior to performing distal thrombectomy appears to be a safe and effective option in the treatment algorithm.","Spiotta, Alejandro M; Lena, Jonathan; Vargas, Jan; Hawk, Harris; Turner, Raymond D; Chaudry, M Imran; Turk, Aquilla S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,143,1

It remains unclear how synovial microenvironment impinges on CD4+ T cells pathogenic functions. Here, we identified a TLR4+ follicular helper T (Tfh) cell-like population present in the blood and expanded in synovial fluid. TLR4+ T cells possess a two-pronged pathogenic activity whereby direct TLR4+ engagement by endogenous ligands in the arthritic joint reprograms them from an IL-21 response, known to sponsor antibody production towards an IL-17 inflammatory program recognized to fuel tissue damage. Ex vivo, synovial fluid TLR4+ T cells produced IL-17, but not IL-21. Blocking TLR4 signaling with a specific inhibitor impaired IL-17 production in response to synovial fluid recognition. Mechanistically, we unveiled that T-cell HLA-DR regulates their TLR4 expression. TLR4+ T cells appear to uniquely reconcile an ability to promote systemic antibody production with a local synovial driven tissue damage program.","Amaral-Silva, Daniela; Gonçalves, Rute; Torrão, Rita C; Torres, Rita; Falcão, Sandra; Gonçalves, Maria João; Araújo, Maria Paula; Martins, Maria José; Lopes, Carina; Neto, Agna; Marona, José; Costa, Tiago; Castelão, Walter; Silva, Ana Bento; Silva, Inês; Lourenço, Maria Helena; Mateus, Margarida; Gonçalves, Nuno Pina; Manica, Santiago; Costa, Manuela; Pimentel-Santos, Fernando M; Mourão, Ana Filipa; Branco, Jaime C; Soares, Helena",Communications biology,143,5

It is a common cause of liver failure in pregnancy and often needs to be admitted to the department of critical care medicine because of the rapid development of acute hepatic dysfunction and severe acute renal dysfunction. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder is not very clear although there have been many studies on it before. Meanwhile, the relatively high mortality requires a better recognition in order to better guide clinical decision making. Our previous multicentre retrospective study on AFLP demonstrated that total bilirubin and serum creatinine were independent risk factors for perinatal maternal mortality. And we aim to further assess maternal outcomes and risk factors in AFLP patients treated without plasma exchange or renal replacement therapy based on previous data we collected.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 133 hospitalized patients with AFLP was collected from four Chinese tertiary hospitals during the period between January 2009 and April 2014. One hundred thirty three patients were divided into two subgroups containing patients treated without plasma exchange (PE) or renal replacement therapy (CRT) and patients treated with PE or/and CRT. Logistic regression was used to analyze independent risk factors for maternal mortality of AFLP treated without PE or CRT.Results: The maternal mortality rate was 12.0% in subgroup of patients treated without PE or CRT. And in subgroup of patients treated with PE or/and CRT, the maternal mortality rate was 26.8%. Independent risk factors for maternal mortality of AFLP treated without PE or CRT were direct bilirubin (OR = 1.012; 95% CI, 1.002-1.022) and serum creatinine (OR = 1.022; 95% CI, 1.007-1.036).Conclusion: Although less liver and kidney damage in AFLP treated without PE or CRT, direct bilirubin and serum creatinine remained to be independent risk factors for maternal mortality. Thus, the level of bilirubin and serum creatinine might not be necessary for AFLP to decide whether to give plasma exchange or dialysis treatment.","Gao, Qiang; Ma, Yujie; Zhang, Jicheng; Chen, Xiukai; Liu, Fen; Tian, Suochen; Qu, Xin","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",143,30

Advances in surgical technologies and techniques have raised concerns about patient safety. Bariatric surgeons and programs are under increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies, insurers, and public health officials to provide high quality and safe care for bariatric patients at all phases of care. METHODS During the 2009 annual meeting of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), a panel of experts convened to provide updated information on patient safety and best practices in bariatric surgery. The following article is a summary of this panel presentation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Weight loss surgery is a field that is evolving and adapting to multiple external pressures. Safety concerns along with increasing public scrutiny have led to a systematic approach to defining best practices, creating standards of care, and identifying mechanisms to ensure that patients consistently receive the best and most effective care possible. In many ways, bariatric surgery and multidisciplinary bariatric surgery programs may serve as a model for other programs and surgical specialties in the near future.","Gould, J; Ellsmere, J; Fanelli, R; Hutter, M; Jones, S; Pratt, J; Schauer, P; Schirmer, B; Schwaitzberg, S; Jones, D B",Surgical endoscopy,143,26

Although the pathogen for COVID-19, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified, the pandemic is still ongoing. The critically ill COVID-19 patients account for most disease-associated death; thus, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic factors that would help determine therapeutic approaches. METHODS In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings in 100 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Hubei Women & Children Healthcare Hospital (Guanggu District), of whom 22 patients died in hospital, and 78 patients survived. RESULTS We found that age, lymphocyte count, and total bilirubin concentration were an independent prognostic factor for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Of particular importance, we observed a significant elevation of myocardium injury biomarkers, including CK-MB, high-sensitivity cardiac troponini I (hs-cTnI), and Mb, in the non-survivor group. These myocardium injury biomarkers appeared to correlate with the time of survival, and two multivariate models have suggested hs-cTnI was a novel prognostic factor with a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 84.9%. CONCLUSIONS Altogether, our study highlighted the prognostic significance of myocardium injury biomarkers in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Monitoring myocardium injury biomarkers would predict patient survival and guide therapeutic strategy.","Cao, Liang; Zhang, Sha; Luo, Xi; Wang, Enxin; Bai, Yang; Li, Zhe; Li, Feng; Ma, Jing; Liu, Haitao",Annals of palliative medicine,143,29

PNS have the functions of scavenging free radicals, anti-inflammation, improving blood supply for tissue and so on. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PNS on the oxidative stress of immune cells induced by porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) infection in vitro and in vivo. METHODS Using an oxidative stress model of PCV2 infection in a porcine lung cell line (3D4/2 cells) and mice, the levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), total glutathione (T-GSH), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the activities of xanthine oxidase (XOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) were determined to evaluate the regulatory effects of PNS on oxidative stress. RESULTS PNS treatment significantly reduced the levels of NO and ROS, the content of GSSG and the activities of XOD, MPO, and iNOS (p < 0.05), while significantly increasing GSH and the ratio of GSH/GSSG in infected 3D4/2 cells (p < 0.05).Similarly, in the in vivo study, PNS treatment significantly decreased the level of ROS in spleen lymphocytes of infected mice (p < 0.05), increased the levels of GSH and T-GSH (p < 0.05), significantly decreased the GSSG level (p < 0.05), and decreased the activities of XOD, MPO, and iNOS.

Less commonly, long-term urothelial irritation from a calculus may also pose a risk of malignant transformation. CASE PRESENTATION A 77-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities presented with a chronic right renal pelvic staghorn calculus and findings concerning for emphysematous pyelonephritis. He was subsequently taken to the operating room for a planned laparoscopic right nephrectomy. Final pathology analysis revealed sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the renal pelvis with superimposed pyelonephritis and renal abscesses. Preoperative imaging was not suggestive of malignancy. CONCLUSION Although SCC of the urothelium can be caused by chronic irritation, its presentation is usually isolated to the lower urinary tract and is rarely encountered in the renal pelvis. Our patient's presentation with sarcomatoid SCC is an even rarer entity. Chronic staghorn calculi must be considered as a potential risk factor for the development of both UTI and malignant urothelial transformation.","Kivlin, Dana; Tong, Carmen; Friedlander, Justin; Perosio, Patricia; Simhan, Jay",Journal of endourology case reports,143,16

These cytokines include heterodimers sharing distinct α (IL-12A, IL-23A, and IL-27A) with two β (IL-12B and Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3 [EBI3]) chains, respectively, IL-12 (IL-12B plus IL-12A) and IL-23 (IL-12B plus IL-23A) sharing IL-12B, IL-27 (EBI3 plus IL-27A), IL-35 (EBI3 plus IL-12A), and IL-39 (EBI3 plus IL-23A) sharing EBI3. In this context, we have recently reported that highly pure neutrophils incubated with TLR8 agonists produce functional IL-23. Previously, we showed that neutrophils incubated with LPS plus IFNγ for 20 h produce IL-12. Herein, we investigated whether highly pure, TLR8-activated, neutrophils produce EBI3, and in turn IL-27, IL-35, and IL-39, the IL-12 members containing it. We report that neutrophils incubated with TLR8 ligands, TNFα and, to a lesser extent, LPS, produce and release remarkable amounts of EBI3, but not IL-27A, consequently excluding the possibility for an IL-27 production. We also report a series of unsuccessful experiments performed to investigate whether neutrophil-derived EBI3 associates with IL-23A to form IL-39. Furthermore, we show that neutrophils incubated with IFNγ in combination with either TLR8 or TLR4 ligands express/produce neither IL-12, nor IL-35, due to the inability of IFNγ, contrary to previous findings, to activate IL12A transcription. Even IL-27 was undetectable in supernatants harvested from IFNγ plus R848-treated neutrophils, although they were found to accumulate IL27A transcripts. Finally, by immunohistochemistry experiments, EBI3-positive neutrophils were found in discrete pathologies only, including diverticulitis, cholecystitis, Gorham disease, and Bartonella Henselae infection, implying a specific role of neutrophil-derived EBI3 in vivo.","Cassatella, Marco A; Gardiman, Elisa; Arruda-Silva, Fabio; Bianchetto-Aguilera, Francisco; Gasperini, Sara; Bugatti, Mattia; Vermi, William; Larousserie, Frederique; Devergne, Odile; Tamassia, Nicola",Journal of leukocyte biology,143,1

Recently we showed that during differentiation of human DCs from monocyte precursors, Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-binding capacity is lost, although integrin expression levels were maintained constant, suggesting a different regulation mechanism of this integrin on different cell types. However, the exact role of LFA-1 in DC adhesion and migration remains obscure. Chemokines are potent regulators of integrin function, influencing migratory and adhesive properties of leukocytes. Here, we show that upon vaccination of cancer patients with human DCs, cells that have migrated in vivo into the lymph nodes upregulated the active form of LFA-1. We further show that exposure of human DCs to the lymphoid chemokine CCL21 specifically restores the high-affinity form of LFA-1 and induces binding to its ligand ICAM-1 under low shear stress. Our data indicate that on DCs LFA-1 may function as an inducible anchor during lymphatic transmigration or within the lymph nodes. A thorough understanding of the adhesive events during the DC life cycle will help to improve the outcome of DC-based antitumor clinical trials.","Eich, Christina; de Vries, I Jolanda M; Linssen, Peter C M; de Boer, Annemiek; Boezeman, Jan B; Figdor, Carl G; Cambi, Alessandra",Immunology and cell biology,143,1

METHODS We performed a systematic search of four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO) for longitudinal studies of prognostic factors of physical function at ≥ 1 month among older adults ≥ 50 years old with surgically treated hip fracture, complemented with hand-searching. Two reviewers independently screened papers for inclusion and assessed the quality of all the included papers using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We assigned the evidence level for each prognostic factor based on consistency in findings and study quality. RESULTS From 98 papers that met our inclusion criteria, we identified 107 pre-discharge prognostic factors and organized them into the following seven categories: demographic, physical, cognitive, psychosocial, socioeconomic, injury-related, and process of care. Potentially modifiable factors with strong or moderate evidence of an association included total length of stay, physical function at discharge, and grip strength. Factors with strong or moderate evidence of no association included gender, fracture type, and time to surgery. Factors with limited, conflicting, or inconclusive evidence included body-mass index, psychological resilience, depression, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight potentially modifiable prognostic factors that could be targeted and non-modifiable prognostic factors that could be used to identify patients who may benefit from more intensive intervention or to advise patients on their expectations on recovery. Examining the efficacies of existing interventions targeting these prognostic factors would inform future studies and whether any of such interventions could be incorporated into clinical practice.","Lim, K K; Matchar, D B; Chong, J L; Yeo, W; Howe, T S; Koh, J S B",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,143,24

The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies' recommended ""supportive care only"" avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of ""what was working and what wasn't working,"" the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically.

The modifications generally involve the formation of spherules, vesicles, and/or multivesicular bodies associated with various organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes. These virus-induced organelles house the viral RNA replication complex and are known as virus factories or viroplasms. Membrane and organelle alterations are attributed to the action of one or two viral proteins, which additionally act as a scaffold for the assembly of a large complex of proteins of both viral and host origin and viral RNA. Some virus factories have been shown to align with and traffic along microfilaments. In addition to viral RNA replication, the factories may be involved in other processes such as viral RNA translation and cell-to-cell virus transport. Confining the process of RNA replication to a specific location may also prevent the activation of certain host defense functions.","Laliberté, Jean-François; Sanfaçon, Hélène",Annual review of phytopathology,143,27

Early studies of Laboulbeniomycetes faced several uncertainties. Were they parasitic worms, red algal relatives, or fungi? If they were fungi, to which group did they belong? What was the nature of their interactions with their arthropod hosts? The historical misperceptions resulted from the extraordinary morphological features of these oddly constructed ectoparasitic fungi. More recently, molecular phylogenetic studies, in combination with a better understanding of life histories, have clearly placed these fungi among filamentous Ascomycota (subphylum Pezizomycotina). Species discovery and research on the classification of the group continue today as arthropods, and especially insects, are routinely collected and examined for the presence of Laboulbeniomycetes. Newly armed with molecular methods, mycologists are poised to use Laboulbeniomycetes-insect associations as models for the study of a variety of basic evolutionary and ecological questions involving host-parasite relationships, modes of nutrient intake, population biology, host specificity, biological control, and invasion biology. Collaboration between mycologists and entomologists is essential to successfully advance knowledge of Laboulbeniomycetes and their intimate association with their hosts.

Binding to a hydrophobic pocket in calmodulin occurs via an anchoring phenylalanine residue of the natively disordered peptide, and is enhanced when a neighbouring hydrophobic residue acts as a co-anchor. The shorter sequence possesses better binding to calmodulin, which is encouraging in terms of the development of non-peptide analogues as therapeutic agents.","Almudallal, Ahmad M; Saika-Voivod, Ivan; Stewart, John M",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,143,31

Methods In this retrospective, single-center, study, we enrolled 16 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University between February 24 and January 25, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological feature, and treatment data were all collected. Outcomes were followed up until March 16, 2020. Results Among the 16 patients with COVID-19 infection, 11 patients (68.8%) had traveled or lived in Wuhan or surrounding areas, and 2 (12.5%) patients had exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The average age of the patients was 44.1 (16.5) years, and there were 10 women (62.5%) and 6 men (37.5%). More than half had chronic diseases [9 (56.3%)]. The most common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 infection were fever [12 (75%)] and cough [8 (50%)]; 11 (68.8%) patients had lymphopenia, and 12 (75%) had elevated C-reactive protein. On admission, abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) or chest X-ray images were revealed among all patients, and 11 (68.8%) of 16 patients had bilateral involvement. All patients were given psychological counseling, 15 (93.8%) patients were administered with antiviral therapy, 8 (50%) received empirical antibiotic treatment, and 5 (31.3%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation [1 (6.3%)], acute respiratory injury [4 (25%)], acute renal injury [1 (6.3%)], septic shock [1 (6.3%)], liver dysfunction [5 (31.3%)], electrolyte disturbance [8 (50.0%)], and hospital-acquired pneumonia [3 (18.8%)]. None of the 16 patients died of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions Compared with the symptoms of the initial patients with COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, the symptoms of the patients from Shaoxing city were relatively mild. Currently, there is no effective drug treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, and psychological counseling cannot be ignored.

METHODS Thirty-five anesthesia nurses without previous intubation experience were recruited. Participants performed endotracheal intubation in a manikin model at two simulated neck positions (normal and fixed neck via cervical immobilization), using three different devices three times each. Performance parameters included intubation time, success rate of intubation, Cormack Lehane laryngoscope grading, dental click, and subjective difficulty score. RESULTS Intubation time and success rate during first attempt were not significantly different between the 3 groups in normal airway manikin. In the cervical immobilized manikin, the intubation time was shorter (p = 0.012), and the success rate with the first attempt was significantly higher (p < 0.001) when using McGrath VL and Pentax AWS compared with Macintosh laryngoscope. Both VLs showed less difficulty score (p < 0.001) and more Cormack Lehane grade I (p < 0.001) in both scenarios. The incidence of dental clicks was higher with Macintosh laryngoscope compared with McGrath VL in cervical immobilized airway (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS McGrath VL and Pentax AWS did not show clinically significant decrease in intubation time, however, they achieved higher first attempt success rate, easier intubation and better glottis view compared with Macintosh laryngoscope by novices in a cervical immobilized manikin model. McGrath VL may reduce the risk of dental injury compared with Macintosh laryngoscope in cervical immobilized scenario.

There was no difference in day 5 eGFR, rate of DGF/SGF, or urine NGAL/Creatinine level between aminophylline vs. placebo arm (eGFR 67.39 ± 38.9 ml/min/1.73m2 vs. 80.48 ± 52.1 ml/min/1.73m2p = 0.32; DGF/SGF 5/23 (21.7%) vs. 3/27 (11.1%) p = 0.31; urine NGAL/creatinine 300.5 ng/mg IQR 105.5-1464.5 ng/mg vs. 425.4 ng/mg IQR 140.3-1126.2 ng/mg, p = 0.95; respectively). At 12 months, there was 100% patient survival and 98% graft survival. eGFR at 12 months was similar between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS There was no benefit in peri-transplant aminophylline administration. Our results are limited by small sample size, since sample calculations were based on primary outcome of day 5 eGFR and low rate of DGF/SGF, which may have precluded us from demonstrating efficacy. Further clinical studies are necessary to determine any benefit of aminophylline in kidney transplant recipients, particularly from high-risk donors.","Haskin, Orly; Shih, Weiwen; Wong, Cynthia J; Axelrod, David M; Grimm, Paul C",Pediatric nephrology,143,1

While COVID-19 has sparked a surge and expansion of new digital business models in different industries, healthcare has been slower to adapt to digital solutions. The majority of ophthalmology clinical practices are still operating through a traditional model of 'brick-and-mortar' facilities and 'face-to-face' patient-physician interaction. In the current climate of COVID-19, there is a need to fuel implementation of digital health models for ophthalmology. In this article, we highlight the current limitations in traditional clinical models as we confront COVID-19, review the current lack of digital initiatives in ophthalmology sphere despite the presence of COVID-19, propose new digital models of care for ophthalmology and discuss potential barriers that need to be considered for sustainable transformation to take place.","Tham, Yih-Chung; Husain, Rahat; Teo, Kelvin Yi Chong; Tan, Anna Cheng Sim; Chew, Annabel Chee Yen; Ting, Daniel S; Cheng, Ching-Yu; Tan, Gavin Siew Wei; Wong, Tien Yin",The British journal of ophthalmology,143,5

This led to the identification and characterization of tautomeric equilibria. Structural elucidation was required to understand the potential impurity profile, thus impacting method development for quality control. In this work, characterization of the chemical structures, AZ13581258 and AZD5718, and equilibria of the tautomeric forms was performed using a range of advanced analytical techniques such as preparative chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), chromatographic detection by mass spectrometry (MS), MSMS, and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). Predictions using density functional theory (DFT) further explains and confirms the tautomer equilibria through predictions of reaction barrier energies, UV-spectra and NMR data. These investigations led to fully understand the impurity profile and to the development of a quality control method for AZD5718 drug substance and drug product. In conclusion, ring-chain tautomeric structures are predominately formed under acidic conditions, and the additional peaks observed in LC during organic impurity determination were found to originate from ring-chain closed tautomers in equilibria with the parent open form compound. Hence, the closed and open tautomer forms should all be considered as the same compound.","Ottosson, Jenny E; Gränfors, Malin; van Pelt, Sally; Langborg Weinmann, Annika; Nilsson Lill, Sten O; Hulthe, Gustaf; Grönberg, Gunnar",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,143,1

The question of whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the kidney is relevant to the understanding of pathogenesis of acute kidney injury and collapsing glomerulopathy in COVID-19. Methodologies to document SARS-CoV-2 infection that have been used include immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in situ hybridization and electron microscopy. In our review of studies to date we found that SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney of patients with COVID-19 was detected in 18 of 94 (19%) by immuno-histochemistry, 71 of 144 (49%) by RT-PCR and 11 of 84 (13%) by in situ hybridization. In a smaller number of patients with COVID-19 examined by immunofluorescence, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10 of 13 (77%). In total, in kidneys from 102 of 235 patients (43.4%), the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was suggested by at least one of the methods used. Despite these positive findings, caution is needed as many other studies have been negative for SARS-CoV-2 presence and it should be noted that when detected it was only in kidneys obtained at autopsy. There is a clear need for studies from kidney biopsies, including those performed at early stages of the COVID-19 associated kidney disease. Development of tests to detect kidney viral infection in urine samples would be more practical as a non-invasive way to evaluate SARS CoV-2 infection during the evolution of COVID-19-associated kidney disease.","Hassler, Luise; Reyes, Fabiola; Sparks, Matthew; Welling, Paul; Batlle, Daniel",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,143,24

OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of different imaging strategies (in particular, pre-specified interval or surveillance imaging, and symptomatic or triggered imaging) on health and economic outcomes for adults with glioma (grades 2 to 4) in the brain. SEARCH METHODS The Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers (CGNOC) Group Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase up to 18 June 2019 and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to December 2014 (database closure). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, and controlled before-after studies with concurrent comparison groups comparing the effect of different imaging strategies on survival and other health outcomes in adults with cerebral glioma; and full economic evaluations (cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses and cost-benefit analyses) conducted alongside any study design, and any model-based economic evaluations on pre- and post-treatment imaging in adults with cerebral glioma. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane review methodology with two authors independently performing study selection and data collection, and resolving disagreements through discussion. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included one retrospective, single-institution study that compared post-operative imaging within 48 hours (early post-operative imaging) with no early post-operative imaging among 125 people who had surgery for glioblastoma (GBM: World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 glioma). Most patients in the study underwent maximal surgical resection followed by combined radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment. Although patient characteristics in the study arms were comparable, the study was at high risk of bias overall. Evidence from this study suggested little or no difference between early and no early post-operative imaging with respect to overall survival (deaths) at one year after diagnosis of GBM (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.21; 48% vs 55% died, respectively; very low certainty evidence) and little or no difference in overall survival (deaths) at two years after diagnosis of GBM (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; 86% vs 81% died, respectively; very low certainty evidence). No other review outcomes were reported. We found no evidence on the effectiveness of other imaging schedules. In addition, we identified no relevant economic evaluations assessing the efficiency of the different imaging strategies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The effect of different imaging strategies on survival and other health outcomes remains largely unknown. Existing imaging schedules in glioma seem to be pragmatic rather than evidence-based. The limited evidence suggesting that early post-operative brain imaging among GBM patients who will receive combined chemoradiation treatment may make little or no difference to survival needs to be further researched, particularly as early post-operative imaging also serves as a quality control measure that may lead to early re-operation if residual tumour is identified. Mathematical modelling of a large glioma patient database could help to distinguish the optimal timing of surveillance imaging for different types of glioma, with stratification of patients facilitated by assessment of individual tumour growth rates, molecular biomarkers and other prognostic factors. In addition, paediatric glioma study designs could be used to inform future research of imaging strategies among adults with glioma.","Thompson, Gerard; Lawrie, Theresa A; Kernohan, Ashleigh; Jenkinson, Michael D",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,143,1

RESULTS The corneal thickness was significantly reduced in the COPD group compared to the control group (p = 0.021). Moreover, a significant difference was found between the COPD group and the control group in terms of corneal endothelial cell density (p = 0.011), hexagonal cell ratio (p = 0.008), and coefficient of variation (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION The corneal endothelial structure was significantly deteriorated in patients with COPD compared to the control group.

The patient was hospitalized for re-haemorrhage six years later. A micro AVM with two diffused niduses was detected and embolised three months after his re-haemorrhage. The patient recovered without any neurological deficit. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION Compressive effects of haematoma and spontaneous obliteration of AVMs might play pivotal roles in negative DSA results.

We find that the sarbecoviruses-the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-undergo frequent recombination and exhibit spatially structured genetic diversity on a regional scale in China. SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor-binding motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses and not one acquired recently via recombination. To employ phylogenetic dating methods, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were shown to be consistent for these three approaches and for two different prior specifications of evolutionary rates based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000) and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009), indicating that the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed in bats for decades.","Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Jiang, Xiaowei; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Perry, Blair W; Castoe, Todd A; Rambaut, Andrew; Robertson, David L",Nature microbiology,143,30

Then, we show the involvement of choice-supportive bias in scientific inquiry as one of the potential cognitive limitations of science. Finally, three ways are discussed to mitigate the effects of this bias in science: more scores to self-criticism publications, recording of the shortcomings of the research by the researcher before publishing, and emphasizing control processes before researcher choices in scientific inquiry.","Kafaee, Mahdi; Marhamati, Hanie; Gharibzadeh, Shahriar",Accountability in research,143,24

Although radiographic examination is accepted as the gold standard for confirming the position of patients' enteral tubes, it is costly, involves risks of radiation, and is not failsafe. Studies using carbon dioxide sensors to detect inadvertent nasogastric tube placements have been conducted in intensive care settings. However, none involved patients in general wards. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to ascertain the diagnostic measure of colorimeter, with radiographic examination as the reference standard, to confirm the location of nasogastric tubes in patients. DESIGN A prospective observational study of a diagnostic test. SETTING This study was conducted in the general wards of an approximately 1100-bed acute care tertiary hospital of an Academic Medical Center in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients with nasogastric tubes admitted to the general wards were recruited into the study. METHODS The colorimeter was attached to the nasogastric tube to detect for the presence of carbon dioxide, suggestive of a tracheobronchial placement. The exact location of the nasogastric tube was subsequently confirmed by a radiographic examination. RESULTS A total of 192 tests were undertaken. The colorimeter detected carbon dioxide in 29 tested nasogastric tubes, of which radiographic examination confirmed that four tubes were located in the tracheobronchial tract. The colorimeter failed to detect carbon dioxide in one nasogastric tube that was located in the tracheobronchial tract, thus, demonstrating a sensitivity of 0.80 [95% CI (0.376, 0.964)]. The colorimeter detected absence of carbon dioxide in 163 tested nasogastric tubes in which radiographic examination confirmed 160 gastrointestinal and one tracheobronchial placements, demonstrating a specificity of 0.865 [95% CI (0.808, 0.907)]. The colorimeter detected one tracheobronchial nasogastric tube placement that the radiographic examination was misinterpreted. CONCLUSION The study found that the use of the colorimeter in the general ward setting was not 100% sensitive or specific in ascertaining the location of a nasogastric tube as previously reported by many studies undertaken in intensive care settings. This is the first study on the use of a colorimeter to confirm the placement of a nasogastric tube in adult patients in the general ward setting. More research on the use of a colorimeter in the general ward setting and its potential use in certain processes for confirming the placement of a nasogastric tube is warranted.","Mordiffi, Siti Zubaidah; Goh, Mien Li; Phua, Jason; Chan, Yiong-Huak",International journal of nursing studies,143,4

Total pericardiectomy is the most effective treatment and is traditionally performed via median sternotomy. With the increasing use of minimally invasive techniques, there have been reports of partial pericardiectomy via thoracoscopy but with suboptimal exposure and difficulty identifying both phrenic nerves. Robotic surgery offers both small incisions and enhanced visualization. We present four cases of robotic endoscopic off-pump total pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis. METHODS Four patients underwent off-pump total pericardiectomy with robotic assistance for constrictive pericarditis. All had constrictive physiology demonstrated by right heart catheterization and/or echocardiogram. One was also found to have coronary artery disease and underwent concurrent totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery. Ports were placed in the left second, fourth, and sixth intercostal spaces. The left lung was isolated and deflated with CO2 insufflation, aiding in exposure. With the use of electrocautery, the pericardium was removed first posterior to the left phrenic nerve, then anteriorly all the way to the right phrenic nerve, and caudally from the diaphragmatic reflection to the great vessel cephalad. A stabilizer in the subcostal fourth robotic arm was used to assist in the dissection. RESULTS Two of four patients were extubated within 6 hours after surgery and transferred to the floor on postoperative day 1. Both were discharged home by postoperative day 5. Two of four patients had preoperative sequelae from chronic constriction and necessitated longer hospital and intensive care unit stays but had improvement in symptoms and were discharged home within 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Total pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis can be performed using a robotic approach. In contrast to thoracoscopy, it offers better visualization of both phrenic nerves, avoids injury, and allows a thorough pericardial dissection. In our experience, the robotic left chest approach has proven more efficacious in removing the posterior pericardium than is allowed with median sternotomy.","Maciolek, Kimberly; Asfaw, Zewditu E; Krienbring, Dorothy J; Arnsdorf, Susan E; Balkhy, Husam H",Innovations,143,9

METHODS Four databases were searched to identify articles measuring patient empowerment in persons with chronic conditions, used a quantitative design and provided evidence on correlates of patient empowerment. Seventy-six articles were included and analyzed by descriptive statistics and summative content analysis. RESULTS The articles used a range of definitions (n = 35) and instruments (n = 38), evaluating a range of correlates in four categories: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported experiences. The most frequent associations were between patient empowerment and age (n = 21), sex (n = 15), educational level (n = 15) and quality of life (n = 18). However, they were not always significant.

We report our experience of treating pituitary apoplexy using an EEA approach. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review on all the patients who underwent EEA skull base and pituitary surgery between December 2003 and March 2012 performed by the senior authors (THS and VKA) and identified patients with pituitary apoplexy. The extent of resection was determined volumetrically and the visual and endocrine outcome was evaluated. RESULTS From a total of 488 skull base surgeries, there were 241 pituitary cases, of which 20 had apoplexy. The most common presenting symptoms included headaches (80%), endocrinopathy (95%), and visual symptoms (60%). Surgery was performed within 24 hours in 15% of patients, and > one month after ictus in 40% due to late referral. Gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 18 (90%) patients. There was one (5%) postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak treated with lumbar drainage. Of 12 patients with preoperative visual disturbances, seven had improvements. For those patients with visual field cuts, only 33.3% showed improvement. There was no postoperative visual deterioration. Two patients developed new transient postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI) but there was no new permanent DI. The mean duration of follow-up was 22 months (range: 6 days - 72 months).

PATIENTS AND METHODS This international, multicenter cohort study included patients who underwent elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until April 19, 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19-free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theater, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with patients with COVID-19). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected ventilation). RESULTS Of 9,171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2,481 were operated on in COVID-19-free surgical pathways. Patients who underwent surgery within COVID-19-free surgical pathways were younger with fewer comorbidities than those in hospitals with no defined pathway but with similar proportions of major surgery. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.2% v 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses for low-risk patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1/2), propensity score-matched models, and patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 preoperative tests. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.1% v 3.6%; aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.76). CONCLUSION Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19-free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Glasbey, James C; Bhangu, Aneel",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,143,28

This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety. RESULTS A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Female patients were associated with higher risk of depression. Patients with family members diagnosed as COVID-19 or died from this disease were associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.","Nie, Xue-Dan; Wang, Qin; Wang, Min-Nan; Zhao, Shuai; Liu, Lei; Zhu, Yu-Lan; Chen, Hong",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,143,1

We investigated the proportion, characteristics, and factors that predict interval CRCs that develop within 6-60 months of colonoscopy. METHODS We performed a population-based cohort study of Utah residents who underwent colonoscopy examinations from 1995 through 2009 at Intermountain Healthcare or the University of Utah Health System, which provide care to more than 85% of state residents. Colonoscopy results were linked with cancer histories from the Utah Population Database to identify patients who underwent colonoscopy 6-60 months before a diagnosis of CRC (interval cancer). Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with interval cancers. RESULTS Of 126,851 patients who underwent colonoscopies, 2659 were diagnosed with CRC; 6% of these CRCs (159 of 2659) developed within 6 to 60 months of a colonoscopy. Sex and age were not associated with interval CRCs. A higher percentage of patients with interval CRC were found to have adenomas at their index colonoscopy (57.2%), compared with patients found to have CRC detected at colonoscopy (36%) or patients who did not develop cancer (26%) (P < .001). Interval CRCs tended to be earlier-stage tumors than those detected at index colonoscopy, and to be proximally located (odds ratio, 2.24; P < .001). Patients with interval CRC were more likely to have a family history of CRC (odds ratio, 2.27; P = .008) and had a lower risk of death than patients found to have CRC at their index colonoscopy (hazard ratio, 0.63; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS In a population-based study in Utah, 6% of all patients with CRC had interval cancers (cancer that developed within 6 to 60 months of a colonoscopy). Interval CRCs were associated with the proximal colon, earlier-stage cancer, lower risk of death, higher rate of adenoma, and family history of CRC. These findings indicate that interval colorectal tumors may arise as the result of distinct biologic features and/or suboptimal management of polyps at colonoscopy.","Samadder, N Jewel; Curtin, Karen; Tuohy, Thérèse M F; Pappas, Lisa; Boucher, Ken; Provenzale, Dawn; Rowe, Kerry G; Mineau, Geraldine P; Smith, Ken; Pimentel, Richard; Kirchhoff, Anne C; Burt, Randall W",Gastroenterology,143,16

This is critical for accurate diagnosis, monitoring and evaluating treatment effects in both clinical practice and trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS We applied Generalisability Theory, a robust novel method to distinguish between dynamic and stable aspects of schizophrenia symptoms in the widely used Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) using a longitudinal measurement design. The sample included 107 patients with chronic schizophrenia assessed using the PANSS at five time points over a 24-week period during a multi-site clinical trial of N-Acetylcysteine as an add-on to maintenance medication for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. RESULTS The original PANSS and its three subscales demonstrated good reliability and generalisability of scores (G=0.77-0.93) across sample population and occasions making them suitable for assessment of psychosis risks and long-lasting change following a treatment, while subscales of the five factor models appeared less reliable. The most enduring symptoms represented by the PANSS were poor attention, delusions, blunted affect, and poor rapport. More dynamic symptoms with 40-50% of variance explained by patient transient state including grandiosity, preoccupation, somatic concerns, guilt feeling and hallucinatory behaviour. CONCLUSIONS Identified dynamic symptoms are more amendable to change and should be the primary target of interventions aiming at effectively treating schizophrenia. Separating out the dynamic symptoms would increase assay sensitivity in trials, reduce the signal to noise ratio and increase the potential to detect the effects of novel therapies in clinical trials.","Medvedev, Oleg N; Berk, Michael; Dean, Olivia M; Brown, Ellie; Sandham, Margaret H; Dipnall, Joanna F; McNamara, Robert K; Sumich, Alexander; Krägeloh, Christian U; Narayanan, Ajit; Siegert, Richard J",European journal of clinical investigation,143,20

We recruited 4 OSA patients who had general anaesthesia for orthopaedic and septoplasty surgery. They required Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) or oral opioids in the post-operative period, hence continuous Saturation of Oxygen (Spo2), End Tidal Carbon dioxide (EtCo2) monitoring on Capnostream monitor with Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI) was organized in high dependency unit. Overnight data was collected every 30 s which included pulse rate, respiratory rate, EtCo2, Spo2, and IPI. The nursing staff was also asked to document if any intervention was carried out due to altered IPI. For first two patient events occurred during various hours but there were no significant events in early night even though increased opioid use at that time. During the period of desaturation nurse intervention required to increase the O2 flow in the first patient but corrected spontaneously in the second patient. IPI index improved over a period of 2 min in most of the events. The duration of desaturation did not correspond with the IPI in only once, remaining period the clinical symptoms were consistent with fall in O2 saturation. The microstream capnography with IPI may provide complete respiratory status of the patient because of its comprehensive parameters on one screen. Main limitation was duration of monitoring was limited to overnight. Capnostream monitoring with IPI may have a role in patients monitoring with OSA on PCA in the postoperative ward but more trials are necessary.","Rao Kadam, Vasanth; Danesh, Mazyar",Sleep science,143,27

The diagnosis of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is a source of significant stress to the patient because of the concerns for aneurysmal rupture, which is associated with substantial rates of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important that decisions regarding optimum management are made based on the comparison of the risk of aneurysmal rupture with the risk associated with intervention. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management options for unruptured intracranial aneurysms based on the current evidence in the literature. Furthermore, the authors discuss the genetic abnormalities associated with intracranial aneurysm and current guidelines for screening in patients with a family history of intracranial aneurysms. Since there is significant controversy in the optimum management of small unruptured intracranial aneurysms, we provided a systematic approach to their management based on patient and aneurysm characteristics as well as the risks and benefits of intervention.","Ajiboye, Norman; Chalouhi, Nohra; Starke, Robert M; Zanaty, Mario; Bell, Rodney",TheScientificWorldJournal,143,33

While remarkable progress has been achieved with various surface passivating agents, long-term stability of PSCs has not been fully addressed. Here, we report a new strategy for surface passivation of PSCs using a low cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA). The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N-bis(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-quinacridone (TBOC-QA), followed by facile thermal annealing to convert TBOC-QA to insoluble QA. With the halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead Iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9% recorded for the unmodified devices. Density functional theory calculations revealed strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, which effectively reduced the surface defects of halide perovskite thin films and suppressed the nonradiative recombination. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to remarkably enhanced contact angle from 35.6⁰ for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2⁰ for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. As a result, the stabilities of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were greatly enhanced, retaining about 90 % of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000 hours storage under ambient conditions. The universality of this passivation strategy was evaluated by extending MAPbI3 systems to triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite systems, which further confirm the effectiveness of industrial pigment passivation of PSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability.","He, Qingquan; Worku, Michael; Liu, He; Lochner, Eric; Robb, Alex J; Lteif, Sandrine; Winfred, J S Raaj Vellore; Hanson, Kenneth; Schlenoff, Joseph B; Kim, Bumjoon J; Ma, Biwu",Angewandte Chemie,143,1

Molecular detection techniques have the potential to address limitations of other methods for detecting infection with Brucella in these species. Presented herein is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method targeting the Brucella genus-specific bcsp31 gene. The method also includes a target to a conserved region of the eukaryotic mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to assess suitability of extracted DNA and a plasmid-based internal control to detect failure of PCR due to inhibition. This method was optimized and validated to detect Brucella spp. in multiple sample matrices, including fresh or frozen tissue, blood, and feces. The analytical limit of detection was low, with 95% amplification at 24 fg, or an estimated 7 bacterial genomic copies. When Brucella spp. were experimentally added to tissue or fecal homogenates, the assay detected an estimated 1-5 bacteria/µl. An experiment simulating tissue autolysis showed relative persistence of bacterial DNA compared to host mitochondrial DNA. When used to screen 1,658 field-collected marine mammal tissues in comparison to microbial culture, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 70.4% and 98.3%, respectively. In addition to amplification in fresh and frozen tissues, Brucella spp. were detected in feces and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from culture-positive animals. Results indicate the utility of this real-time PCR for the detection of Brucella spp. in marine species, which may have applications in surveillance or epidemiologic investigations.","Sidor, Inga F; Dunn, J Lawrence; Tsongalis, Gregory J; Carlson, Jolene; Frasca, Salvatore","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",143,1

However, a definition in the literature of ""recurrence"" is lacking. This study reviews the phenomenon of pseudo-recurrence in patients who describe recurrent symptoms despite an apparently successful laparoscopic ventral or incisional hernia repair (LVIHR). METHODS Cases of LVIHR from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2007 were identified from the Lothian Surgical Audit database. Patients were contacted by telephone after a minimum of 11 months following operation. Pseudo-recurrences were identified by history and clinical examination, together with radiological investigation if the diagnosis remained in doubt. RESULTS One hundred and forty-three repairs were performed in the study period. One hundred and twenty-one patients were contacted (63 incisional and 58 other ventral herniae). Twenty possible recurrences were reported (16.5%). Four were true recurrences and two more were new incisional herniae. There were 14 pseudo-recurrences, arising after 12 incisional and two other ventral hernia repairs. These were due to mesh bulge (10), seroma (3) and retained hernia contents (1). CONCLUSION True recurrences after LVIHR do occur but should be preventable with good surgical technique. Pseudo-recurrences are more common and may mimic true recurrence. We recommend computed tomography (CT) to clarify the diagnosis and determine the indication for revisional surgery.","Tse, G H; Stutchfield, B M; Duckworth, A D; de Beaux, A C; Tulloh, B",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,143,0

However, mechanistic proof that reducing pollution may be beneficial to prevent atherothrombotic events is limited. We aimed at appraising the impact of temporary traffic bans in a large metropolitan area on the risk of acute coronary syndromes. METHODS Aggregate and anonymized data from 15 tertiary cardiac care centers were obtained detailing pre-coronarivus disease 2019 (COVID-19) daily cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), including those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Data on pollutants and climate were sought for the same days. Mixed level regression was used to compare the week before vs after the traffic ban (Fortnight analysis), the 3 days before vs after (Weekly analysis) and the Sunday before vs after (Sunday analysis). RESULTS A total of 8 days of temporary traffic bans were included, occurring between 2017 and 2020, totaling 802 STEMI and 1196 NSTEMI in the Fortnight analysis, 382 STEMI and 585 in the Weekly analysis, and 148 STEMI and 210 NSTEMI in the Sunday analysis. Fortnight and Sunday analysis did not disclose a significant impact of traffic ban on STEMI or NSTEMI (all p>0.05). Conversely, Weekly analysis showed non-significant changes for STEMI but a significant decrease in daily NSTEMI when comparing the 3 days before the traffic ban with the ban day (p=0.043), as well as the 3 days before vs the 3 days after the ban (p=0.025). No statistically significant effect of traffic ban was found at Fortnight, Weekly or Sunday analyses for daily mean concentrations of benzene, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM) <2.5 μm or PM <10 μm (all p>0.05). However, minimum daily concentrations showed a significant reduction of ozone during the ban in comparison to the week preceding it (p=0.034), nitric oxide during the ban in comparison to the 3 days preceding it (p=0.046), and an increase in benzene during the ban in comparison to the Sunday before (p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS Temporary traffic ban may favorably reduce coronary atherothrombotic events, and in particular NSTEMI, even if not globally and immediately impacting on environmental pollution.

Microsurgical detethering is the only treatment for symptomatic patients, but retethering occurs commonly and no treatment is widely available to prevent this complication. OBJECTIVE To apply human amniotic membrane (HAM) grafts, which are immune-privileged and known to possess antifibrogenic properties, in patients requiring microsurgical detethering. For this first-in-human use, we evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of these grafts for preventing retethering. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who required detethering surgery and received an HAM graft between 2013 and 2016 at our institution after various previous intradural spinal surgeries. In all 14 cases, intradural lysis of adhesions was achieved, an HAM graft was sewn in place intradurally, and a dural patch was closed in a watertight fashion over the graft. RESULTS Fourteen patients had received HAM grafts to prevent retethering. All patients had at least 6 mo of follow-up (mean follow-up, 14 mo). Retethering was noted in only 1 patient. Surgical re-exploration showed that the retethering occurred caudal to the edge of the HAM graft, with no tethering underneath the original graft. No complications were attributed specifically to the HAM graft placement. CONCLUSION This first-in-human series provides evidence that HAM grafts are a safe and potentially efficacious method for preventing retethering after microsurgical intradural lysis of adhesions. These results lay the groundwork for further prospective controlled trials in patients with this difficult-to-treat pathology.","Walker, Corey T; Godzik, Jakub; Kakarla, U Kumar; Turner, Jay D; Whiting, Alexander C; Nakaji, Peter",Neurosurgery,143,20

In our laryngology clinics we have noted an increase in cases of ""idiopathic"" vocal fold paralysis and paresis in patients with no history of intubation who are recovering from the novel SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). This finding is concerning for a post-viral vagal neuropathy (PVVN) as a result of infection with COVID-19. Our objective is to raise the possibility that vocal fold paresis may be an additional neuropathic sequela of infection with COVID-19. METHODS Retrospective review of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, had no history of intubation as a result of their infection, and subsequently presented with vocal fold paresis between May 2020 and January 2021. Charts were reviewed for demographic information, confirmation of COVID-19 infection, presenting symptoms, laryngoscopy and stroboscopy exam findings, and laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) results.

This study assesses its efficacy in patients admitted to critical care following cardiovascular surgery and the influence of standard antithrombotic agents routinely used in this specific group. METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p < 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p < 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis.

Patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation had a significantly longer filter life span than those who were on prophylactic doses or ASA alone.","Kośka, Agnieszka; Kirwan, Christopher J; Kowalik, Maciej M; Lango-Maziarz, Anna; Szymanowicz, Wiktor; Jagielak, Dariusz; Lango, Romuald",Cardiology journal,143,1

An Australian/New Zealand organisational position statement released in March 2018 recommended avoiding extended-release opioid prescribing for acute pain. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this organisational position statement on extended-release opioid prescribing among surgical inpatients. Secondary objectives included predictors and clinical outcomes of prescribing extended-release opioids among surgical inpatients. We conducted a retrospective, dual centre, 11-month before-and-after study and time-series analysis by utilising electronic medical records from two teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients prescribed an extended-release opioid. For surgical patients prescribed any opioid (n = 16,284), extended-release opioid prescribing decreased after the release of the position statement (38.4% before vs. 26.6% after, p < 0.001), primarily driven by a reduction in extended-release oxycodone (31.1% before vs. 14.1% after, p < 0.001). There was a 23% immediate decline in extended-release opioid prescribing after the position statement release (p < 0.001), followed by an additional 0.2% decline per month in the following months. Multivariable regression showed that the release of the position statement was associated with a decrease in extended-release opioid prescribing (OR 0.54, 95%CI 0.50-0.58). Extended-release opioid prescribing was also associated with increased incidence of opioid-related adverse events (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.35-1.71); length of stay (RR 1.44, 95%CI 1.39-1.51); and 28-day re-admission (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.12-1.41). Overall, a reduction in extended-release opioid prescribing was observed in surgical inpatients following position statement release.","Awadalla, R; Liu, S; Kemp-Casey, A; Gnjidic, D; Patanwala, A; Stevens, J; Begley, D; Bugeja, B; Penm, J",Anaesthesia,143,1

The aim of this study is to explore how older people in rural Nigeria may be digitally excluded and its impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative data was obtained from 11 older people using interviews. The collected data was then transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings show that older people in rural Nigeria were digitally excluded. However, the older people argued that the digital exclusion is not the reason for their social isolation and loneliness. The study concluded by suggesting how caregivers and social workers can assist rural older people through activity schedule and radio programs designed for older people.","Ekoh, Prince Chiagozie; George, Elizabeth Onyedikachi; Ezulike, Chigozie Donatus",Journal of gerontological social work,143,17

There is an established association between race and severe COVID-19 outcomes in adults in England; however, whether a similar association exists in children is unclear. Objective To investigate the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes. Design, Setting, Participants In this cohort study, children (0-18 years of age) from participating family practices in England were identified in the QResearch database between January 24 and November 30, 2020. The QResearch database has individually linked patients with national SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital admission, and mortality data. Exposures The main characteristic of interest is self-reported race. Other exposures were age, sex, deprivation level, geographic region, household size, and comorbidities (asthma; diabetes; and cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic conditions). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was hospital admission with confirmed COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2-positive test result and any hospital attendance with confirmed COVID-19 and intensive care admission. Results Of 2 576 353 children (mean [SD] age, 9.23 [5.24] years; 48.8% female), 410 726 (15.9%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 26 322 (6.4%) tested positive. A total of 1853 children (0.07%) with confirmed COVID-19 attended hospital, 343 (0.01%) were admitted to the hospital, and 73 (0.002%) required intensive care. Testing varied across race. White children had the highest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 tests (223 701/1 311 041 [17.1%]), whereas Asian children (33 213/243 545 [13.6%]), Black children (7727/93 620 [8.3%]), and children of mixed or other races (18 971/147 529 [12.9%]) had lower proportions. Compared with White children, Asian children were more likely to have COVID-19 hospital admissions (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12-2.36), whereas Black children (adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.90-2.31) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93-2.10) had comparable hospital admissions. Asian children were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (adjusted OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14), and Black children (adjusted OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.08-4.94) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.25-3.65) had longer hospital admissions (≥36 hours). Conclusions and Relevance In this large population-based study exploring the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes, several race-specific disparities were observed in severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, ascertainment bias and residual confounding in this cohort study should be considered before drawing any further conclusions. Overall, findings of this study have important public health implications internationally.","Saatci, Defne; Ranger, Tom A; Garriga, Cesar; Clift, Ash Kieran; Zaccardi, Francesco; Tan, Pui San; Patone, Martina; Coupland, Carol; Harnden, Anthony; Griffin, Simon J; Khunti, Kamlesh; Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Hippisley-Cox, Julia",JAMA pediatrics,143,9

We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups. Future studies will have to address if this stereotyped B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 emerging from unmutated antibody rearrangements will create long-lived memory.","Paschold, Lisa; Simnica, Donjete; Willscher, Edith; Vehreschild, Maria Jgt; Dutzmann, Jochen; Sedding, Daniel G; Schultheiß, Christoph; Binder, Mascha",The Journal of clinical investigation,143,1

New challenges have been identified in order to maintain the safety of this procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A novel approach, using a modified demistifier canopy, was developed during the first wave of the pandemic and implemented for 17 consecutive percutaneous tracheostomies in order to enhance procedural safety. METHODS A protocol was developed after performing a literature review of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary tracheostomy team was established, including the departments of otolaryngology, critical care, and respiratory therapy. Simulation was performed prior to each PT, and postoperative debriefings were done. RESULTS A protocol and technical description of PT using a modified demistifier canopy covering was written and video documented. Data were collected on 17 patients who underwent this procedure safely in our tertiary care hospital. There were no procedure-related complications, and no evidence of COVID-19 transmission to any member of the health care team during the study period. CONCLUSION As patients continue to recover from COVID-19, their need for tracheostomy will increase. The technique described provides a safe, multidisciplinary method of performing PT in COVID-19 patients.","Turkdogan, Sena; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Giroux, Melanie; Piché, Chantal; Khwaja, Kosar; Mascarella, Marco; Khalife, Sarah; Alohali, Sama; Kost, Karen","Ear, nose, & throat journal",143,28

Their dysfunctions result in different diseases like cancer making them an important drug target in oncology and beyond. The present study aims at identifying the selective inhibitors for ATP binding site in CDK proteins (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK5) following a multi-target drug designing approach. Significant challenges lie in identifying the selective inhibitor for the ATP binding site as this region is highly conserved in all protein kinases. Molecular docking coupled with molecular dynamics simulation and free energy of binding calculations (MMPBSA/MMGBSA) were used to identify the potent competitive ATP binding site inhibitors. All the four proteins were docked against the library of drug-like compounds and the outcomes of the docking study were further analyzed by Molecular dynamics (total of 6μs) and MMPB/GBSA techniques. Five different inhibitors for structurally distant protein kinases, i.e. CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK5 are identified with the binding energy (ΔGbind-PB) in the range -18.24 to -28.43Kcal/mol. Mechanistic complexities associated with the binding of the inhibitor are unraveled by carefully analyzing the MD trajectories. It is observed that certain residues (Lys33, Asp127, Asp145, Tyr15, Gly16, Asn144) and regions are critical for the retention of inhibitors in active pocket, and significant conformational changes take place in the active site region as well as its neighbor following the entry of the ligand inside active pocket as inferred by RMSD and RMSF. It is observed that LIG3 and LIG4 are the best possible inhibitors as reflected from their high binding energy, interaction pattern, and their retention inside the active pocket. This study will facilitate the process of multi-target drug designing against CDK proteins and can be used in the development of potential therapeutics against different diseases.","Ahmed, Basharat; Khan, Sara; Nouroz, Faisal; Farooq, Umar; Khalid, Saba",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,143,15

Methods: The Operetta CLS high-content analysis system was used to observe the time-dependent apoptosis process of BMMSCs. Besides, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), dynamic light scattering technology and streaming potential method were used to measure the surface characteristics of BMMSCs derived ApoEVs. The Operetta CLS high-content analysis system was used to observe the process of RAW264.7 phagocyting 5-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (5-TAMRA-SE) labeled ApoEVs. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of arginase-1 (Arg-1). Cell immunofluorescence and Western blotting were used to detect the number of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)(+) macrophages and iNOS protein expression level in each experiment group. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect tumor necrosis factro-α (TNF-α) level in the Pg-LPS induced pro-inflammatory macrophage culture supernatant in each experiment group. Results: After treating with 0.5 μmol/L staurosporine for 12 hours, mouse BMMSCs underwent shrinking with obvious vesicles structure around. The FESEM showed the ApoEVs were in spherical shapes. The size range of ApoEVs was about 100-1 000 nm and the average Zeta potential was -16.6 mV. The Operetta CLS high-content analysis system showed RAW264.7 could phagocytose 5-TAMRA-SE labeled ApoEVs by pseudopodia. The relative mRNA expression of Arg-1 was significantly increased in RAW 264.7 after being treated with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and ApoEVs (261.97±15.91) compared to that with IL-4 alone (115.29±15.42) (P<0.01). Cell immunofluorescence showed that ApoEVs could reduce the number of iNOS(+) macrophages induced by Pg-LPS (39.33±4.70) comparing to those without ApoEVs (95.33±4.70) (P=0.007). In the meanwhile, ApoEVs could also down-regulate the iNOS protein level of macrophages induced by Pg-LPS (5.84±1.05) comparing to those without ApoEVs (14.91±3.87) (P<0.01). Besides, ApoEVs could also reduce the TNF-α secretion in the culture supernatant of pro-inflammatory macrophages induced by Pg-LPS [(21 899.71±409.73) ng/L] comparing to those without ApoEVs [(71 296.50±2 344.22) ng/L] (P=0.003). Conclusions: BMMSCs derived ApoEVs could regulate the polarization of macrophages and could also attenuate the pro-inflammatory condition of macrophages induced by Pg-LPS.","Ye, Q Y; Li, Z H; Wang, Y Z; Liu, S Y; Zhou, J; Liu, S Y; Wang, Q T",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,143,1

Understanding the early innate immune mechanisms that participate in the development of chronic postviral lung disease may reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. The intracellular viral sensor protein melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) sustains the acute immune response to Sendai virus, a mouse pathogen that causes chronic lung inflammation, but its role in the development of postviral chronic lung disease is unknown. OBJECTIVES To establish the role of MDA5 in the development of chronic lung disease. METHODS MDA5-deficient or control mice were infected with Sendai virus. The acute inflammatory response was evaluated by profiling chemokine and cytokine expression and by characterizing the composition of the cellular infiltrate. The impact of MDA5 on chronic lung pathology and function was evaluated through histological studies, degree of oxygen saturation, and responsiveness to carbachol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS MDA5 deficiency resulted in normal virus replication and in a distinct profile of chemokines and cytokines that associated with acute lung neutropenia and enhanced accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages. Diminished expression of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines was also observed in cells infected with influenza virus, suggesting a key role of MDA5 in driving the early accumulation of neutrophils at the infection site. The biased acute inflammatory response of MDA5-deficient mice led to an enhanced chronic lung inflammation, epithelial cell hyperplasia, airway hyperreactivity, and diminished blood oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS MDA5 modulates the development of chronic lung inflammation by regulating the early inflammatory response in the lung.","Kim, Won-Keun; Jain, Deepika; Sánchez, Melissa D; Koziol-White, Cynthia J; Matthews, Krystal; Ge, Moyar Q; Haczku, Angela; Panettieri, Reynold A; Frieman, Matthew B; López, Carolina B",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,143,16

Immune response, including neutralizing antibody titers, T cell activity, and cytokine levels, peaked around days 44-72 after diagnosis. Anti-S trimer antibodies were low at all time points, and T cell response was attenuated by day 119. As immune response waned and viral load increased, increased genetic diversity emerged, suggesting a mechanism for the development of viral variants.","Purpura, Lawrence J; Chang, Michelle; Annavajhala, Medini K; Mohri, Hiroshi; Liu, Lihong; Shah, Jayesh; Cantos, Anyelina; Medrano, Nicola; Laracy, Justin; Scully, Brian; Miko, Benjamin A; Habal, Marlena; Pereira, Marcus R; Tsuji, Moriya; Ho, David D; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Yin, Michael T",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,143,29

We present our experience using SILK flow diverter (SFD) in patients with complex intracranial aneurysms, and a cost analysis. METHODS Between September 2010 and May 2012, 19 consecutive patients with 29 complex intracranial aneurysms were treated with SFD without the adjunctive use of coils. We retrospectively evaluated the technical aspects, thromboembolic events, adjunctive therapies, and short term results in patients with complex intracranial aneurysms treated with SFD. A cost analysis of patients who were treated with SFD was performed and compared with similar sized aneurysms coiled with stent assisted coiling. RESULTS The primary technical success rate was 100%. An adjunctive device was required in two of our patients. The technique related complication rate and the 30 day mortality and morbidity rates were 5% (1/20) and 10% (2/20), respectively. We had a total of 263 patient months of clinical and 166 patient months of imaging follow-up. Follow-up imaging revealed two asymptomatic occlusions of the parent artery. Complete occlusion of the aneurysm with fully patent parent artery was observed in 59% of patients where follow-up images were available. The cost analysis showed that the mean cost of treatment with SFD was significantly cheaper compared with the presumed cost of stent assisted coiling (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The SFD provides a very feasible, efficient, relatively safe, and cost effective method to treat complex intracranial aneurysms without the use of adjunct coiling.","Shankar, Jai Jai Shiva; Vandorpe, Robert; Pickett, Gwynedd; Maloney, William",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,143,11

Furthermore, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a method that gathers medical or dental diagnostic images. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of dental anatomy education through a CBCT technology tool, through teachers' and students' perspectives, adjusted according to the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. A cohort study and longitudinal exploratory analysis were performed. Forty undergraduate first-year dental students, from the University of Coimbra in Portugal, were selected as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two different teaching methods were applied during an identical time-period: face-to face lectures complemented by physical models (T1 cohort) and webinar lectures complemented by CBCT images (T2 cohort). Learning outcomes were then studied according to theoretical and spatial orientation contexts. A self-reported survey that focused on students' satisfaction, stress and support was studied. Both teaching methods were analyzed with paired sample student's t-test and Pearson Correlation Confidence intervals 95% with P < 0.05. Furthermore, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for self-reported satisfaction survey validity and reliability analysis. The learning outcomes between T1 and T2 cohorts were statistically significant, (P < 0.001) corresponding to differences with large effect degree (r > 0.60). Students' satisfaction, as measured on a six-point Likert scale, was positively influenced by the webinar lectures supplemented with CBCT images (T2 cohort) in a learning context (4.95 ± 0.5) and future applications (5.92 ± 0.27). In conclusion, the webinar approach with CBCT images was more effective and better learning method for teaching dental anatomy.","Corte-Real, Ana; Nunes, Tiago; Caetano, Catarina; Almiro, Pedro A",Anatomical sciences education,143,1

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional observation study. METHODS 24 consecutive H1N1 influenza patients with viral pneumonia (13 males, 11 females, mean age: 17.5 years) during their presentation to hospital were retrospectively analysed. Viral load were first measured on average 5.2 days after the onset of symptoms. The initial CT and viral load measurement was carried on the same day in 13 patients. The rest were carried out with a mean interval time of 1.5 days. All patients had viral load follow-up till turned negative. Thirteen patients had radiological follow-up. RESULTS There was no significant correlation between the initial lung lesion severity and viral load (P=0.4). Both viral load and lung lesion severity decreased over time, being highest value at initial presentation. The patients had higher initial viral load or higher initial lung lesion severity tended to be slower in resolving. The lung lesion decreased at a slower rate than viral load.

We also aimed to discover whether age, sex and other comorbidities might affect the association between dementia and mortality. METHODS We carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC and the Cochrane Central Database. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated mortality/death/non-survivor in the studies. The pooled effect estimates were presented as odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS A total of 56 577 patients from 10 studies were included. The prevalence of dementia in this pooled analysis was 10% (7-13%). Dementia was associated with increased mortality in both pooled unadjusted (odds ratio 2.80, 95% CI 1.85-4.24, P < 0.001; I2 = 93.7%) and adjusted effect estimates (adjusted odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.24, P < 0.001; I2 = 72.9%). The association between dementia and mortality was influenced by age (coefficient -0.047, P < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient -0.009, P = 0.020).

The Aperio thrombectomy device showed promising results in an experimental study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the device clinically. METHODS 119 patients with acute stroke were treated in nine centers using the Aperio thrombectomy device. Target vessel, diameter, thrombus length, procedure time, recanalization, number of deployments, additional use of anticoagulants, complications, and the use of additional devices were assessed. RESULTS The median thrombus length was 15 mm (range 1.5-20 mm) and the average time from device insertion to recanalization was 30 min (range 5-120 min). Blood flow restoration (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2-3) was achieved in 85%. In the majority of cases complete clot removal was achieved (TICI 0, 12%; TICI 1, 2%; TICI 2a, 14%; TICI 2b, 18%; TICI 3, 53%). The median number of deployments was 2 (range 1-6).

However, little is known about the physiological responses of this species to environmental extremes under field conditions. This study aimed to establish the efficacy of surgically implanted thermal radio transmitters and data loggers to measure the body temperature of free-ranging koalas across a range of environmental conditions and ambient temperatures. Five free-ranging koalas in southeast Queensland were implanted with thermal transmitters and data loggers waxed together as a single package. Body temperatures were recorded for variable periods ranging from 3 to 12 months. Diurnal rhythms in body temperature were detected irrespective of season. The long-term diurnal body temperature peak for all koalas occurred between 16:00 and 17:00 h and body temperature was 36.7-36.9 °C, the long-term nadir occurred between 07:00 and 08:00 h and body temperature was 35.4-35.7 °C. Koala body temperatures as low as 34.2 °C and as high as 39.0 °C were recorded. Thermolability became apparent when ambient temperatures were outside the deduced thermal neutral zone for koalas (14.5-24.5 °C): heat was accumulated during the day and dissipated during the cool of the night. While this study is the first to report on body temperature of free-ranging koalas in their normal behavioural context, further investigations are necessary to determine the physiological boundaries of the thermal niche for this species, in order to better equip models that will more accurately predict the impacts of climate change on koalas.","Adam, D; Johnston, S D; Beard, L; Nicolson, V; Gaughan, J B; Lisle, A T; FitzGibbon, S; Barth, B J; Gillett, A; Grigg, G; Ellis, W",International journal of biometeorology,143,7

We studied the long-term temporal relationship between several antimicrobial drug groups and the composition of the human gut microbiota determined in feces samples. METHODS Feces samples were obtained from a community-dwelling cohort of middle-aged and elderly individuals (Rotterdam Study). Bacterial DNA was isolated and sequenced using V3/V4 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). The time between the last prescription of several antimicrobial drug groups and the day of sampling was categorized into 0-12, 12-24, 24-48 and >48 months. The effects of the antimicrobial drug groups on the Shannon alpha-diversity (diversity), the Bray-Curtis beta-diversity (community structure), the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and individual genera were determined. RESULTS We studied the gut microbiota of 1413 individuals (57.5% female, median age 62.6 years). The alpha-diversity was significantly lower up to 4 years after prescriptions of macrolides and lincosamides. It was also lower in the first year after the use of beta-lactams. The community structure (beta-diversity) of the microbiota was significantly different up to 4 years for macrolides and lincosamides, the first year for beta-lactams and at least the first year for quinolones. For the F/B ratio, drugs with a high anaerobic activity shifted the ratio toward Firmicutes in the first year whereas other antimicrobial drugs shifted the ratio toward Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSION Use of antimicrobial drugs is associated with a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota.These effects differ in strength and duration, depending on the antimicrobial drug group used. These findings should be considered when prescribing antimicrobial drugs.","Mulder, M; Radjabzadeh, D; Kiefte-de Jong, J C; Uitterlinden, A G; Kraaij, R; Stricker, B H; Verbon, A",Gut microbes,143,29

METHODS Prospective, noninterventional observational study of 50 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) beds equipped with Better Care™ software throughout MV. The software distinguished ventilatory modes and detected ineffective inspiratory efforts during expiration (IEE), double-triggering, aborted inspirations, and short and prolonged cycling to compute the asynchrony index (AI) for each hour. We analyzed 7,027 h of MV comprising 8,731,981 breaths. RESULTS Asynchronies were detected in all patients and in all ventilator modes. The median AI was 3.41 % [IQR 1.95-5.77]; the most common asynchrony overall and in each mode was IEE [2.38 % (IQR 1.36-3.61)]. Asynchronies were less frequent from 12 pm to 6 am [1.69 % (IQR 0.47-4.78)]. In the hours where more than 90 % of breaths were machine-triggered, the median AI decreased, but asynchronies were still present. When we compared patients with AI > 10 vs AI ≤ 10 %, we found similar reintubation and tracheostomy rates but higher ICU and hospital mortality and a trend toward longer duration of MV in patients with an AI above the cutoff. CONCLUSIONS Asynchronies are common throughout MV, occurring in all MV modes, and more frequently during the daytime. Further studies should determine whether asynchronies are a marker for or a cause of mortality.","Blanch, Lluís; Villagra, Ana; Sales, Bernat; Montanya, Jaume; Lucangelo, Umberto; Luján, Manel; García-Esquirol, Oscar; Chacón, Encarna; Estruga, Anna; Oliva, Joan C; Hernández-Abadia, Alberto; Albaiceta, Guillermo M; Fernández-Mondejar, Enrique; Fernández, Rafael; Lopez-Aguilar, Josefina; Villar, Jesús; Murias, Gastón; Kacmarek, Robert M",Intensive care medicine,143,1

METHODS Experimental and observational studies of prehospital notification compared with no notification or another type of notification in major trauma patients requiring emergency transport were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane ACROBAT-NRSI tool. A narrative synthesis was conducted and evidence quality rated using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS Three observational studies of 72,423 major trauma patients were included. All were conducted in high-income countries in hospitals with established trauma services, with two studies undertaking retrospective analysis of registry data. Two studies reported overall mortality, one demonstrating a reduction in mortality; (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.94, 72,073 participants); and the other demonstrating a nonsignificant change (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.64, 81 participants). The quality of this evidence was rated as very low. CONCLUSION Limited research on the topic constrains conclusive evidence on the effect of prehospital notification on patient-centered outcomes after severe trauma. Composite interventions that combine prehospital notification with effective actions on arrival to hospital such as trauma bay availability, trauma team presence, and early access to definitive management may provide more robust evidence towards benefits of early interventions during trauma reception and resuscitation.","Synnot, Anneliese; Karlsson, Adrian; Brichko, Lisa; Chee, Melissa; Fitzgerald, Mark; Misra, Mahesh C; Howard, Teresa; Mathew, Joseph; Rotter, Thomas; Fiander, Michelle; Gruen, Russell L; Gupta, Amit; Dharap, Satish; Fahey, Madonna; Stephenson, Michael; O'Reilly, Gerard; Cameron, Peter; Mitra, Biswadev",Journal of evidence-based medicine,143,20

Bystanders could act as immediate responders after an MCI in order to prevent a victim from exsanguination using direct pressure or commercial tourniquets (C-TQ). Reports have shown that immediate access to C-TQs was not available and bystanders used objects available at the trauma scene to make an improvised tourniquet (I-TQ). The aim of this systematic review of literature was to summarize the existing literature on designs, efficacy and safety of I-TQs. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed. Bibliographic databases PubMed, EMBASE.com and Cochrane Library were searched. All types of original studies about I-TQ's were included. Review studies, exempts from textbooks or studies with TQs applied during elective surgeries were excluded. RESULTS Twenty studies were included. In both simulated experiments and real-life situations, I-TQs outperformed commercial TQs (C-TQ) regarding success rate. Of the I-TQs, the band and windlass design performed most consistently. Although lacking any statistical analysis, there was no reported difference in adverse events between I-TQs and C-TQs. CONCLUSION The use of- and training in I-TQ by civilian immediate responders is not recommended because of limited efficacy and safety concerns; direct pressure is a viable alternative. However, I-TQs may save lives when applied correctly with proper objects; therefore, future studies regarding the best design and training in application of effective and safe I-TQs should be encouraged.","Cornelissen, Maarten Philip; Brandwijk, Anne; Schoonmade, Linda; Giannakopoulos, Georgios; van Oostendorp, Stefan; Geeraedts, Leo",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,143,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a total of 50 investigations in which we documented a complete valve closure at the so called ""crosse"" at the valve of the large saphenous vein, a delayed valve closure or an incomplete valve closure with consecutive insufficiency at the crosse. The valve function of the crosse is crucial for the development of varicosis. For our study we recorded age and gender of the patients. One patient in the study was suffering from Covid19. For the examinations we used a 3-9 MHz probe and a high-end ultrasound device. The examination was performed in a lying position and under quiet conditions. Before examination we practiced inhalation and exhalation as well as ""pressing"" or coughing with the patients, which resulted in a physiological closure of the venous valves. To rule out thrombosis, we carried out compression sonography on the legs. During the examination we documented the B-scan, the Color-Coded Duplex Sonography, the HR-flow and the V-flow for 3 seconds at the estuary of the crosses and incorporated these parameters into our measurements. Via V-flow, vectors can be imaged by representing the flow of erythrocytes and visually indicate a possible insufficiency due to delayed or incomplete valve closure. RESULTS 31 of 50 patients (age 19-81years) showed a complete valve closure of the crosses, while three patients suffered from thrombosis. In eight of the 50 study participants (age 45-79 years) a delayed valve closure could be diagnosed by V-flow within 1-2 seconds. None of them had a thrombosis, but six of them suffered from cancer. In eleven patients we derived an incomplete valve closure with insufficiency (age 51-88 years). With reflux it took >2 seconds to close the valve. The patient with Covid19 also showed an incomplete valve closure with insufficiency. At the same time this patient showed a Covid19-associated deep vein thrombosis. Eight additional patients also had a thrombosis. Six of them suffered from cancer. Overall, the results were best visualized by V-Flow. CONCLUSION The crosse as a significant venous structure can be well investigated by V-flow with respect to hemodynamic changes and a resulted reflux. Also associated changes close to the valve can be visualized well.","Kammerer, S; Stroszczynski, C; Jung, E M",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,143,19

METHODS The SAGES da Vinci(®) TAVAC sub-committee performed a literature review of the da Vinci(®) Surgical System regarding gastrointestinal surgery. Conclusions by the sub-committee were vetted by the SAGES TAVAC Committee and SAGES Executive Board. Following revisions, the document was evaluated by the TAVAC Committee and Executive Board again for final approval. RESULTS Several conclusions were drawn based on expert opinion organized by safety, efficacy, and cost for robotic foregut, bariatric, hepatobiliary/pancreatic, colorectal surgery, and single-incision cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS Gastrointestinal surgery with the da Vinci(®) Surgical System is safe and comparable, but not superior to standard laparoscopic approaches. Although clinically acceptable, its use may be costly for select gastrointestinal procedures. Current data are limited to the da Vinci(®) Surgical System; further analyses are needed.","Tsuda, Shawn; Oleynikov, Dmitry; Gould, Jon; Azagury, Dan; Sandler, Bryan; Hutter, Matthew; Ross, Sharona; Haas, Eric; Brody, Fred; Satava, Richard",Surgical endoscopy,143,1

SYBR(®) Gold and heparin assays indicated improved stability of siRNA/copolymer-complexes with a graft density of 5. At N/P 1, only 40% siRNA condensation was achieved with non-grafted polymer, but 95% siRNA was condensed with copolymer PEI25k-(PCL570-PEG5k)(5). Intracellular uptake studies with confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the cellular uptake was increased with graft density, and copolymer PEI25k-(PCL570-PEG5k)(5) was able to deliver siRNA much more efficiently into the cytosol than into the nucleus. The in vitro knockdown effect of siRNA/hyPEI-g-PCL-b-PEG was also significantly improved with increasing graft density, and the most potent copolymer PEI25k-(PCL570-PEG5k)(5) knocked down 84.43% of the GAPDH expression. Complexes of both the copolymers with graft density 3 and 5 circulated much longer than unmodified PEI25 kDa and free siRNA, leading to a longer elimination half-life, a slower clearance and a three- or fourfold increase of the AUC compared to free siRNA, respectively. We demonstrated that the graft density of the amphiphilic chains can enhance the siRNA delivery efficiency and blood circulation, which highlights the development of safe and efficient non-viral polymeric siRNA nanocarriers that are especially stable and provide longer circulation in vivo.","Zheng, Mengyao; Librizzi, Damiano; Kılıç, Ayşe; Liu, Yu; Renz, Harald; Merkel, Olivia M; Kissel, Thomas",Biomaterials,143,1

In the form of 12 statements, the CDC offers guidance that at times is not supported by the evidence or introduces new concepts (such as a requirement that opioids improve function). Our objective was to examine the new guidelines in terms of how well they could strike the balance between keeping opioids accessible to those who need them while appropriately restricting their use. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The CDC guidelines offer some reasonable and laudable guidance, but they also make some recommendations which are not supported by current scientific evidence. We also noted that the urgent need for greater education among opioid prescribers was not addressed in the new guidelines.","Pergolizzi, J V; Raffa, R B; LeQuang, J A",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,143,29

To address this clinical need, we are developing a low cost, universal magnetically levitated extracorporeal system with interchangeable pump heads for pediatric support. Two impeller and pump designs (pump V1 and V2) for the pediatric pump were developed using dimensional analysis techniques and classic pump theory based on defined performance criteria (generated flow, pressure, and impeller diameter). The designs were virtually constructed using computer-aided design (CAD) software and 3D flow and pressure features were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Simulated pump designs (V1, V2) were operated at higher rotational speeds (~5,000 revolutions per minute [RPM]) than initially estimated (4,255 RPM) to achieve the desired operational point (3.5 L/min flow at 150 mm Hg). Pump V2 outperformed V1 by generating approximately 30% higher pressures at all simulated rotational speeds and at 5% lower priming volume. Simulated hydrodynamic performance (achieved flow and pressure, hydraulic efficiency) of our pediatric pump design, featuring reduced impeller size and priming volume, compares favorably to current commercially available MCS devices.","Tompkins, Landon H; Gellman, Barry N; Morello, Gino F; Prina, Steven R; Roussel, Thomas J; Kopechek, Jonathan A; Petit, Priscilla C; Slaughter, Mark S; Koenig, Steven C; Dasse, Kurt A",ASAIO journal,143,5

METHODS Consecutive BAO patients with symptom onset <24 h treated with IAT were included. Vertebral artery (VA) V3 and posterior communicating artery (PCoA) diameters were measured (CT angiography or MR angiography). The presence of PCoA atresia, VA hypoplasia, VAs that end in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), and extracranial VA occlusion was recorded. RESULTS 38 BAO patients were included. Mean age was 63±15 years; 52% were men. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 21±9, and mean/median time from symptom onset to IAT were 10/7 h. First generation thrombectomy devices were mostly used. Overall Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia 2b-3 reperfusion was 68.4%. Good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2) was observed in 17.8% and mortality in 64.3% of cases at 90 days. 55% of patients had an atretic PCoA while 47% had a hypoplastic VA. The mean sum of the bilateral PCoA and VA diameters were 2.3±1.2 and 5.2±5.2 mm, respectively. VAs that end in the PICA was noted in 23% of patients, and extracranial VA occlusion in 42%. BAO was proximal/mid/distal in 36%/29%/34%. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated hypertensive disease (β=2.97; 95% CI 1.15 to 4.79; p<0.01) and reperfusion rate (β=-0.40; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.70; p=0.02) independently associated with outcome. Multivariate analysis for predictors of reperfusion failed to identify other associations. A trend for better reperfusion with stent retrievers was noted (β=1.82; 95% CI -0.24 to 3.88; p=0.08). CONCLUSIONS Reperfusion emerged as a predictor of good outcome in patients that underwent IAT for BAO.

METHODS Pharmacy directors at 1,437 general and children's medical/surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed using a mixed-mode method of contact by email and mail. Survey completion was online. RESULTS The response rate was 18.7%. Seventy-three percent of hospitals implemented changes to hospital units, including 46% that increased intensive care unit bed capacity; 94% made changes to pharmacy supply chain acquisition, changes to products, and/or increased inventory. Staffing changes were implemented by 69% of hospitals, with the most common being staffing reductions (55%) and salary reductions (16%). Medication-use changes were implemented by 86% of hospitals, with treatment guidelines for COVID-19 treatment (79%) and opening compassionate use or investigational drug studies (55%) being the most common. Changes in sterile compounding processes were implemented by 84% of hospitals. Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages led to 71% of hospitals modifying PPE use standards in sterile compounding. Eighty-seven percent of hospitals changed operational activities, such as changing medication return practices (56%), medication reconciliation processes (46%), intravenous medication recycling (38%), and discharge counseling (37%). Hospitals experienced shortages of many medications, including albuterol inhalers (60%), sedatives and anesthetic agents (58%), neuromuscular blockers (43%), corticosteroids (34%), cardiovascular agents (24%), investigational agents (24%), and dialysis solutions (6%).

We assessed trends in adolescent birth and examined its associations with child undernutrition in Bangladesh using data from seven rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys (1996-2017, n = 12,006 primiparous women with living children <5 years old). Adolescent birth (10-19 years old) declined slowly, from 84% in 1996 to 71% in 2017. Compared with adult mothers (≥20 years old), young adolescent mothers (10-15 years old) were more likely to be underweight (+11 pp), have lower education (-24 pp), have less decision-making power (-10 pp), live in poorer households (-0.9 SD) with poorer sanitation (-15 pp), and have poorer feeding practices (10 pp), and were less likely to access health and nutrition services (-3 to -24 pp). In multivariable regressions controlled for known determinants of child undernutrition, children born to adolescents had lower height-for-age Z-scores (-0.29 SD for young and -0.10 SD for old adolescents (16-19 years old)), weight-for-age Z-score (-0.18 and -0.06 SD, respectively) as well as higher stunting (5.9 pp) and underweight (6.0 pp) than those born to adults. In conclusion, birth during adolescence, a common occurrence in Bangladesh, is associated with child undernutrition. Policies and programs to address poverty and improve women's education can help delay marriage, reduce early childbearing, and improve child growth.","Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Scott, Samuel; Khuong, Long Quynh; Pramanik, Priyanjana; Ahmed, Akhter; Rashid, Sabina Faiz; Afsana, Kaosar; Menon, Purnima",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,143,33

The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p<0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p<0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p<0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p<0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future.

About 85% of patients respond to immunotherapy (and removal of an associated tumour if it applies), but it often takes several months or more than 1 year for patients to recover. There are no complementary treatments, beyond immunotherapy, to accelerate this recovery. Previous studies showed that SGE-301, a synthetic analogue of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is a potent and selective positive allosteric modulator of NMDAR, reverted the memory deficit caused by phencyclidine (a non-competitive antagonist of NMDAR), and prevented the NMDAR dysfunction caused by patients' NMDAR antibodies in cultured neurons. An advantage of SGE-301 is that it is optimized for systemic delivery such that plasma and brain exposures are sufficient to modulate NMDAR activity. Here, we used SGE-301 to confirm that in cultured neurons it prevented the antibody-mediated reduction of receptors, and then we applied it to a previously reported mouse model of passive cerebroventricular transfer of patient's CSF antibodies. Four groups were established: mice receiving continuous (14-day) infusion of patients' or controls' CSF, treated with daily subcutaneous administration of SGE-301 or vehicle (no drug). The effects on memory were examined with the novel object location test at different time points, and the effects on synaptic levels of NMDAR (assessed with confocal microscopy) and plasticity (long-term potentiation) were examined in the hippocampus on Day 18, which in this model corresponds to the last day of maximal clinical and synaptic alterations. As expected, mice infused with patient's CSF antibodies, but not those infused with controls' CSF, and treated with vehicle developed severe memory deficit without locomotor alteration, accompanied by a decrease of NMDAR clusters and impairment of long-term potentiation. All antibody-mediated pathogenic effects (memory, synaptic NMDAR, long-term potentiation) were prevented in the animals treated with SGE-301, despite this compound not antagonizing antibody binding. Additional investigations on the potential mechanisms related to these SGE-301 effects showed that (i) in cultured neurons SGE-301 prolonged the decay time of NMDAR-dependent spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents suggesting a prolonged open time of the channel; and (ii) it significantly decreased, without fully preventing, the internalization of antibody-bound receptors suggesting that additional, yet unclear mechanisms, contribute in keeping unchanged the surface NMDAR density. Overall, these findings suggest that SGE-301, or similar NMDAR modulators, could potentially serve as complementary treatment for anti-NMDAR encephalitis and deserve future investigations.","Mannara, Francesco; Radosevic, Marija; Planagumà, Jesús; Soto, David; Aguilar, Esther; García-Serra, Anna; Maudes, Estibaliz; Pedreño, Marta; Paul, Steven; Doherty, James; Quirk, Michael; Dai, Jing; Gasull, Xavier; Lewis, Mike; Dalmau, Josep",Brain : a journal of neurology,143,1

BACKGROUND Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a promising endovascular treatment option for peripheral artery disease of the femoropopliteal segment, and each unique device requires dedicated clinical study. METHODS The prospective, randomized RANGER SFA (Comparison of the Ranger™ Paclitaxel-Coated PTA Balloon Catheter and Uncoated PTA Balloons in Femoropopliteal Arteries) study (NCT02013193) enrolled 105 patients with symptomatic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford category 2 to 4) and stenotic lesions in the nonstented femoropopliteal segment at 10 European centers. Seventy-one patients (mean age 68 ± 8 years, n = 53 men) were enrolled in the Ranger DCB arm, and 34 patients (mean age 67 ± 9 years, n = 23 men) were assigned to the control group. Twelve-month analysis included patency, safety, and clinical outcomes and quality-of-life assessments. RESULTS The DCB group had a greater primary patency rate at 12 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate 86.4% vs. 56.5%), with a significantly longer time to patency failure (log-rank p < 0.001). The estimated freedom from target lesion revascularization rate was 91.2% in the DCB group and 69.9% in the control group at 12 months, with a significantly longer time to reintervention (p = 0.010). No target limb amputations or device-related deaths occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS Twelve-month results show that patency was maintained longer after Ranger DCB treatment than after conventional balloon angioplasty, and this result was associated with a low revascularization rate and good clinical outcomes.","Steiner, Sabine; Willfort-Ehringer, Andrea; Sievert, Horst; Geist, Volker; Lichtenberg, Michael; Del Giudice, Costantino; Sauguet, Antoine; Diaz-Cartelle, Juan; Marx, Claudia; Ströbel, Armin; Schult, Ingolf; Scheinert, Dierk",JACC.

Latest guidance on this topic and the evidence base for steroid dosing are reviewed and discussed. Risk stratification for patients with AI and optimal strategies for management, including steroid dosing, are detailed. Our review highlights that patients with AI wishing to fast should undergo a thorough risk assessment ideally several months before Ramadan.

Prior to the commencement of Ramadan, all patients must receive up-to-date education on sick day rules, instructions on when to terminate their fast or abstain from fasting, carry steroid warning information and must have a valid intramuscular (IM) hydrocortisone pack and know how to administer this. Switching patients with AI desiring to fast from multiple daily hydrocortisone replacement to prednisolone 5 mg once daily at dawn (during Suhoor or Sehri) is recommended and discussed. Patients on fludrocortisone for AI should be advised to take their total dose at dawn. We provide practically relevant case-based scenarios to help with the application of this guidance.

The online survey was conducted from June 17 to 29, 2020. Respondents reported the frequency of travel before the pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated travel when normal activities resume for walking, bicycling, personal vehicle use, and public transit. Analyses were conducted in July and August 2020. RESULTS During the pandemic, local travel significantly decreased (-10.36%, 95% CI= -16.26, -4.02) relative to prepandemic levels. Within travel modes, significant decreases were reported for public transit, personal vehicle use, and walking. There was no change in reported bicycle use during the pandemic period relative to prepandemic levels. When normal activities resume, respondents anticipated a significant increase in bicycling (24.54%, 95% CI=3.24, 50.24). Anticipated travel using personal vehicles, public transit, and walking were not significantly different from the prepandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS Unlike the other local travel modes, bicycling did not decrease during the pandemic and is anticipated to significantly increase. Investment in bicycle-safe infrastructure could sustain the anticipated increase in bicycling.","Ehsani, Johnathon P; Michael, Jeffrey P; Duren, Michelle L; Mui, Yeeli; Porter, Keshia M Pollack",American journal of preventive medicine,143,16

Methods We collected microarray profiles of 39 ccRCC and matched normal samples to identify differential expression genes (DEGs). Then, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed to identify gene modules associated with the metastasis in ccRCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA, https://www.proteinatlas.org/) database were used for verification set. Finally, we used biological experiments to preliminary investigate the impact of LTF on the tumor biological behavior of ccRCC, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Results A total of 15 genetic modules were identified, and the light-green module is considered the most relevant to tumor metastasis. (P = 0.02, R2 = -0.4). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was performed to identify the hub nodes in the light-green module. Finally, combining the results of PPI, WGCNA and DEGs, lactotransferrin (LTF) gene was regarded as ""real"" hub genes for cancer metastasis risk. LTF was subsequently validated using the TCGA database. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the expression of LTF in ccRCC tumor tissue was significantly lower than that in normal tissue based on the HPA database. Intriguingly, patients with low expression of LTF had lower survival rates (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.89, P = 0.0067), the expression level of the sample was negatively correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.0385), and patients with low expression of LTF gene were more likely to have distant metastasis (P = 0.038). Overexpression of LTF inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis of human ccRCC cells in vitro. Conclusion LTF might be a novel prognostic biomarker for ccRCC.","Ni, Lihua; Yuan, Cheng; Zhang, Changjiang; Xiang, Yuandi; Wu, Juan; Wang, Xiaolong; Wu, Xiaoyan",OncoTargets and therapy,143,19

In particular, the ""loss of heterochromatin"" phenotype in cellular senescence is associated with the process of aging and age-related disorders. Although biological processes of senescent cells, including senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) formation, chromosome compaction, and redistribution of key proteins, have been closely associated with high-order chromatin structure, the relationship between the high-order chromatin reorganization and the loss of heterochromatin phenotype during senescence has not been fully understood. By using senescent and deep senescent fibroblasts induced by DNA damage harboring the ""loss of heterochromatin"" phenotype, we observed progressive 3D reorganization of heterochromatin during senescence. Facultative and constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, respectively, show different alterations. Facultative heterochromatin tends to switch from the repressive B-compartment to the active A-compartment, whereas constitutive heterochromatin shows no significant changes at the compartment level but enhanced interactions between themselves. Both types of heterochromatin show increased chromatin accessibility and gene expression leakage during senescence. Furthermore, increased chromatin accessibility in potential CTCF binding sites accompanies the establishment of novel loops in constitutive heterochromatin. Finally, we also observed aberrant expression of repetitive elements, including LTR (long terminal repeat) and satellite classes. Overall, facultative and constitutive heterochromatin show both similar and distinct multiscale alterations in the 3D map, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression leakage. This study provides an epigenomic map of heterochromatin reorganization during senescence.","Zhang, Xianglin; Liu, Xuehui; Du, Zhenhai; Wei, Lei; Fang, Huan; Dong, Qiongye; Niu, Jing; Li, Yanda; Gao, Juntao; Zhang, Michael Q; Xie, Wei; Wang, Xiaowo",Genome research,143,28

Minimally invasive robotic surgery has made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time, realizing improvements for both the patient and surgeon. This has led to an increase in the use and development of robotic devices and platforms for general surgery. The purpose of this review is to explore current and emerging surgical robotic technologies in a growing and dynamic environment of research and development. METHODS This review explores medical and surgical robotic endoscopic surgery and peripheral technologies currently available or in development. The devices discussed here are specific to general surgery, including laparoscopy, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Benefits and limitations of each technology were identified and applicable future directions were described. RESULTS A number of FDA-approved devices and platforms for robotic surgery were reviewed, including the da Vinci Surgical System, Sensei X Robotic Catheter System, FreeHand 1.2, invendoscopy E200 system, Flex® Robotic System, Senhance, ARES, the Single-Port Instrument Delivery Extended Research (SPIDER), and the NeoGuide Colonoscope. Additionally, platforms were reviewed which have not yet obtained FDA approval including MiroSurge, ViaCath System, SPORT™ Surgical System, SurgiBot, Versius Robotic System, Master and Slave Transluminal Endoscopic Robot, Verb Surgical, Miniature In Vivo Robot, and the Einstein Surgical Robot. CONCLUSIONS The use and demand for robotic medical and surgical platforms is increasing and new technologies are continually being developed. New technologies are increasingly implemented to improve on the capabilities of previously established systems. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each robotic surgical device and platform in the operating suite.","Peters, Brian S; Armijo, Priscila R; Krause, Crystal; Choudhury, Songita A; Oleynikov, Dmitry",Surgical endoscopy,143,24

We hypothesized prophylactic administration of nesiritide (human recombinant brain natriuretic peptide, NES, Natrecor, Scios, Fremont, CA, USA), which has similar physiologic properties to ANP and would promote diuresis in maze and mitral patients postoperatively. METHODS Randomized, blinded, prospective pilot study comparing patients undergoing maze and mitral surgery including excision of the left atrial appendage. Three hours after cardiopulmonary bypass, patients received either a 72-hour infusion of NES at 0.01 mcg/kg/min (n = 9) or placebo (n = 10). Diuresis, diuretics, time to extubation, oxygenation, ANP, and serum Endothelin-1 levels were measured. Nonparametric analysis with Mann-Whitney test was performed with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS In both groups, postoperative ANP levels fell from baseline (NES 330 to 280 ng/mL and control 220 to 150 ng/mL). There were no significant differences in patients receiving NES compared to controls in diuresis (1.33 mL/kg/hour urine output NES vs. 1.68 mL/kg/hour controls, p = 0.14); furosemide dosage (0.04 mg/kg/hour NES vs. 0.04 mg/kg/hour controls, p = 0.08); time to extubation (17.5 hours NES vs. 19.5 control, p = 0.42) or PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 48 hours (NES 200 vs. 273 control, p > 0.05). Endothelin-1 levels were higher at baseline with NES but not at 1 and 72 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (NES 3.1, 3.8, 2.9 pg/mL vs. control 1.85, 4.05, 2.75 pg/mL; p = 0.01, 0.77, 0.47).

METHODS The clinical data of 7 COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumothorax admitted to Huanggang Central Hospital from January 3 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment were summarized, and experience in the treatment of COVID-19 was shared. RESULTS (1) General information: among the 7 patients, 5 were males and 2 were females. Four of them had no underlying disease, and 1 had a history of diabetes and hypertension. One patient had only a history of hypertension. There were 6 cases of right pneumothorax and 1 case of bilateral pneumothorax. The 7 patients had a long hospital stay, all over 4 weeks, mostly complicated with multiple organ dysfunction. (2) Imaging examination: 1 case evolved from the early stage to the advanced stage within 1 week and to the severe stage within 2 weeks. Pneumothorax occurred 4 weeks later, and was absorbed within 2 weeks. The remaining 6 patients presented progressive stage on admission, all of them advanced to severe stage within 1 to 2 weeks, and most of them presented diffused consolidation shadows, striation shadows and fibrosis of both lungs, obvious pleural adhesion, and extremely slow lesion absorption. (3) Treatment: 1 severe patient with pneumothorax 4 weeks after onset was given non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The remaining 6 critically ill patients were treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Five patients were treated with mechanical ventilation within 3 days after the occurrence of pneumothorax, and 1 patient was treated with mechanical ventilation after 11 days. (4) Outcome: 1 patient without endotracheal intubation was continuously given nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, and the condition was stable. Four of the 6 patients complicated with pneumothorax after endotracheal intubation died, and the other 2 patients successfully removed the drainage tube within 2 weeks of closed thoracic drainage, and their condition gradually stabilized. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 complicated with pneumothorax is a dangerous disease with poor prognosis, and should be paid adequate attention.","Jia, Liping; Wang, Changfeng; Zhang, Yujiao; Ye, Yuanyuan; Jin, Zhaoxia",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,143,31

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok(®)). METHODS Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injection of saline placebo (2304 subjects), or trivalent FluBlok containing 45 mcg of each rHA0 component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness. RESULTS Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. CONCLUSIONS Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.","Treanor, John J; El Sahly, Hana; King, James; Graham, Irene; Izikson, Ruvim; Kohberger, Robert; Patriarca, Peter; Cox, Manon",Vaccine,143,17

The respective incidence of these two phenomena has not been previously studied in humans. The study was designed to describe temporal trends in diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients. METHODS Ancillary study of a prospective, 6-month, observational cohort study conducted in two ICUs. MV patients were studied within 24 h following intubation (day-1) and every 48-72 h thereafter. Diaphragm function was assessed by twitch tracheal pressure (Ptr,stim) in response to bilateral anterior magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined as Ptr,stim < 11 cmH2O. Patients who received MV for at least 5 days were retained, and the first and the last measures were analysed. RESULTS Forty-three patients were included. Overall, 79 % of patients developed DD at some point during their ICU stay: 23 (53 %) patients presented DD on initiation of mechanical ventilation, 14 (33 %) of whom had persistent DD, while diaphragm function improved in 9 (21 %). Among the remaining 20 (47 %) patients who did not present DD on initiation of MV, 11 (26 %) developed DD during the ICU stay, while 9 (21 %) did not. Mortality was higher in patients with DD either on initiation of mechanical ventilation or during the subsequent ICU stay than in those who never developed DD (35 vs. 0 %, p = 0.04). Duration of MV was higher in patients with DD on initiation of MV that subsequently persisted than in patients who never exhibited diaphragm dysfunction (18 vs. 5 days, p = 0.04). Factors associated with a change in Ptr,stim were: age [linear coefficient regression (Coeff.) -0.097, standard error (SD) 0.047, p = 0.046], PaO2/FiO2 ratio (Coeff. 0.014, SD 0.006, p = 0.0211) and the proportion of the time under MV with sedation (per 10 %, Coeff. -5.359, SD 2.451, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS DD is observed in a large majority of MV patients ≥5 days at some point of their ICU stay. Various patterns of DD are observed, including DD on initiation of mechanical ventilation and ICU-acquired DD.

METHODS The databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, SocINDEX, ASSIA and the Cochrane Library were searched in February 2020. Included studies needed to focus on women's experiences with and expectations of HCPs after disclosure of IPA. We considered primary studies using qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis published since 2004. Studies conducted in any country, in any type of healthcare setting, were included. The quality of individual studies was assessed using an adaptation of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies. The confidence in the overall evidence base was determined using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE)-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research methods. Thematic synthesis was used for analysis. RESULTS Thirty-one papers describing 30 studies were included in the final review. These were conducted in a range of health settings, predominantly in the USA and other high-income countries. All studies were in English. Four main themes were developed through the analysis, describing women's experiences and expectations of HCPs: (1) connection through kindness and care; (2) see the evil, hear the evil, speak the evil; (3) do more than just listen; and (4) plant the right seed. If these key expectations were absent from care, it resulted in a range of negative emotional impacts for women. CONCLUSIONS Our findings strongly align with the principles of woman-centred care, indicating that women value emotional connection, practical support through action and advocacy and an approach that recognises their autonomy and is tailored to their individual needs. Drawing on the evidence, we have developed a best practice model to guide practitioners in how to deliver woman-centred care.

Materials and Methods Sixty-eight consecutive eligible adults referred for dynamic liver CT were enrolled; 58 had previously undergone liver CT, including 8 that experienced extravasation. Two 22- or 24-gauge catheters were placed in all patients after 2-5 venipunctures, and 2 mL/kg of contrast agent (370 mg I/mL) was split-administered through both catheters to achieve total flow rate of 4 mL/s. Patients' experience and examination success rate, defined as uneventful scans completed at 4 mL/s or at < 4 mL/s achieving standard image quality in all phases, were analyzed. Quantitative hepatic signal-to-noise and hepatic vascular contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were compared with 30 control examinations scanned at 4 mL/s using an 18-gauge catheter. Results One case each of extravasation and severe injection pain caused the examination to be aborted. Success rate was 88.2% (60/68; 54 patients scanned at 4 mL/s, 6 at 3.5-3.9 mL/s). Fifty-five of 58 patients (94.8%) that had past CT regarded the venipuncture as more tolerable than (n = 36) or similar to (n = 19) past experiences; 45 of 58 patients (77.6%) found contrast injection less painful than (n = 35) or similar to (n = 10) past experiences. When compared with control examinations, signal-to-noise ratio was similar in all phases (p ≥ 0.502), but the hepatic arterial CNR in arterial phase was slightly inferior (p ≤ 0.047).

In this study, the influence of salvianolate and aspirin on metabolic enzymes, and the relationship between the blood concentration and pharmacodynamic indexes, were determined. METHOD In this, randomized, parallel-grouped, single-center clinical trial, 18 patients with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated into three groups: aspirin (AP) group, salvianolate (SV) group, and combination (A + S) group. All treatment courses lasted for 10 days, and blood samples were acquired before and after administration at different timepoints. The expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), CD62p, procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1), P2Y12, phosphodiesterase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) were compared with variance analysis The blood concentrations were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS Sixteen subjects completed the study. No significant difference in COMT was found among groups, although there was a decrease in the SV group. The PK results indicated that the absorption time of salicylic acid was shortened and the AUC0-∞ decreased and the elimination time of salvianolic acid B was prolonged and the AUC0-∞ decreased. The PD results declined after administration. A significant difference was found in MAPK8, CD62p, and P2Y12 expression. Compared with the SV group, a significant difference in P2Y12 in the A + S group was found. CONCLUSION A pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was found in the aspirin and salvianolate combination. Pharmacodynamically, there was no difference between the A + S and AP groups. However, P2Y12 expression in the combination group was superior to that in the SV group.

Several lines of evidence suggest that surveillance of sewage and waste can provide an early warning sign for COVID-19 recurrence in a community. In support, SARS-CoV-2 traces were found in sewage in several countries. With this in mind, it is notable that pests, such as cockroaches, are exposed to pathogenic microbes routinely, yet thrive in polluted environments. Such species have likely developed mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogens. In support, recent studies showed that cockroaches possess potent antibacterial molecules to shield themselves from pathogenic bacteria. Among hundreds of molecules, some contained thiazine groups, imidazoles, chromene derivatives, isoquinoline group, sulfonamides, pyrrole-containing analogs, flavanones, and furanones. Here, we propose that cockroaches are a potential source of antiviral molecules to thwart infections. Because this is an unexploited resource for potential antivirals, we believe that cockroaches offer a unique source for novel bioactive molecule(s) to counter COVID-19 with huge clinical impact worldwide.","Siddiqui, Ruqaiyyah; Khan, Naveed Ahmed",ACS chemical neuroscience,143,5

Evidence is scarce on whether DAA therapy reduces downstream medical costs. Objective To examine the association of DAA therapy with posttreatment medical costs among Medicare beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study obtained data from various Medicare claims files for 2013 to 2017. The study population comprised patients with a hepatitis C diagnosis in 2014 who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare and Part D. Multivariate regression models were used to compare changes in medical costs over a 30-month posttreatment follow-up period between patients who used DAA therapy (treatment group) and a propensity score-matched cohort of patients who did not use DAA (control group). The model was estimated separately for patients with and those without cirrhosis. Data were analyzed between September 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Exposures Completion of DAA therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures Two outcomes were established: hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs and total medical costs. Costs were measured by Medicare-allowed payments, which included Medicare reimbursements, patient responsibilities, and third-party payments. Results A propensity score-matched cohort of 15 198 patients (9038 men [59.5%]; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [10.8] years) was analyzed. During the first 6 months after DAA therapy, hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs decreased by $2498 (95% CI, -$3356 to -$1640) in patients with cirrhosis and by $486 (95% CI, -$603 to -$369) in patients without cirrhosis compared with control or untreated patients. Cumulative reductions in hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs during 30 months after DAA treatment were $15 808 (95% CI, -$22 530 to -$9085) in patients with cirrhosis and $5372 (95% CI, -$6384 to -$4360) in patients without cirrhosis. Among those who used DAA therapy compared with control patients, total medical costs decreased by $2905 (95% CI, -$4832 to -$979) in patients with cirrhosis and by $1287 (95% CI, -$2393 to -$283) in patients without cirrhosis during the first 6 months after DAA therapy. No statistically significant association was found between DAA therapy and total medical cost reductions after 12 months of follow-up. Cumulative reductions in total costs during 30 months after DAA therapy were $7074 (95% CI, -$18 448 to $4298) in patients with cirrhosis and $7497 (95% CI, -$14 287 to -$709) in patients without cirrhosis. Conclusions and Relevance This study reported that DAA therapy appeared to be associated with a decrease in hepatitis C or liver disease-related costs for 30 months after treatment and with reduction in total medical costs for only 12 months after treatment in patients with or without cirrhosis. Longer-term follow-up studies with diverse outcomes are necessary to assess the value of DAA therapy.","Jung, Jeah; Feldman, Roger; Kalidindi, Yamini; Riley, Thomas",JAMA network open,143,1

OBJECTIVE This study compared eating behavior and hormones among adolescents in a bariatric surgery program with those in nonoverweight control adolescents and evaluated changes before and after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). DESIGN Fasting leptin, peptide YY (PYY), and ghrelin concentrations were obtained, and postprandial ghrelin and PYY area under the curve (AUC) were assessed after a single-item breakfast. Intake from an ad libitum lunchtime multi-item meal was measured. RESULTS Compared with controls (n = 9), all presurgical candidates (n = 20) had significantly greater fasting leptin, lower fasting ghrelin, and lower AUC ghrelin but similar PYY and AUC PYY. Preoperative candidates did not differ from controls in total energy consumed during the test meal. Postoperatively, among the 11 participants with data both before and after surgery, BMI (in kg/m(2)) decreased by 3.5 (P < 0.001), significantly less energy was consumed in the test meal, and a smaller number of foods were selected. AUC ghrelin and PYY did not significantly change before or after LAGB. CONCLUSIONS Few significant short-term changes were observed in appetitive hormones after LAGB. It is unclear whether objective measures of eating behavior will prove useful in evaluating the impact of bariatric surgery on outcomes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as CT00764127.","Sysko, Robyn; Devlin, Michael J; Schebendach, Janet; Tanofsky-Kraff, Marian; Zimmerli, Ellen; Korner, Judith; Yanovski, Jack A; Zitsman, Jeffrey L; Walsh, B Timothy",The American journal of clinical nutrition,143,11

Such information may in turn be used for reducing geometric uncertainties during therapeutic planning, dose delivery and response assessment. However, given the multiple imaging modalities and/or contrasts potentially included within the imaging protocol over the course of the treatment, the current manual approach to determining tissue displacement may become time-consuming and error prone. In this context, variational multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms allow automatic estimation of tumor and OAR deformations across the acquired images. In addition, they require short computational times and a low number of input parameters, which is particularly beneficial for online adaptive applications, which require on-the-fly adaptions with the patient on the treatment table. However, the majority of such DIR algorithms assume that all structures across the entire field-of-view (FOV) undergo a similar deformation pattern. Given that various anatomical structures may behave considerably different, this may lead to the estimation of anatomically implausible deformations at some locations, thus limiting their validity. Therefore, in this paper we propose an anatomically-adaptive variational multi-modal DIR algorithm, which employs a regionalized registration model in accordance with the local underlying anatomy. The algorithm was compared against two existing methods which employ global assumptions on the estimated deformations patterns. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed method has demonstrated an improved anatomical plausibility of the estimated deformations over the entire FOV as well as displaying overall higher accuracy. Moreover, despite the more complex registration model, the proposed approach is very fast and thus suitable for online scenarios. Therefore, future adaptive IGRT workflows may benefit from an anatomically-adaptive registration model for precise contour propagation and dose accumulation, in areas showcasing considerable variations in anatomical properties.","Zachiu, Cornel; Denis de Senneville, Baudouin; Willigenburg, Thomas; van der Voort van Zyp, Jochem R N; de Boer, J C J; Raaymakers, Bas W; Ries, Mario G",Physics in medicine and biology,143,16

Cardioviruses have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes a large polyprotein (L-1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD) that is cleaved to produce approximately 12 mature proteins. We report on a conserved ORF that overlaps the 2B-encoding sequence of EMCV in the +2 reading frame. The ORF is translated as a 128-129 amino acid transframe fusion (2B*) with the N-terminal 11-12 amino acids of 2B, via ribosomal frameshifting at a conserved GGUUUUY motif. Mutations that knock out expression of 2B* result in a small-plaque phenotype. Curiously, although theilovirus sequences lack a long ORF in the +2 frame at this genomic location, they maintain a conserved GGUUUUU motif just downstream of the 2A-2B junction, and a highly localized peak in conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites suggests that theiloviruses also utilize frameshifting here, albeit into a very short +2-frame ORF. Unlike previous cases of programmed -1 frameshifting, here frameshifting is modulated by virus infection, thus suggesting a novel regulatory role for frameshifting in these viruses.","Loughran, Gary; Firth, Andrew E; Atkins, John F",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,143,4

In this study, we aimed to investigate the predictive role of Fibrinogen to albumin ratio (FAR) in patients with RPL. METHODS Pregnant women in their first trimester of pregnancy were included in the study and divided in to two groups as RPL patients (n:44) and patients with no previous recurrent miscarriage (n:60) as control group. Demographical parameters and routine blood parameters (fibrinogen, D-dimer, fibrinogen to albumin ratio (FAR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet count, main platelet volume (MPV), and red cell distribution width (RDW) values) were compared between the RPL group and the control group. RESULTS The groups were determined to be statistically different in regards to gravidity and parity (p<0.001). The difference between the groups was statistically different in regards to fibrinogen (mg/dl), albumin (g/dl), FAR (%), NLR (%), RDW-coefficient of variation (CV) (%), RDW-standard deviation (SD) (fL), and platelet counts (10-3 / uL). However, MPV (fL) and D-dimer (ug/L) levels were similar in both groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the NLR levels were 84.1% sensitive and 75% specific with a cut-off value of 4.27 and the FAR levels were 79.5% sensitive and 88.3% specific with a cut-off value of 105.69 for predicting RPL.

However, the roughened surface does not always maintain stable fixation over a long period. In this study, a simple heat treatment at 600°C was performed on a commercially available dental Ti implant with grit-blasting/acid-etching, and its effect on mineralization capacity was assessed by examining apatite formation in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The as-purchased implant displayed a moderately roughened surface at the micrometer scale. Its surface was composed of titanium hydride accompanied by a small amount of alumina particles derived from the grit-blasting. Heat treatment transformed the titanium hydride into rutile without evidently changing the surface morphology. The immersion in SBF revealed that apatite formed on the heated implant at 7 days. Furthermore, apatite formed on the Ti rod surface within 1 day when the metal was subjected to acid and heat treatment without blasting. These indicate that apatite formation was conferred on the commercially available dental implant by simple heat treatment, although its induction period was slightly affected by alumina particles remaining on the implant surface. The heat-treated implant should achieve stronger and more stable bone bonding due to its apatite formation.","Ogura, Ayano; Yamaguchi, Seiji; Le, Phuc Thi Minh; Yamamoto, Kayoko; Omori, Michi; Inoue, Kazuya; Kato-Kogoe, Nahoko; Nakajima, Yoichiro; Nakano, Hiroyuki; Ueno, Takaaki; Yamada, Tomohiro; Mori, Yoshihide","Journal of biomedical materials research.

In addition, two of the three cellular eIF2alpha kinases known to be virus induced, protein kinase R (PKR) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), were activated by SARS-CoV. The third kinase, general control nonderepressible-2 kinase (GCN2), was not activated, but late in infection the level of GCN2 protein was significantly reduced. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that the reduction of GCN2 protein was not due to decreased transcription or stability of GCN2 mRNA. The specific reduction of PKR protein expression by antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers strongly reduced cleavage of PARP in infected cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of PKR neither enhanced SARS-CoV replication nor abrogated SARS-CoV-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with beta interferon prior to SARS-CoV infection led to a significant decrease in PERK activation, eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and SARS-CoV replication. The various effects of beta interferon treatment were found to function independently on the expression of PKR. Our results show that SARS-CoV infection activates PKR and PERK, leading to sustained eIF2alpha phosphorylation. However, virus replication was not impaired by these events, suggesting that SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2alpha on viral mRNA translation. Furthermore, our data suggest that viral activation of PKR can lead to apoptosis via a pathway that is independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation.","Krähling, Verena; Stein, David A; Spiegel, Martin; Weber, Friedemann; Mühlberger, Elke",Journal of virology,143,31

At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 5 million people worldwide. A key step in understanding the pathobiology of the SARS-CoV-2 was the identification of -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into host cells. ACE2 is an established component of the 'protective arm' of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) that opposes ACE/angiotensin II (ANG II) pressor and tissue remodelling actions. Identification of ACE2 as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into cells quickly focused attention on the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease given that these pharmacological agents upregulate ACE2 expression in target cells. ACE2 is cleaved from the cells by metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17. Steroid hormone receptors regulate multiple components of the RAAS and may contribute to the observed variation in the incidence of severe COVID-19 between men and women, and in patients with pre-existing endocrine-related disease. Moreover, glucocorticoids play a critical role in the acute and chronic management of inflammatory disease, independent of any effect on RAAS activity. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has emerged as a life-saving treatment in severe COVID-19. This review will examine the endocrine mechanisms that control ACE2 and discusses the impact of therapies targeting the RAAS, glucocorticoid and other endocrine systems for their relevance to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the treatment and recovery from COVID-19-related critical illness.","Young, Morag J; Clyne, Colin D; Chapman, Karen E",The Journal of endocrinology,143,30

Non-diabetic HnrnpfRT KO mice develop hypertension, renal interstitial fibrosis and glycosuria with no renoprotective effect from downregulated Sglt2 expression. Here, we investigated the effect of renal tubular Hnrnpf deletion on hyperfiltration and kidney injury in Akita mice, a model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice were generated through crossbreeding tubule-specific (Pax8)-Cre mice with Akita floxed-Hnrnpf mice on a C57BL/6 background. Male non-diabetic control (Ctrl), Akita, and Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice were studied up to the age of 24 weeks (n = 8/group). RESULTS Akita mice exhibited elevated systolic blood pressure as compared with Ctrl mice, which was significantly higher in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice than Akita mice. Compared with Akita mice, Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice had lower blood glucose levels with increased urinary glucose excretion. Akita mice developed kidney hypertrophy, glomerular hyperfiltration (increased glomerular filtration rate), glomerulomegaly, mesangial expansion, podocyte foot process effacement, thickened glomerular basement membranes, renal interstitial fibrosis and increased albuminuria. These abnormalities were attenuated in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice. Treatment of Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice with a selective A1 adenosine receptor inhibitor resulted in an increase in glomerular filtration rate. Renal Agt expression was elevated in Akita mice and further increased in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice. In contrast, Sglt2 expression was increased in Akita and decreased in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice.

DESIGN We performed a laboratory study to assess the ability of 2 commercially available portable GUV devices to inactivate 2 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on the surface of whole N95 respirators and coupons cut from those respirators. We experimentally contaminated N95 respirators with coronavirus cultures and then assessed viral inactivation after GUV exposure by plaque assay, the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS We found that GUV could efficiently inactivate coronaviruses on the surface of N95 masks, with an average reduction in viral titers of 5-log for HCoV-229E, 3-log for HCoV-OC43, and 5-log for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the GUV susceptibility of HCoV-229E was similar on coupons and whole N95 respirators. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that diverse human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are susceptible to GUV inactivation, and 2 scalable portable GUV devices were effective in inactivating coronaviruses on N95 respirators. Thus, GUV treatment with commercially scalable devices may be an effective method to decontaminate PPE, allowing their safe reuse.","Camargo, Carolina; Lupien, Andréanne; McIntosh, Fiona; Menzies, Dick; Behr, Marcel A; Sagan, Selena M",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,143,19

To support a guideline on COVID-19 management, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory viral infections. METHODS In March 2020, we searched international and Chinese biomedical literature databases, clinical trial registries and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies comparing patients receiving and not receiving convalescent plasma. We included patients with acute coronavirus, influenza and Ebola virus infections. We conducted a meta-analysis using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS Of 1099 unique records, 6 studies were eligible, and none of these included patients with COVID-19. One nonrandomized study (n = 40) on convalescent plasma in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) provided uninformative results regarding mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 0.01 to 1.70). Pooled estimates from 4 RCTs on influenza (n = 572) showed no convincing effects on deaths (4 RCTs, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.81), complete recovery (2 RCTs, odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.64) or length of stay (3 RCTs, mean difference -1.62, 95% CI -3.82 to 0.58, d). The quality of evidence was very low for all efficacy outcomes. Convalescent plasma caused few or no serious adverse events in influenza RCTs (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.29, low-quality evidence). INTERPRETATION Studies of non- COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections provide indirect, very low-quality evidence that raises the possibility that convalescent plasma has minimal or no benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 and low-quality evidence that it does not cause serious adverse events.","Devasenapathy, Niveditha; Ye, Zhikang; Loeb, Mark; Fang, Fang; Najafabadi, Borna Tadayon; Xiao, Yingqi; Couban, Rachel; Bégin, Philippe; Guyatt, Gordon",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,143,16

In addition, there are several misinterpretations that surround the presence and environmental impact of plastics in the oceans and, consequently, human health, that require much more critical and scientific thinking. This short communication aims at unveiling any existing misconceptions and attempts to place this global challenge within its real magnitude, based either on scientific facts or nuances.

RECENT FINDINGS New classification criteria for childhood vasculitis have recently been proposed and are currently undergoing validation. Infectious triggers are still implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of Kawasaki disease and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Several genetic polymorphisms in vasculitides have now been described that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents. However, new challenges are looming with regard to the role of inflammation in endothelial health and the long-term cardiovascular morbidity for children with primary systemic vasculitis. SUMMARY As our understanding of disease pathogenesis in vasculitis of the young has advanced, novel therapeutic approaches have been adapted. International multicentre collaboration is of great importance to further increase and standardize the scientific base of investigating and treating childhood vasculitis.","Eleftheriou, Despina; Dillon, Michael J; Brogan, Paul A",Current opinion in rheumatology,143,31

The American Heart Association (AHA) promotes several important strategies associated with improved cardiac arrest outcomes, including decreasing pulse check time and maintaining a chest compression fraction (CCF) > 0.80. Video review is a potential tool to improve skills and analyze deficiencies in various situations, however its use in improving medical resuscitation remains poorly studied in the emergency department (ED). We implemented a quality improvement initiative, which utilized video review of cardiac arrest resuscitations in an effort to improve compliance with such AHA quality metrics. METHODS A cardiopulmonary resuscitation Video Review Team (CoVeRT) of emergency medicine residents were assembled to analyze CA resuscitations in our urban academic ED. Videos were reviewed by two residents, one of whom was a senior resident (PGY-3 or -4), and analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for numerous quality improvement metrics, including pulse check time, CCF, time to intravenous access, and time to patient attached to monitor. RESULTS We collected data on 94 cardiac arrest resuscitations between July 2017 and June 2020. Average pulse check time was 13.09 (SD ±5.97) seconds, and 38% of pulse checks were less than 10 seconds. After the implementation of the video review process, there was a significant decrease in average pulse check time (p=0.01) and a significant increase in CCF (p=0.01) throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the video review and feedback process was significantly associated with improvements in AHA quality metrics for resuscitation in CA among patients presented to the ED.","Brooks, J T; Pierce, A; McCarville, P; Sullivan, N; Rahimi-Saber, A; Payette, C; Popova, M; Koizumi, N; Pourmand, A; Yamane, D",International journal of clinical practice,143,1

As only 10 to 20% of affected individuals receive CRPs, there is concern for guideline adherence and knowledge dissemination to relevant medical specialties. This study aimed to characterize patterns of CRP utilization over time, across all United States regions, and by provider specialty. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis with time trends of CRP claims in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service Provider Utilization and Payment database, 2012 to 2017. SETTING National administrative claims data. PATIENTS Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. INTERVENTIONS Canalith repositioning procedures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES CRP utilization was analyzed by year, hospital referral region (HRR), and provider specialty. RESULTS From 2012 to 2017, 253,894 CRPs were performed on 146,139 Medicare beneficiaries and CRP utilization increased 80%. CRP use varied widely by geographic region. In 2017, CRP use per 100,000 beneficiaries varied 113-fold across HRRs (range, 6.0-701.8, interquartile range, 68.4, extremal ratio, 116.9). Most CRPs were performed by otolaryngologists (50.9%) and physical therapists (34.3%) with few by primary care providers (1.3%). CONCLUSIONS CRP utilization increased substantially suggesting improved dissemination and implementation of BPPV management guidelines. Nevertheless, wide geographic and provider-level variation remained, signifying non-uniform provider practices and access to care. Care for BPPV may thus be improved through education and incentivization of a broader range of providers.","Zuniga, Steven A; Marmor, Schelomo; Adams, Meredith E","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",143,24

We herein describe 12 recent cases with gastric SMT located in the greater curvature or anterior wall. The aim is to validate technical feasibility and safety of single-incision laparoscopic partial gastrectomy. Thus far, this is one of the largest series of patients with gastric SMT who underwent SILS. METHODS From July 2009 to April 2013, single-incision laparoscopic partial gastrectomy was attempted in 12 consecutive patients with gastric SMT. Three trocars were assembled in the umbilical incision, and the lesion was mobilized and staple-resected with endoscopic stapling devices. RESULTS SILS surgery was successfully completed without any additional trocars. The median operating time was 96.5 min, and median blood loss was 7.5 mL. The median tumor size was 30 mm, with histopathologic diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (10) and schwannoma (2). There was no immediate postoperative morbidity. During a median follow-up of 12 months, all patients were on full regular diet without any gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION SILS with transumbilical gastric stapling is a safe and practical alternative to conventional multiport laparoscopy in patients with gastric SMT, except for cases originating in the lesser curvature and close to the cardia/ pylorus.","Takata, Akihiro; Nakajima, Kiyokazu; Kurokawa, Yukinori; Takahashi, Tsuyoshi; Yamasaki, Makoto; Miyata, Hiroshi; Takiguchi, Shuji; Mori, Masaki; Doki, Yuichiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,143,16

No data exist on the effects of lockdowns on the health status of patients affected by chronic pathologies, specifically those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our study aims to establish variations across the psychological and cognitive profile of patients during the isolation period in Italy, in a cohort of patients affected by COPD, between February and May 2020. Forty patients with established COPD were comprehensively evaluated by geriatric multidimensional assessment before the spread of the epidemic in Italy, and submitted to a second evaluation during the subsequent lockdown. We assessed functional ability, basic and instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL and IADL), cognition and mood status. We compared the scores obtained at baseline against those obtained during the pandemic, and used mean differences for correlation with major clinical and functional indexes. The score differences from MMSE, ADL and IADL were statistically significant. Such differences were correlated to the presence of a caregiver and to the total number of family members living together. Remarkably, the loneliness dimension, more than the restrictions themselves, seemed to represent the major determinant of altered health status and depressed psycho-cognitive profile in our population. Also remarkably, we detected no correlation between the score variation and the respiratory function indexes of disease severity. The isolation measures adopted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have triggered the classic clinical string associated to geriatric isolation, which leads to a deterioration of cognitive functions, independence and frailty levels in a population affected by a chronic degenerative disease, such as COPD. If considered from a multidimensional geriatric point of view, the individual benefit of isolation measures could be small or non-existent.","Scarlata, Simone; Cardaci, Vittorio; Santangelo, Carmen; Matarese, Maria; Cesari, Matteo; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele",COPD,143,17

This is a rare complication after a conventional abdominoperineal resection (APR). However, the risk of a PH may be increased after a laparoscopic resection because this technique can cause fewer postoperative adhesions, predisposing the small bowel to sliding down toward the pelvis. However, only a few case reports describe the transperineal approach for the repair of a PH after a laparoscopic APR. We present a case of a PH after a laparoscopic APR; the PH was repaired with synthetic mesh by using a transperineal approach. A transperineal approach using a mesh to reconstruct the pelvic floor is less invasive and more effective. We suggest that this technique should probably be the first choice for treating an uncomplicated PH that occurs after a laparoscopic APR.","Lee, Taek-Gu; Lee, Sang-Jeon",Annals of coloproctology,143,26

METHODS Between January 2005 and July 2009, 93 patients underwent surgical treatment of paraesophageal hernia, including 8 recurrent cases after multiple repairs. Open transabdominal surgeries were performed in 14 (15%) patients, and combined thoracotomy was performed in 1 (1%). Laparoscopic surgeries were performed in 78 (84%) patients with 4 (5%) conversions. Artificial prosthetics were used in 27 (29%) patients. Fundoplication was performed in 82 (88%) patients. Gastropexy or feeding tube gastrostomy was performed in 10 (11%) patients. RESULTS The average length of the surgery was 125 minutes (range, 51-304 min). The mean blood loss was 100 mL. The average length of stay was 4 days (range, 1-14 d). There were 2 mortalities (2%) and 4 re-operations, with a recurrence rate of 2%.

Children aged 28 days-18 years requiring imaging to rule out limb DVT, as per the treating clinical team, were enrolled in the study. The outcome was ultrasound proven DVT. D-dimer levels were obtained around the time of imaging. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression models were used for data analyses. In total, 296 patients were enrolled between 2017-2020; 204 patients were diagnosed with DVT [DVT(+)]. Median D-dimer levels were 2.3 μg/mL FEU (25th -75th percentile 0.9-3.9) among DVT(+) and 1.9 μg/mL FEU (25th -75th percentile 0.8-4.0) among DVT(-) patients (p=0.60). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.59]. The odds ratio for D-dimer levels was 1.00 (95 % CI 0.99-1.01), holding confounders constant. In a sub-group exploratory analysis including 23 patients with no underlying conditions or co-morbidities, the AUC curve was 0.90 (95% CI 0.76-1.00). In this prospective cohort study of consecutive children with suspected limb DVT, D-dimer levels had poor discriminative and predictive ability for DVT. However, D-dimer levels showed better discriminative and predictive ability for DVT in an exploratory sample of patients with no underlying conditions or co-morbidities at the time of diagnosis.

These fragile aneurysms have the propensity to rupture with minimal manipulation, which makes them hazardous and difficult to treat. The present study evaluated the safety and feasibility of endovascular treatment of BBAs with the Willis covered stent. MATERIALS Thirteen patients (7 men and 6 women, age range 28-68 years) who presented with ruptured BBAs and were treated with the Willis covered stent were retrospectively reviewed. Results of the procedures and treatment-related complications were recorded. Angiographic and clinical follow-ups were performed 4-6 months after the procedure. RESULTS Placement of the covered stent was successful in all patients. Immediate angiography showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 12 patients while one patient showed a mild endoleak. This high rate of aneurysm exclusion ensured the security of postoperative antiplatelet treatment. Occlusion of the ophthalmic artery occurred in two patients and occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery occurred in one patient; however, none of them showed acute or delayed clinical symptoms. Thrombosis, aneurysm rupture, and other complications did not develop in any case. Angiographic follow-up showed complete aneurysm exclusion without aneurysm recurrence in any patients. Only two patients showed asymptomatic mild to moderate in-stent stenosis. All patients had satisfactory clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score ≤1). CONCLUSIONS Willis covered stent implementation may be safe and feasible for BBAs. This strategy might be a promising option for this high-risk type of aneurysm.","Fang, Chun; Tan, Hua-Qiao; Han, Hong-Jie; Feng, Hao; Xu, Ji-Chong; Yan, Shuo; Nie, Zhi-Yu; Jin, Ling-Jing; Teng, Fei",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,143,7

Genomic surveillance continues to be a critical effort toward tracking the virus and containing its spread, and more genomes from diverse geographical areas and different time points are needed to provide an appropriate representation of the virus evolution. In this study, we report the successful assembly of one single gapless, unambiguous contiguous sequence representing the complete viral genome from a nasopharyngeal swab of an infected health care worker in Cairo, Egypt. The sequence has all typical features of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with no protein-disrupting mutations. However, three mutations are worth highlighting and future tracking: a synonymous mutation causing a rare spike S813I variation and two less frequent ones leading to an A41V variation in NSP3, encoded by ORF1a (ORF1a A895V), and a Q677H variation in the spike protein. Both affected proteins, S and NSP3, are relevant to vaccine and drug development. Although the genome, named CU_S3, belongs to the prevalent global genotype, marked by the D614G spike variation, the combined variations in the spike proteins and ORF1a do not co-occur in any of the 197,000 genomes reported to date.

The highest mortality rate is observed among the older adult population. During the first wave of the pandemic (March-June 2020), following a national health decree demanding that no visitors or family members be allowed in health institutions, our geriatric rehabilitation center closed gates to all visitors from the outside. We aimed to assess the rehabilitation outcomes of older patients with hip fractures in the first pandemic wave, who underwent rehabilitation under complete social isolation from primary care givers and family members. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. It took place at a university-affiliated, major postacute geriatric rehabilitation center. Rehabilitation outcomes measured were discharge functional independence measure (FIM) score and motor FIM score, FIM score change, motor FIM score change, favorable motor FIM effectiveness, length of stay, discharge destination, and home aid at discharge. RESULTS The study group included 36 patients who were admitted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020). The control group comprises 106 individuals with hip fractures who were admitted in the respective time periods during the previous 2 years, that is, March 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, and March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019. The facility's occupancy rates were much lower during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with previous years (78 and 99%, respectively). Patients showed similar demographics and comorbidities, but the social isolation group was more severely deconditioned upon admission. All rehabilitation outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION According to the findings of this retrospective study, social isolation from family and caregivers did not have a detrimental effect on the rehabilitation outcomes of these patients.

Such neonates suffer from complications of prolonged hypotension and extended therapy with VI. ELBW infants with refractory hypotension (RH) are clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from those who respond to VI. OBJECTIVE Early identification and differentiation of ELBW infants susceptible to steroid dependent hypotension from those who respond to inotropic medications. METHODS In a retrospective study the ante- and postnatal clinical characteristics of ELBW infants who received hydrocortisone (HC) for refractory hypotension (RH) were compared to those who responded to volume-inotropes (VI). RESULTS Infants in HC group had lower birth weight (BW, 675±121g) and gestational age (GA, 25.1±1.3weeks) and higher mean airway pressure and oxygen requirements, all independent of antenatal steroid (ANS) exposure. The receipt of ANS (p 0.01) and occurrences of maternal diabetes mellitus (GDM, p 0.01) were lower in HC group. ANS (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.9, p 0.01) and GDM (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.09-0.9, p 0.04) reduced the risk for RH. HC group had higher risk for IVH (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.02-4.2 p=0.04) which declined in the multivariate analysis. A trend towards lower risk of ventriculomegaly (VM) was noted in HC group (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.1), which became significant after controlling for BW (OR 0.2 95% CI 0.07-0.9, p 0.04). Similar trend was noted for maternal hypertension. CONCLUSION Hypotension in ELBW infants who are ≤25wks of GA and unexposed to ANS and GDM is refractory to VI therapy. Such neonates may benefit from an initial therapy with, or earlier institution of hydrocortisone. The trend towards a higher risk for VM with VI therapy needs validation in future studies.","Verma, Rita P; Dasnadi, Shaeequa; Zhao, Yuan; Chen, Hegang H",Early human development,143,24

Incomplete understanding of the fundamental biological aspects of osteoarthritis underlies the current lack of effective treatment or disease modifying drugs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We implemented a systems approach by making use of the statistical network concepts in Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis to reconstruct the organisation of the core proteome network in chondrocytes obtained from OA patients and healthy individuals. Protein modules reflect groups of tightly co-ordinated changes in protein abundance across healthy and OA chondrocytes. RESULTS The unbiased systems analysis identified extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanosensing and glycolysis as two modules that are most highly correlated with ΟΑ. The ECM module was enriched in the OA genetic risk factors tenascin-C (TNC) and collagen 11A1 (COL11A1), as well as in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a biomarker associated with cartilage integrity. Mapping proteins that are unique to OA or healthy chondrocytes onto the core interactome, which connects microenvironment sensing and regulation of glycolysis, identified differences in metabolic and anti-inflammatory adaptation. CONCLUSION The interconnection between cartilage ECM remodeling and metabolism is indicative of the dynamic chondrocyte states and their significance in osteoarthritis.","Destouni, Aspasia; Tsolis, Konstantinos C; Economou, Anastassios; Papathanasiou, Ioanna; Balis, Charalampos; Mourmoura, Evanthia; Tsezou, Aspasia",Expert review of proteomics,143,5

METHODS Health care workers (801) from designated COVID-19 hospitals (400) and non-COVID-19 facilities (401) underwent an electrochemiluminescent automated immunoassay for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Details including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms compatible with COVID-19, contact with COVID-19 individuals, personal protective equipment use at work, and details of polymerase chain reaction tests were collected through a validated questionnaire. RESULTS Doctors (201, 25.1%), nurses (308, 38.5%), and ancillary workers (292, 36.5%) participated in the study. Seroprevalence in 801 participants was 11.1% (9.1% to 13.5%). It was significantly higher ancillary workers (18.5%, 14.5% to 23.3%) than doctors (7%, 4.2% to 11.4%) and nurses (6.8%, 4.5% to 10.2%). Seroprevalence was significantly higher in non-COVID-19 hospitals (13.5%, 10.5% to 17.2%) than COVID-19 hospitals (8.7%, 6.3% to 11.9%). Having a COVID-19 household contact was a significant risk for seropositivity (18.9% vs 10.3%), while a neighborhood contact did not affect seropositivity (9.4% vs 7.3%). Loss of taste/smell and fever were only 2 symptoms associated with seropositivity. Comorbidities did not affect the seropositivity rate. CONCLUSION Seropositivity was likely to be higher in ancillary workers and in non-COVID hospitals. There is need to enhance COVID protection protocols and awareness among all health care workers.","Kumar, Nishant; Bhartiya, Shibal; Desai, Shashank; Mutha, Amit; Beldar, Amit; Singh, Tarundeep",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,143,1

The authors investigated the frequency of respiratory virus detection in the upper airways of febrile neutropenic children with negative bacterial cultures. METHODS This is a 3-year prospective study of children younger than 19 years, hospitalized with febrile neutropenia and negative bacterial cultures. Respiratory samples were obtained for amplification of viral nucleic acids via Luminex xTAG technology. RESULTS There were 50 febrile neutropenic episodes among 42 patients. Respiratory viruses were detected in 26 (52%) febrile episodes. A single virus was detected in 22 febrile episodes; multiple viruses were detected in the remaining 4. Rhinovirus/Enterovirus was most frequently detected. CONCLUSION Respiratory viruses were detected frequently in nasopharyngeal samples from febrile neutropenic patients with negative bacterial cultures, thus providing an impetus to determine the relationship between virus detection, infection, and pathology in this unique patient population.","Suryadevara, Manika; Tabarani, Christy M; Bartholoma, Nadine; Rosenberg, Helene F; Domachowske, Joseph B",Clinical pediatrics,143,31

METHODS From December 2010 to June 2011, a total of 28 patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y-esophagojejunostomy anastomosis with OrVil. Perioperative treatments, intraoperative data, postoperative complications and hospital length of stay were evaluated. RESULTS There were no conversions to the open gastrectomy. The mean operation time was 143 minutes and the mean blood loss was 70 ml. Patients resumed an oral liquid diet on postoperative days 4 to 5. Two patients (7%) who suffered postoperative aspiration pneumonia were cured by conservative treatment. The median hospital length of stay was 9.6 days (8 to 11 days), with no inhospital mortalities. The median follow-up time was 14.8 months (12 to 18 months), and postoperative endoscopic examination revealed no anastomosis stenosis in patients who had dysphagia.

We aim to compare diagnostic performance and inter-/intra-observer among chest radiologists in the interpretation of RSNA and CO-RADS reporting systems and assess clinician preference. METHODS Chest CT scans of 279 patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent RT-PCR testing were retrospectively and independently examined by 3 chest radiologists who assigned interpretation according to the RSNA and CO-RADS reporting systems. Inter-/intra-observer analysis was performed. Diagnostic accuracy of both reporting systems was calculated. 60 clinicians participated in a survey to assess end-user preference of the reporting systems. RESULTS Both systems demonstrated almost perfect inter-observer agreement (Fleiss kappa 0.871, P < 0.0001 for RSNA; 0.876, P < 0.0001 for CO-RADS impressions). Intra-observer agreement between the 2 scoring systems using the equivalent categories was almost perfect (Fleiss kappa 0.90-0.92, P < 0.001). Positive predictive values were high, 0.798-0.818 for RSNA and 0.891-0.903 CO-RADS. Negative predictive value were similar, 0.573-0.585 for RSNA and 0.573-0.58 for CO-RADS. Specificity differed between the 2 systems, 68-73% for CO-RADS and 52-58% for RSNA with superior specificity of CO-RADS. Of 60 survey participants, the majority preferred the RSNA reporting system rather than CO-RADS for all options provided (66.7-76.7%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS RSNA and CO-RADS reporting systems are consistent and reproducible with near perfect inter-/intra-observer agreement and excellent positive predictive value. End-users preferred the reporting language in the RSNA system.","O' Neill, Siobhan B; Byrne, Danielle; Müller, Nestor L; Jalal, Sabeena; Parker, William; Nicolaou, Savvas; Bilawich, Ana-Maria",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,143,1

Training in endoscopic skills is essential for ENT residents, and is especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown period. In such difficult times, ENT residents and surgeons can undergo hands-on training using a papaya petiole, even within their homes. OBJECTIVE Endoscopic ear surgery training can be carried out using a papaya petiole, enabling the practice of grommet insertion, tympanomeatal flap elevation and foreign body removal from the external auditory canal. This model does not need any laboratory setup. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The hollow structure of the papaya petiole model is very similar to that of the external auditory canal, making training in endoscopic ear surgery easy. Use of the model helps a beginner to train in endoscopic handling and microsurgical instrumentation, and improves depth perception. In addition, it does not require high-end facilities to store equipment or undertake the training at any given point in time.","Narendrakumar, V",The Journal of laryngology and otology,143,31

If this checkup is the only screening opportunity, women who do not attend or whose depressive episode occurs at a different time may not be identified. We evaluated women's encounters with postpartum health care to identify screening opportunities for postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS). Materials and Methods: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data for 2012-2015 from eight jurisdictions (n = 23,990, representing 1,939,865 women) were used to calculate percentage of women reporting attendance at postpartum checkups, well-child visits, or postpartum home visitation, by presence of PDS. PDS were assessed using a modified two-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Using Modified Poisson regression, adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare health services by PDS, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Almost all women with or without PDS attended a postpartum checkup (85.1% and 91.4%; aPR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99) and their infants attended a well-child visit (97.3% and 98.9%; aPR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00); 13.7% and 10.9% received home visitation (aPR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02-1.35). Of women with PDS who missed their postpartum checkup, 13.5% reported infant attendance at well-child visits, and 2.0% received home visitation. Of women with PDS, 98.8%, 86.1%, and 11.2% attended 1, 2, or 3 health services. Conclusion: A large percentage of women with PDS may attend well-child visits or receive home visitation, representing opportunities for depression screening and referral for care.","Haight, Sarah C; Ko, Jean Y; Yogman, Michael W; Farr, Sherry L",Journal of women's health,143,10

Pregnant rats were given subcutaneous injection of either saline, or leptin, or leptin plus xanthenone (ACE2 activator), or xanthenone (XTN) alone. SBP, serum ACE, ACE2, endothelin-1, E-selectin and ICAM-1 levels were estimated; also their gene expressions were determined in the kidney and aorta respectively. Compared to control, SBP was higher in the leptin-only treated group (P<0.001) and lower in rats treated with xanthenone alone (P<0.01). Proteinuria, markers of endothelial activation were significantly higher than controls in leptin-only treated rats (P<0.05). ACE2 activity and expression were lower in leptin-only treated rats when compared to controls (P<0.05). It seems, leptin administration during pregnancy significantly increases SBP, proteinuria, endothelial activation, but decreases ACE2 level and expression.

RECENT FINDINGS The difficulty of predicting time to death in dementia inhibits access to Medicare hospice benefits. Efforts have been made to create dementia-specific advance directives. Advance refusal of artificial nutrition and hydration are common, but the issue of oral ingestion of food and fluids by dementia patients remains controversial. Medicare's hospice benefit should be made more accessible to dementia patients. State advance directive threshold definitions should be broadened to include dementia, and capacitated persons who refuse in advance orally ingested food and fluids should have their choices honored.","Allen, William",Current psychiatry reports,143,16

If such microbes are active in karstic paddy soils, their activity would help increase soil organic carbon and mitigate As contamination. We therefore used gel-stabilized gradient systems to cultivate microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria from karstic paddy soil to investigate their capacity for Fe(II) oxidation, carbon fixation, and As sequestration. Stable isotope probing demonstrated the assimilation of inorganic carbon at a maximum rate of 8.02 mmol C m-2 d-1. Sequencing revealed that Bradyrhizobium, Cupriavidus, Hyphomicrobium, Kaistobacter, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, unclassified Phycisphaerales, and unclassified Opitutaceas were fixing carbon. Fe(II) oxidation produced Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides, which can absorb and/or coprecipitate As. Adding As(III) decreased the diversity of functional bacteria involved in carbon fixation, the relative abundance of predicted carbon fixation genes, and the amount of carbon fixed. Although the rate of Fe(II) oxidation was also lower in the presence of As(III), over 90% of the As(III) was sequestered after oxidation. The potential for microbially mediated As(III) oxidation was revealed by the presence of arsenite oxidase gene (aioA), denoting the potential of the Fe(II)-oxidizing and autotrophic microbial community to also oxidize As(III). Thisstudy demonstrates that carbon fixation coupled to Fe(II) oxidation can increase the carbon content in soils by microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, as well as accelerate As(III) oxidation and sequester it in association with Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides.","Tong, Hui; Zheng, Chunju; Li, Bing; Swanner, Elizabeth D; Liu, Chengshuai; Chen, Manjia; Xia, Yafei; Liu, Yuhui; Ning, Zengping; Li, Fangbai; Feng, Xinbin",Environmental science & technology,143,1

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of rectal ESD in North America. Methods This is a multicenter retrospective analysis of rectal ESD between January 2010 and September 2018 in 15 centers. End points included: rates of en bloc resection, R0 resection, adverse events, comparison of pre- and post-ESD histology, and factors associated with failed resection. Results In total, 171 patients (median age 63 years; 56 % men) underwent rectal ESD (median size 43 mm). En bloc resection was achieved in 141 cases (82.5 %; 95 %CI 76.8-88.2), including 24 of 27 (88.9 %) with prior failed endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). R0 resection rate was 74.9 % (95 %CI 68.4-81.4). Post-ESD bleeding and perforation occurred in 4 (2.3 %) and 7 (4.1 %), respectively. Covert submucosal invasive cancer (SMIC) was identified in 8.6 % of post-ESD specimens. There was one case (1/120; 0.8 %) of recurrence at a median follow-up of 31 weeks; IQR: 19-76 weeks). Older age and higher body mass index (BMI) were predictors of failed R0 resection, whereas submucosal fibrosis was associated with a higher likelihood of both failed en bloc and R0 resection. Conclusion Rectal ESD in North America is safe and is associated with high en bloc and R0 resection rates. The presence of submucosal fibrosis was the main predictor of failed en bloc and R0 resection. ESD can be considered for select rectal lesions, and serves not only to establish a definitive tissue diagnosis but also to provide curative resection for lesions with covert advanced disease.","Yang, Dennis; Aihara, Hiroyuki; Perbtani, Yaseen B; Wang, Andrew Y; Aadam, Abdul Aziz; Tomizawa, Yutaka; Hwang, Joo Ha; Zou, Baiming; Natov, Nikola S; Siegel, Amanda; Khoshknab, Milad Pourmousavi; Khashab, Mouen A; Ngamruengphong, Saowanee; Khara, Harshit S; Diehl, David L; Maniere, Thibaut; Andrawes, Sherif; Benias, Petros; Kumta, Nikhil A; Ramay, Fariha; Kim, Raymond E; Samarasena, Jason; Chang, Kenneth; Hashimoto, Rintaro; Tharian, Benjamin; Inamdar, Sumant; Lan, Gloria; Sethi, Amrita; Nosler, Michael J; Tabash, Abdalaziz; Othman, Mohamed O; Draganov, Peter V",Endoscopy international open,143,24

We aimed to determine the usefulness of videolaryngoscopy during NIV for identifying mechanisms and sites of obstruction and for providing a guide for their resolution in difficult-to-titrate subjects. METHODS When obstructions during NIV were present in the built-in software, EPAP was raised to 12 cm H2O. If obstructions persisted, a polygraphy during NIV was performed; if the events occurred with effort, a videolaryngoscopy with nasal and oronasal masks in awake subjects was performed. RESULTS In a population of 208 subjects in whom NIV was initiated, 13 were identified as difficult to titrate with persistent obstructions during NIV despite an EPAP of 12 cm H2O. Videolaryngoscopy during NIV was able to identify the mechanism and the site of obstruction in all cases. The obstruction under oronasal mask ventilation was due to soft-palate (velum) collapse in 4 subjects, to epiglottic backward movement in 5 other subjects, and to tongue-base obstruction reducing the retroglossal space in 3 more. Videolaryngoscopy during NIV demonstrated improvement in 9 subjects (69%) upon changing to nasal mask and suggested a possible surgical approach in 2 (15%); in one of these 2 subjects, a successful uvulopalatopharyngoplasty was performed. CONCLUSIONS The use of videolaryngoscopy during NIV in difficult-to-titrate patients may help to identify the sites and mechanisms of obstruction and in some cases may improve quality of ventilation.","Sayas Catalán, Javier; Jiménez Huerta, Ignacio; Benavides Mañas, Pedro; Luján, Manel; López-Padilla, Daniel; Arias Arias, Eva; Hernández Voth, Ana; Rabec, Claudio",Respiratory care,143,25

Surgical resection and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are defined as the main treatments but cannot cure patients with advanced GIST, which eventually develops into recurrence and acquired drug resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to identify prognostic biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for GISTs. CC chemokine receptor type 8 (CCR8) protein participates in regulation of immune responses. Recent studies on CCR8 in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer showed that it was highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells and correlated with a poor prognosis. AIM To detect CCR8 expression in GIST tissues and analyze its relationships with clinicopathological features and prognosis in patients with GISTs. METHODS Tissue samples were used for the tissue microarrays construction. The microarrays were then subjected to immunohistochemical analyses to detect CCR8 expression. Next, Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to calculate the survival rate of patients with complete follow-up data, and the potential prognostic value of CCR8 was evaluated by Cox regression analysis. Finally, a Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes single-gene enrichment chart of CCR8 was constructed using the STRING database. RESULTS CCR8-positive signals were detected as brown or brown-yellow particles by immunohistochemistry located in the cytoplasm. Among 125 tissue samples, 74 had CCR8 high expression and 51 had low or negative expression. Statistical analyses suggested CCR8 was significantly correlated with tumor size, mitotic index, AFIP-Miettinen risk classification and tumor location. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses showed that patients with low or negative CCR8 expression, mitotic index < 5/high-power fields (HPF) and tumor diameter < 5 cm had a better prognosis. Based on the STRING database, CCR8 was significantly enriched in biological processes such as tumor immunity, T lymphocyte chemotaxis, migration and pathways like the nuclear factor-κB and tumor necrosis factor pathways as well as intestinal immune regulation networks. CONCLUSION CCR8 is a prognostic biomarker for malignant potential of GISTs, with high expression correlated with malignancy and poor prognosis.","Li, Huai-Liang; Wang, Lin-Hua; Hu, Yi-Lin; Feng, Ying; Li, Xiao-Hong; Liu, Yi-Fei; Li, Peng; Mao, Qin-Sheng; Xue, Wan-Jiang",World journal of gastroenterology,143,17

METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected consecutive intra-arterial therapies from October 2010 to March 2015 comparing OAC (vitamin-K antagonists and novel oral anticoagulants) versus normal hemostasis versus intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator patients. Primary safety end point is parenchymal hematoma. Secondary safety end point is 90-day mortality. Efficacy end points are successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, 2b-3) and good outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). Logistic regression for predictors of parenchymal hematoma was performed. RESULTS A total of 604 patients were qualified for the study. Baseline and outcomes variables were overall similar for vitamin-K antagonists (n=29) and novel oral anticoagulants (n=17) patients. When compared with normal hemostasis (n=265) and intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (n=297), OAC (n=46) patients were older and had more comorbidities. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of parenchymal hematoma (8% versus 5%; P=0.42), 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 (30% versus 40%; P=0.26), and 90-day mortality (32% versus 26%; P=0.46) among OAC and normal hemostasis patients. Similarly, there were no significant differences between OAC and intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator patients in terms of parenchymal hematoma (8% versus 4%; P=0.16), 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 (30% versus 43%; P=0.13), and 90-day mortality (32% versus 22%; P=0.18). The use of OAC was not associated with the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma on multivariate logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS Intra-arterial therapy seems to be safe in patients taking OACs; however, our study showed a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhage and mortality with a nonsignificant decrease in good outcomes in comparison with non-OAC patients. Although these nominal differences may have been related to older age and more comorbidities in the OAC group, larger studies are needed to confirm our findings given our limited sample size.","Rebello, Letícia C; Haussen, Diogo C; Belagaje, Samir; Anderson, Aaron; Frankel, Michael; Nogueira, Raul G",Stroke,143,11

STP can occur at several possible anatomic sites, such as dural sinuses, jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome), portal vein (pylephlebitis), and pelvic veins. Its high mortality in the preantibiotic era improved considerably with the introduction of modern antibiotics. However, little evidence exists to date to guide its clinical management. The incidence of STP or its risk factors may be increasing, and its mortality may still be considerable. These trends would have far-reaching implications, especially in the setting of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. No clinical assessment tools exist to support patient screening or guide treatment in STP. Few interventional studies exist on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation. Recommendations on its indications, duration, and the agents of choice are mostly based on evidence derived from small observational studies. While all forms of STP pose similar challenges, future research may benefit from the distinction between bacteria-associated, virus-associated, and mycosis-associated thrombophlebitis. Addressing these gaps in evidence would enhance our ability to diagnose this condition and treat patients effectively.","Valerio, Luca; Riva, Nicoletta",Hamostaseologie,143,13

We aim to evaluate the impact of the extent of Tmax>10 s CTP lesions in patients undergoing successful treatment. METHODS Retrospective database review of endovascular acute ischemic stroke treatment between September 2010 and March 2015 for patients with anterior circulation occlusions with baseline RAPID CTP and full reperfusion (mTICI 3). The primary outcome was the impact of the Tmax>10 s lesion spectrum on infarct growth. Secondary safety and efficacy outcomes included parenchymal hematomas and good clinical outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2). RESULTS Of 684 treated patients, 113 patients fit the inclusion criteria. Tmax>10 s>100 mL patients (n=37) had significantly higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (20.7±3.8 versus 17.0±5.9; P<0.01), more internal carotid artery terminus occlusions (29% versus 9%; P=0.02), and larger baseline (38.6±29.6 versus 11.7±15.8 mL; P<0.01) and final (60.7±60.0 versus 29.4±33.9 mL; P<0.01) infarct volumes when compared with patients without Tmax>10 s>100 mL (n=76); however, the 2 groups were otherwise well balanced. There were no significant differences in infarct growth (22.1±51.6 versus 17.8±32.4 mL; P=0.78), severe intracranial hemorrhage (PH2: 2% versus 4%; P=0.73), good outcomes (90-day mRS score, 0-2: 56% versus 59%; P=0.83), or 90-day mortality (16% versus 7%; P=0.28). On multivariate analysis, only baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.34; P<0.01) and baseline infarct core volume (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08; P<0.01) were independently associated with Tmax>10 s>100 mL. There was no association between Tmax>10 s>100 mL with any PH, good outcome, or infarct growth. CONCLUSIONS In the setting of limited baseline ischemic cores, large Tmax>10 s lesions on computed tomographic perfusion do not seem to be associated with a higher risk of parenchymal hematomas and do not preclude good outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular reperfusion with contemporary technology.","Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C; Dehkharghani, Seena; Rebello, Leticia C; Lima, Andrey; Bowen, Meredith; Belagaje, Samir; Anderson, Aaron; Frankel, Michael",Stroke,143,17

In this study, 25 phosphate bags are evenly distributed (5 × 5) with a length equal to 50 cm in a wooden box called the modified solar still (MSS). This system was compared with the conventional solar still (CSS) in the same climatic conditions. Phosphate bags are placed vertically to increase the energy storage capacity, and the water's surface area since the capillaries inside the phosphate bags play an important role in increasing the energy storage capacity. Experiments were conducted at El Oued University in Algeria during April and May 2020, with 1 cm and 2 cm of saltwater depth. The cumulative yield of 5.27 and 4.87 kg was produced from the MSS at 1 cm and 2 cm of saltwater, respectively, while the cumulative yield of the CSS was 3.8 kg. The MSS's overall efficiency at 1 cm and 2 cm of saltwater was enhanced by 28 and 22.5%, respectively compared with the CSS. The presence of calcium and copper in phosphate stores the heat energy during morning and afternoon, and stored heat energy was released during evening. Finally, it can be concluded that increasing phosphate bags significantly enhances the productivity in solar distillation, increasing efficiency and productivity.","Attia, Mohammed El Hadi; Driss, Zied; Kabeel, Abd Elnaby; Alagar, Karthick; Athikesavan, Muthu Manokar; Sathyamurthy, Ravishankar",Environmental science and pollution research international,143,22

Implementing service-focused activities that can be conducted by the students remotely can overcome these struggles. The goals of this study were to 1) implement citizen science activities focused on water quality using three commercially available low-cost test strips (2:1, 5:1, and 16:1) while teaching four undergraduate engineering courses at the University of Mississippi (UM) during a pandemic event, and 2) evaluate the acceptability and validate the results obtained. Eighty-five undergraduate students (citizen scientists) and five research scientists (control group) collected two water samples (with triplicates) after receiving detailed step-by-step written guidelines and video tutorials. One hundred twenty tap water samples were collected from private households across Lafayette County and its surrounding counties and multiple buildings on campus. Five laboratory fortified blank (LBF) samples were implemented to validate the results. While the academic background of the participants did not impact the results (p > 0.05), the results obtained using the different test strips were statistically different (p < 0.05). In fact, results obtained using the 2:1 and the 5:1 test strips were close to the LFBs, while, except for the higher concentration of Total Alkalinity (40 mg/L CaCO3), results obtained using the 16:1 test strips were significantly different than the LFBs. Results (in terms of pH, Nitrate, and Total Chlorine) obtained by the citizen scientists using the 2:1 and 5:1 test strips were consistent with those reported in the annual drinking water quality reports from UM and municipalities included in the investigated region. Overall, this activity was well received by the students. Approximately 75% of them agreed that this hands-on activity was a positive experience while struggling to attend face-to-face classes.","D'Alessio, Matteo; Rushing, Grace; Gray, Tiffany L",The Science of the total environment,143,1

In this study, we reported our current experience of thoracoscopic surgery using a new caudal position technique for anatomical lung resections and compared it with the standard anterior VATS technique. Methods From January 2016 to October 2017, 92 consecutive patients with lung cancer underwent VATS lobectomy. Among these, 34 patients were treated by conventional anterior three portal VATS lobectomy, and 58 patients were treated using the caudal three port VATS lobectomy. The mean operative time, conversion rate, hospital stay, post-operative drainage, reoperation, post operative pain were compared between each group. Results No differences between the two groups are showed in terms of surgical time, post-operative drainage, incidence of prolonged air leaks and post-operative pain. Conclusions The caudal approach to major pulmonary resection of thoracoscopic lobectomy results in a reliable and comfortable procedure for the surgeon. Once demonstrated the reliability of the VATS lobectomy with three accesses using the caudal position, we are starting to standardize biportal and uniportal VATS with the surgeon in the caudal position.","Dolci, Giampiero; Campisi, Alessio; Giunta, Domenica; Congiu, Stefano; Daddi, Niccolò; Murana, Giacomo; Dell'Amore, Andrea",Journal of visualized surgery,143,17

METHODS Between 2010 and 2018, a test for C. difficile was performed using faecal samples from 137 thoroughbred racehorses with colitis presenting with diarrhoea and fever. The mortality rate, clinical findings, predisposing factors and the selected treatments were investigated in a retrospective manner. RESULTS Twenty-four cases were diagnosed as CDAD and 113 as non-CDAD. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the CDAD group (83 per cent) than that in the non-CDAD group (34 per cent). The levels of serum amyloid A, blood urea nitrogen and packed cell volume at initial presentation were also significantly higher, and those of total protein and albumin were significantly lower in the CDAD group. The development of CDAD was associated with the administration of antimicrobials, surgery and hospitalisation. No significant improvement in mortality was observed for any of the selected treatment in both groups. CONCLUSION CDAD in thoroughbred racehorses was identified as a high mortality disease with rapid progression of systemic inflammation and deterioration of the circulatory state.

However, they require personnel and equipment resources, as well as valuable operating room (OR) time. A block room offers a dedicated environment to perform regional anesthesia procedures while potentially offsetting costs. METHODS The goal of this prospective quality improvement study was to develop a business case for implementation of a regional anesthesia block room and to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this program in decreasing OR time for TJA. All elective TJA patients presenting between January 2019 and March 2020 were included in our analysis. RESULTS Our detailed business plan was approved by the hospital leadership. 561 patients in the preintervention group and 432 in the postintervention group were included for data analysis. Mean total OR time per surgical case decreased from 166 to 143 min for a difference of 23 min (95% CI 17 to 29). Similarly, anesthesia controlled OR time decreased from 46 min to 26 min for a difference of 20 min (95% CI 17 to 22). The block room resulted in an additional primary TJA case per daily OR list. The percentage of TJA patients receiving a peripheral nerve block increased from 63.1% to 87.0% (p<0.001). No safety events or block room associated OR delays were observed. CONCLUSION Implementing a regional anesthesia block room required a comprehensive business plan for securing the necessary resources to support the program.

METHODS A systematic review used MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify published literature from 2005 to 2016 addressing how stakeholders-patients, caregivers, and others-assisted researchers conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research. Three pairs of Workgroup members screened titles and abstracts to select articles for full-text review and analysis. Two Workgroup members abstracted the following data: research focus, characterization and role of stakeholders, and type(s) of engagement strategy employed. Data were summarized descriptively. RESULTS We identified 5717 references for abstract screening. Of these, 69 met the criteria for full-text screening, and 11 were selected for data abstraction. Of these 11 studies, seven focused on the development of a research agenda and eight had stakeholders react or advise on an aspect of the study. Although patients were the most commonly identified stakeholders, advocacy groups and health care professionals were also frequently identified. Some studies reported the engagement of other stakeholders, including local government or policy experts. Engagement strategies varied, with five studies using more than one strategy. Studies often did not indicate the involvement of stakeholders in developing the study design or with implementation.

Surgical resection is recommended for leiomyomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the colon. We present a case in which we performed laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intraabdominal anastomosis for treating leiomyoma of the transverse colon in a patient with an abdominal mesh. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 64-year-old woman with a history of right subtotal adrenalectomy and right mastectomy was incidentally found to have an abdominal mass on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan, which was confirmed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the mesentery following abdominal contrast-enhanced CT. We planned surgical resection for preoperative diagnosis because the tumor was >5 cm in diameter. However, she had undergone transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap reconstruction after right mastectomy, in which the TRAM flap was replaced with an abdominal mesh; hence, total laparoscopic surgery was performed to avoid damaging the mesh owing to the risk of mesh infection. Laparotomy revealed that the tumor originated from the transverse colon; thus, transverse colectomy with intraabdominal anastomosis was performed. The total operative time and blood loss were 3 h 32 min and 5 mL, respectively. No postoperative leakage or mesh infection was observed. The resected specimen revealed a leiomyoma without malignancy. DISCUSSION We successfully performed colectomy that minimized the resection range and intraabdominal anastomosis. CONCLUSION Total laparoscopic surgery was effective for colonic leiomyoma with an abdominal mesh to avoid mesh-related complications.","Fujimoto, Goshi; Osada, Shunichi",International journal of surgery case reports,143,1

These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public's reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks, and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases. These results have important implications for ongoing vaccine distribution efforts worldwide.","Hartnett, Gavin S.; Parker, Edward; Gulden, Timothy R.; Vardavas, Raffaele; Kravitz, David",,143,5

We feel that it may be useful for personal use and prescreening large masses of population for such viruses. We estimate the mass of a virus particle as 0,5 fg and determine the mass sensitivity and limit of detection of a typical calibrated 434 MHz RSAW QSM as 19,7 kHz/ng and 11 pg (22 average virus particles), respectively. Thus, the QSM provides at least 3 orders of magnitude higher mass sensitivity and lower limit of detection than the classical QCM. Furthermore, using protein particles simulating the presence of the coronavirus in human breath, we show experimentally that the QSM can successfully detect such particles and measure their concentration. © 2021 IEEE.","Avramov, I.

With the development of data-independent technologies (DIA/SWATH-MS), it is now possible to analyze hundreds of samples with great reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. However, this technology benefits from empirically derived spectral libraries that define the detectable set of peptides and proteins. Here we apply a simple and accessible tip-based workflow for the generation of spectral libraries to provide a comprehensive overview on the plasma proteome in individuals with and without active tuberculosis (TB). To boost protein coverage, we utilized non-conventional proteases such as GluC and AspN together with the gold standard trypsin, identifying more than 30,000 peptides mapping to 3,309 proteins. Application of this library to quantify plasma proteome differences in TB infection recovered more than 400 proteins in 50 minutes of MS-acquisition, including diagnostic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins that have previously been detectable primarily by antibody-based assays and intracellular proteins not previously described to be in plasma.","Fossati, Andrea; Richards, Alicia L.; Chen, Kuei-Ho; Jaganath, Devan; Cattamanchi, Adithya; Ernst, Joel D.; Swaney, Danielle L.",bioRxiv,143,16

In this approach, the enterprise acts as a coordinator and broker to organize the residents of informal settlements to regularize their settlements by negotiating buyouts of the underlying private owners at discounted values, handling titling and registration of the occupants, and coordinating with municipal governments to provide infrastructure. The analysis of parcel-level repayment and price data provides evidence of the sustainability of the business model and increase of property values of the regularized parcels. The results presented from the enterprise’s own repayment data demonstrate that under (non-pandemic) historical conditions residents are largely able to pay an affordable monthly payment over 7–10 years to the enterprise for the service to purchase the plots and maintain the enterprise. In operation since 2001, the enterprise has regularized over 20,000 parcels in more than 30 settlements, primarily in the cities of Sao Paolo and Curitiba in Brazil. The approach suggests that it could be widely replicable and add to the set of options for regularizing informal settlements, especially when purchase of private land is required.","Childress, Malcolm Carter Selina Barki Edgard",Land,143,20

Majority of the dental procedures produce droplets and aerosols in a dental practice. In this context, the standard protective measures are not enough in the daily dental practice during this pandemic. Dental professionals, students in particular should be aware of the main symptoms of COVID-19, its mode of transmission and precautions to be adopted in the dental practice so as to break the chain of infection. The purpose of the study was to investigate the perception regarding COVID-19 among the dental students of a dental teaching institution in Bangalore city. METHODS An online questionnaire was created to assess the perception about COVID-19 among dental students. Total enumeration method was followed, and undergraduates, interns and post graduate students of a tertiary care dental hospital participated in the online survey. chi-square goodness of fit test was used to compare the differences in the distribution of respondents and independent chi-square test was used to do the comparison in the difference of responses towards the study questionnaire between the students studying in different undergraduate years;with level of significance set at P &lt; 0.05. RESULTS About 380 dental students participated in the online survey;correct response rate was slightly higher among clinical dental students than pre-clinical students. Educational and training programmes related to COVID-19, infection control and practices were implemented at the institution for the dental professionals in the academic level. CONCLUSIONS The perception about COVID-19 among pre-clinical dental students were slightly lower than the clinical students.","Johnson, N.; Somasundara, Y. S.; Bhat, P.

The thematic analysis shows that the callers make sense of the crisis linked to social relations on a personal, anonymous, and abstract level . The callers' responses to chal-lenges to their everyday routines – adjustment or critical evaluation – are connected to different approaches to trust: basic trust in a shared social reality with someone or regulating trust in a set of norms independent from that other . Whereas the calls demonstrate very few positive adjustments in personal relations, they show that anonymous and abstract relations serve as im-portant resources for both maintaining and re-evaluating everyday life during a crisis . Although older people's lack of secure personal relations during the pandemic points to vulnerability, their resourcefulness is apparent in their active engagement in important anonymous and abstract relations.","Iversen, Clara Redmalm David Flinkfeldt Marie Persson Marcus",Sociologisk Forskning,143,1

Senegal, in particular, has been noted for its relative success in mitigating the spread and impact of COVID-19. We report original research findings on COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults. Methods: A multi-modal cross-sectional study was conducted to describe COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults and to identify potential predictors of prevention behaviors. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were generated to describe the sample and explore potential correlations. Results: Mask wearing, hand washing, and use of hand sanitizer were most frequently reported. Social distancing and staying at home were also reported albeit to a lower degree. We also identified a range of psychosocial and demographic predictors for COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Men, compared to women, had lower odds (OR=0.59) of reporting prevention behaviors. Rural residents (vs. urban; OR=1.49) and participants with at least a high school education (vs. less than high school education; OR=1.33) were more likely to report COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Discussion: Stakeholders and decision makers in Senegal and across Africa can use place-based evidence like ours to address COVID-19 risk factors and intervene effectively with policies and programming.

Currently used technically-simple frontline assays such as the PF4-polyanion enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) lack specificity, and more accurate functional assays such as the serotonin release assay (SRA) and PF4-dependent P-selectin expression assay (PEA) have long turnaround times due to technical complexity and availability only in the reference laboratory setting. There is a critical need for accurate near-patient functional testing to guide patient management, but a key barrier to attaining this goal is the short-term viability of platelets. Here, we detail a process of platelet cryopreservation that renders them viable for at least one year and show that PF4-treated cryopreserved platelets, when coupled with ELISA-based measurement of thrombospondin-1 release (a platelet -granule protein), detects pathogenic HIT antibodies with high accuracy. Furthermore, testing of a cohort of non-pathogenic HIT antibodies that were strongly reactive in PF4/polyanion ELISA but negative in functional assays demonstrated negative results in the thrombospondin-1 release assay, confirming high specificity of this technique. These findings have the potential to transform the diagnostic testing paradigm in HIT by making in-hospital functional testing available for rapid and accurate diagnosis.","Kanack, A.; Jones, C.; Singh, B.; Leger, R.; Heikal, N.; Chen, D.; Pruthi, R.; Padmanabhan, A.",,143,1

Actions taken to limit COVID-19 infection and mortality could potentially lead to unintended consequences, precipitating excess mortality due to other causes. One such cause is delayed cancer diagnosis. Significant decreases in presentation for cancer diagnosis at the primary care level have been noted in the UK. This study aimed to look for evidence of a similar effect in the US. Methods: CMS claims data from JAN18-JUN20 associated with primary diagnosis across 11 cancers (bladder, breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, sarcoma and thyroid) were analyzed for use of surgical pathology (SP), a procedure associated with initial diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Test volumes varied widely by test and cancer so were normalized to enable comparison across indications. This was done by dividing the month-on-month difference for the period JAN19-JUN19 vs JAN20-JUN20 by the median monthly test volume for the period JAN18-DEC19 (“pre-COVID period”). Extent and duration of declines in test rates and number of missing patients as the sum of these declines were then determined. The ratio of IHC to SP testing was taken to determine any decline in likely post-initial diagnosis testing. Results: There were significant (>10%) declines in test volumes for SP for all 11 cancers at some time in Q1- Q2 2020. Table. Extent, duration and return to preCOVID levels for SP testing across 11 cancers Median extent and duration of the decline was 56% (range 41.1%-80.4%) and 2 months (range 1- >4). This equates to 32,192 missing diagnoses across all cancers. SP test volumes for all cancers except lung and breast had returned to around pre-COVID levels by JUN20. There was no significant (>10%) increase in normalized SP test volume after the COVID dip for any cancer. While SP showed decreased test volumes across all cancers at some point during the first half of 2020, test volume ratios of IHC to SP showed increases for most cancers in the same time period. Conclusions: These data highlight that the decline in patients presenting to their primary care physicians with suspicion of cancer for diagnostic investigation was linked to COVID-19 prevention strategies. No evidence for increased, “catch up” testing to address presentational/diagnostic backlog was observed. Thus, it is predicted that these patients may subsequently present with a more advanced cancer. Potential excess morbidity, mortality and cost associated with absent or delayed diagnosis should be factored into cancer control programs going forward.

Propellers are used to control the flight behavior of multirotor drones, but it is challenging to control propellers under conditions subjected to variable loads, such as the spraying of sanitizers. In this study, a prototype quadrotor was developed to collect flight data under loading conditions. We used white-box mathematical models of the quadrotor, considering the physical quantities and black-box mathematical models, to identify practical data models. The proportional-integral-derivative control system was applied, in addition to particularizing the system tuning using the ZieglerNichols (ZN) theory applied to the quadrotor. The results of the ZN theory applied to the quadrotor with and without load and those applied to the quadrotor with variable load were validated. It was found that the performance improved by up to 75%.

A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six proline stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from Neisseria meningitidis. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs seven days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung. The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating, needle-free, subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing.","van der Ley, Peter A.; Zariri, Afshin; van Riet, Elly; Oosterhoff, Dinja; Kruiswijk, Corine P.",bioRxiv,143,1

However, partisan and ideological identities cannot explain popular attraction to Trump’s anti-elite and populist rhetoric, nor can polarization and sorting account for rising levels of mass identification as political independents. In light of these discrepancies, we offer an explanation for the Trump era unrelated to traditional left-right identities and ideologies: anti-establishment orientations. We argue that much of what is interpreted as an expression of partisan and ideological extremism or polarization is actually the product of a deep-seated antagonism toward the broader political establishment. We first exhibit the individual-level correlates of anti-establishment orientations, finding that people holding strong anti-establishment views exhibit relatively high levels of anti-social personality traits and distrust of others. We then show that anti-establishment orientations are more predictive than left-right orientations of beliefs in conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19, QAnon, and voter fraud. Most importantly, we demonstrate that, while anti-establishment orientations are positively related to support for Donald Trump, they are negatively related to support for Joe Biden and both major parties. In short, the toxicity emblematic of the Trump era—support for outsider candidates, belief in conspiracy theories, corrosive rhetoric, and violence—are derivative of antipathy towards the established political order, rather than a strict adherence to partisan and ideological dogma. We conclude that Trump’s most powerful and unique impact on American electoral politics is his activation, inflammation, and manipulation of preexisting anti-establishment orientations for partisan ends.","Enders, Adam M.; Uscinski, Joseph E.",The Forum,143,24

Various RT-PCR strategies have been proposed to identify specific viral RNA species that may predict the presence of infectious virus, including detection of transcriptional intermediates (e.g. subgenomic RNA [sgRNA]) and replicative intermediates (e.g. negative-strand RNA species). Using a novel primer/probe set for detection of subgenomic (sg)E transcripts, we successfully identified 100% of specimens containing culturable SARS-CoV-2 from a set of 126 clinical samples (total sgE CT values ranging from 12.3-37.5). This assay showed superior performance compared to a previously published sgRNA assay and to a negative-strand RNA assay, both of which failed to detect target RNA in a subset of samples from which we isolated live virus. In addition, total levels of viral RNA (genome, negative-strand, and sgE) detected with the WHO/Charite primer-probe set correlated closely with levels of infectious virus. Specifically, infectious virus was not detected in samples with a CT above 31.0. Clinical samples with higher levels of viral RNA also displayed cytopathic effect (CPE) more quickly than those with lower levels of viral RNA. Finally, we found that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 samples is significantly dependent on the cell type used for viral isolation, as Vero E6 cells expressing TMRPSS2 extended the analytical sensitivity of isolation by more than 3 CT compared to parental Vero E6 cells and resulted in faster isolation. Our work shows that using a total viral RNA Ct cut-off of >31 or specifically testing for sgRNA can serve as an effective rule-out test for viral infectivity.","Bruce, E. A.; Mills, M. G.

Notably data on the molecular events that precipitate altered gene expression programmes are very limited. Here we have identified two discrete L-CD subtypes from transcriptomic and whole-genome DNA methylation data, and comprehensively defined their molecular profiles using Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Subtype (Group) 1 features upregulation of neuronal markers (L-CD-NeU) and is characterised by focal spindle cell morphology, peripheral location (71%), high mutational load (P=3.4x10-4), recurrent copy number alterations and is enriched for Atypical Lung Carcinoids. Group 2 (L-CD-PanC) are centrally located and feature upregulation of pancreatic and metabolic pathway genes concordant with promoter hypomethylation of beta cell and genes related to insulin secretion (P<1x10-6). L-CD-NeU tumours harbour mutations in chromatin remodelling and in SWI/SNF complex members, while L-CD-PanC tumours show aflatoxin mutational signatures and significant DNA methylation loss genome-wide, particularly enriched in repetitive elements (P<2.2 x 10-16).

These observations were made during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, a time when human activity inflicted a minimum level of damage. The location of the observations was a microecosystem discovered on an urban college campus. Observations were made of four different types of seeds (palm, mulberry, linden and laurel) inside this ecosystem as well as of the way they were being carried via three different means (gravity, wind and the birds). The methods of how evidence of these seed-carrying processes was collected are presented here. A systematic and sequential observational technique in three steps is suggested to facilitate understanding the germination, growth and development processes of the different seeds in the microecosystem explored. We propose on the basis of this module that anyone can discover a microecosystem in their immediate environment and that with systematic observations can develop the skills needed to gather evidence on the ways seeds are disseminated and how plants grow. The entire construct of this study has been structured to support this claim.

This method allows for a selection of features (i.e. key words) by their informativity, the establishment of the most informative that provide the basis for “synthetic” features and algorithms, or the classification of the reviewed text by the relevance to the subject of the study. The results of fundamental studies showed that folates, vitamins A, D, and B12 are the regulators of mitosis of T and B-lymphocytes that exert the functions of the acquired immunity. Such microelements as zinc, iron, selenium, manganese, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid support the functioning of T and B-lymphocytes (energy metabolism, intracellular signal transmission, and transcription). Clinical studies showed that the support of vaccination with the specified micronutrients not only increases the titre of the respective antibodies to viral and bacterial pathogens but can also prevent unfavorable effects from vaccination. The administration of micronutrients before and after vaccination will contribute to a decrease in the mortality rate and severity of the pathology development (in case of disease). A systematic analysis allowed the authors to determine the perspectives of the proposed measures for an increase in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, including COVID-19. Additional micronutrient supply contributes to an increase in the effectiveness and safety of vaccination. The application of specialized vitamin and mineral complexes during vaccination is economically feasible and reduces the vaccination risks for patients with polyhypoavitaminoses.","Chuchalin, A.

Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 is a newly developed Smart Gene molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performance of Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 has not been evaluated. Methods Nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal samples were prospectively collected from subjects referred to the local PCR center from March 25 to July 5, 2021. Two swabs were simultaneously obtained for the Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 assay and the reference real-time RT-PCR assay, and the results of Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 were compared to the reference real-time RT-PCR assay. Results Among a total of 1150 samples, 68 of 791 nasopharyngeal samples and 51 of 359 anterior nasal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the reference real-time RT-PCR assay. In the testing of nasopharyngeal samples, Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 showed the total, positive and negative concordance of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.4-99.7%), 94.1% (95% CI: 85.6-98.4%) and 99.7% (95% CI: 99.0-100%), respectively. For anterior nasal samples, Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 showed the total, positive and negative concordance of 98.9% (95% CI: 97.2-99.7%), 98.0% (95% CI: 89.6-100%) and 99.0% (95% CI: 97.2-99.8%), respectively. In total, 5 samples were positive in the reference real-time RT-PCR and negative in Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2, whereas 5 samples were negative in the reference real-time RT-PCR and positive in Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 showed sufficient analytical performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal samples.","Kiyasu, Y.; Owaku, M.; Akashi, Y.; Takeuchi, Y.; Narahara, K.; Mori, S.; Nagano, T.; Notake, S.; Ueda, A.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.; Suzuki, H.",,143,1

Numerous assays have emerged to meet SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic needs. A clear knowledge of these assays parameters is essential to choose the proper test by clinical microbiologists. Unfortunately, the latter cannot be the unique criterion that guides test selection as - given the great demand - shortcomings of commercial kits is also a great issue. Aimed by the intention of overcoming both difficulties we have developed a new qualitative RT-PCR probe based for COVID-19 detection. The system detects three genes of SARS-CoV-2: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) and {beta}-actin gene used as endogenous internal control. The results of our assay show a total agreement with those obtained using a commercially available kit, with the exception of two specimens which did not pass the endogenous internal control. Moreover, our kit was designed to be open either for nucleic acid extraction step or on the RT-PCR assay to be carried out on several instruments. Thus, it is free from the industrial production logics of closed systems and conversely it is hypothetically available for distribution on large numbers in any microbiological laboratories. Presently, the kit is currently distributed worldwide","Favaro, M.; Mattina, W.; Pistoia, E. S.; Gaziano, R.; Di Francesco, P.; Middleton, S.; D'Angelo, S.; Altarozzi, T.; Fontana, C.",,143,13

Government agencies informing people to stay safe don't go outside, keep social distancing. Means we want to break chain of corona virus affected people. Till date there is no any automation tool is designed to detect Covid-19 patients. Such type of automation tool is required to detect patient at earlier stage(during first week of infection). If we detect Covid-19 patients in earlier stage and take required actions, we can save all patients. In this proposal we want to design automated digital screening tool to identify the people in the first week of the pandemic. Based on machine learning techniques, system will be trained as per the day to day symptoms. ASHA workers from Rural Health Centre can collect the all the peoples information related to Covid-19. By using Classification algorithm system will classify the people into different categories like healthy people (no any symptoms), first day of covid-19, second day covid-19, upto fourteenth day of covid-19. Data set required for training the model will be created by studying covid-19 patients per day history. Like first day he had aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea etc., related any symptoms. Similarly, we will prepare dataset of 5000 patients. Using this dataset model will be trained. After training the model whenever such type of pandemic occurs we will detect the infected people in early stage. We will reach to each of the citizen of India through social workers, ASHA worker, Rural Health care staff. Collect information of each person by using attributes which is decided for dataset. We will provide collected dataset (each citizen information) to our designed system. Designed system will classify according to classes mentioned above. If person don't have any symptoms related to covid-19 means he is healthy. If he had any symptoms according to day we have classified then such type of people immediately informed and according to requirement they will be kept in isolation, quarantine or hospitalized immediately. If we able to identify during the first week of pandemic then we can break chain at early stage and we can avoid spreading of coronavirus to large number of people. If we use such type of system then no need of lockdown for long period is required. Time required only for collecting the information, identifying the infected people and take appropriate action as mentioned above. Maximum 1 week of lockdown will be sufficient and we can stop chain. No any major loss in economy. In future this type of model can be used for any type of pandemic. We will detect infected people at early stage and we can stop chain for any type of pandemic.

Triterpenoids, a group of bioactive phytochemicals, have been tested for antibiofilm activity against model biofilm forming bacteria in recent times. In this context, glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA), representing three categorically distinct groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, are targeted for profiling their impact on Vibrio cholerae C6709 biofilms. The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. Albeit total extracellular proteolytic activity remained unaffected by the triterpenoids, GRA treatment resulted in considerable reduction of extracellular gelatinase activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated potential interaction with cyclic di-GMP sensor VpsT, autoinducer-2 sensor kinase LuxP-LuxQ and transcriptional activator HapR, component of complex quorum sensing networks modulating biofilm formation. Comprehensive analysis of antibiotic action revealed accentuation of cephalosporin antibiotics with GRA and UA while BA potentiated action of fluoroquinolones, widening the scope of combinatorial therapeutic strategy.","Bhattacharya, Sudipta Paul; Bhattacharya, Arijit; Sen, Aparna",bioRxiv,143,1

To better understand the impact of the measures put in place by the Kenyan government on health care provision, this project sought to document and quantify the impact of the restriction measures on patients' attendance in Machakos County. Methods Hospital attendance at 10 public hospitals were obtained including Machakos Level 5 Hospital (the county referral facility) and one health facility from each of the 9 Sub-counties of Machakos County. Data on outpatient and inpatient attendance from November 2019 to May 2020 were obtained and compared with a similar calendar period from the previous year. Key informant interviews (KIIs), focused group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews were conducted with the hospital management personnel (n = 46), as well as with the patients (n = 453) who missed scheduled clinic appointments at Machakos Level 5 Hospital to understand the reasons behind the drop in attendance numbers. Results Overall, there was a decline in the number of patient attendances compared to the prior calendar period. Outpatient attendance reduced by 24.7% in April 2020 (n = 39 704) compared with April 2019 (n = 52 731). Inpatient attendance reduced by 13.7% in April 2020 (n = 3298) compared with April 2019 (n = 2845). Declines in patient attendance were observed in all hospitals that had inpatient services. A great decline in attendance was noted among larger hospitals that run specialty clinics, which were suspended midMarch 2020 when the first case of COVID-19 was announced. Some increase in attendance was noted in May when most clinics resumed operations. Most hospital management staff highlighted the closure of clinics as the main reason for reduced attendance while patients added that they also feared contracting COVID-19 at the hospital and the stigma they would face should they be quarantined. Conclusions The findings from this study provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and measures put in place by the government to curb its spread disrupted the provision of health services in Machakos County. Efforts to minimize adverse impacts of indirect impacts on access to health care and preventative services to counter increased morbidity and mortality require attention throughout the pandemic.","Gitau, T.; Kamita, M.; Muli, E.; Mweni, S.; Waithanji, R.; Mutisya, F.; Kirira, P.; Nzioka, A.; Figueroa, J.; Makokha, F.",Journal of Global Health,143,25

Our purpose is to analyze the results of the patients that both have a hematological disease and receive treatment for COVID-19 infection in our hospital. Four hundred COVID-19 positive patients that received inpatient treatment between March 12, 2020 and October 1, 2020 in our center and got a diagnosis by using real -time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were scanned retrospectively. Eighty one patients were included in the study. Nineteen patients had a hematological disease;62 had a chronic disease but didn't have a hematological disease. We found that the group with hematological disease had a high level of ferritin (p= 0.0001). While the use of steroids in COVID-19 treatments is more frequent in the group with hematological disease (p= 0.01), the use of LMWH (low molecular weight heparin) is more frequent in the group with no hematological diseases (p= 0.02). Intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilatory support were required more for the patients with hematological disease than the others (p= 0.03. p= 0.008). While the mortality rate is 42.1% in the patients with hematological disease, it is 9.7% in the patients with chronic disease (p= 0.003). In cox regression analysis, the study found that hematological diseases (HR: 4.02, 95% CI: 1.7-1844.5, p= 0.02), cardiac diseases (HR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.2-77.9, p= 0.03), and intensive care treatment (HR: 4.60, 95% CI: 3.1-3115.0, p= 0.009) are significant risk factors.

To counteract this misinformation, reliably identifying it is a principal problem to be solved. However, the identification of misinformation poses a formidable challenge for language processing systems since the texts containing misinformation are short, work with insinuation rather than explicitly stating a false claim, or resemble other postings that deal with the same topic ironically. Accordingly, for the development of better detection systems, it is not only essential to use hand-labeled ground truth data and extend the analysis with methods beyond Natural Language Processing to consider the characteristics of the participant's relationships and the diffusion of misinformation. This paper presents a novel dataset that deals with a specific piece of misinformation: the idea that the 5G wireless network is causally connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have extracted the subgraphs of 3,000 manually classified Tweets from Twitter's follower network and distinguished them into three categories.

Here, we report the ability of 20 human sera, drawn 2 or 4 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2, to neutralize USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 bearing variant spikes from Delta plus (Delta-AY.1, Delta-AY.2), Delta-Δ144 (Delta with the Y144 deletion of the Alpha variant), Lambda, and B. 1.1.519 lineage viruses. Geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization titers against Delta-AY.1, Delta-AY.2, and Delta-Δ144 viruses are slightly lower than against USA-WA1/2020, but all sera neutralize the variant viruses to titers of ≥80. Neutralization titers against Lambda and B. 1.1.519 variants and against USA-WA1/2020 are equivalent. The susceptibility of Delta plus, Lambda, and other variants to neutralization by the sera indicates that antigenic change has not led to virus escape from vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies and supports ongoing mass immunization with BNT162b2 to control the variants and to minimize the emergence of new variants.","Liu, Jianying; Liu, Yang; Xia, Hongjie; Zou, Jing; Weaver, Scott C.; Swanson, Kena A.; Cai, Hui; Cutler, Mark; Cooper, David; Muik, Alexander; Jansen, Kathrin U.; Sahin, Ugur; Xie, Xuping; Dormitzer, Philip R.; Shi, Pei-Yong",bioRxiv,143,1

Yet the impact of these crises is unevenly distributed across countries, leading to discrepancies in (inter)national crisis-regulating institutions? ability to uphold public trust and safeguard their constituents? well-being. Employing the paradigm of citizens as customers of political institutions, drawing on attribution and sociopolitical trust theories, and using the COVID-19 pandemic as an empirical context, the authors investigate how consumers? relative perceptions of local impact following a global crisis affect the psychological processes of institutional trust formation and consumer well-being. Conducting one survey-based study in two countries affected disproportionately by the pandemic?s first wave (the United States and Greece) and one experimental study in a third country (Italy) during the pandemic?s second wave, the authors find that institutional trust declines more in countries whose citizens hold perceptions of higher relative local impact following a global crisis;institutional blame attributions explain trust erosion;institutional distrust decreases consumer well-being and adherence to institutional guidelines;consumers? globalization attitudes immunize international institutions from blame and distrust;and political conservatives transfer blame and distrust from national to international institutions amid global crises. The findings enrich the institutional branding and trust literatures and have implications for stakeholders involved in global crisis management (e.g., policy makers, political marketers, institutional brand managers).","Davvetas, Vasileios Ulqinaku Aulona Abi Gülen Sarial",Journal of International Marketing,143,7

Its impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is widely acknowledged among practitioners, but only a handful of studies reported empirical research in real-life settings focusing only on children. However, these studies did not measure the alterations of vegetative functions related to interpersonal distance. Here, we introduced a new experimental design to systematically measure interpersonal distance along with heart rate variability (HRV) in adults with ASD and tested the modulatory effect of intentionality, eye contact, moving activity, and attribution. Twenty-two adults diagnosed with ASD and 21 matched neurotypical controls participated in our study from 2019 October to 2020 February. Our new experimental design combined the modified version of the stop distance paradigm with HRV measurement controlling for eye contact between the experimenter and the participant to measure interpersonal distance in incidental and intentional conditions. Our results showed greater preferred distance in ASD in the intentional but not in the incidental condition. These results were altered with eye contact and the participant's role (active vs. passive) in the stop distance task. Moreover, we found lower baseline HRV and reduced HRV reactivity in ASD; however, these vegetative measurements could not predict preferred interpersonal distance. Our study highlights the importance of interpersonal space regulation in ASD and the need for sophisticated experimental designs to grasp the complexity and underlying factors of distance regulation in typical and atypical populations.","Farkas, K.; Pesthy, O.; Guttengeber, A.; Weigl, A.

This behavior can cause or maintain distress.ObjectivesLittle is known about cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic or how cyberchondria in one individual may cause distress in their significant other if they are self-isolating together;our study sought to fill these gaps.MethodsWe conducted a Qualtrics Panel survey with 760 cohabitating Canadian couples;in June 2020, participants retrospectively reported on their cyberchondria behavior, general anxiety, and COVID-19 fears during the month of April 2020, while adhering to stay-at-home advisories. Two separate actor-partner interdependence models (APIMs) used cyberchondria excessiveness and compulsion to predict generalized anxiety and COVID-19 danger/contamination fears in the actor and partner.ResultsBoth cyberchondria excessiveness and compulsion were associated with higher general anxiety and higher COVID-19 danger/contamination fears in the individual (actor effects). Partner cyberchondria compulsion was associated with higher general anxiety in the individual whereas partner cyberchondria excessiveness was associated with higher COVID-19 danger/contamination fears in the individual (partner effects).ConclusionsFindings suggest that excessive and uncontrollable searching of information about COVID-19 on the internet during lockdown may contribute to distress in both the individual engaging in the cyberchondria behavior, and in their romantic partner. Moreover, different aspects of cyberchondria in the partner (compulsion vs. excessiveness) appears to contribute to general vs. COVID-19-specific anxiety/fears in the partner, respectively. Future research should examine mechanisms underlying the observed partner effects (e.g., co-rumination, social contagion) and reasons for the differential partner effects of cyberchondria components.","Stewart, S.; King, F.; Rodriguez, L.; Meier, S.; Sherry, S.; Abbass, A.; Deacon, H.; Nogueira-Arjona, R.; Hagen, A.",European Psychiatry,143,24

This study was conducted at National Technical University of Ukraine ""Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute"" and Bharat Vidyalaya, Buldana, Maharashtra, India. A mixed method research design was used in the study: quantitative and qualitative data were obtained from two surveys completed by students anonymously as Google Forms. The research indicated that more Indian than Ukrainian students confirmed that they prepared for the English class. While nearly a third of Ukrainian students' suggestions on effectiveness of English lessons were about speaking and communication, Indian respondents also proposed preparation and revision. Indian students preferred learning something new to grades. Over half of Indian students and a third of Ukrainian students opted for working in groups. From the findings, we can see that most Indian and Ukrainian students had their working space, necessary devices and the Internet connection for studying online. Ukrainian students were more positive about feeling safer with their cameras turned off than Indian students. It was easier for most Indian and Ukrainian students to concentrate in a face-to-face class than in an online class. However, Indian students were mostly positive about studying English online. Most respondents indicated agreement about developing selfdirected learning skills while studying English online. Ukrainian students chose speaking, reading and writing as skills better developed online, while Indian students opted for listening skills. The findings of the research provide valuable information related to students' attitudes towards studying English online considering which may improve teaching and learning distantly. The research results show that despite understanding the necessity of studying online, some students are reluctant to accept it fully. Moreover, there are some intercultural differences related to social distance in the cultures.","Chugai, O.; Pawar, A.",Advanced Education,143,8

However, current methods are limited to providing simple DTIs without mode of action (MoA), or they show unsatisfactory performance for a limited range of compounds and targets. Here, we propose AI-DTI, a novel method that predicts activatory and inhibitory DTIs by combining the mol2vec and genetically perturbed transcriptomes. We trained the model on large-scale DTIs with MoA and found that our model outperformed a previous model that predicted activatory and inhibitory DTIs. To extend the applicability, we applied the inferential method for the target vector so that our method can learn and predict a wider range of targets. Our method achieved satisfactory performance in an independent dataset where the target was unseen in the training set and a high-throughput screening dataset where positive and negative samples were explicitly defined. Finally, our method successfully rediscovered approximately half of the DTIs for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. These results indicate that AI-DTI is a practically useful tool for guiding drug discovery processes and generating plausible hypotheses that can reveal unknown mechanisms of drug action.","Lee, Won-Yung; Lee, Choong-Yeol; Kim, Chang-Eop",bioRxiv,143,19

Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site. Lastly, tourism bodies and businesses could increase their partnerships with local custodians to add cultural value and understand the visitor experience.","Minunno, Roberto Morrison Gregory M.",Sustainability,143,17

Chest CT scan plays an important role in the early diagnosis and management of respiratory complications due to nCovid19. Clinicians should be aware about the indications for the CT scan of the thorax, timing of investigation, and limitations of CT. Main body of abstract Chest CT scan is indicated in patients with moderate to severe respiratory symptoms and pretest probability of nCovid19 infection, when RT-PCR test results are negative, and in patients for whom an RTPCR test is not performed or not readily available. When a rapid antigen test is negative and an RT-PCR test report takes time, CT can be used in seriously ill patients to decide whether it is COVID or not. For patients who are dependent on oxygen even after 2 weeks, CT may help to show the extent of lung involvement and predict long-term prognosis. CT may be done to exclude nCovid19 pneumonia. For patients with high risk for nCovid19 who require an immediate diagnosis to rule out lung involvement, CT can be done. A normal CT excludes nCovid19 pneumonia. CT scan is required in confirmed cases of nCovid19 pneumonia when complications are suspected clinically. These include pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumothorax, mediastinal/surgical emphysema, bacterial pneumonia, and unexplained deterioration with new shadows in chest X-ray. CT pulmonary angiogram is indicated when pulmonary embolism is suspected, and in other cases, plain CT should be done. In pre-operative cases where emergency surgery is required, nCovid19 disease is suspected clinically, and RT-PCR report awaited or not available, CT thorax can be done. Conclusion: CT scan is useful for early diagnosis of lung involvement, detection complications, triaging of cases, risk stratification, and preoperative evaluation in select cases. CT scan should be done only when there is a definite indication so to reduce radiation hazards and to reduce health care expenditure. Normal CT excludes nCovid19 lung involvement, but the patient may have upper respiratory involvement which may progress later to involve lungs.","Moleyar, V. S.; Noojibail, A.; Shetty, I.

However, some pertinent areas involving accurate and sensitive diagnostics, immunoglobulin specificity, evolution of mutant strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the drug combination strategy to combat it still require more attention. METHODS: This review critically examines the COVID-19 response and containment operations. It also addresses some standing challenges involving the areas of diagnostics, vaccine development and prospect, and treatment strategies in relation to antiviral drug treatment and immunotherapy.

METHODS Thirty 28-week-old male New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into control group (CON; n=14) and PE group (PE; n=16; 5 mg/kg body weight/day) after receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON. Before and after inductive protocol, Dynamic-MRI was employed on bilateral femora for local intra-osseous perfusion, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis and lipid-transportation, and marrow samples were quantified for adipogenesis-gene mRNA expression. Six weeks later, bilateral femora were dissected for Micro-CT-based micro-angiography, and then ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular fat-cell-size were examined histopathologically. RESULTS The incidence of ON in the PE group (31%) was significantly lower than that in the CON group (93%). Compared to the CON group, local intra-osseous perfusion was maintained in the PE group. Blocked trunk vessels were seldom found in micro-angiography of the PE-treated rabbits. Thrombosis incidence and fat-cell-size were both significantly lower in the PE group than those in the CON group. During the early period after induction, indicator of coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation and adipogenesis-gene expression were found with significantly changing pattern in the PE group compared to the CON group. CONCLUSION PE was able to exert beneficial effect on preventing steroid-associated ON in rabbits with inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid deposition.","Zhang, G; Qin, L; Sheng, H; Yeung, K W; Yeung, H Y; Cheung, W H; Griffith, J; Chan, C W; Lee, K M; Leung, K S",Bone,143,17

Several methods of pain assessment have been proposed to assess pain in this environment. These include both behavioural observation scales and evaluation of physiological measurements such as heart rate and blood pressure. Although numerous validation studies pertaining to behavioural observation scales have been published, several limitations associated with using these measures for pain assessment remain. Over the past few years, researchers have been interested in the use of the bispectral index monitoring system as a proxy for the evaluation of encephalography readings to assess the level of anesthesia and, potentially, analgesia. OBJECTIVES To synthesize the main studies exploring the use of the bispectral index monitoring system for pain assessment, to guide future research in adults under sedation in the intensive care unit. METHOD The EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published between 1996 and 2013 that evaluated the use of the bispectral index in assessing pain. RESULTS Most studies conclude that nociceptive stimulation causes a significant increase in the bispectral index and revealed the importance of controlling certain confounding variables such as the level of sedation. DISCUSSION Further studies are needed to clearly demonstrate the relationship between nociceptive stimuli and the bispectral index, as well as the specificity of the bispectral index in detecting pain.","Coleman, Robin Marie; Tousignant-Laflamme, Yannick; Ouellet, Paul; Parenteau-Goudreault, Élizabeth; Cogan, Jennifer; Bourgault, Patricia",Pain research & management,143,9

The protein binding is specific, in that a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe prevents formation of the complexes but no reduction is observed with a 2,000-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA. Complex formation is inhibited by poly(U) but is relatively unaffected by poly(A), poly(G), or poly(C-I). PVX RNA-host protein complex formation occurs in vitro at salt concentrations up to 400 mM. Deletion mapping indicates that the proteins bind within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of PVX genomic RNA and that an 8-nucleotide U-rich sequence (5'-UAUUUUCU) is required for the binding. Deletion of the 8-nucleotide U-rich region from the 3' UTR of a sensitive PVX reporter virus that carries the luciferase gene in place of the PVX coat protein gene results in a more than 70,000-fold reduction in luciferase expression in tobacco protoplasts. RNA probes carrying the sequence GCGC in place of the central four contiguous uridines of the 8-nucleotide U-rich motif fail to bind host protein at detectable levels, and the same mutation, when introduced into the PVX reporter virus, eliminates viral multiplication. Mutations of 1 or 2 nucleotides within the same four uridines reduced both binding of host proteins and replication of reporter virus. These results indicate that the 8-nucleotide U-rich motif within the PVX 3' UTR is important for some aspect of viral multiplication and suggest that host protein binding plays a role in the process.","Sriskanda, V S; Pruss, G; Ge, X; Vance, V B",Journal of virology,143,1

RESULTS Serum concentrations of C3, C4, CRP and PA were (1.18 +/- 0.42) g/L, (1.15 +/- 0.56) g/L, (10.52 +/- 8.77) mg/L and (107 +/- 54) mg/L in SARS patients, (1.30 +/- 0.46) g/L, (0.57 +/- 0.31) g/L, (0.88 +/- 0.43) mg/L and (291 +/- 76) mg/L in patients with other pneumonia, and (1.11 +/- 0.56) g/L, (0.38 +/- 0.26) g/L, (0.42 +/- 0.26) mg/L and (376 +/- 74) mg/L in normal persons, respectively. Serum level of PA was significantly lower and levels of C4 and CRP significantly in patients with SARS higher than those in patients with other pneumonia and normal persons (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in serum level of C3 between the three groups (P > 0.05).

METHODS The children who were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 in the Wuchang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan from February 5 to March 10, 2020 were enrolled as subjects. The clinical, laboratory, and lung imaging data were collected during hospitalization and isolation. This was a retrospective single-center case series analysis. RESULTS A total of 1 124 patients with mild COVID-19 were admitted from February 5 to March 10, 2020, including 13 children (1.16%). All the 13 children (7 boys and 6 girls) were residents of Wuhan in China, with a median age of 16 years (range: 10-18 years). Of all the 13 children, 9(69%) were from family clusters of COVID-19 and 4(31%) had unknown sources of infection. The mean time from exposure to onset was 6.8 days (range: 2-13 days) in 9 children with a definite history of exposure. There were 6 symptomatic children with the main manifestations of fever, cough, weakness, and myalgia, and the mean time from onset to hospitalization was 9.2 days. Of all the 13 children, 7(54%) were asymptomatic with positive nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There were 4 children (31%) with abnormal lung CT findings, mainly patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lung field, and 6 children (46%) had no symptoms with normal lung CT findings. All children had normal routine blood test results and C-reactive protein levels. Eight children underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests at least once, among whom 6 had negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM but positive IgG, and 2 underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests twice and had negative results. Of all the 13 children, 11(85%) had negative results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests during hospitalization and were discharged, and 2(15%) had positive results of four SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and were transferred to another hospital and lost to follow-up. Among the 11 children who were followed up, 1 had positive results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests at the isolation point, and 10 had negative results. The mean hospital stay was 10.9 days for the 13 children. Eleven children recovered during follow-up, with good living and learning conditions. CONCLUSIONS Children with mild COVID-19 often have an uncertain history of exposure and may not have any clinical symptoms. Etiological diagnosis is more important than clinical diagnosis. The disappearance of clinical manifestations may not parallel with the result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. SARS-CoV-2 has a long detoxification time, and there may be recurrent cases of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Further studies are needed to investigate the production patterns of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and their effect on the body.","Tian, Ji-Dong; Xie, Min; Wen, Zai-Chi; Xu, Jun-Mei; Wen, Chuan",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,143,16

This study evaluated the evolution of the prevalence of HTLV-1 and 2 in blood donors of the Hemominas Foundation from 1993 to 2007, and its geographical distribution in State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS The Hemominas Foundation is a centralized blood center in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The sources of data were the Hemominas Foundation Technical Bulletin and files from the centralized serological laboratory. Donors were tested in the period using enzyme linked immuno sorbent assays (ELISA), followed by Western blot, when repeatedly reactive. The data were analyzed by EPIINFO 6.2 and TABWIN 3.5 softwares. RESULTS The average seroprevalence in the period 1993-2007 was 0.1%. A steady decline occurred from 0.4% in 1993 to below 0.1% in 2002 and later, with a transient peak of 0.5% in 1994. HTLV reactivity distribution was asymmetrical in the state, with regions of higher prevalence, interspersed with low prevalence areas. Comparison of positive and negative donors verified that increasing age was proportional to virus positivity. Odds ratio for age ranged from 1.43 (30 to 39 years-old) to 3.09 (50 to 65 years-old). Women had a greater chance of being positive (OR-1.64), as previously described. CONCLUSIONS Possible explanations for HTLV-1/2 prevalence decline are the exclusion of positive donors from the donor pool, an increase in repeat donors and ELISA test improvement, with reduction in the number of false positive results.","Dias-Bastos, Maria Regina; Oliveira, Cláudia Di Lorenzo; Carneiro-Proietti, Anna Bárbara de Freitas",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,143,19

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of naratriptan for short-term prevention of MRM in 2 large, identically designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. METHODS MRM was defined as any migraine beginning during the perimenstrual period (PMP). By definition, the PMP consisted of Days -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with Day 1 being the first day of menstrual flow. Adult women were eligible if they reported a history of MRM, had regular menstrual cycles, and could predict within 2 days both the onset of menstrual flow and MRM. The studies comprised a baseline phase and a treatment phase. During the baseline phase, patients prophylactically treated their first PMP after the screening visit with single-blind placebo. Patients who documented an MRM while receiving placebo were eligible for the treatment phase. During the treatment phase, patients were randomized to receive either naratriptan 1 mg twice daily or placebo beginning 3 days before the predicted onset of MRM for a total of 6 days for 4 PMPs or 6 months, whichever occurred sooner. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean percentage of treated PMPs without MRM per patient. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of patients who were free of MRM during all treated PMPs, the median number of days with MRM over 4 PMPs, and patient satisfaction. Safety and tolerability measures included adverse events, standard clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs. RESULTS The intent-to-treat population was 287 in Study 1 (149 in the naratriptan group and 138 in the placebo group) and 346 in Study 2 (173 in each treatment group). Approximately 20% of randomized patients in each treatment group in Study 1 and 10% in each treatment group in Study 2 withdrew prematurely from the studies over the 4-month treatment period. The mean percentage of PMPs without MRM per patient was 38% and 34% among naratriptan-treated patients treating at least 1 PMP compared with 29% and 24% among placebo-treated patients in each respective study (P < .05 naratriptan vs placebo for both studies). Efficacy of naratriptan did not vary as a function of age, use of oral contraceptives, or use of migraine prophylaxis. More patients who had received naratriptan reported attacks posttreatment compared to patients who had received placebo. Among patients treating at least 1 PMP, the percentage of patients with no MRM in any treated PMP was significantly (P < .05) higher in the naratriptan group (11%; 19/173) than the placebo group (3%; 6 of 173) in Study 2. There were no differences in the percentages of patients with no MRM in any treated PMP in Study 1. The number of MRM days per patient across 4 PMPs was significantly lower in the naratriptan group than in the placebo group in both studies (median 5.0 days vs 6.5 days in Study 1 [P= .005] and 5.3 days vs 6.0 days in Study 2 [P= .018]). Significantly more patients receiving naratriptan were satisfied with the ability of naratriptan to control MRM either by preventing their occurrence or reducing their severity or duration compared with patients receiving placebo. No single drug-related adverse event was reported by more than 2% of patients in a treatment group in either study, and no serious drug-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS Naratriptan 1 mg twice daily for 6 days per month is effective and well tolerated when used for short-term prevention of MRM. More patients receiving naratriptan than placebo were satisfied with treatment. The observed increase in posttreatment attacks needs further study.","Mannix, Lisa K; Savani, Naren; Landy, Steve; Valade, Dominique; Shackelford, Steve; Ames, Michael H; Jones, Martin W",Headache,143,33

The pigs were killed at regular intervals between 24 and 144 hours after exposure. Virulent TGEV and virulent FIPV produced necrosis of villous epithelium, resulting in villous atrophy in the jejunum and the ileum. Similar, but less extensive and severe lesions, were produced by the 4 other viruses. Coronaviral antigens were identified by immunofluorescence in villous epithelial cells of pigs that had been inoculated with virulent TGEV, attenuated TGEV, virulent FIPV, and tissue culture-adapted FIPV.

Previously we have presented evidence that during flavivirus infection, peptide supply to the endoplasmic reticulum is increased (A. Müllbacher and M. Lobigs, Immunity 3:207-214, 1995). Here we show that during the early phase of infection with different flaviviruses, the transport activity of the peptide transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is augmented by up to 50%. TAP expression is unaltered during infection, and viral but not host macromolecular synthesis is required for enhanced peptide transport. This study is the first demonstration of transient enhancement of TAP-dependent peptide import into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum as a consequence of a viral infection. We suggest that the increased supply of peptides for assembly with MHC class I molecules in flavivirus-infected cells accounts for the upregulation of MHC class I cell surface expression with the biological consequence of viral evasion of natural killer cell recognition.","Momburg, F; Müllbacher, A; Lobigs, M",Journal of virology,143,11

A single recombination point was found and the sizes of the genes (C, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4 and NS5) were according to the parental subtypes. The PKR-eIF2alpha phosphorylation site homology domain sequence of the E2 protein was identical to those of genotype 2 strains, while the IFN-alpha-sensitivity-determining region of the NS5A protein was identical to those of interferon-resistant 1b strains. For the parental strains, two hairpin structures, HS1 and HS2, were predicted for the plus-strand up- and downstream of the crossover site, which were not present in the recombinant strain. HS2 shared similarity with the motif1 hairpin of turnip crinkle virus RNA that binds to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and facilitates 3'-terminal extension during recombination.

This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of the LigaSure Small Jaw (Covidien, Boulder, CO) with those of the Cavitation Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) system (Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ) in hepatic surgery. METHODS We enrolled 102 patients with liver tumors, of whom 51 underwent liver resection with the CUSA (CUSA group) between March 2004 and April 2011. Another 51 underwent resection with the LigaSure Small Jaw (LS group) between June 2011 and July 2012. We stratified patients by time period depending on the instrument used, and compared operative duration; intraoperative bleeding; and postoperative liver function and complication rate. RESULTS Total operation time (mean ± SD) was significantly shorter in the LS group than in the CUSA group (358.8 ± 91.7 versus 460.6 ± 146.1 min, P < 0.001). Blood loss was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Frequency of postoperative complications was lower, but not significantly, in the LS group.

We demonstrated that, in the DI RNA-transfected cells, the leader sequence of these DI RNAs was switched to that of the helper virus during one round of replication. This high-frequency leader sequence exchange was not observed if a nine-nucleotide stretch of sequence (UUUAUAAAC) at the junction between the leader and the remaining DI sequence was deleted. This observation suggests that a free leader RNA generated from the genomic RNA of mouse hepatitis virus may participate in the replication of DI RNA.","Makino, S; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,143,30

Recently, sequence-specific in vitro endoribonuclease activity was demonstrated for the NendoU-containing nonstructural protein (nsp) 15 of several coronaviruses. To investigate the biological role of this novel enzymatic activity, we have characterized a comprehensive set of arterivirus NendoU mutants. Deleting parts of the NendoU domain from nsp11 of equine arteritis virus was lethal. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues exerted pleiotropic effects. In a first-cycle analysis, replacement of two conserved Asp residues in the C-terminal part of NendoU rendered viral RNA synthesis and virus production undetectable. In contrast, mutagenesis of other conserved residues, including two putative catalytic His residues that are absolutely conserved in NendoU and cellular homologs, produced viable mutants displaying reduced plaque sizes (20 to 80% reduction) and reduced yields of infectious progeny of up to 5 log units. A more detailed analysis of these mutants revealed a moderate reduction in RNA synthesis, with subgenomic RNA synthesis consistently being more strongly affected than genome replication. Our data suggest that the arterivirus nsp11 is a multifunctional protein with a key role in viral RNA synthesis and additional functions in the viral life cycle that are as yet poorly defined.","Posthuma, Clara C; Nedialkova, Danny D; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Blokhuis, Jeroen H; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,143,27

METHODS SARS-CoV N and N199 (a truncated nucleocapsid gene) genes were cloned, expressed, identified by Western blotting, and applied in screening of human and swine samples. Sera of SARS convalescent-phase patients, normal human sera, sera of patients with other respiratory diseases, and swine sera were screened by ELISA, with whole SARS-CoV F69, N and N199 proteins as antigens. RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of N and N199 proteins in human sera diagnosis were approximate (P = 0.743), which was higher than whole viral protein but the difference was not significant (P = 0.234). The N199 protein proved to be more specific in swine sera screening than whole viral and N protein (P < 0.001).

The rational design process is accompanied by 3D structure determinations of different ligand-protein complexes. Most often, significantly improved binding affinities of the ligands are observed after several cycles of 3D structure determinations, the design of compounds with appropriate structural modifications, synthesis, and testing of the new drug candidates.

A risk with lead structure optimization by structure-based design is the neglect of other important biological properties, such as bioavailability and metabolic stability. Recent applications of structure-based design, as well as success stories in the search for new, potent and selective HIV protease inhibitors, thrombin inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors and integrin receptor antagonists, are reviewed.","Kubinyi, H",Current opinion in drug discovery & development,143,28

The sequence contained two long open reading frames of 321 bases and 264 bases, overlapping by five bases but in different frames. Both open reading frames are initiated by AUG codons in sequence contexts that are relatively infrequently used as initiator codons. The smaller, downstream open reading frame encoded a neutral protein (mol. wt. 10200) with a hydrophobic amino terminus. The larger, 5'-proximal open reading frame encoded a basic protein (mol. wt. 12400) which lacks internal methionine residues. With the exception of the AUG codon initiating the downstream open reading frame, no internal AUG codons were found within the sequence covered by the upstream open reading frame. These results suggest that the MHV-JHM mRNA 5 is translated to produce two proteins by a mechanism involving internal initiation of protein synthesis. Preliminary evidence is presented showing that the downstream open reading frame is functional in vivo.","Skinner, M A; Ebner, D; Siddell, S G",The Journal of general virology,143,33

Recently, the use of BMI for assessing childhood obesity in the B4SC programme has been questioned. This article provides evidence in support of the assessment of BMI during the B4SC, including specific key points: 1. BMI is currently the only appropriate field tool for assessing overweight and obesity.2. Our New Zealand data show that BMI is reliable at measuring adiposity in all ethnic groups. 3. High childhood BMI often leads to adult obesity and is associated with increased adult morbidity and mortality. 4.

203792,203792,203792,[Thermal ablation of brain tumours],13.841556,6.68144,2020,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool used to integrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics knowledge to optimize and personalize various drug therapies. The optimization of drug dosing may improve treatment outcomes, reduce toxicity, and reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. To adequately implement TDM, accurate and precise analytical procedures are required. In clinical practice, blood is the most commonly used matrix for TDM; however, less invasive samples, such as dried blood spots or non-invasive saliva samples, are increasingly being used. The choice of sample preparation method, type of column packing, mobile phase composition, and detection method is important to ensure accurate drug measurement and to avoid interference from matrix effects and drug metabolites. Most of the reported procedures used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques due to its high selectivity and sensitivity. High-performance chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) methods are also used when a simpler and more cost-effective methodology is desired for clinical monitoring. The application of high-performance chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) with and without derivatization processes and high-performance chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) techniques for the analysis of various drugs in biological samples for TDM have been described less often. Before chromatographic analysis, samples were pretreated by various procedures-most often by protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction, rarely by microextraction by packed sorbent, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. The aim of this article is to review the recent literature (2010-2020) regarding the use of liquid chromatography with various detection techniques for TDM.","Tuzimski, Tomasz; Petruczynik, Anna",Molecules (Basel),143,20

Seven different scenarios varying epidemiological and economical effects of social distance interventions were performed, which are: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The model can be easily extended to new societies by varying the parameters as well as allows the creating of a multitude of other scenarios.","Silva, Petronio C. L.; Batista, Paulo V.

Rather than stimulating demand, government policy’s main aim should be to provide insurance to firms and workers to avoid undue scarring that will hamper a recovery once the pandemic is past. We develop a corporate finance framework to guide interventions in credit markets to avoid such scarring. We emphasize three main results. First, policy should inject liquidity into small and medium-sized firms that are liquidity constrained and for which social costs of bankruptcy are high. Second, large firms for whom solvency is the dominant issue require a more nuanced approach. Debt overhang creates a distortion, leading these firms to fire workers, forgo expenditures that maintain enterprise value, and delay filing for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy longer than is socially efficient. Government resources toward reducing the legal and financial costs of bankruptcy are unambiguously beneficial. Policies that reduce funding costs are only socially desirable if the pandemic is expected to be short-lived and if bankruptcy costs are high. Last, transfers necessary to avoid bankruptcy allow borrowers to continue paying their mortgages or credit card bills and ultimately benefit owners of assets such as real estate or credit card receivables. Taxes to fund transfers should be raised from these asset owners. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

As most studies have investigated bi- or tri-variate models, a multivariate model accounting for simultaneous potential mediations is necessary to have a comprehensive view of the determinants of QOL. We sought to estimate the associations between cognitive reserve, cognition, functioning, insight, depression, schizophrenic symptoms, and QoL in schizophrenia and their potential mediation relationships. METHODS: We used structural equation modeling with mediation analyses to test a model based on existing literature in a sample of 776 patients with schizophrenia from the FondaMental Foundation FACE-SZ cohort. RESULTS: Our model showed a good fit to the data. We found better functioning to be positively associated with a better QoL, whereas better cognition, better insight, higher levels of depression, and schizophrenic symptoms were associated with a lower QoL in our sample. Cognitive reserve is not directly linked to QoL, but indirectly in a negative manner via cognition. We confirm the negative relationship between cognition and subjective QoL which was previously evidenced by other studies; moreover, this relationship seems to be robust as it survived in our multivariate model. It was not explained by insight as some suggested, thus the mechanism at stake remains to be explained. CONCLUSION: The pathways to subjective QoL in schizophrenia are complex and the determinants largely influence each other. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these cross-sectional findings.","Ehrminger, Mickael; Roux, Paul; Urbach, Mathieu; André, Myrtille; Aouizerate, Bruno; Berna, Fabrice; Bohec, Anne-Lise; Capdevielle, Delphine; Chéreau, Isabelle; Clauss, Julie; Dubertret, Caroline; Dubreucq, Julien; Fond, Guillaume; Honciuc, Roxana-Mihaela; Lançon, Christophe; Laouamri, Hakim; Leigner, Sylvain; Mallet, Jasmina; Misdrahi, David; Pignon, Baptiste; Rey, Romain; Schürhoff, Franck; Passerieux, Christine; Brunet-Gouet, Eric",Psychol Med,143,1

We also show that all of these $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{R}}$-modules can be realized as the cohomology of a $2$-local finite $\mathbb{R}$-motivic spectrum. The realization results are obtained using an $\mathbb{R}$ -motivic analogue of the Toda realization theorem. We notice that each realization of $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{R}}(1)$ can be expressed as a cofiber of an $\mathbb{R}$-motivic $v_1$-self-map. The $\mathrm{C}_2$-equivariant analogue of the above results then follows because of the Betti realization functor. We identify a relationship between the $\mathrm{RO}(\mathrm{C}_2)$-graded Steenrod operations on a $\mathrm{C}_2$-equivariant space and the classical Steenrod operations on both its underlying space and its fixed-points. This technique is then used to identify the geometric fixed-point spectra of the $\mathrm{C}_2$-equivariant realizations of $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{C}_2}(1)$. We find another application of the $\mathbb{R}$-motivic Toda realization theorem: we produce an $\mathbb{R}$-motivic, and consequently a $\mathrm{C}_2$-equivariant, analogue of the Bhattacharya-Egger spectrum $\mathcal{Z}$, which could be of independent interest.","Bhattacharya, Prasit; Guillou, Bertrand J.; Li, Ang",,143,16

The survey included four general questions (age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem) and four COVID-19 specific questions (contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask, and frequent hand washings). RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty -eight people were surveyed (108 healthy individuals, 154 patients with epilepsy, and 96 patients with psychiatric problems).

However, understanding the patterns of risk perception could also facilitate effective risk communication to minimize the impacts of disease spread during this crisis. OBJECTIVE: We attempt to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions of COVID-19 in South Korea using internet search data. METHODS: Google Trends (GT) and NAVER relative search volumes (RSVs) data were collected using COVID-19-related terms in the Korean language and were retrieved according to time, gender, age groups, types of device, and location. Online queries were compared to the number of daily new COVID-19 cases and tests reported in the Kaggle open-access data set for the time period of December 5, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Time-lag correlations calculated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients were employed to assess whether correlations between new COVID-19 cases and internet searches were affected by time. We also constructed a prediction model of new COVID-19 cases using the number of COVID-19 cases, tests, and GT and NAVER RSVs in lag periods (of 1-3 days). Single and multiple regressions were employed using backward elimination and a variance inflation factor of <5. RESULTS: The numbers of COVID-19-related queries in South Korea increased during local events including local transmission, approval of coronavirus test kits, implementation of coronavirus drive-through tests, a face mask shortage, and a widespread campaign for social distancing as well as during international events such as the announcement of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. Online queries were also stronger in women (r=0.763-0.823; P<.001) and age groups &#8804;29 years (r=0.726-0.821; P<.001), 30-44 years (r=0.701-0.826; P<.001), and &#8805;50 years (r=0.706-0.725; P<.001). In terms of spatial distribution, internet search data were higher in affected areas. Moreover, greater correlations were found in mobile searches (r=0.704-0.804; P<.001) compared to those of desktop searches (r=0.705-0.717; P<.001), indicating changing behaviors in searching for online health information during the outbreak. These varied internet searches related to COVID-19 represented community health risk perceptions. In addition, as a country with a high number of coronavirus tests, results showed that adults perceived coronavirus test-related information as being more important than disease-related knowledge. Meanwhile, younger, and older age groups had different perceptions. Moreover, NAVER RSVs can potentially be used for health risk perception assessments and disease predictions. Adding COVID-19-related searches provided by NAVER could increase the performance of the model compared to that of the COVID-19 case-based model and potentially be used to predict epidemic curves. CONCLUSIONS: The use of both GT and NAVER RSVs to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions could be beneficial for targeting risk communication from several perspectives, including time, population characteristics, and location.","Husnayain, Atina; Shim, Eunha; Fuad, Anis; Su, Emily Chia-Yu",J Med Internet Res,143,33

We aimed to develop a national consensus management pathway for the UK to provide guidance for clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. A three-phase online Delphi process and virtual consensus meeting sought consensus over the investigation, management, and research priorities from multidisciplinary clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. We used 140 consensus statements to derive a consensus management pathway that describes the initial investigation of children with suspected PIMS-TS, including blood markers to help determine the severity of disease, an echocardiogram, and a viral and septic screen to exclude other infectious causes of illness. The importance of a multidisciplinary team in decision making for children with PIMS-TS is highlighted throughout the guidance, along with the recommended treatment options, including supportive care, intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and biological therapies. These include IL-1 antagonists (eg, anakinra), IL-6 receptor blockers (eg, tocilizumab), and anti-TNF agents (eg, infliximab) for children with Kawasaki disease-like phenotype and non-specific presentations. Use of a rapid online Delphi process has made it possible to generate a national consensus pathway in a timely and cost-efficient manner in the middle of a global pandemic. The consensus statements represent the views of UK clinicians and are applicable to children in the UK suspected of having PIMS-TS. Future evidence will inform updates to this guidance, which in the interim provides a solid framework to support clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. This process has directly informed new PIMS-TS specific treatment groups as part of the adaptive UK RECOVERY trial protocol, which is the first formal randomised controlled trial of therapies for PIMS-TS globally.","Harwood, Rachel; Allin, Benjamin; Jones, Christine E; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V; Kaleem, Musa; Tulloh, Robert; Peters, Mark J; Almond, Sarah; Davis, Peter J; Levin, Michael; Tometzki, Andrew; Faust, Saul N; Knight, Marian; Kenny, Simon",Lancet Child Adolesc.

Optimising and standardising management through evidence-based guidelines may improve quality of care and therefore patient outcomes. METHODS: A task force from the European Respiratory Society and endorsed by the Chinese Thoracic Society identified priority interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for the initial version of this ""living guideline"" using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format. The GRADE approach was used for assessing the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Systematic literature reviews were performed, and data pooled by meta-analysis where possible. Evidence tables were presented and evidence to decision frameworks were used to formulate recommendations. RESULTS: Based on the available evidence at the time of guideline development (20 February, 2021), the panel makes a strong recommendation in favour of the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients requiring supplementary oxygen or ventilatory support, and for the use of anticoagulation in hospitalised patients. The panel makes a conditional recommendation for interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibody treatment and high-flow nasal oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The panel make strong recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Conditional recommendations are made against the use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, colchicine, and remdesivir, in the latter case specifically in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. No recommendation was made for remdesivir in patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Further recommendations for research are made. CONCLUSION: The evidence base for management of COVID-19 now supports strong recommendations in favour and against specific interventions. These guidelines will be regularly updated as further evidence becomes available.","Chalmers, James D; Crichton, Megan L; Goeminne, Pieter C; Cao, Bin; Humbert, Marc; Shteinberg, Michal; Antoniou, Katerina M; Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli; Parks, Helen; Wang, Chen; Vandendriessche, Thomas; Qu, Jieming; Stolz, Daiana; Brightling, Christopher; Welte, Tobias; Aliberti, Stefano; Simonds, Anita K; Tonia, Thomy; Roche, Nicolas",Eur. respir. j,143,21

To better understand the neuropathogenesis of this acute encephalopathy, we describe a series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) encephalopathy, highlighting its phenomenology and its neurobiological features. On May 10, 2020, 707 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized at the Geneva University Hospitals; 31 (4.4%) consecutive patients with an acute encephalopathy (64.6 ± 12.1 years; 6.5% female) were included in this series, after exclusion of comorbid neurological conditions, such as stroke or meningitis. The severity of the COVID-19 encephalopathy was divided into severe and mild based on the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS): severe cases (n = 14, 45.2%) were defined on a RASS < -3 at worst presentation. The severe form of this so-called COVID-19 encephalopathy presented more often a headache. The severity of the pneumonia was not associated with the severity of the COVID-19 encephalopathy: 28 of 31 (90%) patients did develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome, without any difference between groups (p = .665). Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities were found in 92.0% (23 of 25 patients) with an intracranial vessel gadolinium enhancement in 85.0% (17 of 20 patients), while an increased cerebrospinal fluid/serum quotient of albumin suggestive of blood-brain barrier disruption was reported in 85.7% (6 of 7 patients). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 was negative for all patients in the cerebrospinal fluid. Although different pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to this acute encephalopathy, our findings suggest the hypothesis of disturbed brain homeostasis and vascular dysfunction consistent with a SARS-CoV-2-induced endotheliitis.","Uginet, Marjolaine; Breville, Gautier; Assal, Frédéric; Lövblad, Karl-Olof; Vargas, Maria Isabel; Pugin, Jérôme; Serratrice, Jacques; Herrmann, Francois R; Lalive, Patrice H; Allali, Gilles",J Med Virol,143,20

CIPNM diagnosis is usually limited to clinical evaluation. We compared patients with ARDS from COVID-19 and other aetiologies, in whom a neurophysiological evaluation for the detection of CIPNM was performed. The aim was to determine if there were any differences between these two groups in frequency of CINPM and outcome at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study performed on mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted (January 2016-June 2020) to the ICU of Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy, with ARDS of different aetiologies. Neurophysiological evaluation was performed on patients with stable ventilation parameters, but marked widespread hyposthenia (Medical Research Council score <48). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and mean morning glycaemic values were collected. RESULTS: From a total of 148 patients, 23 with COVID-19 infection and 21 with ARDS due to other aetiologies, underwent electroneurography/electromyography (ENG/EMG) recording. Incidence of CIPNM was similar in the two groups, 65% (15 of 23) in COVID-19 patients and 71% (15 of 21) in patients affected by ARDS of other aetiologies. At ICU discharge, subjects with CIPNM more frequently required ventilatory support, regardless the aetiology of ARDS. CONCLUSION: ENG/EMG represents a useful tool in the identification of the neuromuscular causes underlying ventilator wean failure and patient stratification. A high incidence of CIPNM, with a similar percentage, has been observed in ARDS patients of all aetiologies.","Scarpino, Maenia; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Lazzeri, Chiara; Lanzo, Giovanni; Lolli, Francesco; Ciapetti, Marco; Hakiki, Bahia; Grippo, Antonello; Peris, Adriano; Ammannati, Andrea; Baldanzi, Fabrizio; Bastianelli, Maria; Bighellini, Annamaria; Boccardi, Cristina; Carrai, Riccardo; Cassardo, Annalisa; Cossu, Cesarina; Gabbanini, Simonetta; Ielapi, Carmela; Martinelli, Cristiana; Masi, Giulia; Mei, Cristina; Troiano, Simone",Acta Neurol Scand,143,20

However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups during these periods.We used the daily number of coronavirus 2019 cases (by date of symptom onset) reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network among individuals aged 15-19 years through 65-69 years. For each age group g, we computed the proportion PrE(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15-69 years during the pre-lockdown period (1-10 March 2020) and the corresponding proportion PrL(g) during two lockdown periods (initial: 25 March-3 April; strengthened: 8-17 April 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g) = PrL(g)/PrE(g). For each pair of age groups g1, g2, PR(g1)>PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the lockdown period vs. the pre-lockdown period.For the initial lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50-54 years (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55-59 years (PR = 1.19; 1.11,1.27). For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15-19 years (PR = 1.26; 0.95,1.68) and 50-54 years (PR = 1.20; 1.09,1.31).Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the initial lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64 years, particularly those aged 50-59 years, had a higher relative incidence compared with the pre-lockdown period. Younger adults/older adolescents had an increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown. The role of different age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future mitigation efforts.","De Salazar, P M; Gómez-Barroso, D; Pampaka, D; Gil, J M; Peñalver, B; Fernández-Escobar, C; Lipsitch, M; Larrauri, A; Goldstein, E; Hernán, M A",Epidemiol Infect,143,29

This study included two cohorts of adult inpatients admitted into the ED. All patients who were suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who underwent a typical chest CT imaging were included. Thus, we studied two distinct cohorts: patients with positive RT-PCR (PCR+) and those with negative initial RT-PCR (PCR-). The data were analyzed using Bayesian methods. We included 66 patients in the PCR- group and 198 in the PCR+ group. The baseline characteristics did not differ except in terms of a proportion of lower chronic respiratory disease in the PCR- group. We noted a less severe clinical presentation in the PCR- group (lower respiratory rate, lower oxygen need and mechanical ventilation requirement).

A total of 476 health care workers including doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff participated from Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. A validated WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to screen for Depression. A 25.7% prevalence of depression was reported among health care workers. Almost 70% of them were either not satisfied or partially satisfied with the provided personal protective equipment.

In the current study, to investigate the spread possibility of COVID-19 via the environmental media, three typical rivers (Yangtze, Han, and Fu River) and watershed cities in Hubei province of China were selected, and a more comprehensive risk assessment analysis method was built with a risk index proposed. Results showed that the risk index in the Yangtze River Basin is about 10-12, compared to 10-10 and 10-8 in the Han and Fu River Basins, and the risk index is gradually reduced from Wuhan city to the surrounding cities. The safety radius and safety time period for the Yangtze, Han, and Fu River are 8 km/14 h, 20 km/30 h and 36 km/36 h, respectively.

We then ask: What does it mean to talk about the virus and the ways to address it through war-framings? We argue that the Bolsonaro administration has framed the COVID-19 pandemic as an extra-territorial threat in an effort to create internal stability while failing to handle the matter effectively. Such politically motivated spatial framings inhibit an effective response in Brazil and pose a severe threat to public health. Once COVID-19 becomes securitized, the response is framed by the military bureaucracy rather than public health authorities, resulting in dangerous consequences.","Pfrimer, Matheus Hoffmann; Barbosa Jr, Ricardo",Dialogues Hum.

Some studies suggest that small air particles facilitate the spread of viruses and also of the new coronavirus, besides the direct person-to-person contagion. However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5-10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21-32% additional cases, whose 19-28% more positives and 4-14% more deaths. Our findings, demonstrating that fine-particulate (PM2.5) pollutant level is the most important factor to predict SARS-CoV-2 effects that would worsen even with a slight decrease of air quality, highlight that the imperative of productivity before health and environmental protection is, indeed, a short-term/small-minded resolution.","Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto; Velichevskaya, Alena; Tateo, Andrea; Amoroso, Nicola; Monaco, Alfonso",Environ Pollut,143,0

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) leads to maternal morbidity and may diminish quality of life due to post-thrombotic syndrome during the rest of a woman's life. Despite this important burden, the evidence base for the management of pregnancy-related VTE is weak. Recommendations from evidence-based guidelines are often extrapolated from the non-pregnant population and thus weak or conditional. As a consequence, there is wide variation of practice. In women with a suspicion of PE, the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm is safe and efficient, with 39% of women not needing computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to rule out PE. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in therapeutic doses is the treatment of choice during pregnancy, and anticoagulation (LMWH or vitamin K antagonists [VKA] postpartum) should be continued until 6 weeks after delivery with a minimum total duration of 3 months. Use of LMWH or vitamin K antagonists does not preclude breastfeeding. Postpartum, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an option if women do not breastfeed and long-term use is intended. Management of delivery, including the type of analgesia, requires a multidisciplinary approach and depends on local preferences and patient-specific conditions. Several options are possible and include waiting for spontaneous delivery with temporary interruption of LMWH. Prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent VTE in subsequent pregnancies is indicated in most women with a history of VTE.","Middeldorp, Saskia; Ganzevoort, Wessel",Blood,143,16

News articles from countries with past experience with Ebola were more likely to mention the pandemic's effects on vulnerable populations, especially on incarcerated people. Vulnerable groups were reported to have experienced a range of effects including economic disruptions, heightened domestic and sexual abuse, arbitrary arrests, health care inaccessibility, and educational challenges throughout the pandemic. With implications for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030 in West Africa, these countries should consider and focus more strategic efforts on vulnerable populations to overcome their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and to achieve the SDG for 2030.","Saalim, Khalida; Sakyi, Kwame S; Morrison, Emily; Owusu, Prince; Dalglish, Sarah L; Kanyangarara, Mufaro",PLoS One,143,1

Family/friend caregivers often receive little to no education or training about dementia but are expected to provide ongoing support for a complex condition. Web-based family/friend caregiver interventions may be helpful, but little is known about how best to implement them. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to 1) design and develop a novel education prescription application to help scale and spread web-based dementia education to family/friend caregivers, 2) conduct user testing, and 3) conduct a larger-scale field trial. METHODS: A novel education prescription web-based application was designed and developed. Initial user testing used task completion and the ""think aloud"" technique with a small sample of representative clinicians who work with people living with dementia and family/friend caregivers. Following iterative incorporation of feedback, a larger field trial was conducted with a convenience sample of clinicians. Account invitations were sent to 55 clinicians and, following a 2-month trial period, surveys were administered to participants including the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score. RESULTS: During the initial user testing phase, participants (N=7) from representative disciplines easily completed associated tasks, and had very positive feedback with respect to the usability of the application. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 91.4. Suggestions from feedback were incorporated into the application. During the larger field trial phase, participants (total N=55; activated account n=17; did not activate account n=38) were given access to the iGeriCare education prescription application. During this period, 2 participants created educational prescriptions; a total of 3 educational prescriptions were sent. Survey completers who did not activate their account (n=5) identified that their lack of use was due to time constraints, competing priorities, or forgetting to use the application. Survey completers who activated their account (n=5) identified their lower use was due to lack of time, lack of eligible family/friend caregivers during trial period, and competing priorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 78.75, and the Net Promoter Score was 50. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate a generally positive response for the usability of a web-based application for clinicians to prescribe dementia education to family/friend caregivers. The dissonance between the promising data and widespread enthusiasm for the design and purpose of the education prescription application found in the initial user testing phase and subsequent lack of significant adoption in the field trial represents both an important lesson for other novel health technologies and a potential area for further investigation. Further research is required to better understand factors associated with implementation of this type of intervention and impact on dissemination of education to family/friend caregivers.","Levinson, Anthony J; Bousfield, John; Douglas, William; Ayers, Stephanie; Sztramko, Richard",JMIR Hum Factors,143,7

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of referrals to and eligible donors from an eye bank between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, was performed, with the same time period in 2019 as a control. Referrals who were not procured because of Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines and eye bank-specific restrictions were noted. The results of 1 month of routine postmortem testing performed by the eye bank were examined. Analysis of variance tests were performed to assess the change between donors from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in both the number of total referrals to the eye bank (P = 0.044) and donors eligible for surgical transplantation (P = 0.031). Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines reduced the number of referrals over this period by 4% to 14%. Of the 266 surgically eligible donors who received postmortem COVID-19 testing in June by the eye bank, 13 resulted positive (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction in referrals and eligible corneal transplant donors at a single eye bank, there was a surplus of surgically suitable corneal tissue during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. RESULTS: We found four themes relating to symptom attribution ('normalising symptoms', 'err on the side of caution', 'experience of temperature', 'symptoms not normal for us'). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as 'unusual' for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation ('difficult to prevent contact with children', 'isolation would be no different to lockdown life', 'ability to get food and supplies', 'limited space'). Parents believed they would find isolation within the household difficult or impossible if they had dependent children, had limited space or could not shop for groceries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight complexities in symptom perception, attribution and household isolation. We suggest that they can be overcome by (a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, (b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household and (c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.","Hodson, A; Woodland, L; Smith, L E; Rubin, G J",Public Health,143,16

Aiming to explore these suppositions, an online survey was conducted among 710 Israeli adults. Of them, 370 were childhood abuse survivors. A history of childhood abuse, COVID-19-related stressors, overall psychological distress, and peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic were assessed via self-report measures. Participants with a history of childhood abuse had elevated overall psychological distress as well as peritraumatic stress symptoms during the pandemic, compared to nonabused participants, above and beyond demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related stressors. Emotion regulation difficulties were related to elevated psychological distress and peritraumatic stress symptoms among both childhood abuse survivors and nonabused participants. Nonetheless, a history of childhood abuse moderated the relations between the emotion regulation difficulty of being unable to engage in goal-directed behaviors when distressed (on one hand) and mental outcomes (on the other): Although the associations between inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors, overall psychological distress, and peritraumatic stress symptoms were nonsignificant among nonabused participants, they were significant among childhood abuse survivors.

Entities on both the supply and demand sides of the market had to adapt to highly non-standard market conditions in a relatively short time. Closing the economy, combined with social distancing, was supposed to slow the spread of the pandemic. The question of how successful this effort has been can only be answered over time. In any case, the consequences of a lockdown in the form of changes in common patterns of behavior can be monitored almost immediately. The aim of the presented study is to examine selected characteristics of consumer behavior of Slovaks during a pandemic compared to the reference pre-pandemic period. During the first lockdown in 2020, the B2C interactions of the five largest Slovak e-shops and their customers in the environment of the social network Facebook were monitored on a daily basis. The results suggest that customer interactions have shifted over time during the current day, while the interactions of content producers have remained unchanged. In order to remain effective in spending resources on promotion, companies will need to better reflect changes in customer behavior patterns in the future. At the same time, it is necessary to monitor how the identified trends will create new standards. © 2021 IDIMT 2021 - Pandemics: Impacts, Strategies and Responses, 29th Interdisciplinary Information Management Talks All rights reserved.","Pollák, F.; Dorčák, P.; Markovič, P.; Világi, R.; Konečný, M.","29th Interdisciplinary Information Management Talks - Pandemics: Impacts, Strategies and Responses, IDIMT 2021",143,24

Clinical evidence on the use of respirators is poor and interest in the topic has not been constant over time. A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed, together with high-quality clinical data on the use of respirators or alternative devices. Moreover, healthcare workers, regardless of their level of experience, should receive specific training.

In recent years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns of neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have focused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31 participants, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the neural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled, contrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of reading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization task). Our primary result is that all three tasks -- coding, prose reading, and mental rotation -- are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally find more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a neural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later. While preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also provide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice programming.","Endres, Madeline; Karas, Zachary; Hu, Xiaosu; Kovelman, Ioulia; Weimer, Westley",,143,4

This study aimed to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to prospectively predict the expected number of cases without any intervention. The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic, Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated models of population behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the efficacy of current prescriptive measures against disease spread.","Blanco, Natalia; Stafford, Kristen; Lavoie, Marie-Claude; Brandenburg, Axel; Gorna, Maria W.; Health, Matthew Merski Center for International; Education,; Biosecurity,; Medicine, Institute of Human Virology -University of Maryland School of; Baltimore,; USA, Maryland; Epidemiology, Department of; Health, Public; Medicine, University of Maryland School of; Nordita,; Technology, KTH Royal Institute of; University, Stockholm; Stockholm,; Sweden,; Biological,; Centre, Chemical Research; Chemistry, Department of; Warsaw, University of; Warsaw,; Poland,",,143,17

This study, prepared by a large international panel of stroke experts, assesses the rapidly growing research and personal experience with COVID-19 stroke and offers recommendations for stroke management in this challenging new setting: modifications needed for prehospital emergency rescue and hyperacute care; inpatient intensive or stroke units; posthospitalization rehabilitation; follow-up including at-risk family and community; and multispecialty departmental developments in the allied professions. SUMMARY: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses spike proteins binding to tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, most often through the respiratory system by virus inhalation and thence to other susceptible organ systems, leading to COVID-19. Clinicians facing the many etiologies for stroke have been sobered by the unusual incidence of combined etiologies and presentations, prominent among them are vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial dysfunction. International standards of acute stroke management remain in force, but COVID-19 adds the burdens of personal protections for the patient, rescue, and hospital staff and for some even into the postdischarge phase. For pending COVID-19 determination and also for those shown to be COVID-19 affected, strict infection control is needed at all times to reduce spread of infection and to protect healthcare staff, using the wealth of well-described methods. For COVID-19 patients with stroke, thrombolysis and thrombectomy should be continued, and the usual early management of hypertension applies, save that recent work suggests continuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Prothrombotic states, some acute and severe, encourage prophylactic LMWH unless bleeding risk is high. COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy adds risk of cardioembolic stroke, where heparin or warfarin may be preferable, with experience accumulating with DOACs. As ever, arteritis can prove a difficult diagnosis, especially if not obvious on the acute angiogram done for clot extraction. This field is under rapid development and may generate management recommendations which are as yet unsettled, even undiscovered. Beyond the acute management phase, COVID-19-related stroke also forces rehabilitation services to use protective precautions. As with all stroke patients, health workers should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or distress developing in their patients and caregivers. Postdischarge outpatient care currently includes continued secondary prevention measures. Although hoping a COVID-19 stroke patient can be considered cured of the virus, those concerned for contact safety can take comfort in the increasing use of telemedicine, which is itself a growing source of patient-physician contacts. Many online resources are available to patients and physicians. Like prior challenges, stroke care teams will also overcome this one. Key Messages: Evidence-based stroke management should continue to be provided throughout the patient care journey, while strict infection control measures are enforced.","Venketasubramanian, Narayanaswamy; Anderson, Craig; Ay, Hakan; Aybek, Selma; Brinjikji, Waleed; de Freitas, Gabriel R; Del Brutto, Oscar H; Fassbender, Klaus; Fujimura, Miki; Goldstein, Larry B; Haberl, Roman L; Hankey, Graeme J; Heiss, Wolf-Dieter; Lestro Henriques, Isabel; Kase, Carlos S; Kim, Jong S; Koga, Masatoshi; Kokubo, Yoshihiro; Kuroda, Satoshi; Lee, Kiwon; Lee, Tsong-Hai; Liebeskind, David S; Lip, Gregory Y H; Meairs, Stephen; Medvedev, Roman; Mehndiratta, Man Mohan; Mohr, Jay P; Nagayama, Masao; Pantoni, Leonardo; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Parrilla, Guillermo; Pastori, Daniele; Pendlebury, Sarah T; Pettigrew, Luther Creed; Renjen, Pushpendra N; Rundek, Tatjana; Schminke, Ulf; Shinohara, Yukito; Tang, Wai Kwong; Toyoda, Kazunori; Wartenberg, Katja E; Wasay, Mohammad; Hennerici, Michael G",Cerebrovasc Dis,143,21

Emerging data suggests that ""essential"" workers, who are disproportionately more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants, bear a disproportionate degree of risk. We used publicly available data to build a series of spatial autoregressive models assessing county level associations between COVID-19 mortality and (1) percentage of individuals engaged in farm work, (2) percentage of households without a fluent, adult English-speaker, (3) percentage of uninsured individuals under the age of 65, and (4) percentage of individuals living at or below the federal poverty line. We further adjusted these models for total population, population density, and number of days since the first reported case in a given county. We found that across all counties that had reported a case of COVID-19 as of July 12, 2020 (n = 3024), a higher percentage of farmworkers, a higher percentage of residents living in poverty, higher density, higher population, and a higher percentage of residents over the age of 65 were all independently and significantly associated with a higher number of deaths in a county. In urban counties (n = 115), a higher percentage of farmworkers, higher density, and larger population were all associated with a higher number of deaths, while lower rates of insurance coverage in a county was independently associated with fewer deaths. In non-urban counties (n = 2909), these same patterns held true, with higher percentages of residents living in poverty and senior residents also significantly associated with more deaths. Taken together, our findings suggest that farm workers may face unique risks of contracting and dying from COVID-19, and that these risks are independent of poverty, insurance, or linguistic accessibility of COVID-19 health campaigns.","Fielding-Miller, Rebecca K; Sundaram, Maria E; Brouwer, Kimberly",PLoS One,143,24

Methods: A single center, phase I/II, randomized controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted at Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were COVID-19 infected individuals, classified as either severely or critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Participants were randomized through parallel-group design with sequential assignment in a 4:1 allocation to either intervention group with four C-IVIG dosage arms (0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 g/kg), or control group receiving standard of care only (n = 10). Primary outcomes were 28-day mortality, patient's clinical status on ordinal scale and Horowitz index (HI), and were analysed in all randomized participants that completed the follow-up period (intention-to-treat population). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04521309). Findings: Fifty participants were enrolled in the study from June 19, 2020 to February 3, 2021 with a mean age of 56.54±13.2 years of which 22 patients (44%) had severe and 28 patients (56%) had critical COVID-19. Mortality occurred in ten of 40 participants (25%) in intervention group compared to six of ten (60%) in control group, with relative risk reduction in intervention arm I (RR, 0.333; 95% CI, 0.087-1.272), arm II (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.171-1.463), arm III (RR, 0.167; 95% CI, 0.024-1.145), and arm IV (RR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.268-1.660). In intervention group, median HI significantly improved to 359 mmHg [interquartile range (IQR) 127-400, P = 0.009)] by outcome day, while the clinical status of intervention group also improved as compared to control group, with around 15 patients (37.5%) being discharged by 7th day with complete recovery. Additionally, resolution of chest X-rays and restoration of biomarkers to normal levels were also seen in intervention groups. No drug-related adverse events were reported during the study.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational, descriptive, medical records review study was performed on patients with MIS-C admitted to the PICU between September 1 and November 1, 2020. Through medical records review, we confirmed that patients were positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or for COVID-19 exposure history within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with severe MIS-C were included (21 male) with a median age of 9 years. The most common signs and symptoms during disease course were fever (100%) and abdominal pain (75.5%). Clinical features of 63.6% patients were consistent with Kawasaki disease/Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 36.4% were consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Myocardial dysfunction and/or coronary artery abnormalities were detected in 18 patients during the PICU stay. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were given to 33 patients. Anakinra was administered to 23 patients (69.6%). There was a significant increase in lymphocyte and platelet counts and a significant decrease in ferritin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels at the end of the first week of treatment in patients who were given biological therapy. Two patients were switched to tocilizumab because of an insufficient response to anakinra. The mortality rate of MIS-C patients admitted in PICU was 6.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Management of systemic inflammation and shock is important to decrease mortality and the development of persistent cardiac dysfunction in MIS-C. The aggressive treatment approach, including biological agents, may be required in patients with severe symptoms and cardiac dysfunction.","Çelikel, Elif; Tekin, Zahide Ekici; Aydin, Fatma; Emeksiz, Serhat; Uyar, Emel; Özcan, Serhan; Perk, Oktay; Sezer, Müge; Tekgöz, Nilüfer; Coskun, Serkan; Güngörer, Vildan; Gül, Ayse Esin Kibar; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Özbek, Namik; Azili, Müjdem Nur; Acar, Banu Çelikel",J. clin. rheumatol,143,16

The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS: The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively. There is no direct correlation among the number of the selected features, accuracy, and AUC, however, with changes in the number of the selected features, the accuracy and AUC values will change. Feature selection procedure RFE+BAG classifier and RFE+DT classifier achieve the highest prediction accuracy (accuracy: 0.984), followed by MI+Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and logistic regression (LGR)+DT classifiers (accuracy: 0.976).

Rural residents might be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness because, on average, they are older, have higher prevalences of underlying medical conditions, and have more limited access to health care services.* In May, after a cluster of seven COVID-19 cases was identified in a rural Ohio Amish community, access to testing was increased. Among 30 additional residents tested by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit), 23 (77%) received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid and sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with multiple social gatherings. Informant interviews revealed that community members were concerned about having to follow critical mitigation strategies, including social distancing§ and mask wearing.¶ To help reduce the ongoing transmission risk in a community, state and county health department staff members and community leaders need to work together to develop, deliver, and promote culturally responsive health education messages to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and ensure that access to testing services is timely and convenient. Understanding the dynamics of close-knit communities is crucial to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Ali, Hammad; Kondapally, Karthik; Pordell, Paran; Taylor, Brandi; Martinez, Gisela Medina; Salehi, Ellen; Ramseyer, Stacey; Varnes, Susan; Hayes, Nikki; de Fijter, Sietske; Lloyd, Spencer",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,143,16

The effects that survivors experience have been reported but rarely from the point of view of the survivors regarding their life after treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the perceived late effects of pediatric cancer on survivors and their self-identified primary support persons in order to understand the multifaceted nature of living after a pediatric cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Using a pragmatic interpretive phenomenology approach, 10 survivors of pediatric cancer (aged 21-28 years) and 9 of their support persons (aged 23-73 years) participated, completing background questionnaires and semistructured, one-on-one interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Both survivors and support persons acknowledged that survivors experienced negative physical and cognitive health outcomes that require follow-up care. Survivors acknowledged that their cancer experience and residual effects have changed the trajectory of their lives. CONCLUSIONS: Research on young adult survivors of pediatric cancer and the residual/late effects and emotional outcomes they experience is warranted. Longitudinal research can aid in understanding how effects develop or worsen over time. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study support The Children's Oncology Group Long-term Follow-up Guidelines for practitioners. As the frontline caring for these individuals and families, nurses' involvement in transitional care out of treatment is necessary. Continued involvement and understanding of long-term pediatric cancer survivorship for nurses are also imperative for continuity for survivors and families.","Molinaro, Monica L; Fletcher, Paula C",Cancer Nurs,143,26

DESIGN: This study was based on the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey established in early May 2020. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms. The sociodemographic information and routine dietary patterns before and after lockdown of participants were investigated. t tests and &#967;2 tests were used to compare the differences in consumption patterns of twelve major food groups and beverages between sex and across educational levels before and after lockdown. Factor analysis was employed to obtain the main dietary patterns. SETTINGS: China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 082 youths. RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in the average weekly frequency of rice intake, while significant increases were observed in the frequency of intake of wheat products, other staple foods, fish, eggs, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit and dairy products (all P values < 0·01). Heterogeneities of average weekly frequency existed between sex and across educational levels to different extents. The three main dietary patterns derived were loaded most heavily on dairy products, rice and wheat products, separately; the rice pattern became more dominant than the wheat products pattern after lockdown. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased, while the frequency of other beverages had increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our timely survey would inform policymakers and health professionals of these significant changes in youths' dietary patterns after lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents between sex and across educational levels, for better policy-making and public health practice.","Yu, Bin; Zhang, Dong; Yu, Wanqi; Luo, Miyang; Yang, Shujuan; Jia, Peng",Public Health Nutr,143,16

METHODS: We used TriNetX, a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data, which has one of the largest known global COVID-19 database. We included patients with chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorders (aNMD) [myasthenia gravis (MG), inflammatory myositis, and chronic inflammatory neuropathies (CIN)] and MS, based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) coding for one year before January 20th, 2020. We examined the use of IST, rate of COVID- 19, hospitalization, intubation, and mortality among the patients with aNMD and MS. RESULTS: A total of 33,451 patients with aNMD and 42,899 patients with MS were included. Among them, 111 (0.33%) patients with aNMD and 115 patients (0.27%) with MS had COVID-19. About one third of them required hospitalization. IST did not appear to have a significant impact on overall infection risk in either group; however, risk of hospitalization for immunosuppressed patients with aNMD was higher (Odds ratio 2.86, p-value 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: IST use does not appear to make patients with aNMD and MS more vulnerable to COVID-19. IST may be continued during the pandemic, as previously suggested by expert opinion guidelines. However, it is important to consider individualizing immunotherapy regimens in some cases. Additional physician reported registry-based data is needed to further confirm these findings.","Kovvuru, Sukanthi; Nalleballe, Krishna; Onteddu, Sanjeeva Reddy; Sharma, Rohan; Jasti, Madhu; Kapoor, Nidhi; Veerapaneni, Karthika; Yadala, Sisira; Dandu, Vasuki; Archer, Robert; Nowak, Richard J; Roy, Bhaskar",J Neurol Sci,143,21

The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical activity of pediatricians. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and descriptive online survey among pediatricians practicing in Cameroon. Data were collected through an anonymous pre-tested Google Form®. RESULTS: Among the 118 pediatricians eligible for the survey, 101 responded (85.6%), of whom 61.2% were women. The pediatric outpatient consultations dropped significantly from 60.4% of pediatricians seeing more than 30 patients per week before the pandemic to 9.9% during the pandemic (P<0.000). According to the occupancy rate of hospitalisation beds, 45.5% of pediatricians reported having 76-100% of pediatric hospitalisation beds occupied per week before the pandemic but no pediatrician reported a similar rate during the pandemic (P<0.000). There was a significant increase in the use of telehealth, ranging from no pediatrician using telehealth ""very frequently"" before the pandemic to 23.8% using it during the pandemic (P<0.000). Most of the pediatricians had at their disposal surgical masks (96%), care gloves (80.2%), hydroalcoholic gel (99.0%), and soap and water (86.1%). For the management of children, 90.1% and 71.3% of pediatricians experienced difficulties accessing COVID-19 PCR and chloroquine, respectively, and 74.3% declared difficulties for proper isolation of patients. More than half (65.3%) of the pediatricians interviewed were ""very afraid"" or ""extremely afraid"" of being infected with SARS-Cov-2, respectively 45.5% and 19.8%. The most frequent reasons included fear of infecting their relatives (85.1%) and of developing a severe form of the disease (43.6%). The reluctance to consult health services expressed by the parents was due to: fear of being infected when leaving their home and especially in the health facility (96%), strict compliance with confinement (30.7%), and financial difficulties of families (13.9%). CONCLUSION: This work highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the clinical activity of Cameroonian pediatricians. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a significant drop in the use of health facilities, which probably has a negative impact on children's overall level of health. Although the preventive measures explain this drop in attendance at health facilities, the parents' fear of being infected when leaving the house was the predominant reason likely to explain this drop in attendance at health facilities. This could constitute an axis for developing messages to parents to encourage a gradual return to child health services.","Enyama, D; Chelo, D; Noukeu Njinkui, D; Mayouego Kouam, J; Fokam Djike Puepi, Y; Mekone Nkwele, I; Ndenbe, P; Nguefack, S; Nguefack, F; Kedy Koum, D; Tetanye, E",Arch Pediatr,143,1
265674,265674,265674,The Virus II: Triage and Treatment,13.761021,6.1904354,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was identified after a recent outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has generated a global pandemic impacting over 200 countries around the world. Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons. In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic. In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population. Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient treated with natalizumab for relapsing MS who developed COVID-19 and recovered in a few days without complications. RESULTS: After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms. DISCUSSION: This case supports the opportunity to avoid discontinuing or delaying the retreatment over 8 weeks in patients recovered from a recent COVID-19.","Borriello, Giovanna; Ianniello, Antonio",Mult Scler Relat Disord,143,26

We aim to assess the impact of organ injury (OI) on prognosis according to the number of affected organs at admission. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Third Hospital & Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from February 17 to March 22, 2020. We classified the patients according to the presence and number of damaged organs (heart, liver, and kidney). RESULTS: The percentage of patients with no, one, two, or three organs affected was 59.75%, 30.46%, 8.07%, and 1.72%, respectively. With the increasing number of OI, there is a tendency of gradual increase regarding the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen as well as the incidence of most complications. In a Cox regression model, individuals with OI, old age, and an abnormal level of C-reactive protein were at a higher risk of death compared with those without. Patients with three organ injuries had the highest mortality rate [57.9%; hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) vs. patients without OI: 22.31 (10.42-47.77), those with two (23.6%; HR 8.68, 95% CI 4.58-16.48), one (8.6%; HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7), or no OI (2.6%); P < 0.001].

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and implemented population-level dashboards that collate information on individuals tested for and infected with COVID-19, in partnership with state and local public health agencies as well as health systems. The dashboards are deployed on top of a statewide health information exchange. One dashboard enables authorized users working in public health agencies to surveil populations in detail, and a public version provides higher-level situational awareness to inform ongoing pandemic response efforts in communities. RESULTS: Both dashboards have proved useful informatics resources. For example, the private dashboard enabled detection of a local community outbreak associated with a meat packing plant. The public dashboard provides recent trend analysis to track disease spread and community-level hospitalizations. Combined, the tools were utilized 133,637 times by 74,317 distinct users between June 21 and August 22, 2020. The tools are frequently cited by journalists and featured on social media.

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries' characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Compared with Europe, Africa's younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","Diop, Binta Zahra; Ngom, Marieme; Pougué Biyong, Clémence; Pougué Biyong, John N",,143,25

Objective: To develop a risk-based strategy for triaging mammograms during periods of decreased capacity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data collected prospectively from mammography examinations performed in 2014 to 2019 at 92 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Participants included individuals undergoing mammography. Data were analyzed from August 10 to November 3, 2020. Exposures: Clinical indication for screening, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, age, time since last mammogram/screening interval, family history of breast cancer, breast density, and history of high-risk breast lesion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Combinations of clinical indication, clinical history, and breast cancer risk factors that subdivided mammograms into risk groups according to their cancer detection rate were identified using classification and regression trees. Results: The cohort included 898â¯415 individuals contributing 1â¯878â¯924 mammograms (mean [SD] age at mammogram, 58.6 [11.2] years) interpreted by 448 radiologists, with 1â¯722â¯820 mammograms in individuals without a personal history of breast cancer and 156â¯104 mammograms in individuals with a history of breast cancer. Most individuals were aged 50 to 69 years at imaging (1â¯113â¯174 mammograms [59.2%]), and 204â¯305 (11.2%) were Black, 206â¯087 (11.3%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 126â¯677 (7.0%) were Hispanic or Latina, and 40â¯021 (2.2%) were another race/ethnicity or mixed race/ethnicity. Cancer detection rates varied widely based on clinical indication, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, and age. The 12% of mammograms with very high (89.6 [95% CI, 82.3-97.5] to 122.3 [95% CI, 108.1-138.0] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) or high (36.1 [95% CI, 33.1-39.3] to 47.5 [95% CI, 42.4-53.3] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) cancer detection rates accounted for 55% of all detected cancers and included mammograms to evaluate an abnormal mammogram or breast lump in individuals of all ages regardless of breast cancer history, to evaluate breast symptoms other than lump in individuals with a breast cancer history or without a history but aged 60 years or older, and for short-interval follow-up in individuals aged 60 years or older without a breast cancer history. The 44.2% of mammograms with very low cancer detection rates accounted for 13.1% of detected cancers and included annual screening mammograms in individuals aged 50 to 69 years (3.8 [95% CI, 3.5-4.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) and all screening mammograms in individuals younger than 50 years regardless of screening interval (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6-3.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms). Conclusions and Relevance: In this population-based cohort study, clinical indication and individual risk factors were associated with cancer detection and may be useful for prioritizing mammography in times and settings of decreased capacity.","Miglioretti, Diana L; Bissell, Michael C S; Kerlikowske, Karla; Buist, Diana S M; Cummings, Steven R; Henderson, Louise M; Onega, Tracy; O039,; Meara, Ellen S; Rauscher, Garth H; Sprague, Brian L; Tosteson, Anna N A; Wernli, Karen J; Lee, Janie M; Lee, Christoph I",JAMA Netw Open,143,26

While individual clerkships have shared their curricular adaptations via social and academic networking media, there is currently no organizational standard in establishing a non-clinical, Emergency Medicine (EM) virtual rotation (VR). The primary objective of this study was to describe EM clerkship directors' (CDs) perspectives on their experience adapting an EM VR curriculum during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A 21-item survey with quantitative and qualitative questions was disseminated between June and August 2020 to EM CDs via the Clerkship Director of Emergency Medicine (CDEM) Listserv to describe their experience and perspectives in adapting a VR during the spring of 2020. Results: We analyzed 59 out of 77 EM clerkship survey responses. Among respondents, 52% adapted a VR while 47.5% did not. Of those who adapted a VR, 71% of CDs had 2 weeks or less to develop the new curriculum, with 84% reporting usual or increased clinical load during that time. Clerkships significantly diversified their asynchronous educational content and utilized several instructional models to substitute the loss of clinical experience. Reflecting on the experience, 71% of CDs did not feel comfortable writing a standardized letter of evaluation for students based on the VR, with the majority citing inability to evaluate students' competencies in a clinical context. Conclusion: A crisis, such as COVID-19 necessitates change in all facets of medical education. While EM educators demonstrated the ability to create emergency remote learning with limited time, this was not equivalent to the formal development of pre-planned VR experiences. Future faculty development and curriculum innovation are required to fully transition an in-person immersive experience to a non-inferior virtual experience.","Ren, Ronnie; Parekh, Kendra; Franzen, Doug; Estes, Molly; Camejo, Melanie; Olaf, Mark; Zhang, Xiao Chi",AEM Educ Train,143,11

These guidelines include adherence clubs (AC) and decentralized medication delivery (DMD) as two differentiated models of care for stable HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy. While the adherence guidelines do not suggest that provider costs (costs to the healthcare system for medications, laboratory tests and visits to clinics or alternative locations) for stable patients in these differentiated models of care will be lower than conventional, clinic-based care, recent modelling exercises suggest that such differentiated models could substantially reduce provider costs. In the context of continued implementation of the guidelines, we discuss the conditions under which provider costs of care for stable HIV patients could fall, or rise, with AC and DMD models of care in South Africa. DISCUSSION: In prior studies of HIV care and treatment costs, three main cost categories are antiretroviral medications, laboratory tests and general interaction costs based on encounters with health workers. Stable patients are likely to be on the national first-line regimen (Tenofovir/Entricitabine/Efavarinz (TDF/FTC/EFV)), so no difference in the costs of medications is expected. Laboratory testing guidelines for stable patients are the same regardless of the model of care, so no difference in laboratory costs is expected as well. Based on existing information regarding the costs of clinic visits, AC visits and DMD drug pickups, we expect that for some clinics, visit costs for DMD or AC models of care could be less, but modestly so, than for conventional, clinic-based care. For other clinics, however, DMD or AC models could have higher visit costs (see Table 2). CONCLUSIONS: The standard of care for stable patients has already been ""differentiated"" for years in South Africa, prior to the roll out of the new adherence guidelines. AC and DMD models of care, when implemented as envisioned in the guidelines, are unlikely to generate substantive reductions or increases in provider costs of care.","Larson, Bruce A; Pascoe, Sophie Js; Huber, Amy; Long, Lawrence C; Murphy, Joshua; Miot, Jacqui; Fox, Matthew P; Fraser-Hurt, Nicole; Rosen, Sydney",J Int AIDS Soc,143,1

Currently, the COVID-19 epidemic that had largely subsided during last summer is resurging in Hamburg and in other parts of the world, underlining the need for additional tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. AIM: We aimed to develop and validate a simple, low-cost assay for detecting antibodies against the native coronavirus 2 spike protein (CoV-2 S) that does not require recombinant protein or virus. METHOD: We transiently co-transfected HEK cells or CHO cells with expression vectors encoding CoV-2 S and nuclear GFP. Spike protein-specific antibodies in human serum samples bound to transfected cells were detected with fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies by flow cytometry orimmunofluorescence microscopy. We applied this assay to monitor antibody development in COVID-19 patients, household contacts, and hospital personnel during the ongoing epidemic in the city state of Hamburg. RESULTS: All recovered COVID-19 patients showed high levels of CoV-2 S-specific antibodies. With one exception, all household members that did not develop symptoms also did not develop detectable antibodies. Similarly, lab personnel that worked during the epidemic and followed social distancing guidelines remained antibody-negative. CONCLUSION: We conclude that high-titer CoV-2 S-specific antibodies are found in most recovered COVID-19 patients and in symptomatic contacts, but only rarely in asymptomatic contacts.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess self­reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19 in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross­sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, in 4516 nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19 in Poland. The questionnaire included 8 questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID­19, comorbidities, and smoking status. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1942 patients with COVID­19 with a response rate of 43%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2% were women. Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19, 21.3% had hypertension, 4.5% had diabetes, and 3.1% had a chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2% of patients with COVID­19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6% of patients. Almost half of patients (47%) with COVID­19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2% reported diarrhea. Among 1942 interviewed patients, 54.2% reported at least 1 olfactory or taste disorder and 42.5% reported both alterations. Self­reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2% and 47.5%, respectively. Self­reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID­19 was significantly higher (P <0.001) in women than men. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that olfactory and taste disorders are frequent symptoms in patients with mild­to­moderate COVID­19. Moreover, our study indicated sex differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders among nonhospitalized patients with COVID­19.","Sierpinski, Radoslaw; Pinkas, Jaroslaw; Jankowski, Mateusz; Zgliczynski, Wojciech S; Wierzba, Waldemar; Gujski, Mariusz; Szumowski, Lukasz",Pol Arch Intern Med,143,24

SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.","Mutnal, Manohar B; Arroliga, Alejandro C; Walker, Kimberly; Mohammad, Amin; Brigmon, Matthew M; Beaver, Ryan M; Midturi, John K; Rao, Arundhati",J. med. virol,143,10

In 2018, samples from Ross 308 breeding hens aged 35 weeks were delivered for IBV diagnosis. IBV presence was detected, but all attempts to amplify the S gene fragment were negative. The field material was analysed using the Illumina MiSeq platform and a 1073-nt fragment of the S1 coding region was obtained. The gCoV/ck/Poland/516/2018 strain shared only 52.7-58.1% nucleotide identity to any known genotype of IBV and shared the highest identity of 81.4% to the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant. Based on the obtained sequence, a specific molecular test was constructed and used for screening of chicken samples from 35 field cases delivered to our laboratory between 2018 and 2019 for IBV diagnosis. Application of this test enabled detection of another three chicken flocks as positive for this new strain. All positives were identified in commercial layers with egg production problems. To date, the virus has not been detected in broiler chickens. Taking into account the proposed criteria for the definition of a new IBV genotype or lineage, it seems that the detected viruses in Poland, together with the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant, may be classified as separate lineages/genotype in the new IBV classification. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS The new IBV variant is distantly related to other known GI-GVII IBV genotypes/lineages. It affects long-lived birds causing egg production problems. The detected IBV and the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant are candidates for separate lineages in the new GVIII genotype.","Domanska-Blicharz, Katarzyna; Sajewicz-Krukowska, Joanna; Lisowska, Anna",Avian Pathol,143,24

The first aim of this study was to report our experience on the management of neonates from mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection focusing on a 28-day follow-up since birth. The second aim is to assess how many data on neonatal outcomes of the first month of life are reported in literature, performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: We report our experience based on routine management of neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and follow-up until 28 days of life. RESULTS: In our experience at discharge, 1/48 (2.08%) of entrusted (mother refusing personal protective equipment) and none of separated presented positive nasopharyngeal swab (p = NS). All babies show good outcome at 28 days of life. The literature data show that the percentage of positive separated infants is significantly higher than the percentage of infants entrusted to positive mothers with appropriate control measures (13.63 vs. 2.4%; p = 0.0017). Meta-analysis of studies focused on follow-up showed a 2.94% higher risk of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in entrusted newborns than in separated newborns (95% confidence interval: 0.39-22.25), but this was not significant (p = 0.30). CONCLUSION: A vertical transmission in utero cannot be totally excluded. Since in newborns, the disease is often ambiguous with mild or absent symptoms, it is important to define the most efficient joint management for infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers, being aware that the risk of horizontal transmission from a positive mother, when protective measures are applied, does not seem to increase the risk of infection or to affect the development of newborns from birth to first four weeks of life, and encourages the benefits of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin practice. KEY POINTS: · Entrusting the newborn to the positive mother does not increase the risk of infection.. · Our follow-up shows that newborns have good growth and outcome at one month of life.. · Applying protective measures we suggest breastfeeding and skin-to-skin practice..","Falsaperla, Raffaele; Giacchi, Valentina; Lombardo, Giulia; Mauceri, Laura; Lena, Germana; Saporito, Marco Andrea Nicola; Vitaliti, Giovanna; Palumbo, Marco Antonio; Ruggieri, Martino",Am. j. perinatol,143,23

Though SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly via the droplets of respiratory secretions, it was also detected in stool samples of patients, indicating active infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage samples was reported in February 2020, raising the possibility of using environmental water surveillance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 activity in infected areas. The aim of this study was to standardize the methodology for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage and explore the feasibility of establishing supplementary surveillance for COVID-19. Methods: Sewage specimens were collected from six sites in Mumbai, India, using the grab sample method and processed using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran phase separation method for virus concentration. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: A total of 20 sewage samples collected from six different wards in Mumbai city, before the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and during May 11-22, 2020, were processed using the phase separation method. The WHO two-phase PEG-dextran method was modified during standardization. SARS-CoV-2 was found to concentrate in the middle phase only. All samples collected before March 16, 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 negative. Viral RNA was detected in sewage samples collected during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in all the six wards. Interpretation & conclusions: PEG-dextran phase separation method was effectively used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from domestic waste waters to detection levels. It would be feasible to initiate sewage surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 to generate data about the viral transmission in various epidemiologic settings.","Sharma, Deepa Kailash; Nalavade, Uma Prajwal; Kalgutkar, Kamlesh; Gupta, Nivedita; Deshpande, Jagadish Mohanrao",Indian journal of medical research,143,24

METHODS: We retrospectively studied stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MPI studies performed during the peak of COVID-19 restrictions at the University of Alabama Medical Center in comparison to the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: SPECT-MPI volume was reduced from 553 per month in 2019 to 105 per month in 2020. The proportion of abnormal SPECT-MPI for the 2020 cohort (61 ± 13 years, 48% men, 41% black) was not different from the 2019 cohort (62 ± 12 years, 48% men, 42% black) (31% vs. 27%, p = 0.4). Similar proportion of patients in the 2 cohorts had abnormal myocardial perfusion, moderate-large perfusion defects, myocardial ischemia, myocardial scar, and abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction. The proportion of abnormal SPECT-MPIs was not different based on whether patients were evaluated face-to-face or by telemedicine (28% vs. 27%, p > 0.9) but was higher for cardiology providers (40% vs. 20%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in the number of SPECT-MPI studies performed during the peak restrictions from the pandemic. Despite this restriction, the rate of abnormal studies remained stable. Our study suggests that it remains difficult to predict which patients will have abnormal SPECT-MPI even when providers and stress laboratories are forced to prioritize the performance of studies to high-yield patients.","Hasnie, Usman A; Bhambhvani, Pradeep; Iskandrian, Ami E; Hage, Fadi G",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,143,1

We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. METHODS: Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","Chew, Nicholas W S; Lee, Grace K H; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Jing, Mingxue; Goh, Yihui; Ngiam, Nicholas J H; Yeo, Leonard L L; Ahmad, Aftab; Ahmed Khan, Faheem; Napolean Shanmugam, Ganesh; Sharma, Arvind K; Komalkumar, R N; Meenakshi, P V; Shah, Kenam; Patel, Bhargesh; Chan, Bernard P L; Sunny, Sibi; Chandra, Bharatendu; Ong, Jonathan J Y; Paliwal, Prakash R; Wong, Lily Y H; Sagayanathan, Renarebecca; Chen, Jin Tao; Ying Ng, Alison Ying; Teoh, Hock Luen; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Ho, Cyrus S; Ho, Roger C; Sharma, Vijay K",Brain Behav Immun,143,16

As the vaccine of the virus is still not available, the most effective way to combat the virus is testing and social distancing. Among all other detection techniques, the Chest X-ray (CXR) based method can be a good solution for its simplicity, rapidity, cost, efficiency, and accessibility. In this paper, we propose CovMUNET, which is a multiple loss deep neural network approach to detect COVID-19 cases from CXR images. Extensive experiments are performed to ensure the robustness of the proposed algorithm and the performance is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with an accuracy of 96.97% for 3-class classification (COVID-19 vs normal vs pneumonia) and 99.41% for 2-class classification (COVID vs non-COVID).

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe. METHODS: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of ""Coronavirus"" were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika.

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patient's close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS text messages and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: For this study, we aim to perform a preliminary evaluation of the use of the TellYourContacts website, a digital contact notification tool for COVID-19 that can be used confidentially and anonymously. We will gather information about the number of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative Inc (a COVID-19 testing laboratory) and Healthvana (a results disclosure app). Included in the notification was a link to the TellYourContacts website and a message encouraging the person who tested positive for COVID-19 to use the website to alert their close contacts of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18, 2020, to August 17, 2020, we used Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the number of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9130 users accessed the website and 1474 unique senders sent a total of 1957 messages, which included 1820 (93%) SMS text messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 US states, with the majority of US senders residing in California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will use the TellYourContacts website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages. The TellYourContacts website offers an additional method that individuals can and will use to notify their close contacts about a recent COVID-19 diagnosis.","Okpara, Kelechi S; Hecht, Jennifer; Wohlfeiler, Dan; Prior, Matthew; Klausner, Jeffrey D",JMIR Form Res,143,31

The influenza virus, with a constantly mutating genome, is becoming resistant to existing antiviral drugs and vaccines. For that reason, there is an urgent need for developing new therapeutics and therapies. Despite the fact that a new generation of universal vaccines or anti-influenza drugs are being developed, the perfect remedy has still not been found. In this review, various strategies for using nanoparticles (NPs) to defeat influenza virus infections are presented. Several categories of NP applications are highlighted: NPs as immuno-inducing vaccines, NPs used in gene silencing approaches, bare NPs influencing influenza virus life cycle and the use of NPs for drug delivery. This rapidly growing field of anti-influenza methods based on nanotechnology is very promising. Although profound research must be conducted to fully understand and control the potential side effects of the new generation of antivirals, the presented and discussed studies show that nanotechnology methods can effectively induce the immune responses or inhibit influenza virus activity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, with its variety of modification possibilities, nanotechnology has great potential for applications and may be helpful not only in anti-influenza but also in the general antiviral approaches.","Wieczorek, Klaudia; Szutkowska, Barbara; Kierzek, Elzbieta",,143,16

We assessed associations between various social network aspects and practicing behavior to prevent respiratory infectious diseases. METHODS: We analyzed baseline-data (2019) from the SaNAE-cohort on social networks and health, collected by an online questionnaire in Dutch community-dwelling people aged 40-99 years. Outcome was the number of preventive behaviors in past two months [range 0-4]. Associations between network aspects were tested using ordinal regression analyses, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Of 5,128 participants (mean age 63; 54% male), 94% regularly washed hands with water and soap, 55% used only paper (not cloth) handkerchiefs/tissues; 19% touched their face as little as possible; 39% kept distance from people with respiratory infectious disease symptoms; median score of behaviors was 2. Mean network size was 11 (46% family; 27% friends); six network members were contacted exclusively in-person and two exclusively via phone/internet. Participants received informational, emotional, and practical support from four, six, and two network members, respectively. Independently associated with more preventive behaviors were: 'strong relationships', i.e., large share of friends and aspects related to so called 'weak relationships', a larger share of distant living network members, higher number of members with whom there was exclusively phone/internet contact, and more network members providing informational support. Club membership and a larger share of same-aged network members were inversely associated. CONCLUSION: Friends ('strong' relationships) may play an important role in the adoption of infection-preventive behaviors. So may 'weak relationships', e.g. geographically more distant network members, who may provide informational support as via non-physical modes of contact. Further steps are to explore employment of these types of relationships when designing infectious diseases control programs aiming to promote infection-preventive behavior in middle aged-and older individuals.","Steijvers, Lisanne C J; Brinkhues, Stephanie; Hoebe, Christian J P A; van Tilburg, Theo G; Claessen, Vivian; Bouwmeester-Vincken, Noortje; Hamers, Femke; Vranken, Petra; Dukers-Muijrers, Nicole H T M",PLoS One,143,24

Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell.

We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD. The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2. Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with level I-IV tumor thrombus who underwent radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy between January 2014 and April 2019. The patients were categorized into two groups: 86 patients were used to establish the imaging model, and the data validation was conducted in 24 patients. We measured the imaging parameters and used logistic regression to evaluate the uni- and multivariable associations of the clinical and radiographic features of IVC resection and established an image prediction model to assess the probability of IVC vascular wall invasion. Results: In all of the patients, 46.5% (40/86) had IVC vascular wall invasion. The residual IVC blood flow (OR 0.170 [0.047-0.611]; P = 0.007), maximum coronal IVC diameter in mm (OR 1.203 [1.065-1.360]; P = 0.003), and presence of bland thrombus (OR 3.216 [0.870-11.887]; P = 0.080) were independent risk factors of IVC vascular wall invasion. We predicted vascular wall invasion if the probability was >42% as calculated by: {Ln [Pre/(1 - pre)] = 0.185 × maximum cornal IVC diameter + 1.168 × bland thrombus-1.770 × residual IVC blood flow-5.857}. To predict IVC vascular wall invasion, a rate of 76/86 (88.4%) was consistent with the actual treatment, and in the validation patients, 21/26 (80.8%) was consistent with the actual treatment. Conclusions: Our model of multimodal imaging associated with IVC vascular wall invasion may be used for preoperative evaluation and prediction of the probability of partial or segmental IVC resection.","Liu, Zhuo; Li, Liwei; Hong, Peng; Zhu, Guodong; Tang, Shiying; Zhao, Xun; Zhang, Qiming; Wang, Guoliang; He, Wei; Zhang, Hua; Xue, Heng; Cui, Ligang; Ge, Huiyu; Jiang, Jie; Zhang, Shudong; Cao, Fangting; Yan, Jing; Ma, Fengrong; Liu, Cheng; Ma, Lulin; Wang, Shumin",Biomed Res Int,143,33

We aim to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hospital admission or death in adult outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, registered in the Covidom telesurveillance solution for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Paris area, from March to August 2020. The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43 103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD 14.3 years); 93.0% (n = 40 081) of patients were <65 years old and 61.9% (n = 26 688) were women. Of these 43 103 patients, 67.5% (n = 29 104) completed a medical questionnaire on co-morbidities and symptoms. The main reported co-morbidities were asthma (12.8%; n = 3685), hypertension (12.3%; n = 3546) and diabetes (4.8%; n = 1385). A small proportion of all eligible patients (4.1%, 95% CI 3.9-4.2; 1751/43 103) experienced clinical worsening. The rate of hospitalization was 4.0% (95% CI 3.8%-4.2%; n = 1728) and 0.1% (95% CI 0.1%-0.2%; n = 64) died. Factors associated with clinical worsening were male sex, older age, obesity and co-morbidities such as chronic renal disease or cancer under treatment. Probability of worsening was reduced with anosmia/ageusia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical worsening was rare among outpatients. Male sex, older age and co-morbidities such as chronic renal disease, active cancers or obesity were independently associated with clinical worsening. However, our cohort may include patients younger and healthier than the general population.","Yordanov, Youri; Dinh, Aurélien; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Mensch, Arthur; Lescure, François-Xavier; Debuc, Erwan; Jourdain, Patrick; Jaulmes, Luc; Dechartres, Agnes",Clin. microbiol. infect,143,11

As India already has inadequate waste treatment facilities, and the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to significant growth of Bio-medical waste (BMW), consequently safe disposal of a large quantity of waste has become a more serious concern. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of BMW of India before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article highlights the gaps in the implementation of BMW rules in India. This study uses various government and non-government organizations, reports and data specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The finding of the study demonstrated that most of the States/Union Territories (UTs) of India are lacking in terms of COVID-19 waste management. India has generated over 32,996 mt of COVID-19 waste between June and December 2020. During this period, Maharashtra (789.99 mt/month) is highest average generator of COVID-19 waste, followed by Kerala (459.86 mt/month), Gujarat (434.87 mt/month), Tamil Nadu (427.23 mt/month), Uttar Pradesh (371.39 mt/month), Delhi (358.83 mt/month) and West Bengal (303.15 mt/month), and others respectively. We draw attention to the fact that many gaps were identified with compliance of BMW management rules. For example, out of all 35 States/UTs, health care facilitates (HCFs), only eight states received authorization as per BMW management rules. Moreover, the government strictly restricted the practice of deep burials; however, 23 States/UTs are still using the deep burial methods for BMW disposal. The present research suggests that those States/UTs generated on an average of 100 mt/month COVID-19 waste in the last 7 months (June-December 2020) should be considered as a high priority state. These states need special attention to implement BMW rules and should upgrade their BMW treatment capacity.","Rajak, Rahul; Mahto, Ravi Kumar; Prasad, Jitender; Chattopadhyay, Aparajita",Waste Manag Res,143,1

The scientific community has pointed out concerns related to suboptimal performance of certain tests, although a selection of tests with sensitivity and specificity of >99% is available. Neutralizing antibodies represent a generally accepted surrogate marker of immunological protection against viral infections. In COVID-19, we argue that focusing only on neutralizing antibodies may not be necessary and that evidence of spontaneous clearance of COVID-19 may be a reliable surrogate marker of individuals' immune competency toward future reinfections (regardless of its mechanism) for a period of time. Furthermore, current polymerase chain reaction testing lacks the ability to determine the duration of transmissibility, thus alternatives for direct testing of replicating virus are needed. Broadly applied viable virus testing together with serosurveillance will help reopen the economy with more precision and speed, and help guide isolation, quarantine, and cohorting protocols in conglomerate settings such as correctional facilities, nursing facilities, schools, and long-distance travel.","Krsak, Martin; Henao-Martínez, Andrés F; Franco-Paredes, Carlos",Viral immunol,143,16

We aimed to investigate whether M-ATRIA-RS was an independent predictor of mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and compare its discrimination capability with CHADS, CHA2DS2-VASc, and modified CHA2DS2-VASc (mCHA2DS2-VASc)-RS. A total of 1,001 patients were retrospectively analyzed and classified into three groups based on M-ATRIA-RS, designed by changing sex criteria of ATRIA-RS from female to male: Group 1 for points 0-1 (n=448), Group 2 for points 2-4 (n=268), and Group 3 for points &#8805;5 (n=285). Clinical outcomes were defined as in-hospital mortality, need for high-flow oxygen and/or intubation, and admission to intensive care unit. As the M-ATRIA-RS increased, adverse clinical outcomes significantly increased (Group 1, 6.5%; Group 2, 15.3%; Group 3, 34.4%; p <0.001 mortality for in-hospital). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that M-ATRIA-RS, malignancy, troponin increase, and lactate dehydrogenase were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (p<0.001, per scale possibility rate for ATRIA-RS 1.2). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the discriminative ability of M-ATRIA-RS was superior to mCHA2DS2-VASc-RS and ATRIA-RS, but similar to that Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (AUCM-ATRIA vs AUCATRIA Z-test=3.14 p=0.002, AUCM-ATRIAvs. AUCmCHA2DS2-VASc Z-test=2.14, p=0.03; AUCM-ATRIAvs. AUCCCI Z-test=1.46 p=0.14). M-ATRIA-RS is useful to predict in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, it is superior to the mCHA2DS2-VASc-RS in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19 and is more easily calculable than the CCI score.","Aciksari, Gonul; Cetinkal, Gokhan; Kocak, Mehmet; Cag, Yasemin; Atici, Adem; Altunal, Lutfiye Nilsun; Barman, Hasan Ali; Aydin, Mehtap; Kocas, Betul Balaban; Cam, Gulsum; Guclu, Kader Gorkem; Caliskan, Mustafa",Am. j. med. sci,143,16

All heterologous SARS-CoV-2 reinfected ferrets showed active virus replication in the upper respiratory and gastro-intestinal tracts. However, the high NAb titre group showed attenuated viral replication and rapid viral clearance. In addition, direct-contact transmission was observed only from reinfected ferrets with low NAb titres (<20), and not from other groups. Further, lung histopathology demonstrated the presence of limited inflammatory regions in the high NAb titre groups compared with control and low NAb groups.

Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and uncontrolled spreading of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may severely change the pandemic's course by interfering with public health interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations' susceptibility to false claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a strong association between perceived believability of misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Additionally, our study shows that only half of the online users exposed to rumors might have seen the fact-checked information. Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals considered these rumors believable. Our survey also shows that poorer regions are more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation. We discuss implications of our findings on public campaigns that proactively spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the infodemic.

It has infected millions, with more than 275,000 fatal cases as of May 8, 2020. Currently, there are no specific COVID-19 therapies. Most patients depend on mechanical ventilation. Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation, and passive viral neutralization not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation, both of which are limited resources.","Bonam, Srinivasa Reddy; Kaveri, Srini V; Sakuntabhai, Anavaj; Gilardin, Laurent; Bayry, Jagadeesh",Cell Rep Med,143,24

In this study we explore the same philosophy in the context of immunology. Our objective was to assess the correlation of ""size"" (number of edges and minimum vertex cover) of the JAK/STAT network with treatment effect in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), phenotype of viral infection and effect of immunosuppressive agents on a system infected with the coronavirus. We extracted the JAK/STAT pathway from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, hsa04630). The effects of the following drugs, and their combinations, commonly used in RA were tested: methotrexate, prednisolone, rituximab, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and baricitinib. Following viral systems were also tested for their ability to evade the JAK/STAT pathway: Measles, Influenza A, West Nile virus, Japanese B virus, Yellow Fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Kaposi's sarcoma virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, Hendra and Nipah virus and Coronavirus. Good correlation of edges and minimum vertex cover with clinical efficacy were observed (for edge, rho = - 0.815, R2 = 0.676, p = 0.007, for vertex cover rho = - 0.793, R2 = 0.635, p = 0.011). In the viral systems both edges and vertex cover were associated with acuteness of viral infections. In the JAK/STAT system already infected with coronavirus, maximum reduction in size was achieved with baricitinib. To conclude, algebraic and combinatorial invariant of a network may explain its biological behaviour. At least theoretically, baricitinib may be an attractive target for treatment of coronavirus infection.","Banerjee, Arindam; Goswami, Rudra Prosad; Chatterjee, Moumita",Sci Rep,143,20

Eosinopenia was often noticed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but its role is poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and eosinopenia. METHODS: We revised the records of consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our ER-COVID-19 area in order to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without eosinopenia. We considered the following clinical outcomes: 4-weeks survival; need for intensive respiratory support; and hospital discharge. RESULTS: Out of first 107 consecutive patients with pneumonia and a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, 75 patients showed undetectable eosinophil count (absolute eosinopenia). At 4 weeks, 38 patients (38.4%) had required intensive respiratory treatment, 25 (23.4%) deceased and 42 (39.2%) were discharged. Compared with patients without absolute eosinopenia, patients with absolute eosinopenia showed higher need of intensive respiratory treatment (49.3% vs 13.3%, P < .001), higher mortality (30.6% vs 6.2%, P .006) and lower rate of hospital discharge (28% vs 65.6%, P < .001). Binary logistic regression analyses including neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte counts showed that absolute eosinopenia was an independent factor associated with 4-weeks mortality, need for intensive respiratory support and hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute eosinopenia is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and might be used as a marker to discriminate patients with unfavourable prognosis.","Cazzaniga, Massimo; Fumagalli, Luca A M; D039,; angelo, Luciano; Cerino, Mario; Bonfanti, Giulia; Fumagalli, Riccardo M; Schiavo, Gianpaolo; Lorini, Cristina; Lainu, Elisa; Terragni, Sabina; Chiarelli, Marco; Scarazzati, Claudio; Bonato, Claudio; Zago, Mauro",Int J Clin Pract,143,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, ""COVID-19"" and ""Interleukin"". The outcome of interest was prognosis in COVID 19 patients. RESULTS: We performed meta analysis of 16 studies. Higher counts of CD4 and CD8 with Lower Levels of TNF-a, IL2R, IL6, IL8 were observed on patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis; -0.57 (pg/mL) (-1.10, -0.04, p = 0.04), (I2 91%, p < 0.001); -579.84 (U/mL) (-930.11, -229.57, p < 0.001), (I2 96%, p < 0.001); -1.49 (pg/mL) (-1.97, -1.01, p < 0.001), (I2 94%, p < 0.001); -0.80 (pg/mL) (-1.21, -0.40, p < 0.001), (I2 79%, p < 0.001); -2.51 (pg/mL) (-3.64, -1.38, p < 0.00001), (I2 98%, p < 0.001) respectively.

This study aimed to compare the mental health status during the pandemic in the general population of seven middle income countries (MICs) in Asia (China, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). All the countries used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to measure mental health. There were 4479 Asians completed the questionnaire with demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure, and rated their mental health with the IES-R and DASS-21. Descriptive statistics, One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression were used to identify protective and risk factors associated with mental health parameters. There were significant differences in IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 7 MICs (p<0.05). Thailand had all the highest scores of IES-R, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, and depression scores whereas Vietnam had all the lowest scores. The risk factors for adverse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include age <30 years, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries and contact with people with COVID-19 (p<0.05). The protective factors for mental health include male gender, staying with children or more than 6 people in the same household, employment, confidence in doctors, high perceived likelihood of survival, and spending less time on health information (p<0.05).

This article explores the potential value of using triage tests before reference tests when the capacity of the reference test is constrained. METHODS: We developed a simple model with inputs: prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and reference test capacity. We included a case study of rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigens used as triage tests before a reference polymerase chain reaction test. Performance data were obtained from an evaluation performed by an academic center on 425 samples from testing centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. RESULTS: When reference test capacity is constrained, the use of a triage test leads to a relative expansion of the population tested and cases identified; both are higher with a high-specificity triage test. When reference test capacity is not constrained, the potential advantages of introducing a triage test can be assessed using a standard cost-utility framework, balancing the utility of the reduction in the number of reference tests required against the disutility of missed cases associated with the use of a lower-sensitivity triage test. In the constrained case, the advantage of a triage testing strategy in terms of population covered and cases identified is reduced as the prevalence increases. In the unconstrained case, the reduction in reference tests required is reduced and the number of cases missed increase as the prevalence rises. CONCLUSION: When the availability of the reference test is constrained, tests added in a triage position do not need high levels of accuracy to increase the number of cases diagnosed.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality. METHODS: We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors. RESULTS: In the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p < 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p < 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p < 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.","Hermans, Lieke W A; Regis, Marta; Fonseca, Pedro; Overeem, Sebastiaan; Leufkens, Tim R M; Vermeeren, Annemiek; van Gilst, Merel M",Psychopharmacology,143,20

Rapid, accurate, sensitive and user friendly detection method is urgently needed to facilitate early intervention and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a one-pot visual SARS-CoV-2 detection system named ""opvCRISPR"" by integrating reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and Cas12a cleavage in a single reaction system. We demonstrate that the collateral activity against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporters of activated Cas12a triggered by RT-LAMP amplicon increases detection sensitivity and makes detection results observable with naked eye. The opvCRISPR enables detection at nearly single molecule level in 45 min. We validate this method with 50 SARS-CoV-2 potentially infected clinical samples. The opvCRISPR diagnostic results provide 100% agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved quantitative RT-PCR assay. The opvCRISPR holds great potential for SARS-CoV-2 detection in next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics.","Wang, Rui; Qian, Chunyan; Pang, Yanan; Li, Miaomiao; Yang, Yu; Ma, Haijing; Zhao, Manying; Qian, Feng; Yu, Hang; Liu, Zhenping; Ni, Ting; Zheng, Yan; Wang, Yongming",Biosens Bioelectron,143,16

From a total of 1,852 individuals aged &#8805;18 years, 40 deaths occurred between January and June, 2020. In addition, a seroprevalence survey showed that 45% of the adult population have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Verbal autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 as the most likely cause of death in 29 cases. The mean age of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was 76.9±12.1 years, while that of those dying from unrelated causes was 60.3±20.4 years (p=0.003). The overall mortality rate was 21.6 per 1,000 population (95% C.I.: 15.9 - 29.2), almost three-quarters of it due to SARS-CoV-2 (15.7 per 1,000; 95% C.I.: 11 - 22.4). This configures a 266% of excess mortality when compared to 5.9 per 1,000 (95% C.I.: 3.3 - 10.6) deaths from other causes. When SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate was calculated in individuals aged &#8805;60 years, it raised up to 68.9 per 1,000 (95% C.I.: 47.8 - 98.4). After peaking in April and May, mortality significantly decreased.

This study aimed to assess (a) organizational preparedness of hospitals (establishment of screening clinics, COVID-19 wards/committees/intensive care units [ICUs]/operating rooms [ORs]), (b) type of major/minor surgeries performed, and (c) employee well-being (determined by salary deductions, paid leave provisions, and work in-rotation). METHODS: This online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was distributed to 480 oncosurgeons across India. We used &#967;2 statistics to compare responses across geographical areas (COVID-19 lockdown zones and city tiers) and type of organization (government/private, academic/nonacademic, and dedicated/multispecialty hospitals). P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Total of 256 (53.3%) oncologists completed the survey. About 206 hospitals in 85 cities had screening clinics (98.1%), COVID-19 dedicated committees (73.7%), ward (67.3%), ICU's (49%), and OR's (36%). Such preparedness was higher in tier-1 cities, government, academic, and multispecialty hospitals. Dedicated cancer institutes continued major surgeries in all oncological subspecialties particularly in head and neck (P = .006) and colorectal oncology (P = .04). Employee well-being was better in government hospitals. CONCLUSION: Hospitals have implemented strategies to continue cancer care. Despite limited resources, the significant risk associated and financial setbacks amidst nationwide lockdown, oncosurgeons are striving to prioritize and balance the oncologic needs and safety concerns of cancer patients across the country.","Singh, Hemant Kumar; Patil, Vijayraj; Chaitanya, Ganne; Nair, Deepa",J. surg. oncol,143,16

In the current study, we applied our adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based vaccine, MVC-COV1901, to hamster models to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from virus challenge. Golden Syrian hamsters immunized intramuscularly with two injections of 1 µg or 5 µg of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2. Prior to virus challenge, the vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies with 10,000-fold higher IgG level and an average of 50-fold higher pseudovirus neutralizing titers in either dose groups than vehicle or adjuvant control groups. Six days after infection, vaccinated hamsters did not display any weight loss associated with infection and had significantly reduced lung pathology and most importantly, lung viral load levels were reduced to lower than detection limit compared to unvaccinated animals. Vaccination with either 1 µg or 5 µg of adjuvanted S-2P produced comparable immunogenicity and protection from infection.

METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients.","Marcos, Miguel; Belhassen-García, Moncef; Sánchez-Puente, Antonio; Sampedro-Gomez, Jesús; Azibeiro, Raúl; Dorado-Díaz, Pedro-Ignacio; Marcano-Millán, Edgar; García-Vidal, Carolina; Moreiro-Barroso, María-Teresa; Cubino-Bóveda, Noelia; Pérez-García, María-Luisa; Rodríguez-Alonso, Beatriz; Encinas-Sánchez, Daniel; Peña-Balbuena, Sonia; Sobejano-Fuertes, Eduardo; Inés, Sandra; Carbonell, Cristina; López-Parra, Miriam; Andrade-Meira, Fernanda; López-Bernús, Amparo; Lorenzo, Catalina; Carpio, Adela; Polo-San-Ricardo, David; Sánchez-Hernández, Miguel-Vicente; Borrás, Rafael; Sagredo-Meneses, Víctor; Sanchez, Pedro-Luis; Soriano, Alex; Martín-Oterino, José-Ángel",PLoS One,143,10

In this review, we explored the potential siddha strategies for covid - 19 infections. Aim and objectives: To evaluate the additional benefits of siddha drugs Vasantha kusumakaram mathirai, Thippili rasayanam, Adathodai manapagu and Kabasura kudineer compared to the allopathic standard of care alone in COVID-19 mild - moderate cases. Materials and Methods: The present study was an open label Two arm - randomized controlled interventional clinical study. The Group I patients were assigned to Siddha add on treatment whereas Group II subjects were assigned with standard treatment alone. The patients recruited for the study were Covid 19 RT-PCR +ve patients declared by Tamil Nadu Government and admitted in IPD (in patient ward) at Omandurar Government Medical College Hospital. The sample size was 100 for each group. Result: Among the gender distribution observed in Group I and Group II, 71, 69 were males and 29, 31 were females respectively. The mean age of patients was observed as 42.98 in Group I and 45.68 in Group II. The average number of days taken for reduction of symptoms after the treatment was 3.21 and 5.13 in Group I and Group II respectively (n=100). The Group I showed significant results (P<0.001) when compared with Group II. The real - time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) investigation turned negative for 78.33% in Group I and 33.33% in Group II patients after 11-14 days duration of treatment. Similarly, the before and after Computed tomography (CT) chest, Ground glass opacities covid pattern lung involvement percentage showed highly significant reduction (P<0.0001) in Group I, when compared with Group II, which showed significant reduction (P<0.001) for the same. In addition, Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) ratio, showed significant reduction (P<0.01) when analyzed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Renal and Liver parameters were observed within the normal limits when analyzed after treatment for 25 samples in Group I. Conclusion: Finally, it was concluded that Siddha add on Group showed accelerated recovery for Covid - 19 patients compared to standard treatment Group.

States' actions to address the pandemic have varied widely, and federal and state officials have provided conflicting messages. This fragmented approach has surely cost time and lives. Federalism will shape the long-term health and economic impacts of COVID-19, including plans for the future, for at least two reasons: First, federalism exacerbates inequities, as some states have a history of underinvesting in social programs, especially in certain communities. Second, many of the states with the deepest needs are poorly equipped to respond to emergencies due to low taxes and distrust of government, leading to inadequate infrastructure. These dynamics are not new, but they have been laid bare by this crisis. What can policy makers do to address the inequities in health and economic outcomes that federalism intensifies?

However, methodological advances in electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates, including simultaneous recordings in multiple brain regions, have recently begun to reveal the pulvinar's functional contributions to selective attention. These new findings suggest that the pulvinar is critical for the efficient transmission of sensory information within and between cortical regions, both synchronizing cortical activity across brain regions and controlling cortical excitability. These new findings further suggest that the pulvinar's influence on cortical processing is embedded in a dynamic selection process that balances sensory and motor functions within the large-scale network that directs selective attention.","Kastner, Sabine; Fiebelkorn, Ian C; Eradath, Manoj K",Curr Opin Neurobiol,143,20

Peripheral blood samples were collected to compare the differences in the phenotype and functions of major populations of immune cells between the two groups of patients. The result shows that the proportions of CD3+ CD8+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD27- effector T killer cells generally declined, whereas that of CD3+ CD4+ CD8+ double-positive T cells (DPTs) increased in the persistently PCR-positive patients. In summary, considering the imbalance between effector T killer cells/CD3+CD4+CD8+ DPTs was a possible key factor for PCR-negative conversion in patients with COVID-19.","Yu, Hai-Bin; Wang, Wen-Jing; Tang, Shan; Chen, De-Xi; Xu, Bin",J Med Virol,143,10

Hence, in this study, the impact of climate and urban factors on confirmed cases of COVID-19 (a new type of coronavirus) with the trend and multivariate linear regression (MLR) has been investigated to propose a more accurate prediction model. For this propose, some important climate parameters, including daily average temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, in addition to urban parameters such as population density, were considered, and their impacts on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. The analysis was performed for three case studies in Italy, and the application of the proposed method has been investigated. The impacts of parameters have been considered with a delay time from one to nine days to find out the most suitable combination. The result of the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impact of climate parameters on the trend of confirmed cases. The research hypothesis approved by the MLR model and the present assessment method could be applied by considering several variables that exhibit the exact delay of them to new confirmed cases of COVID-19.","Pirouz, B.; Haghshenas, S.

This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the ""wrong virus"" at the ""wrong time""). These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.

This strategy will need to be maintained until herd immunity is achieved, hopefully through vaccination rather than natural infection. We suggest that a pure test-trace-isolate strategy is likely not practicable in most countries, and a degree of social distancing, ranging up to full lockdown, is the main public-health tool to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by reliable surveillance data, distancing should be continuously optimised down to the lowest sustainable level that guarantees a low and stable infection rate in order to balance its wide-ranging negative effects on public health. The qualitative mixture of social-distancing measures also needs to be carefully optimised in order to minimise social costs.","Lytras, Theodore; Tsiodras, Sotirios",Scand J Public Health,143,18

The objective of this case series is to describe early neonatal outcomes and inpatient management in U.S. hospitals. STUDY DESIGN: We solicited cases of mother-infant dyads affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the Better Outcomes through Research for Newborns (BORN) Network members. Using a structured case template, participating sites contributed deidentified, retrospective birth hospitalization data for neonates &#8805;35 weeks of gestation at birth with mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before delivery. We describe demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical management, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen U.S. hospitals contributed 70 cases. Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for 66 (94%) neonates in which 4 (6%) required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. None required evaluation or treatment for infection, and all who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative (n = 57). Half of the dyads were colocated (n = 34) and 40% directly breastfed (n = 28). Outpatient follow-up data were available for 13 neonates, all of whom remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: In this multisite case series of 70 neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical outcomes were overall good, and there were no documented neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical management was largely inconsistent with contemporaneous U.S. COVID-19 guidelines for nursery care, suggesting concerns about the acceptability and feasibility of those recommendations. Longitudinal studies are urgently needed to assess the benefits and harms of current practices to inform evidence-based clinical care and aid shared decision-making. KEY POINTS: · Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for late preterm and term infants with maternal COVID-19.. · Nursery management of dyads affected by COVID-19 varied between hospitals.. · Adherence to contemporaneous U.S. clinical guidelines for nursery care was low.. · Breastfeeding rates were lower for dyads roomed separately than those who were colocated..","Congdon, Jayme L; Kair, Laura R; Flaherman, Valerie J; Wood, Kelly E; LoFrumento, Mary Ann; Nwaobasi-Iwuh, Eberechi; Phillipi, Carrie A",Am J Perinatol,143,20

AIM: To explore patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for palliative care, service planning and research. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis and population-based modelling of routine data. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All deaths registered in England and Wales between 7 March and 15 May 2020. We described the following mortality categories by age, gender and place of death: (1) baseline deaths (deaths that would typically occur in a given period); (2) COVID-19 deaths and (3) additional deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19. We estimated the proportion of people who died from COVID-19 who might have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic using simple modelling with explicit assumptions. RESULTS: During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, there were 101,614 baseline deaths, 41,105 COVID-19 deaths and 14,520 additional deaths. Deaths in care homes increased by 220%, while home and hospital deaths increased by 77% and 90%, respectively. Hospice deaths fell by 20%. Additional deaths were among older people (86% aged â©¾ 75 years), and most occurred in care homes (56%) and at home (43%). We estimate that 22% (13%-31%) of COVID-19 deaths occurred among people who might have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in palliative care needs.

Trust, important in all patient-provider relationships, is difficult to build in such communities, particularly when stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now COVID-19, is widespread. CHWs, responsible for bringing people back into care, must repair trust. In South Africa, where a national CHW programme is being rolled out, marginalised communities have high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and injury. OBJECTIVES: In this complex social environment, we explored CHW workplace trust, interpersonal trust between the patient and CHW, and the institutional trust patients place in the health system. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Within the observation phase of a 3-year intervention study, we conducted interviews, focus groups and observations with patients, CHWs, their supervisors and, facility managers in Sedibeng. RESULTS: CHWs had low levels of workplace trust. They had recently been on strike demanding better pay, employment conditions and recognition of their work. They did not have the equipment to perform their work safely, and some colleagues did not trust, or value, their contribution. There was considerable interpersonal trust between CHWs and patients, however, CHWs' efforts were hampered by structural poverty, alcohol abuse and no identification documents among long-term migrants. Those supervisors who understood the extent of the poverty supported CHW efforts to help the community. When patients had withdrawn from care, often due to nurses' insensitive behaviour, the CHWs' attempts to repair patients' institutional trust often failed due to the vulnerabilities of the community, and lack of support from the health system. CONCLUSION: Strategies are needed to build workplace trust including supportive supervision for CHWs and better working conditions, and to build interpersonal and institutional trust by ensuring sensitivity to social inequalities and the effects of structural poverty among healthcare providers. Societies need to care for everyone.","Anstey Watkins, Jocelyn; Griffiths, Frances; Goudge, Jane",BMJ Open,143,30

Methods: An observational, longitudinal, prospective, and multicenter study of hospitalized Mexican patients was made. We assessed the prevalence of myocardial injury and its relationship with complications and mortality. Results: 254 COVID-19 patients were included. Their average age was 53.8 years old, 167 (65.7%) were male and 87 (34.3%) female. According to troponin levels, two populations were generated, those with and without myocardial injury. There was no difference in gender or age between both groups. However, there was a greater proportion of obesity and hypertension in myocardial injury group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that obesity (OR 2.029, 95% CI 1.039-3.961; p=0.038), arterial oxygen saturation <90% (OR 2.250, 95% CI 1.216-3.560; p=0.025), and systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg (OR 2.636, 95% CI 1.530-4.343; p=0.042), were directly related to higher levels of troponins. Multivariate cox proportional hazards analysis showed that primary endpoint (mortality) was determined by overweight/obesity (OR 1.290, 95% CI 0.115-0.730; p=0.009), ferritin levels (OR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.001; p<0.001), myocardial injury (OR 3.764, 95% CI 1.307-10.838; p=0.014), septic shock (OR 4.104, 95% CI 1.142-14.132; p=0.024), acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 3.001, 95% CI 1.008-10.165; p=0.040), and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (OR 0.357, 95% IC 0.133-0.955; p=0.040) .Secondary endpoint (Mechanical ventilation risk) was associated to the same factors.

Here we report the clinical features of 66 hemodialysis patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 1 January to 5 March 2020; the final date of follow-up was 25 March 2020. RESULTS: The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11.0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died. According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group. A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p < .05). More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.439; p = .044; OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.026 to 1.875; p = .034, OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 3.315 to 6.263; p = .007, respectively).

We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 69 793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until 8 April 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users, and 1577 patients were nonusers. In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (Pâ <â .001). However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; Pâ =â .60). No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.

The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for all patients diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis who underwent SAVR with CABG or TAVR with PCI during the years 2016-2017. Study outcomes included all-cause in-hospital mortality, acute stroke, pacemaker insertion, vascular complications, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, sepsis, non-home discharge, length of stay and cost. Outcomes of hospitalization were modeled using logistic regression for binary outcomes and generalized linear models for continuous outcomes. Overall, 31,205 patients were included (TAVRâ¯+â¯PCI=2,185, SAVRâ¯+â¯CABG=29,020). In reference to SAVRâ¯+â¯CABG, recipients of TAVRâ¯+â¯PCI were older with mean age 82 vs 73 years, effect size (d) =0.9, had higher proportions of females 47.6% vs 26.6%, d= 0.4 and higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure. On multivariable analysis, TAVRâ¯+â¯PCI was associated with lowers odds for mortality adjusted OR: 0.32 [95%CI: 0.17 - 0.62] p=0.001, lower odds for acute kidney injury, sepsis, non-home discharge, shorter length of stay and higher odds for vascular complications, need for pacemaker insertion and higher cost. The occurrence of stroke was similar between both groups. In conclusion, results from real-world observational data shows less rates of mortality and periprocedural complications in TAVRâ¯+â¯PCI compared to SAVRâ¯+â¯CABG.","Abugroun, Ashraf; Osman, Mohammed; Awadalla, Saria; Klein, Lloyd",,143,16

However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. METHODS: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. RESULTS: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis. The management protocol for patients with stroke and COVID-19 should include a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed.","Barrios-López, J M; Rego-García, I; Muñoz Martínez, C; Romero-Fábrega, J C; Rivero Rodríguez, M; Ruiz Giménez, J A; Escamilla-Sevilla, F; Mínguez-Castellanos, A; Fernández Pérez, M D",Neurologia,143,13

The practice and scope of surgery and medicine transformed radicially as the virus spread across the world. There is an urgent need to understand the outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients who undergo surgery. We present a comprehensive review of the current literature on the management of surgical patients who develop COVID-19. FINDINGS: Poor outcomes were most frequent in general surgery or oncological surgery patients who were older with chronic comorbidities. In contrast, outcomes among transplant surgery and obstetric patients were not signficantly altered by COVID-19. Surgical societies have released specialty specific guidelines on the managment of patients who require surgical care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality in surgical patients. Data is currently limited, often restricted to single sites and smaller cohorts. As the sequelae of the virus is better understood, the revisions to the guidelines on managment of surgical patients may help improve outcomes.","Aziz, Hassan; Filkins, Alexandra; Kwon, Yong Kyong",Am Surg,143,10

It is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to develop a severe disease. This study was designed to determine the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients associated with the development of pneumonia and factors associated with disease progression. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with etiologically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China from December 27, 2019 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed-up to March 16, 2020. Differences in clinical and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without were determined by the &#967;2 test or the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and independent group t test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables). The Cox proportional hazard model and Generalized Estimating Equations were applied to evaluate factors that predicted the progression of COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean incubation was 8.67 (95% confidence interval, 6.78-10.56) days. Mean duration from the first test severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive to conversion was 11.38 (9.86-12.90) days. Compared to pneumonia-free patients, pneumonia patients were 16.5 years older and had higher frequencies of having hypertension, fever, and cough and higher circulating levels of neutrophil proportion, interleukin-6, low count (< 190/µl) of CD8+ T cells, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Thirteen patients deteriorated during hospitalization. Cox regression analysis indicated that older age and higher serum levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate at admission significantly predicted the progression of COVID-19. During hospitalization, circulating counts of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were lower, whereas neutrophil proportion, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the circulating levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocyte count in pneumonia patients did not recover when discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitionin, interleukin-6, and lactate might predict COVID-19 progression. T lymphocyte, especially CD8+ cell-mediated immunity is critical in recovery of COVID-19. This study may help in predicting disease progression and designing immunotherapy for COVID-19.","Yang, Peng-Hui; Ding, Yi-Bo; Xu, Zhe; Pu, Rui; Li, Ping; Yan, Jin; Liu, Ji-Luo; Meng, Fan-Ping; Huang, Lei; Shi, Lei; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Qin, En-Qiang; Zhao, Min; Zhang, Da-Wei; Zhao, Peng; Yu, Ling-Xiang; Wang, Zhao-Hai; Hong, Zhi-Xian; Xiao, Zhao-Hui; Xi, Qing; Zhao, De-Xi; Yu, Peng; Zhu, Cai-Zhong; Chen, Zhu; Zhang, Shao-Geng; Ji, Jun-Sheng; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Cao, Guang-Wen",Infect Dis Poverty,143,1

METHODS: 127 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Demographics, symptoms, underlying diseases and laboratory data were collected and assessed for predictive value. RESULTS: Of 127 COVID-19 patients, 16 cases (12.60%) were classified into the severe group. High level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reaction protein (CRP) and hypertension were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. The risk model based on IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, the baseline IL-6 was positively correlated with other immune-inflammatory parameters and the dynamic change of IL-6 in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that high level of IL-6, CRP and hypertension were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of COVID-19. The risk model established upon IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest predictability in this study. Besides, IL-6 played a pivotal role in the severity of COVID-19 and had a potential value for monitoring the process of severe cases.","Zhu, Zhe; Cai, Ting; Fan, Lingyan; Lou, Kehong; Hua, Xin; Huang, Zuoan; Gao, Guosheng",Int J Infect Dis,143,1

New challenges have arisen, such as demand on supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the implications of social distancing on staff, patients, and their families. Despite the pandemic, the need to deliver safe, urgent congenital cardiac surgery has remained. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how Lean methodology can improve PPE supply chain demand and reduce staff exposure to children with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We implemented the define, measure, analyze, improve, and control method (DMAIC) and Value Stream Maps to eliminate waste steps during testing for SARS-CoV-2 for children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. RESULTS: Following a 3-week period of implementation of this new value stream map, we reduced PPE set usage from 13 to 1 per patient, resulting in an annual saving of over 36,000 and reducing single-use plastic waste by nearly 70 000 pieces per annum. We reduced numbers of staff exposed to patients with an unknown SARS-CoV-2 status from 13 to 1. CONCLUSION: The use of Lean methodology can reduce waste of PPE and plastic, resulting in cost savings, while reducing staff exposure when testing patients with congenital cardiac disease for SARS-CoV-2. By preventing admission of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, we can reduce use of isolation beds and prevent cancellation of surgery, improving patient flow and departmental efficiency. Other departments in our institution are implementing similar admission pathways to allow surgical services to restart during the ongoing pandemic.","Sheehan, John Robert; Lyons, Barry; Holt, Francesca",Paediatr Anaesth,143,1

The discovery of its homologue, ACE2, 20 years ago has led to intensive comparisons of these two enzymes revealing surprising structural, catalytic and functional distinctions between them. ACE2 plays multiple roles not only as a vasopeptidase but also as a regulator of amino acid transport and serendipitously as a viral receptor, mediating the cellular entry of the coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, very recently, COVID-19. Catalytically, ACE2 functions as a monocarboxypeptidase principally converting the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to the vasodilatory peptide Ang-(1-7) thereby counterbalancing the action of ACE on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and providing a cardioprotective role. Unlike ACE, ACE2 does not metabolise bradykinin nor is it inhibited by classical ACE inhibitors. However, it does convert a number of other regulatory peptides in vitro and in vivo. Interest in ACE2 biology and its potential as a possible therapeutic target has surged in recent months as the COVID-19 pandemic rages worldwide. This review highlights the surprising discoveries of ACE2 biology during the last 20 years, its distinctions from classical ACE and the therapeutic opportunities arising from its multiple biological roles.","Hooper, Nigel M; Lambert, Daniel W; Turner, Anthony J",Clin Sci (Lond),143,16

In particular, circular migration remains poorly captured as circular migrants move back and forth between source and destination regions. Based on survey data from rural Bihar, an important source region of migration in India, this paper finds that a vast majority of migrants work and live in precarity in predominantly urban and prosperous destinations across India. However, those at the lowest rungs of the social and economic ladder in source regions-the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, other backward classes I and the labouring class-are the worst off at destination; they are part of the most precarious shorter-term migration streams, earn the lowest incomes, have the poorest conditions of work, and live in the harshest circumstances. The paper shows that social and economic hierarchies, and in turn, precarity in source region is reproduced at destination, and, thus, there is little evidence that spatial mobility is associated with social mobility. Focusing on migrants' location, work, employment, income, housing, and access to basic services at destination, the paper foregrounds migrant precarity and adds to a small body of empirical literature that is significant in understanding the spatial and structural elements of circular migration in India and in turn, the migration crisis that emerged as a result of the economic shock of the COVID 19 pandemic.","Datta, Amrita",Indian J Labour Econ,143,24

Candidates for repurposing include drugs that target COVID-19 pathobiology, including agents that alter angiotensin signalling. Recent data indicate that key findings in COVID-19 patients include thrombosis and endotheliitis. Activation of proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), in particular by the serine protease thrombin, is a critical element in platelet aggregation and coagulation. PAR1 activation also impacts on the actions of other cell types involved in COVID-19 pathobiology, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells.

However, concerns have been increasingly raised that relying on the potential of BECCS to achieve negative emissions could result in delayed reductions in gross CO2 emissions, with consequent high-risk of overshooting global temperature targets. We focus on two particular issues; the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that one ton of CO2 captured in the growth of biomass equates to one ton of CO2 sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO2 is emitted by variable amounts during the life cycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political, and economic factors. Here, we question whether, because of the limited sustainable supply of biomass, BECCS should continue to be considered the dominant NET in IPCC and other scenarios achieving the Paris targets, or should it be deemed no longer fit for purpose?","Jones, Michael B; Albanito, Fabrizio",,143,1

Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. CONCLUSIONS: in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients. These findings should be confirmed in larger, prospective, adequately powered studies.","Macaya, Fernando; Espejo Paeres, Carolina; Valls, Adrián; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; González Del Castillo, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, Javier; Runkle, Isabelle; Rubio Herrera, Miguel Ángel",Nutr. hosp,143,21

Following vicarious exposure, positive psychological outcomes, such as vicarious posttraumatic growth (VPTG), are also likely, though they are less studied. The present study aims to examine (a) the associations among STS, VPTG, and coping strategies among HCWs during the COVID-19 lockdown and (b) the mediating role of coping strategies in the STS-VPTG relationship. METHOD: Cross-sectional online data were collected amid the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece (March 23, 2020 through May 3, 2020) from a sample of 647 HCWs (25% men, 75% women). The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, the Post Traumatic Growth Inventory, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory were used to measure STS, VPTG, and coping strategies, respectively. RESULTS: HCWs reported moderate to low levels of STS and VPTG, with the VPTG dimensions of personal strength and appreciation of life being the highest categories. Intrusions mental and both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies predicted VPTG. Adaptive coping strategies partially mediated the relationship between STS and VPTG, whereas maladaptive coping strategies fully mediated this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the coping responses during lockdown among HCWs is important for developing tailored prevention and intervention actions to protect the populations at risk from the deleterious impacts of uncontrollable and life-threatening diseases and promote posttraumatic growth.

While primarily run on CPUs in HPC clusters, these algorithms have been shown to scale in performance when developed to be run on massively parallel architectures such as GPUs. While parallelizing existing SBI algorithms provides us with performance gains, this might not be the most efficient way to utilize the achieved parallelism. This work proposes a new algorithm, that builds on an existing SBI method - Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo(ABC-SMC). This new algorithm is designed to utilize the parallelism not only for performance gain, but also toward qualitative benefits in the learnt parameters. The key idea is to replace the notion of a single 'step-size' hyperparameter, which governs how the state space of parameters is explored during learning, with step-sizes sampled from a tuned Beta distribution. This allows this new ABC-SMC algorithm to more efficiently explore the state-space of the parameters being learnt. We test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to learn parameters for an epidemiology model running on a Tesla T4 GPU. Compared to the parallelized state-of-the-art SBI algorithm, we get similar quality results in $\sim 100$x fewer simulations and observe ~80x lower run-to-run variance across 10 independent trials.","Kulkarni, Sourabh; Moritz, Csaba Andras",,143,22

Most countries are well connected on a global scale, making it nearly impossible to implement perfect and prompt mitigation strategies for infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, due to the explosive growth of international travel, the complex network of human mobility enabled the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally. OBJECTIVE: South Korea was one of the earliest countries to be affected by COVID-19. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, South Korea has implemented and maintained stringent interventions, such as large-scale epidemiological investigations, rapid diagnosis, social distancing, and prompt clinical classification of severely ill patients with appropriate medical measures. In particular, South Korea has implemented effective airport screenings and quarantine measures. In this study, we aimed to assess the country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 and investigate its impact on the local transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: The country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 in South Korea was assessed. We investigated the relationships between country-specific imported cases, passenger numbers, and the severity of country-specific COVID-19 prevalence from January to October 2020. We assessed the country-specific risk by incorporating country-specific information. A renewal mathematical model was employed, considering both imported and local cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Furthermore, we estimated the basic and effective reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The risk of importation from China was highest between January and February 2020, while that from North America (the United States and Canada) was high from April to October 2020. The R0 was estimated at 1.87 (95% CI 1.47-2.34), using the rate of &#945;=0.07 for secondary transmission caused by imported cases. The Rt was estimated in South Korea and in both Seoul and Gyeonggi. CONCLUSIONS: A statistical model accounting for imported and locally transmitted cases was employed to estimate R0 and Rt. Our results indicated that the prompt implementation of airport screening measures (contact tracing with case isolation and quarantine) successfully reduced local transmission caused by imported cases despite passengers arriving from high-risk countries throughout the year. Moreover, various mitigation interventions, including social distancing and travel restrictions within South Korea, have been effectively implemented to reduce the spread of local cases in South Korea.","Lee, Hyojung; Kim, Yeahwon; Kim, Eunsu; Lee, Sunmi",JMIR Public Health Surveill,143,16

METHODS: Hypoxic and awake patients with probable COVID 19 pneumonia who were referred to the Ankara City Hospital Emergency Department from 1 April to 31 May 2020 were included in this prospective study. Patients were transported in prone position and fixed on the stretcher. During the transport, patients continued receiving 2â¯l per minute oxygen with nasal cannula. Arterial blood gases were obtained from the patients before and after transport. The transport time was recorded as minutes. The primary outcome of the study is the increase of partial oxygen value in the arterial blood gas of patients after transport. RESULTS: It was found that pO2 and SpO2 end values were statistically significantly higher in the patient group compared to the initial values. In the group with transport duration of more than 15â¯min, a difference was found between the initial and end values in pO2 and SpO2 parameters similar to the whole group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the initial and end values in the group with transport duration of 15â¯min or below. CONCLUSIONS: Awake hypoxemic patients can be transported without complications in prone position during transport. Transports more than 15â¯min, prone position may be recommended because the partial oxygen pressure of the patients increases.","San, Ishak; Yildirim, Çagdas; Bekgöz, Burak; Gemcioglu, Emin",Am. j. emerg. med,143,16

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data from the United Kingdom and Spain. In the UK, we consider the National Health Service at the level of trusts and define a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates the four nearest neighbours of any given trust. In Spain we coarse-grain the healthcare system at the level of autonomous communities, and extract similar contact networks. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity. Our framework is general and flexible allowing for additional criteria, alternative cost functions, and can be extended to other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand, we show that it is possible to enable access to ICU for up to 1000 additional cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm. Under a more realistic and heterogeneous demand, our method is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system only using local sharing, and over 1300 using countrywide sharing, potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU.","Lacasa, Lucas; Challen, Robert; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Danon, Leon",PLoS One,143,8

About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals, and scientists play a key role in addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick. In this article, we discuss these issues.","Carbone, Michele; Lednicky, John; Xiao, Shu-Yuan; Venditti, Mario; Bucci, Enrico",J Thorac Oncol,143,16

Adults 18 years or older (N = 407) completed an online survey that included demographic, household, and employment information along with standardized measures of psychological distress (State-Trait Anxiety and Beck Depression) and relationship functioning-either the Dyadic Adjustment Scale if there were no children in the household or a Basic Family Relations Evaluation Questionnaire (CERFB) measuring conjugal, parental, and coparental functions. Qualitative analyses of responses to an open-ended question about perceived changes in couple or family dynamics during lockdown revealed nine specific themes comprising two overarching categories: relational improvement and deterioration. The overall prevalence of improvement themes (61.7%) exceeded deterioration themes (41.0%), with increased (re)connection and conflict atmosphere cited most often. Quantitative analyses found elevated levels of state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression during lockdown. Consistent with the qualitative results, couples having no children at home reported high levels of dyadic adjustment, but with children present CERFB parental functioning exceeded conjugal functioning, a pattern sometimes associated with child triangulation into adult conflicts. Although correlates of psychological distress (e.g., unemployment, perceived economic risk) were relatively stable across subgroups, predictors of relationship functioning varied substantially with household/parental status (e.g., telecommuting and employment facilitated conjugal functioning only for couples with children).","Günther-Bel, Cristina; Vilaregut, Anna; Carratala, Eduard; Torras-Garat, Sonia; Pérez-Testor, Carles",Fam Process,143,5

While data suggests that COVID-19 is not associated with significant adverse health outcomes for pregnant women and newborns, the psychological impact on pregnant women is likely to be high. AIM: The aim was to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian pregnant women, especially regarding concerns and birth expectations. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of pregnant women in Italy was conducted. Responses were analysed for all women and segregated into two groups depending on previous experience of pregnancy loss. Analysis of open text responses examined expectations and concerns before and after the onset of the pandemic. FINDINGS: Two hundred pregnant women responded to the first wave of the survey. Most (n=157, 78.5%) had other children and 100 (50.0%) had a previous history of perinatal loss. 'Joy' was the most prevalent emotion expressed before COVID-19 (126, 63.0% before vs 34, 17.0% after; p<0.05); fear was the most prevalent after (15, 7.5% before vs 98, 49.0% after; p<0.05). Positive constructs were prevalent before COVID-19, while negative ones were dominant after (p<0.05). Across the country, women were concerned about COVID-19 and a history of psychological disorders was significantly associated with higher concerns (p<0.05). A previous pregnancy loss did not influence women's concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Women's expectations and concerns regarding childbirth changed significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Women with a history of psychological disorders need particular attention as they seem to experience higher levels of concern.","Ravaldi, Claudia; Wilson, Alyce; Ricca, Valdo; Homer, Caroline; Vannacci, Alfredo",Women and birth (Online),143,1

Clinical data indicate that severe COVID-19 most commonly manifests as viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinical entity mechanistically understood best in the context of influenza A virus-induced pneumonia. Similar to influenza, advanced age has emerged as the leading host risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. In this review we connect the current understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and host response to the clinical presentation of COVID-19, borrowing concepts from influenza A virus-induced ARDS pathogenesis and discussing how these ideas inform our evolving understanding of COVID-19-induced ARDS. We also consider important differences between COVID-19 and influenza, mainly the protean clinical presentation and associated lymphopenia of COVID-19, the contrasting role of interferon-Î³ in mediating the host immune response to these viruses, and the tropism for vascular endothelial cells of SARS-CoV-2, commenting on the potential limitations of influenza as a model for COVID-19. Finally, we explore hallmarks of ageing that could explain the association between advanced age and susceptibility to severe COVID-19.","Torres Acosta, Manuel A; Singer, Benjamin D",Eur. respir. j,143,16

The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. METHODS: A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. CONCLUSION: The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.","Billah, Md Arif; Miah, Md Mamun; Khan, Md Nuruzzaman",PLoS One,143,16

However, trauma admissions are not scheduled and cannot be postponed. There is a paucity of information available on continuing trauma care during the pandemic. The study purpose was to describe multicenter trauma care process changes made during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive survey summarized the response to the COVID-19 pandemic at six Level I trauma centers. The survey was completed in 05/2020. Questions were asked about personal protective equipment, ventilators, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and negative pressure rooms. Data were summarized as proportions. RESULTS: The survey took an average of 5 days. Sixty-seven percent reused N-95 respirators; 50% sanitized them with 25% using ultraviolet light. One hospital (17%) had regional resources impacted. Thirty-three percent created ventilator allocation protocols. Most hospitals (83%) designated more beds to the ICU; 50% of hospitals designated an ICU for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients were isolated in negative pressure rooms at all hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Level I trauma centers created processes to provide optimal trauma patient care and still protect providers.

However, it is possible that even with an optimal use of the increased resources, these will not suffice for all patients in need. Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary authors group with support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethico-legal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supra-individual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. Assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient's general health status prior to the current illness.","Marckmann, Georg; Neitzke, Gerald; Schildmann, Jan; Michalsen, Andrej; Dutzmann, Jochen; Hartog, Christiane; Jöbges, Susanne; Knochel, Kathrin; Michels, Guido; Pin, Martin; Riessen, Reimer; Rogge, Annette; Taupitz, Jochen; Janssens, Uwe",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,143,16

Cost-effective mental health screening is prerequisite for timely intervention. We developed an online tool to identify prospective predictors of PTSD and depressive symptoms in the context of co-occurring social unrest and COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 150 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, with a median duration of 29 days. Three logistic regression models were constructed to assess its discriminative power in predicting PTSD and depressive symptoms at one month. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for each model to determine their optimal decision thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity of the models were 87.1% and 53.8% for probable PTSD, 77.5% and 63.3% for high-risk depressive symptoms, and 44.7% and 96.4% for no significant depressive symptoms. The models performed well in discriminating outcomes (AUCs range: 0.769-0.811). Probable PTSD was predicted by social unrest-related traumatic events, high rumination, and low resilience. Rumination and resilience also predicted high-risk and no significant depressive symptoms, with COVID-19-related events also predicting no significant depression risk.

We present our real world experience with Itolizumab, a repurposed immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody, administered in COVID-19 patients. Methodology: Data from 25 confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients, with high levels of pro-inflammatory markers and pulmonary function worsening on best supportive care and Itolizumab were included in this analysis. Patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were excluded. Clinical parameters (oxygen requirement) and laboratory parameters (ferritin, interleukin [IL]-6, C-reactive protein [CRP] and absolute lymphocyte count [ALC]) were studied preand post-treatment. Average total length of stay in hospital and ICU, percentage of patients requiring ICU admission and average time taken for weaning off oxygen for all patients were also reported. Results: All Patients were in the range of 30-78 years of age, with majority being male (76%). Most prevalent comorbid conditions were diabetes (64%) and hypertension (28%). Median IL-6 value showed a decline by 85.4%. Significant reduction in median CRP (86.96%) and Ferritin (55.61%) was observed post- Itolizumab compared to pre-dose values. Median ALC improved from 1605 cells/ mm3 (pre-dose) to 2462.5 cells/mm3 (post-dose). Average recovery time, defined as time from Itolizumab infusion to discharge was 9.28 ± 4.04 days. Average duration of hospitalization and ICU admission was 14.24 ± 4.15 and 8.27 ± 4.47 days, respectively, with 76% patients recovered and discharged. Median oxygen saturation improved from 88 % (pre-dose) to 96 % (post-dose). All patients were weaned off oxygen within Avg + SD : 6.53 ± 2.09 days post-Itolizumab treatment. One and two point reduction in ordinal scale was observed in 88% and 76% patients, respectively. Three patients (12%) did not show improvement in ordinal sore of which two patients died because of complications due to pre-existing comorbidities. The all-cause mortality of 8%; was considered not related to Itolizumab. One infusion related event reported abated with infusion period extension. Interpretation and Conclusion: A single dose of Itolizumab accelerated recovery in adult patients with COVID-19 by controlling immune hyperactivation. The clinical improvement was demonstrated by reduction in inflammatory markers, weaning off oxygen, reduced length of hospital stay and improvement of ordinal score. Itolizumab was well tolerated and when administered in the early phase of the inflammatory cascade is an efficient therapeutic option for treatment of cytokine release syndrome in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.","Gore, Vishal; Kshirsagar, Dinesh P; Bhat, Shreepad M; Khatib, Khalid I; Mansukhani, Bhavna",J Assoc Physicians India,143,16

This study is based on publicly accessible data on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan extracted from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website. We analysed the characteristics, infection source, symptom presentation, and route of identification of the 321 imported cases that were identified from 21 January to 6 April 2020. They were mostly returned Taiwanese citizens who had travelled to one or more of 37 countries for tourism, business, work, or study. Half of these cases developed symptoms before arrival, most of the remainder developed symptoms 1-13 days (mean 4.0 days) after arrival, and 3.4% never developed symptoms. Three-quarters of the cases had respiratory symptoms, 44.9% had fever, 13.1% lost smell or taste, and 7.2% had diarrhoea. Body temperature and symptom screening at airports identified 32.7% of the cases. Of the remainder, 27.7% were identified during home quarantining, 16.2% were identified via contact tracing, and 23.4% were reported by hospitals. Under the strict enforcement of these measures, the incidence of locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Taiwan remains sporadic.

The lockdown effect on carbon emissions has been studied by many researchers using statistical approaches. However, the lockdown effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on an urban scale remains unclear. Here we present CO2 concentration and carbon isotopic (Î´13C) measurements to assess the impact of COVID-19 control measures on atmospheric CO2 in Xi'an, China. We find that CO2 concentrations during the lockdown period were 7.5% lower than during the normal period (prior to the Spring Festival, Jan 25 to Feb 4, 2020). The observed CO2excess (total CO2 minus background CO2) during the lockdown period was 52.3% lower than that during the normal period, and 35.7% lower than the estimated CO2excess with the effect of weather removed. A Keeling plot shows that in contrast CO2 concentrations and Î´13C were weakly correlated (R2 = 0.18) during the lockdown period, reflecting a change in CO2 sources imposed by the curtailment of traffic and industrial emissions. Our study also show that the sharp reduction in atmospheric CO2 during lockdown were short-lived, and returned to normal levels within months after lockdown measures were lifted.","Wu, Shugang; Zhou, Weijian; Xiong, Xiaohu; Burr, G S; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Peng; Niu, Zhenchuan; Hou, Yaoyao",Environ Res,143,1

Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back containment measures. The aims of this study were to investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; and to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory. Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples, respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled. Pooling is a viable strategy for high-throughput testing of SARS-CoV-2 in low-prevalence settings.","Chong, Brian S W; Tran, Thomas; Druce, Julian; Ballard, Susan A; Simpson, Julie A; Catton, Mike",Pathology,143,21

Whilst respiratory droplets are believed to be the dominant transmission mechanisms, indirect transmission may also occur through shared contact of contaminated common objects that is not directly curtailed by a lockdown. The conditions under which contaminated common objects may lead to significant spread of coronavirus disease 2019 during lockdown and its easing is examined using the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model with a fomite term added. Modelling the weekly death rate in the UK, a maximum-likelihood analysis finds a statistically significant fomite contribution, with 0.009 ± 0.001 (95% CI) infection-inducing fomites introduced into the environment per day per infectious person. Post-lockdown, comparison with the prediction of a corresponding counterfactual model with no fomite transmission suggests fomites, through enhancing the overall transmission rate, may have contributed to as much as 25% of the deaths following lockdown. It is suggested that adding a fomite term to more complex simulations may assist in the understanding of the spread of the illness and in making policy decisions to control it.","Meiksin, A",Epidemiol Infect,143,16

DESIGN: a population-based retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included all swab positive cases aged 40 years older (No. 18,286) among residents in the territory of the Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) up to 27.04.2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the ATS administrative database of chronic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: to predict 30-day mortality risk, a multivariable logistic regression model, including age, gender, and the selected conditions, was developed following the TRIPOD guidelines. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed. RESULTS: after age and gender, the most important predictors of 30-day mortality were diabetes, tumour in first-line treatment, chronic heart failure, and complicated diabetes. The bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78, which suggests that this model is useful in predicting death after COVID-19 infection in swab positive cases. The model had good discrimination (Brier score 0.13) and was well calibrated (Index of prediction accuracy of 14.8%). CONCLUSIONS: a risk prediction model for 30-day mortality in a large COVID-19 cohort aged 40 years or older was developed.

Symptoms persisting for more than three weeks after the diagnosis of COVID-19 characterize the post-COVID syndrome. Its incidence ranges from 10% to 35%, however, rates as high as 85% have been reported among patients with a history of hospitalization. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of post-COVID syndrome. We reviewed the published information on post-COVID syndrome, putting emphasis on its pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome is multi-factorial and more than one mechanism may be implicated in several clinical manifestations. Prolonged inflammation has a key role in its pathogenesis and may account for some neurological complications, cognitive dysfunction, and several other symptoms. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) of all ages has been also described recently, similarly to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The post-infectious inflammatory pathogenetic mechanism of MIS-A is supported by the fact that its diagnosis is established through serology in up to one third of cases. Other pathogenetic mechanisms that are implicated in post-COVID syndrome include immune-mediated vascular dysfunction, thromboembolism, and nervous system dysfunction. Although the current data are indicating that the overwhelming majority of patients with post-COVID syndrome have a good prognosis, registries to actively follow them are needed in order to define the full clinical spectrum and its long-term outcome. A consensus-based classification of post-COVID syndrome is essential to guide clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic management.

Quarantine is separation of persons who have been exposed to an infection but asymptomatic, while isolation is separation of infected patients. Voluntary quarantine is preferred, but if necessary, it can be mandatory. These implementations can lead to restrictions on individual liberties, leading to ethical and legal problems. Isolation and quarantine enforcement are regulated by laws. Those who do not follow the quarantine rules could be punished. Isolation and quarantine practices in our country are described in General Hygiene Law. In this study the importance of quarantine, when and how it is applied, and its ethical and especially legal dimension are discussed.","Kiliç, Rahmi; Ataman Hatipoglu, Çigdem; Günes, Cemil",Turk J Med Sci,143,16

Guidance issued early during the pandemic suggested avoiding transnasal approaches to minimize risks of transmitting COVID-19 to health care professionals involved in these procedures. Methods This observational, single-center study compares results of endoscopic transsphenoidal approach (TSA) for pituitary tumors since the start of the pandemic to a pre-pandemic period. Anesthetic time, surgical time, and complication rates were compared. Newly acquired COVID-19 infections and transmission rates to patients and staff were reviewed. Data were analyzed by using the independent t -test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Pearson Chi-square test, significance set at p &lt;0.05. Results Over a 12-month period, a total of 50 and 69 patients underwent endoscopic TSA for pituitary tumor during and before the pandemic, respectively. All patients tested negative for COVID-19 preoperatively. Median duration of anesthesia was 35minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 22) during the pandemic and 25minutes (IQR: 8, p =0.0002) pre-pandemic. Median duration of surgery was 70minutes (IQR: 28) during the pandemic and 79minutes (IQR: 33.75, p =0.126) pre-pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences between intraoperative CSF leaks and complication rates. No staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Three patients tested positive for COVID-19 postdischarge, but the infections were community acquired. Conclusion In contrast to published guidelines, adequate preoperative testing, a multidisciplinary approach and the implementation of standardized protocols and vaccination against COVID-19 allow for endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery to be performed safely in patients with pituitary pathology during the pandemic.","Amarouche, M.; Rashid, S.; Eraifej, J.; Borg, A.; Halliday, J.; Warner, O.

One of them, proposed by Segreto and Deigin, assumes artificial chimeric construction of SARS-CoV-2 from a backbone of RaTG13-like CoV and receptor binding domain (RBD) of a pangolin MP789-like CoV, followed by serial cell or animal passage. Here we show that this hypothesis relies on incorrect or weak assumptions, and does not agree with the results of comparative genomics analysis. The genetic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and both its proposed ancestors is too high to have accumulated in a lab, given the timeframe of several years. Furthermore, comparative analysis of S-protein gene sequences suggests that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 probably represents an ancestral non-recombinant variant. These and other arguments significantly weaken the hypothesis of a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2, while the hypothesis of a natural origin is consistent with all available genetic and experimental data.","Tyshkovskiy, Alexander; Panchin, Alexander Y",Bioessays,143,16

We aimed to evaluate the effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetrical emergency attendance in a low-risk population and the corresponding perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This is a single center retrospective cohort study of all singleton births between February 21 and April 30. Prenatal emergency labor ward admission numbers and obstetric outcomes during the peak of the first COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 in Israel were compared with the combined corresponding periods for the years 2017 to 2019. RESULTS: During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of prenatal emergency labor ward admissions was lower, both by daily count and per woman, in comparison to the combined matching periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (48.6 ± 12.2 vs. 57.8 ± 14.4, p < 0.0001 and 1.74 ± 1.1 vs. 1.92 ± 1.2, p < 0.0001, respectively). A significantly (p = 0.0370) higher rate of stillbirth was noted in the study group (0.4%) compared with the control group (0.1%). All study group patients were negative for COVID-19. Gestational age at delivery, rates of premature delivery at <28, 34, and 37 weeks, pregnancy complications, postdate delivery at >40 and 41 weeks, mode of delivery, and numbers of emergency cesarean deliveries were similar in both groups. There was no difference in the intrapartum fetal death rate between the groups. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home policy combined with patient fear of contracting the disease in hospital could explain the associated higher rate of stillbirth. This collateral perinatal damage follows a decreased in prenatal emergency labor ward admissions during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. KEY POINTS: · Less obstetrical ER attendance is observed during the pandemic.. · There is a parallel increase in stillbirth rate.. · Stillbirth cases tested negative for COVID-19.. · Lockdown and pandemic panic are possible causes..","Mor, Matan; Kugler, Nadav; Jauniaux, Eric; Betser, Moshe; Wiener, Yifat; Cuckle, Howard; Maymon, Ron",Am. j. perinatol,143,16

A pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization on March 11th 2020, with an escalation of new cases worldwide. Dermatology units experienced a reorganization of regular activity, also providing clinical diagnosis and medical assistance to COVID-19-positive patients who developed cutaneous manifestations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian dermatologic clinical practice. MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a prospective online survey, consisting of a questionnaire with 35 multiple-choice questions uploaded on the website of the Italian Society of Dermatology and Venereology - SIDeMaST. RESULTS: A total of 136 dermatologists, 78 women (57%) and 58 men (43%), participated in the survey. The mean age was 58 ± 14 years. In total, 60% of participants reported an impact of the pandemic on their practice, in most cases consisting of a remarkable reduction in routine clinical activity (58%). Concern regarding possible infection was evaluated with a score ranging from 0 (no concern) to 5 (extremely concerned): the fear of becoming infected was high (&#8805;3 in 40%), as was the fear of infecting families, colleagues or patients (&#8805;3 points in 45%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a strong impact on dermatology practice in Italy. The identification of critical points may help scientific societies to improve the clinical scenario and create specific strategies to overcome the emergency.","Lambertini, Martina; Patrizi, Annalisa; Peris, Ketty; Marasco, Giovanni; Toselli, Marco; Marcelli, Emanuela; Giampieri, Enrico; Mussi, Martina; Dika, Emi",Eur J Dermatol,143,5

Topic modeling further revealed that people in the UK worry about their family and the economic situation. Tweet-sized texts functioned as a call for solidarity, while longer texts shed light on worries and concerns. Using predictive modeling approaches, we were able to approximate the emotional responses of participants from text within 14% of their actual value.

To identify a functional in vivo model, herein we used germ-free (GF) mice to test the effectiveness of textiles as filtration material and droplet barriers to complement available in vitro-based knowledge. Herein, we report a study conducted in vivo with bacteria-carrying microdroplets to determine to what extent household textiles prevent contamination of GF mice in their environment. Using a recently validated spray-simulation method (mimicking a sneeze), herein we first determined that combed-cotton textiles used as two-layer-barriers covering the mouse cages prevented the contamination of all GF animals when sprayed 10–20 bacterial-droplet units/cm 2. In additional to exposure trials, the model showed that GF mice were again protected by the combed-cotton textile after the acute exposure to 10 times more droplets (20 “spray-sneezes”, ~200 bacterial-droplet units/cm 2). Overall, two-layer combed-cotton protected 100% of the GF mice from bacteria-carrying droplets (n = 20 exposure-events), which was significantly superior compared to 100% mouse contamination without textile coverage or when 95% partly covered (n = 18, Fisher-exact, p &lt; 0.0001). Of relevance is that two different densities of cotton were equally effective (100%) in preventing contamination regardless of density (120–vs. 200 g/m 2; T-test, p = 0.0028), suggesting that similar density materials could prevent droplet contamination. As a practical message, we conducted a speech trial (counting numbers, 1–100) with/without the protection of the same cotton textile used as face cover. The trial illustrated that contamination of surfaces occurs at a rate of &gt;2–6 bacteria-carrying saliva-droplets per word (2.6 droplets/cm 2, 30 cm) when speaking at 60–70 decibels and that cotton face covers fully prevent bacterial surface contamination.","Rodriguez-Palacios, Alex; Conger, Mathew; Cominelli, Fabio",Front.

In SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients risks associated with other underlying comorbidities might vary from those in non-cancer SARS CoV-2 infected patients. The relative impact of different underlying health conditions among patients with cancer and SARS CoV-2 infection remains yet to be explored. This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of comorbidities among cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection and their impact on mortality. METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of science were searched for articles published between 9th July 2019 to July 8th 2020.Studies of cancer patients (>18 years) with diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection, published in English were included. A random-effects modelling for the meta-analyses was applied to assess the pooled prevalence and odds ratio for mortality due to comorbidities in SARS CoV-2 infected cancer patients. RESULTS: Total 31studies with 4086 SARS-CoV-2 infectedcancer patientsmet the inclusion criteria. Most prevalent co-morbidities in cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection were hypertension [42.3% (95%CI:37.5- 47.0)], diabetes [17.8% (95% CI: 15.3-20.4)] and cardiovascular diseases [16.7% (95%CI:12.9-20.4)].The risk of mortality (pOR) was significantly higher in individuals with hypertension[1.6(95%CI 1.24-2.00)], cardiovascular diseases [2.2 (95%CI 1.49- 3.27)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [1.4(95% CI 1.05-2.00)] and diabetes [1.35(95%CI 1.06-1.73)]. CONCLUSION: Our results indicates that the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients is affected by preexisting non-cancer comorbidities.

RECENT FINDINGS: Direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 is not common, and convincing morphologic evidence of substantive kidney infection by SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Severe COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury is likely multifactorial and results from the physiologic disturbances and therapies used to treat this illness. COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy (COVAN) is seen almost exclusively in patients with apolipoprotein L1 high-risk genotypes with no evidence of direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: The prevailing evidence does not support substantive or persistent infection of kidneys in COVID-19 and indirect means of tissue injury are favored, although a 'hit and run' model cannot be excluded. COVAN frequently occurs in patients with mild respiratory systems, suggesting that innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide the second hit needed for the development of collapsing glomerulopathy in susceptible individuals.","Smith, Kelly D; Akilesh, Shreeram",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,143,24

Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of RA. Whether MTX exposure increases the risk of ILD in patients with RA is disputed. We aimed to evaluate the association of prior MTX use with development of RA-ILD. METHODS: Through a case-control study design with discovery and international replication samples, we examined the association of MTX exposure with ILD in 410 patients with chronic fibrotic ILD associated with RA (RA-ILD) and 673 patients with RA without ILD. Estimates were pooled over the different samples using meta-analysis techniques. RESULTS: Analysis of the discovery sample revealed an inverse relationship between MTX exposure and RA-ILD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.90; p=0.022), which was confirmed in the replication samples (pooled adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.79; p=0.009). The combined estimate using both the derivation and validation samples revealed an adjusted OR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26-0.69; p=0.0006). MTX ever users were less frequent among patients with RA-ILD compared to those without ILD, irrespective of chest high resolution computed tomography pattern. In patients with RA-ILD, ILD detection was significantly delayed in MTX ever users compared to never users (11.4±10.4â years and 4.0±7.4â years, respectively; p<0.001). ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: Our results suggest that MTX use is not associated with an increased risk of RA-ILD in patients with RA, and that ILD was detected later in MTX treated patients.","Juge, Pierre-Antoine; Lee, Joyce S; Lau, Jessica; Kawano-Dourado, Leticia; Rojas Serrano, Jorge; Sebastiani, Marco; Koduri, Gouri; Matteson, Eric; Bonfiglioli, Karina; Sawamura, Marcio; Kairalla, Ronaldo; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Bozzalla Cassione, Emanuele; Manfredi, Andreina; Mejia, Mayra; Rodríguez-Henriquez, Pedro; González-Pérez, Montserrat I; Falfán-Valencia, Ramcés; Buendia-Roldán, Ivette; Pérez-Rubio, Gloria; Ebstein, Esther; Gazal, Steven; Borie, Raphaël; Ottaviani, Sébastien; Kannengiesser, Caroline; Wallaert, Benoît; Uzunhan, Yurdagul; Nunes, Hilario; Valeyre, Dominique; Saidenberg-Kermanac039,; h, Nathalie; Boissier, Marie-Christophe; Wemeau-Stervinou, Lidwine; Flipo, René-Marc; Marchand-Adam, Sylvain; Richette, Pascal; Allanore, Yannick; Dromer, Claire; Truchetet, Marie-Elise; Richez, Christophe; Schaeverbeke, Thierry; Lioté, Huguette; Thabut, Gabriel; Deane, Kevin D; Solomon, Joshua; Doyle, Tracy; Ryu, Jay H; Rosas, Ivan; Holers, V Michael; Boileau, Catherine; Debray, Marie-Pierre",Eur. respir. j,143,26

This paper describes the layout and functioning of a typical Fangcang shelter hospital, Wuhan Dongxihu Fangcang shelter Hospital, where the author has worked, the working mechanism, experience and effectiveness. A set of patient management protocols was employed for daily practice, which included preset criteria and procedure for admission, examination, medication treatment, referral and discharge. WeChat platform with different groups was used for communication, ward round, test appointments and patient data communication. All these procedures and mechanisms of working enabled the effective management of a larger number of patients with relatively few doctors. As a result, 442 mild or moderate COVID-19 patients in Hall C were successfully managed by a team of 40 doctors, with 246 (56%) patients were cured and discharged from the Fangcang shelter hospital while the remaining 196 (44%) patients were referred on to designated hospitals for further treatment. The reasons for referral included poor resolution in computerized tomography (CT) scan (59%), persistently positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by PCR after 9 days of admission (16%), deterioration in CT image (4%), development of dyspnoea (1%) and other (4%) or unclear reasons (16%) due to no record of reasons for referral on the document. There were no deaths and no complaints from the patients in Hall C. In summary, the Fangcang shelter hospital could be run successfully with a set of patient management protocols under conditions of limited facilities and medical staff. It was effective and safe in isolating patients, providing basic medical care and early identification of potential severe cases. This experience may provide a successful example of a working mechanism for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.","Liu, Pei; Zhang, Hongmei; Long, Xiang; Wang, Wei; Zhan, Danting; Meng, Xinke; Li, Duoyun; Wang, Lingwei; Chen, Rongchang",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),143,21

To enable the continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 assays, we have developed a web-based assay validation algorithm that checks existing PCR-based assays against the ever-expanding genome databases for SARS-CoV-2 using both thermodynamic and edit-distance metrics. The assay screening results are displayed as a heatmap, showing the number of mismatches between each detection and each SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. Using a mismatch threshold to define detection failure, assay performance is summarized with the true positive rate (recall) to simplify assay comparisons.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa&#8482; COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required. RESULTS: The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9-3.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2-1.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9-3.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2-1.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL. Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay. Clinical performances of Simplexa&#8482; COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, their association with study-relevant problems, and the moderating effect of parent-child relationship among Chinese adolescents during the school closures. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis with data collected in middle and high schools in Taizhou, China. Students completed an online survey between April 16 and May 14, 2020. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory. Three types of study problems were recorded, including having difficulty in studying at home, dislike of remote learning, and excessive screen entertainment time. Parental relationships were categorized into good or normal relationship and poor relationship. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between study-relevant problems and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Using data from 6435 adolescents, we found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 17.7%. All the study problem measures were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. There was a moderating effect of the parental relationship on the associations between study problems and depressive symptoms. The association between number of study problems and depressive symptoms was stronger in adolescents with a poor parent-child relationship (regression coefficient 4.34 [95% CI 2.97, 5.72]) than those with a good or normal relationship (2.55 [2.35, 2.75]), p for interaction 0.002, on multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Study problems due to school closures were particularly problematic for adolescents who had poor parent-child relationships. Public health initiatives could help students to adjust study habits and improve parent-child relationships, thereby protecting against the development of depression.","Wang, Jingyi; Wang, Hao; Lin, Haijiang; Richards, Marcus; Yang, Shuyue; Liang, Hongbiao; Chen, Xiaoxiao; Fu, Chaowei",Global Health,143,20

These simulations can provide detailed insight into how molecules behave under certain environmental conditions. This work explores a machine learning (ML) solution to predicting long-term properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S-protein) through the analysis of its nanosecond backbone RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) MD simulation data at varying temperatures. The simulation data were denoised with fast Fourier transforms. The performance of the models was measured by evaluating their mean squared error (MSE) accuracy scores in recurrent forecasts for long-term predictions. The models evaluated include k-nearest neighbors (kNN) regression models, as well as GRU (gated recurrent unit) neural networks and LSTM (long short-term memory) autoencoder models. Results demonstrated that the kNN model achieved the greatest accuracy in forecasts with MSE scores over around 0.01 nm less than those of the GRU model and the LSTM autoencoder. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the kNN model accuracy increases with data size but can still forecast relatively well when trained on small amounts of data, having achieved MSE scores of around 0.02 nm when trained on 10,000 ns of simulation data. This study provides valuable information on the feasibility of accelerating the MD simulation process through training and predicting supervised ML models, which is particularly applicable in time-sensitive studies.

Uniquely in recent times, governments have imposed partly voluntary, partly compulsory restrictions on the population to slow the spread of the virus. In this context, public attitudes and behaviors are vitally important for reducing the death rate. Analyzing tweets about the disease may therefore give insights into public reactions that may help guide public information campaigns. This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about Covid-19 from March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction: gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare, whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global spread of the virus, and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the population safe. The detailed results may be useful to inform public information announcements and to help understand the spread of the virus. For example, failure to impose a sporting bans whilst encouraging social distancing may send mixed messages to males.","Thelwall, Mike; Thelwall, Saheeda",Prof. Inf.,143,11

[Turkish],13.611686,6.6600213,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The management of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still a matter of debate. We aimed to assess in this group the attack rate of asymptomatic carriers and the symptoms most frequently associated with infection. METHODS: Occupational and clinical characteristics of HCWs who underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a university hospital from 24 February 2020 to 31 March 2020 were collected. For those who tested positive and for those who tested positive but who were asymptomatic, we checked the laboratory and clinical data as of 22 May to calculate the time necessary for HCWs to then test negative and to verify whether symptoms developed thereafter. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: There were 139 positive tests (8.8%) among 1573 HCWs (95% confidence interval, 7.5-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (122/503, 24.2%) and asymptomatic (17/1070, 1.6%) workers (p < 0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (61/582, 10.5%), whereas clerical workers and technicians had the lowest frequency (5/137, 3.6%). The likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 increased with the number of reported symptoms; the strongest predictors of test positivity were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio = 76.9) and fever (odds ratio = 9.12). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 27 days (95% confidence interval, 24-30). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 without displaying any symptoms. Among symptomatic HCWs, the key symptoms to guide diagnosis are taste and smell alterations and fever. A median of almost 4 weeks is necessary before nasopharyngeal swab test results are negative.","Lombardi, A; Consonni, D; Carugno, M; Bozzi, G; Mangioni, D; Muscatello, A; Castelli, V; Palomba, E; Cantù, A P; Ceriotti, F; Tiso, B; Pesatori, A C; Riboldi, L; Bandera, A; Lunghi, G; Gori, A",Clin Microbiol Infect,143,22

If toxic stress is characterized by an absence of protective relationships, telemedicine may have a role in collective prevention efforts by enabling and preserving patient-provider continuity. Through virtual visits and check-ins, trusted health care providers can serve as a source of emotional support and psychosocial buffering for families under stress. By leveraging technology to deliver care remotely, telemedicine lets patients and providers connect, relate, and engage. Connection enables the conveyance of compassion and empathy. Telemedicine may thus serve as an important conduit for fostering protective relationships, buffering toxic stressors, and promoting safety and healing.

The elucidation of these complex processes begins with investigating the expression of the genes of interest, however the appropriate reference genes (RGs) for normalizing the gene expression are still unavailable in A. tuberosum. To fill this lacuna, transcriptome-wide screening was undertaken to identify the most stable genes according to the analysis of their FPKM values. The expression stability of the RGs was further evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder algorithms. The comprehensive analysis showed that GLY1 and SKP1, instead of two traditionally used RGs (eIF1&#945; and ACT2), were the most stable genes across diverse A. tuberosum tissues, indicating the necessity to carefully validate the stability of RGs prior to their use for normalizations. As indicated by geNorm, the normalizations with at least two RGs could give more accurate results. qRT-PCR experiments were conducted with randomly selected genes, demonstrating that normalization with a combination of GLY1 and SKP1 resulted in reliable normalization results. Our finding represents the first attempt toward establishing a standardized qRT-PCR analysis in this economically important vegetable.","Tong, Jing; Hu, Manman; Han, Beibei; Ji, Yanhai; Wang, Baoju; Liang, Hao; Liu, Mingchi; Wu, Zhanhui; Liu, Ning",Sci Rep,143,1

PURPOSE: To evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates and COVID-19 outcomes, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. (PROSPERO: CRD42020187078). DATA SOURCES: English-language articles in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, searched from inception through 31 August 2020. Gray literature sources were searched through 2 November 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies examining SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, or deaths by race/ethnicity in U.S. settings. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by a second reviewer; independent dual-reviewer assessment of quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: 37 mostly fair-quality cohort and cross-sectional studies, 15 mostly good-quality ecological studies, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and APM Research Lab were included. African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and COVID-19-related mortality compared with non-Hispanic White populations, but not higher case-fatality rates (mostly reported as in-hospital mortality) (moderate- to high-strength evidence). Asian populations experience similar outcomes to non-Hispanic White populations (low-strength evidence). Outcomes for other racial/ethnic groups have been insufficiently studied. Health care access and exposure factors may underlie the observed disparities more than susceptibility due to comorbid conditions (low-strength evidence). LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, missing race/ethnicity data, and incomplete outcome assessments in cohort and cross-sectional studies must be considered. In addition, adjustment for key demographic covariates was lacking in ecological studies. CONCLUSION: African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality but similar rates of case fatality. Differences in health care access and exposure risk may be driving higher infection and mortality rates.

Since the initiation of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many studies have reported a higher severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 among patients with cancer in general. AREAS COVERED: The immunomodulatory effects of ICI can modify the patients' immune system function in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There is controversy over whether the severity of COVID-19 in cancer patients who previously received ICI compared to other patients with cancer has increased. There is evidence that the upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules in T cells, lymphopenia, and inflammatory cytokine secretion are associated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. EXPERT OPINION: ICI can interrupt the T cell exhaustion and depletion by interrupting the inhibitory signaling of checkpoint molecules in T cells, and augments the immune system response in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia. However, ICI may also increase the risk of cytokine release syndrome. ICI can be considered not only as a cancer immunotherapy but also as immunotherapy in COVID-19. More studies are needed to assess the safety of ICI in COVID-19 patients with or without cancer.","Pezeshki, Parmida Sadat; Rezaei, Nima",Expert Opin Biol Ther,143,20

Five types of vaccines are currently approved for emergency use in many countries (Inactivated, Sinopharm; Viral-vector, Astrazeneca, and Gamaleya Research Institute; mRNA, Moderna, and BioNTech/Pfizer). The main challenge in this pandemic was the availability to produce an effective vaccine to be distributed to the world's population in a short time. Herein, we developed a whole virus NRC-VACC-01 inactivated candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and tested its safety and immunogenicity in laboratory animals. In the preclinical studies, we used four experimental animals (mice, rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters). Antibodies were detected as of week three post vaccination and continued up to week ten in the four experimental models. Safety evaluation of NRC-VACC-01 inactivated candidate vaccine in rats revealed that the vaccine was highly tolerable.

Outcomes of ICU and non-ICU patients were compared, and a simple nomogram for predicting the probability of ICU transfer after hospital admission was developed based on initial laboratory data using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences in laboratory indices were observed between patients admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted. Several independent predictors of ICU transfer in COVID-19 patients were identified including older age (&#8805;65 years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02), hypertension (HR = 2.65), neutrophil count (HR = 1.11), procalcitonin level (HR = 3.67), prothrombin time (HR = 1.28), and D-dimer level (HR = 1.25). The lymphocyte count and albumin level were negatively associated with mortality (HR = 0.08 and 0.86, respectively). The developed model provides a means for identifying, at hospital admission, the subset of patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression and would require transfer to the ICU within 3 and 7 days after hospitalization. This method of early patient triage allows a more effective allocation of limited medical resources.","Zeng, Zihang; Ma, Yiming; Zeng, Huihui; Huang, Peng; Liu, Wenlong; Jiang, Mingyan; Xiang, Xudong; Deng, Dingding; Liao, Xin; Chen, Ping; Chen, Yan",J. med. virol,143,16

In this study we compared outcomes for PWH with COVID-19 disease to a matched comparison group. DESIGN: We identified 88 PWH hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital system in New York between March 12 and April 23, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory values, HIV infection status, COVID-19 treatment, and outcomes from this group and matched comparators (one PWH to up to five patients by age, sex, race/ethnicity and calendar week of infection). We compared baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes (death, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge) for these two groups, as well as cumulative incidence of death by HIV status. RESULTS: Patients did not differ significantly by HIV status by age, sex or race/ethnicity due to the matching algorithm. PWH hospitalized with COVID-19 had high proportions of HIV virologic control on antiretroviral therapy. PWH had greater proportions of smoking (p<0.001) and comorbid illness than demographically similar uninfected comparators. There was no difference in COVID-19 severity on admission by HIV status (p=0.15). Poor outcomes for hospitalized PWH were frequent but similar to proportions in comparators; 18% required mechanical ventilation and ultimately 21% died during follow-up (compared with 23% and 20% respectively). There was similar cumulative incidence of death over time by HIV status (p=0.94). INTERPRETATION: We found no differences in adverse outcomes associated with HIV infection for hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to a demographically similar patient group.","Sigel, Keith; Swartz, Talia; Golden, Eddye; Paranjpe, Ishan; Somani, Sulaiman; Richter, Felix; De Freitas, Jessica K; Miotto, Riccardo; Zhao, Shan; Polak, Paz; Mutetwa, Tinaye; Factor, Stephanie; Mehandru, Saurabh; Mullen, Michael; Cossarini, Francesca; Bottinger, Erwin; Fayad, Zahi; Merad, Miriam; Gnjatic, Sacha; Aberg, Judith; Charney, Alexander; Nadkarni, Girish; Glicksberg, Benjamin S",Clin. infect. dis,143,23

However, official inequality statistics are only available at low frequency and with considerable delay, which challenges policymakers in their objective to mitigate inequality and fine-tune public policies. We show that using data from bank records it is possible to measure economic inequality at high frequency. The approach proposed in this paper allows measuring, timely and accurately, the impact on inequality of fast-unfolding crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this approach to data from a representative sample of over three million residents of Spain we find that, absent government intervention, inequality would have increased by almost 30% in just one month. The granularity of the data allows analyzing with great detail the sources of the increases in inequality. In the Spanish case we find that it is primarily driven by job losses and wage cuts experienced by low-wage earners. Government support, in particular extended unemployment insurance and benefits for furloughed workers, were generally effective at mitigating the increase in inequality, though less so among young people and foreign-born workers. Therefore, our approach provides knowledge on the evolution of inequality at high frequency, the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the increase of inequality and the subgroups of the population most affected by the changes in inequality. This information is fundamental to fine-tune public policies on the wake of a fast-moving pandemic like the COVID-19.","Aspachs, Oriol; Durante, Ruben; Graziano, Alberto; Mestres, Josep; Reynal-Querol, Marta; Montalvo, Jose G",PLoS One,143,16

The responsibilities of women, particularly mothers, are amplified during times of pressure. This study investigated the experiences of teaching-mothers in Pakistan during the Covid-19 pandemic to understand the challenges they faced as professionals and as mothers. The data were collected through in-depth interviews of 24 teaching-mothers. The study participants were identified through the snowball sampling technique. The data were collected until the point of data saturation and analysed through. The analysis indicates that teaching-mothers in Pakistan faced issues in terms of maintaining their work-life balance, managing space and resources for online teaching, and learning a new set of skills in order to teach online. These multiple challenges affected their mental health. The findings indicate a sharp division of gendered roles in Pakistan and their negative impact on the mental health of women during Covid-19. The study suggests devising organizational policies to support teaching-mothers generally and especially during crises.

The spread of the coronavirus poses a particularly serious threat to those that comprise the system, including personnel, attorneys, prisoners, their families and extends into the communities in which facilities are located. These correctional facilities and communities were especially underprepared for the sudden onset of a highly contagious virus, which has resulted in an exceedingly high number of infections among those who work and are held in the facilities. Rampant overcrowding in the U.S. correctional system, an aging population, and a population exhibiting high rates of underlying health conditions are highly likely to exacerbate the spread of this highly contagious virus. This potentially dire set of interrelated circumstances necessitates rapid decarceration measures that effectively balance public safety and public health. Unfortunately, there has been unclear guidance as well as changing and even contradictory information coming from the federal government concerning rapid measures to mitigate the spread of infection to justice system personnel and federal prisoners. In this paper we summarize the federal response and how it has impacted those responsible for implementation. Furthermore, we discuss how systemic deleterious conditions of the U.S. correctional system serve as both accelerants to as well as effects of the pandemic.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and remdesivir were found to effective in treatment of COVID-19 patients. Here we have performed docking and molecule dynamic (MD) simulation study of HCQ and remdesivir with Mpro protein which gave promising results to inhibit Mpro protein in SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of results obtained we designed structurally modified 18 novel derivatives of HCQ, remdesivir and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and carried out docking studies of all the derivatives. From the docking studies six molecules DK4, DK7, DK10, DK16, DK17 and DK19 gave promising results and can be use as inhibitor for Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 very effectively. Further, molecular dynamics simulation of one derivative of HCQ and one derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol showing excellent docking score was performed along with the respective parent molecules. The two derivatives gave excellent docking score and higher stability than the parent molecule as validated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the binding affinities towards Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 thus represented as strong inhibitors at very low concentration.","Mishra, Deepak; Raman Maurya, Radha; Kumar, Kamlesh; Munjal, Nupur S; Bahadur, Vijay; Sharma, Sandeep; Singh, Prashant; Bahadur, Indra",J Mol Liq,143,9

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-five dentate AL residents were included in this secondary analysis. CNAs were asked to rate the AL residents' overall oral self-care function using a 6-point Likert scale. Their assessments were then compared with the objective, performance-based Dental Activities Test and the oral hygiene and gingival health measures. The analysis showed that nearly 90% of the participants presented with at least one untreated decayed or broken tooth. On average, nearly two-thirds of the surfaces were covered by soft deposits (Debris Index = 1.83, SD = 0.60). Generalized mild to moderate inflammation (Gingival Index = 1.51, SD = 0.53) commonly presented on residents' gingiva. CNAs were able to accurately identify the residents with substantial impairment in oral self-care function, yet they tended to overestimate the oral self-care function of residents with mild to moderate impairment. CNAs assessments were also not significantly correlated with residents' oral hygiene measures. CONCLUSION: CNAs failed to identify and provide assistance to AL residents with impaired oral self-care function, contributing to poor oral oral hygiene in these vulnerable individuals.","Chen, Xi; D039,; Souza, Violet; Comnick, Carissa L; Xie, Xianjin",Spec. care dentist,143,20

In this study, the performance of one laboratory-developed test (LDT) and two commercial tests, cobas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Roche) and Amplidiag COVID-19 (Mobidiag), were evaluated for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. A total of 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement was highest for the cobas test (100%), followed by the Amplidiag test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement was lowest for the cobas test (89.4%), followed by the Amplidiag test (98.8%), and the highest value was obtained for the LDT (100%). The dilution series of positive specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas assay in comparison with the other two assays, and the low negative percent agreement value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the pandemic.

To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW™ COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min. More so, isothermal platforms are cost effective and could easily be scaled up to resource limited settings.

Expanding virus populations, such as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms, imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for robust clustering. Here, we propose subdividing the global SARS-CoV-2 population into six well-defined subtypes and 10 poorly represented genotypes named tentative subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons and structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. The six subtypes and the additional genotypes showed amino acid replacements that might have phenotypic implications. Notably, three mutations (one of them in the Spike protein) were responsible for the geographical segregation of subtypes. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing candidate vaccines or drugs.","Morais, Ivair José; Polveiro, Richard Costa; Souza, Gabriel Medeiros; Bortolin, Daniel Inserra; Sassaki, Flávio Tetsuo; Lima, Alison Talis Martins",Sci Rep,143,16

The tai chi group received two, 8-form tai chi classes of 60 min duration per week. Changes in psychoemotional state, cognition, and the learning of fast and accurate reaching movements were assessed. In addition, the potential roles of the autonomic nervous system and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. Tai chi practice decreased (P < 0.05) perceived stress, whereas no change in autonomic nervous system activity was observed. Improvements in mental switching correlated with decreased depressive symptoms and increased BDNF levels (P < 0.05), whereas improvements in inhibitory control tended to correlate with BDNF levels (P = 0.08). Improvements in visuospatial processing tended to correlate with decreased depressive symptoms (P = 0.07) while improved visuospatial processing correlated with improved motor planning during learning tasks (P < 0.05).

METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID-19 patients at seven institutions receiving HCQ therapy from whom a baseline and at least one ECG at 48+ h were available were enrolled in the study. QT/QTc prolongation, QT-associated and QT-independent arrhythmic events, arrhythmic mortality, and overall mortality during HCQ therapy were assessed. A total of 649 COVID-19 patients (61.9 ± 18.7 years, 46.1% males) were enrolled. HCQ therapy was administrated as a home therapy regimen in 126 (19.4%) patients, and as an in-hospital-treatment to 495 (76.3%) hospitalized and 28 (4.3%) intensive care unit (ICU) patients. At 36-72 and at 96+ h after the first HCQ dose, 358 and 404 ECGs were obtained, respectively. A significant QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of the increase was modest [+13 (9-16) ms]. Baseline QT/QTc length and presence of fever (P = 0.001) at admission represented the most important determinants of QT/QTc prolongation. No arrhythmic-related deaths were reported. The overall major ventricular arrhythmia rate was low (1.1%), with all events found not to be related to QT or HCQ therapy at a centralized event evaluation. No differences in QT/QTc prolongation and QT-related arrhythmias were observed across different clinical settings, with non-QT-related arrhythmias being more common in the intensive care setting. CONCLUSION: HCQ administration is safe for a short-term treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection regardless of the clinical setting of delivery, causing only modest QTc prolongation and no directly attributable arrhythmic deaths.","Gasperetti, Alessio; Biffi, Mauro; Duru, Firat; Schiavone, Marco; Ziacchi, Matteo; Mitacchione, Gianfranco; Lavalle, Carlo; Saguner, Ardan; Lanfranchi, Antonio; Casalini, Giacomo; Tocci, Marco; Fabbricatore, Davide; Salghetti, Francesca; Mariani, Marco Valerio; Busana, Mattia; Bellia, Alfonso; Cogliati, Chiara Beatrice; Viale, Pierluigi; Antinori, Spinello; Galli, Massimo; Galiè, Nazzareno; Tondo, Claudio; Forleo, Giovanni Battista",Europace,143,21

The aim of this study was to compare two systems providing patients with diabetes with insoles in terms of their ecological, economic and social footprints. Prefabricated insoles (PRI) were compared with custom-made insoles (CMI). Using a welfare-economic monetary approach, costs were estimated for (1) treatment, (2) travelling to and from the hospital in terms of both fuel and time consumed by the patients and (3) society through emissions contributing to climate change. The proportion of patients/year that could be supplied within the same budget, for each individual treatment, was calculated. The cost of the insoles was 825 SEK (PRI) and 1450 SEK (CMI), respectively. The cost, mean value/patient due to the consumption of patients' time at the department, was 754 SEK (PRI) and 1508 SEK (CMI), respectively. Emissions, in terms of CO2 equivalent, were 13.7 (PRI) and 27.4 (CMI), respectively. Using PRI, a total of 928 patients could be provided/year compared with 500 patients if CMI are used. By using PRI, the cost/treatment was reduced by 46%. The cost of treatment dominated and the cost of time consumed by patients were also substantial. The societal cost of contributing to climate change was of low importance. By using PRI, the needs of 86% more patients could be met within the same budget.

AIMS: To investigate the response to these restrictions in elective gynaecological and In vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the Medicare Item Reports for the number of elective gynaecological (labioplasty, vulvoplasty; prolapse and continence; operative hysteroscopy; hysterectomy; fertility) and IVF procedures claimed in Australia between January-June 2020 and compared these to January-June 2019. RESULTS: The number of included gynaecological and IVF procedures performed in January-June 2020 decreased by -13.71% and -12.56%, respectively, compared to January-June 2019. The greatest reductions were in May 2020 (gynaecology -43.71%; IVF -51.63% compared to May 2019), while April 2020 reported decreases of -37.69% and -31.42% in gynaecological and IVF procedures, respectively. In April 2020, 1963 IVF cycle initiations (-45.20% compared to April 2019), 2453 oocyte retrievals (-26.99%) and 3136 embryo transfers (-22.95%) were billed.

This carries public health implications, particularly in a global public health emergency such as COVID-19. The study objective was to understand pet owners' consideration of their pets' welfare when making personal healthcare decisions specific to COVID-19. A large sample (n = 1356) of adult pet owners in the U.S. completed an online survey in April and May of 2020, coinciding with the onset of social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Respondents were asked if they would delay or avoid testing or treatment for COVID-19 due to concern for their pets' welfare, and a follow-up question asked them to elaborate. Multinomial logistic regression models showed that attachment to pets and socioeconomic resources were important factors in pet owners' hypothetical decisions regarding testing and treatment for COVID-19. Qualitative analysis of responses to the follow-up question revealed explanations across three themes: (1) the need to find pet accommodation prior to seeking healthcare; (2) pet-related concerns; and, (3) human-related concerns. Pet owners often cited concern for their pets' welfare as a factor contributing to their decision making; participants' lack of a concrete plan for pet care was most commonly cited as the reason for their delay in seeking healthcare. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experience unique obstacles to accessing healthcare related to COVID-19, which has implications for future public health emergencies. Increased disease spread and prevalence of poor health outcomes could result if pet owners delay or avoid testing or treatment. Communities can benefit from a One Health/One Welfare approach to collaboration between human and animal health and service providers to reduce COVID-19 spread and secure the well-being of people and their pets.","Applebaum, Jennifer W; Adams, Britni L; Eliasson, Michelle N; Zsembik, Barbara A; McDonald, Shelby E",One Health,143,16

Given the rapid deterioration of patients' condition before death, markers with efficient prognostic values are urgently required. During the treatment process, notable changes in plasma potassium levels have been observed among severely ill patients. We aimed to evaluate the association between average plasma potassium (Ka +) levels during hospitalization and 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the Zhongfaxincheng branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China from February 8 to 28, 2020 were enrolled in this study. We followed patients up to 30 days after admission. Results: A total of 136 patients were included in the study. The average age was 62.1±14.6 years and 51.5% of patients were male. The median baseline potassium level was 4.3 (3.9-4.6) mmol/L and Ka + level during hospitalization was 4.4 (4.2-4.7) mmol/L; the median number of times that we measured potassium was 4 (3-5). The 30-day mortality was 19.1%. A J-shaped association was observed between Ka + and 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression showed that compared with the reference group (Ka + 4.0 to <4.5 mmol/L), 30-day mortality was 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.54-7.35, P=0.300), 1.14 (95% CI=0.39-3.32, P=0.810), and 4.14 (95% CI=1.29-13.29, P=0.017) times higher in patients with COVID-19 who had Ka + <4.0, 4.5 to <5.0, and &#8805;5.0 mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19 who had a Ka + level &#8805;5.0 mmol/L had a significantly increased 30-day mortality compared with those who had a Ka + level 4.0 to <4.5 mmol/L.

On the basis of prior research, scientists are testing drugs based on medical therapies for SARS and MERS. Many drugs which include lopinavir, ritonavir and thalidomide are listed in the new recommendations. A topological index is a type of molecular descriptor that simply defines numerical values associated with the molecular structure of a compound that is effectively used in modeling many physicochemical properties in numerous quantitative structure-property/activity relationship (QSPR/QSAR) studies. In this study, several degree-based and neighborhood degree sum-based topological indices for several antiviral drugs were investigated by using a M-polynomial and neighborhood M-polynomial methods. In addition, a QSPR was established between the various topological indices and various physicochemical properties of these antiviral drugs along with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and theaflavin was performed in order to assess the efficacy of the calculated topological indices. The obtained results reveal that topological indices under study have strong correlation with the physicochemical characteristics of the potential antiviral drugs.

Thus far, there is no medication or vaccine to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. As the virus is airborne and transmitted through droplets, there has been significant demand for face masks and other personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of infection. Health care and laboratory workers who come in close contact with infected people or material are at a high risk of infection. Therefore, robust biosafety measures are required at hospitals and laboratories to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Various diagnostic platforms including of serological, molecular and other advanced tools and techniques have been designed and developed for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and each has its own merits and demerits. Molecular assays such as real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) has been used worldwide for diagnosis of COVID-19. Samples such as nasal swabs or oropharyngeal swabs are used for rRT-PCR. Laboratory acquired infection has been a significant problem worldwide, which has gained importance during the current pandemic as the samples for rRT-PCR may contain intact virus with serious threat. COVID-19 can spread to workers during the sampling, transportation, processing, and disposal of tested samples.

Rapidly designing, manufacturing and distributing nAbs requires significant planning across the product value chain and an understanding of the opportunities, challenges and risks throughout. Methods: A systems framework comprised of four critical components is presented to aid in developing effective end-to-end nAbs strategies in the context of a pandemic: (1) product design and optimization, (2) epidemiology, (3) demand and (4) supply. Quantitative models are used to estimate product demand using available epidemiological data, simulate biomanufacturing operations from typical bioprocess parameters and calculate antibody production costs to meet clinical needs under various realistic scenarios. Results: In a US-based case study during the 9-month period from March 15 to December 15, 2020, the projected number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 15.73 million. The estimated product volume needed to meet therapeutic demand for the maximum number of clinically eligible patients ranged between 6.3 and 31.5 tons for 0.5 and 2.5 g dose sizes, respectively. The relative production scale and cost needed to meet demand are calculated for different centralized and distributed manufacturing scenarios. Conclusions: Meeting demand for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs requires significant manufacturing capacity and planning for appropriate administration in clinical settings. MIT Center for Biomedical Innovation's data-driven tools presented can help inform time-critical decisions by providing insight into important operational and policy considerations for making nAbs broadly accessible, while considering time and resource constraints.","Guttieres, D.; Sinskey, A.

Here, we sought to determine the effect of a history of neurological disorder and development of neurological manifestations on mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: From March 20 to May 20, 2020, hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 were identified at four hospitals in Ohio. Previous history of neurological disease was classified by severity (major or minor). Neurological manifestations during disease course were also grouped into major and minor manifestations. Encephalopathy, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures were defined as major manifestations, whereas minor neurological manifestations included headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, dizziness or vertigo, and myalgias. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine significant predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Results: 574/626 hospitalized patients were eligible for inclusion. Mean age of the 574 patients included in the analysis was 62.8 (SD 17.6), with 298 (51.9%) women. Of the cohort, 240(41.8%) patients had a prior history of neurological disease (HND), of which 204 (35.5%) had a major history of neurological disease (HND). Mortality rates were higher in patients with a major HND (30.9 vs. 15.4%; p = 0.00002), although this was not a significant predictor of death. Major neurological manifestations were recorded in 203/574 (35.4%) patients during disease course. The mortality rate in patients who had major neurological manifestations was 37.4% compared to 11.9% (p = 2 × 10(−12)) in those who did not. In multivariate analysis, major neurological manifestation (OR 2.1, CI 1.3-3.4; p = 0.002) was a predictor of death. Conclusions: In this retrospective study, history of pre-existing neurological disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients did not impact mortality; however, development of major neurological manifestations during disease course was found to be an independent predictor of death. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings.","Salahuddin, Hisham; Afreen, Ehad; Sheikh, Irfan S.; Lateef, Sohaib; Dawod, Giana; Daboul, Judy; Karim, Nurose; Gharaibeh, Khaled; Al-Chalabi, Mustafa; Park, Sihyeong; Castonguay, Alicia C.; Assaly, Ragheb; Safi, Fadi; Matal, Marla; Sheikh, Ajaz; Tietjen, Gretchen; Malaiyandi, Deepa; James, Elysia; Ali, Imran; Zaidi, Syed F.; Abdelwahed, Ahmad; Kung, Vieh; Burgess, Richard; Jumaa, Mouhammad A.",Front Neurol,143,17

METHOD: Young subjects who have been followed up with a primary diagnosis of OCD in a university hospital were reached by telephone or online programs to assess symptom profile, symptom severity and exacerbation during pandemic. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (CY-BOCS) and Clinical Global Impression- Severity (CGI-S) Scales were used to rate symptom profile and severity before pandemic and during pandemic periods. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the frequency of contamination obsessions (p=0.008) and cleaning/washing compulsions (p=0.039) during pandemic period. CY-BOCS obsessions (p<0.001), compulsions subscales (p<0.001) and total scores (p<0.001), and CGI-S scores (p<0.001) during pandemic period were statistically higher than before pandemic period. There was a significant relationship between the change in CY-BOCS scores with talking/searching in the social environment about COVID-19, daily preoccupation about COVID-19, duration of OCD diagnosis and diagnosis of COVID-19 in someone familiar.

Carriers of the IFNL4-dG allele but not the IFNL4-TT allele are able to produce the IFN-λ4 protein. Patients with hepatitis C virus that do not produce the IFN-λ4 protein have higher rates of viral clearance suggesting a potential inhibitory role of IFN-λ4 in liver-tropic infections. METHODS: In this study, it was investigated whether children infected with Plasmodium falciparum, which has a well-characterized liver stage infection, would be more susceptible to clinical malaria relative to their IFNL4-rs368234815 allele. A cohort of 122 children from a malaria holoendemic region of Kenya was analysed. Episodes of clinical malaria and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) were determined using information collected from birth to 2 years of age. The dinucleotide frameshift variant IFNL4-rs368234815-dG/TT was genotyped using a TaqMan assay. RESULTS: In this cohort, 33% of the study participants had the dG/dG genotype, 45% had the dG/TT genotype, and 22% had TT/TT genotype. The number and time to first episode of clinical malaria and URTIs with respect to the IFNL4-rs368234815 allele was evaluated. It was found that children that carried the IFNL4-rs368234815-dG allele had an increased number of clinical malaria episodes. In addition, there was a significant association between earlier age of first malaria infection with carriers of the IFNL4-dG allele (p-value: 0.021). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the ability to produce IFN-λ4 negatively affects host immune protection against P. falciparum malaria in Kenyan children.

In recent years, on-site H(2) gas generators, which produce high-purity H(2) by water electrolysis, have begun to be introduced in hospitals, clinics, beauty salons, and fitness clubs because of their ease of use. In general, these generators produce H(2) at a low-flow rate, so physicians are concerned that an effective blood concentration of H(2) may not be ensured when the gas is delivered through a nasal cannula. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate blood concentrations of H(2) delivered from an H(2) gas generator via a nasal cannula. METHODS: We administered 100% H(2), produced by an H(2) gas generator, at a low-flow rate of 250 mL/min via a nasal cannula to three spontaneously breathing micro miniature pigs. An oxygen mask was placed over the nasal cannula to administer oxygen while minimizing H(2) leakage, and a catheter was inserted into the carotid artery to monitor the arterial blood H(2) concentration. RESULTS: During the first hour of H(2) inhalation, the mean (standard error (SE)) H(2) concentrations and saturations in the arterial blood of the three pigs were 1,560 (413) nL/mL and 8.85% (2.34%); 1,190 (102) nL/mL and 6.74% (0.58%); and 1,740 (181) nL/mL and 9.88% (1.03%), respectively. These values are comparable to the concentration one would expect if 100% of the H(2) released from the H(2) gas generator is taken up by the body. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of 100% H(2) produced by an H(2) gas generator, even at low-flow rates, can increase blood H(2) concentrations to levels that previous non-clinical and clinical studies demonstrated to be therapeutically effective. The combination of a nasal cannula and an oxygen mask is a convenient way to reduce H(2) leakage while maintaining oxygenation.","Sano, Motoaki; Shirakawa, Kohsuke; Katsumata, Yoshinori; Ichihara, Genki; Kobayashi, Eiji",J Clin Med Res,143,3

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of abnormal LFTs on clinical outcomes in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on 2,912 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a makeshift hospital in China between 5 February and 23 March 2020. The association between LFTs abnormalities (baseline and peak values) and clinical outcomes was measured by using Cox regression models. Results: On admission 1,414 patients (48.6%) had abnormal LFTs, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation in 662 (22.7%), 221 (7.6%), 52 (1.8%), 135 (4.6%), and 536 (18.5%) patients, respectively, and hypoalbuminemia in 737 (25.3%) patients. During a median 13 (IQR: 8–19) days of hospitalization, 61 patients (2.1%) died, 106 patients (3.6%) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and 75 patients (2.6%) required mechanical ventilation. After adjustment for confounders, baseline abnormal LFTs were independently associated with increased risks of mortality (adjusted HR 3.66, 95%CI 1.64–8.19, p = 0.002), ICU admission (adjusted HR 3.12 95%CI 1.86–5.23, p < 0.001), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 3.00, 95%CI 1.63–5.52, p < 0.001), which was homogeneous across the severity of COVID-19 infection. Among the parameters of LTFs, the associations with the outcomes were more pronounced for AST and albumin abnormality. In contrast, ALT elevation was not significantly associated with those outcomes. Similar results were observed for peak values of LFTs during hospitalization. Conclusions: Abnormality of AST, albumin, TBIL, ALP, and GGT but not ALT were independently associated with adverse outcomes.","Lv, Yong; Zhao, Xiaodi; Wang, Yan; Zhu, Jingpu; Ma, Chengfei; Feng, Xiaodong; Ma, Yao; Zheng, Yipeng; Yang, Liyu; Han, Guohong; Xie, Huahong",Front Med (Lausanne),143,18

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at Washington University-Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO. PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive patients admitted to the medical ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation from March 12, 2020, to April 21, 2020, were included. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor blocker, was prescribed at the discretion of the treating physicians to patients with a clinical picture compatible with cytokine release syndrome. MEASUREMENTS: All the patients were followed to death or hospital discharge. Demographic and laboratory data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical record. Interleukin-6 levels were measured at days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21. Infections were divided into culture positive and culture negative (clinically suspected and treated). The main outcomes were infectious complications and interleukin-6 levels at different points in time. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 were on mechanical ventilation during the study period. Twenty-seven (68%) were male, and 31 (72.1%) were African-American. Median Charlson score was 2 (interquartile range, 0–4). Median Pao2/Fio2 was 171.5 (122–221) on the day of mechanical ventilation initiation, and 13 patients (30.2%) required vasopressors. C-reactive protein was 142.7 (97.7–213.7), d-dimer 1,621 (559–13,434), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II 11 (9–15). Interleukin-6 levels at admission were 61 pg/mL (interquartile range, 28.6–439 pg/mL). Patients treated with tocilizumab had higher levels of interleukin-6 at each measurement (days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21) compared with patients receiving standard of care. Both groups reached peak interleukin-6 levels at day 7. Administration of tocilizumab was associated with a trend toward increased risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-6 levels peak at day 7 in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and follows a similar trajectory in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation irrespective of treatment with interleukin-6R blockers.

We show that for liquid specimens (here suspension of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture medium), virus inactivation rate under heat treatment at 70°C can vary by almost two orders of magnitude depending on the treatment procedure, from a half-life of 0.86 min (95% credible interval: [0.09, 1.77]) in closed vials in a heat block to 37.0 min ([12.65, 869.82]) in uncovered plates in a dry oven.

Evidence from a large number of randomized controlled trials can help when discussing treatment options with families. Indigenous children in the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand experience more OM than other children. In some places, Indigenous children continue to suffer from the most severe forms of the disease. Communities with more than 4% of the children affected by chronic tympanic membrane perforation have a major public health problem (high-risk populations). Higher rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and chronic suppurative lung disease (including bronchiectasis) are also seen. These children will often benefit from effective treatment of persistent (or recurrent) bacterial infection.","Morris, Peter S.; Leach, Amanda J.",Pediatr Clin North Am,143,33

Now celebrating its 50th anniversary, the PDB houses >175,000 experimentally determined atomic structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes with one another and small molecules and drugs. The importance of three-dimensional (3D) biostructure information for research and education obtains from the intimate link between molecular form and function evident throughout biology. Among the most prolific consumers of PDB data are biomedical researchers, who rely on the open access resource as the authoritative source of well-validated, expertly curated biostructures. This review recounts how the PDB grew from just seven protein structures to contain more than 49,000 structures of human proteins that have proven critical for understanding their roles in human health and disease. It then describes how these structures are used in academe and industry to validate drug targets, assess target druggability, characterize how tool compounds and other small-molecules bind to drug targets, guide medicinal chemistry optimization of binding affinity and selectivity, and overcome challenges during preclinical drug development. Three case studies drawn from oncology exemplify how structural biologists and open access to PDB structures impacted recent regulatory approvals of antineoplastic drugs.","Burley, Stephen K.",J Biol Chem,143,29

Do investors sacrifice return for pursuing ESG-aligned megatrend goals? The study analyses the risk-adjusted financial performance of ESG-themed megatrend investment strategies in global equity markets. The analysis covers nine themes for the period 2015–2019: environmental megatrends covering energy efficiency, food security, and water scarcity; social megatrends covering ageing, millennials, and urbanisation; governance megatrends covered by cybersecurity, disruptive technologies, and robotics. We construct megatrend factor portfolios based on signalling theory and formulate a novel measure for stock megatrend exposure (MTE), based on the relative fund flows into the corresponding thematic ETFs. We apply pure factor portfolios methodology based on constrained WLS cross-sectional regressions to calculate Fama-French factor returns. Time-series regression rests on the generalised method of moments estimator (GMM) that uses robust distance instruments. Our findings show that each environmental megatrend, as well as the disruptive technologies megatrend, yielded positive and significant alphas relative to the passive strategy, although this outperformance becomes statistically insignificant in the Fama-French 5-factor model context. The important result is that most of the megatrend factor portfolios yielded significant non-negative alphas; which supports our assumption that megatrend investing strategy promotes SDGs while not sacrificing returns, even when accounting for transaction costs up to 50bps/annum. Higher transaction costs, as is the case for some of these ETFs with expense ratios reaching 80-100bps, may be an indication of two things: ESG-themed megatrend investors were willing to sacrifice ca. 30-50bps of annual return to remain aligned with sustainability targets, or that expense ratio may well decline in the future.","Naffa, Helena; Fain, Máté",PLoS One,143,23

Under this system, lockdowns were established, lifted, or prolonged according to the weekly health authorities’ assessment of municipalities’ epidemiological situation. The public announcements about the confinement situation of municipalities country-wide are made typically on Tuesdays or Wednesdays before noon, have received extensive media coverage, and generated sharp stock market fluctuations. Municipalities are the smallest administrative division in Chile, with each city broken down typically into several municipalities. We analyze social media behavior in response to the confinement situation of the population at the municipal level. The dynamic quarantine scheme offers a unique opportunity for our analysis, given that municipalities display a high degree of heterogeneity, both in size and in the socioeconomic status of their population. We exploit the variability over time in municipalities’ confinement situations, resulting from the dynamic quarantine strategy, and the cross-sectional variability in their socioeconomic characteristics to evaluate the impact of these characteristics on social sentiment. Using event study and panel data methods, we find that proxies for social sentiment based on Twitter queries are negatively related (more pessimistic) to increases in the number of confined people, but with a statistically significant effect concentrated on people from the wealthiest cohorts of the population. For indicators of social sentiment based on Google Trends, we found that search intensity during the periods surrounding government announcements is positively related to increases in the total number of confined people. Still, this effect does not seem to be dependent on the segments of the population affected by the quarantine. Furthermore, we show that the observed heterogeneity in sentiment mirrors heterogeneity in stock market reactions to government announcements. We provide evidence that the observed stock market behavior around quarantine announcements can be explained by the number of people from the wealthiest segments of the population entering or exiting lockdown.","Díaz, Fernando; Henríquez, Pablo A.",PLoS One,143,1

However, how state Divisions of Motor Vehicles (DMV) adapted their operation policies in response to COVID-19 remains unknown. This study analyzed adaptations to the content of state DMV operation policies during the COVID-19 pandemic across 50 US states and assessed the relationships between these policy adoptions and their state-level COVID-19 restriction orders. METHODS: We merged data on policy adaptations due to COVID-19 obtained from DMV websites for all 50 states with data on state-level restrictions obtained from the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP). We created a codebook and analyzed the DMV policy adaptations in the following three areas: (1) road testing, (2) licensure extension and renewals, and (3) facility reopening. Two trained coders independently reviewed and coded the adaptations of policy content related to precaution to spread of COVID-19 and ease of obtaining licensure. We calculated summary scores for policy adaptations and ease of licensure and compared these scores across three categories of state-level COVID-19 restrictions using ANOVA. RESULTS: DMVs in all 50 states adapted their policies to slow the spread of COVID-19. The ease of licensure summary scores increased in some states but decreased in others. Extensions for licensure renewals was the most common change. Adoption of COVID-19 precautions during the road test was the most common road test adaptation, while road test waivers were the most controversial. Requiring appointments, social distancing, and/or face coverings/personal protective equipment [PPE] were common adaptations during facility reopening. However, variations in level of policy adaptations and ease of licensure were not associated with the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into policy adaptations made by state DMVs to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and may inform future policy adaptations in DMVs and other government agencies during public health emergencies.","Feiss, Robyn; Hautmann, Amanda; Asa, Nicole; Hamann, Cara; Peek-Asa, Corinne; Yang, Jingzhen",Accid Anal Prev,143,16

Rooted into statistical physics, the ERGMs framework has been successfully employed for reconstructing networks, detecting statistically significant patterns in graphs, counting networked configurations with given properties. From a technical point of view, the ERGMs workflow is defined by two subsequent optimization steps: the first one concerns the maximization of Shannon entropy and leads to identify the functional form of the ensemble probability distribution that is maximally non-committal with respect to the missing information; the second one concerns the maximization of the likelihood function induced by this probability distribution and leads to its numerical determination. This second step translates into the resolution of a system of O(N) non-linear, coupled equations (with N being the total number of nodes of the network under analysis), a problem that is affected by three main issues, i.e. accuracy, speed and scalability. The present paper aims at addressing these problems by comparing the performance of three algorithms (i.e. Newton’s method, a quasi-Newton method and a recently-proposed fixed-point recipe) in solving several ERGMs, defined by binary and weighted constraints in both a directed and an undirected fashion. While Newton’s method performs best for relatively little networks, the fixed-point recipe is to be preferred when large configurations are considered, as it ensures convergence to the solution within seconds for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes (e.g. the Internet, Bitcoin). We attach to the paper a Python code implementing the three aforementioned algorithms on all the ERGMs considered in the present work.","Vallarano, Nicolò; Bruno, Matteo; Marchese, Emiliano; Trapani, Giuseppe; Saracco, Fabio; Cimini, Giulio; Zanon, Mario; Squartini, Tiziano",Sci Rep,143,24

However, due to the absence of large-scale race-based data, it is impossible to measure the extent to which immigrant and racialized communities are experiencing the pandemic and the impact of measures taken (or not) to mitigate these impacts, especially at a local level. To address this issue, the Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership partnered with the Collaborative Critical Research for Equity and Transformation in Health lab at the University of Ottawa and the Canadians of African Descent Health Organization to implement a project to build local organizational capacities to understand, monitor, and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant and racialized populations. This research note describes the working framework used for this project, proposed indicators for measuring the determinants of health among immigrant and racialized populations, and the data gaps we encountered. Recommendations are made to policymakers, and community and health stakeholders at all levels on how to collect and use data to address COVID-19 health inequities, including data collection strategies aimed at community engagement in the collection of disaggregated data, improving methods for collecting and analyzing data on immigrants and racialized groups and policies to enable and enhance data disaggregation.

In large part, this may be attributed to the high variability of viral species and the difficulties in developing broad-spectrum, yet specific, diagnostic assays. To overcome this problem, a novel method for the detection of viruses is described in the current manuscript. The technique relies on the addition of synthetic oligonucleotides to both termini of RNA fragments in a sequence-dependent manner during first- and second-strand DNA synthesis; these oligonucleotides are used subsequently for amplification of the viral nucleic acids of interest. The recognition of the target sequence by the oligonucleotides is mediated by short (6–8 nt) conserved regions, which facilitates development of broad–spectrum assays. The method has been tested for coronaviruses, although it may be also adopted for other RNA viruses.","Pyrc, Krzysztof; Stożek, Karol; Galan, Wojciech; Potempa, Jan",J Virol Methods,143,20

Timely prognosis and treatment are important to control the spread of this infection. Unreliable screening systems and limited number of clinical facilities are the major hurdles in controlling the spread of covid-19. Nowadays, many automated detection systems based on deep learning techniques using computed tomography (CT) images have been proposed to detect covid-19. However, these systems have the following drawbacks: (i) limited data problem poses a major hindrance to train the deep neural network model to provide accurate diagnosis, (ii) random choice of hyperparameters of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) significantly affects the classification performance, since the hyperparameters have to be application dependent and, (iii) the generalization ability using CNN classification is usually not validated. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose two models: (i) based on a transfer learning approach, and (ii) using novel strategy to optimize the CNN hyperparameters using Whale optimization-based BAT algorithm + AdaBoost classifier built using dynamic ensemble selection techniques. According to our second method depending on the characteristics of test sample, the classifier is chosen, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and simultaneously produced promising results.

It is intended to support tactical decision-making around localized/staged re-institution of pre-pandemic levels and patterns of social/economic/health service delivery activity, following an initial stage of pan-societal closures of social/economic institutions and reductions in services. By design, CovidSIMVL supports the generation of dynamic models that reflect heterogeneity within and between an array of interacting localized contexts. Within a localized context (a CovidSIMVL ""Universe""), this heterogeneity is embodied in a hierarchically-organized array of rules that reflect the pathophysiology of transmission, the role of physical proximity in infection transmission (""HazardRadius"" in CovidSIMVL),and the movement of people within a localized setting (""MingleFactor""). Within an interacting array of localized contexts (a CovidSIMVL ""Multiverse""), this heterogeneity is embodied in different patterns of movement of agents between different contexts. To calibrate the HazardRadius and MingleFactor parameters, growth curves were generated with CovidSIMVL by setting different configurations of values on those two factors. These were compared to the characteristic shape of curves generated by equation-based compartmental models (e.g., SEIR models) that fit different real-world datasets that embody different reproduction numbers (R0). By operating with parameter values in CovidSIMVL that generate ""real-world"" growth curves, the tool can be used to produce plausible simulations of localized chains of transmission, including cross-over transmission among impacted/unaffected contexts or sub-populations, via agents who interact within and across arrays of local contexts, such as schools, multigenerational families, recreational facilities, places of work, or other settings in which people are in close physical proximity.","Moselle, K.

DESIGN: Perspective supplemented with epidemiologic insights from available online databases. METHODS: We extracted data from the Global Vision Database (2017) and Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) to highlight temporal trends in global blindness since 1990, and provide a narrative overview of how COVID-19 may derail progress toward the goals of VISION 2020. RESULTS: Over 2 decades of VISION 2020 advocacy and program implementation have culminated in a universal reduction of combined age-standardized prevalence of moderate-to-severe vision impairment (MSVI) across all world regions since 1990. Between 1990 and 2017, low-income countries observed large reductions in the age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 persons of vitamin A deficiency (25,155 to 19,187), undercorrected refractive disorders (2,286 to 2,040), cataract (1,846 to 1,690), onchocerciasis (5,577 to 2,871), trachoma (506 to 159), and leprosy (36 to 26). Despite these reductions, crude projections suggest that more than 700 million persons will experience MSVI or blindness by 2050, principally owing to our growing and ageing global population.

Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPH) for physical health conditions are an indicator of health service access, integration and effectiveness, and are elevated in long term studies of people with MH conditions. We aimed to examine whether PPH rates were elevated in MH service users over a 12-month follow-up period more suitable for routine health indicator reporting. We also examined whether MH service users had increased PPH rates at a younger age, potentially reflecting the younger onset of chronic physical conditions. METHODS: A population-wide data linkage in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, population 7.8 million. PPH rates in 178 009 people using community MH services in 2016–2017 were compared to population rates. Primary outcomes were crude and age- and disadvantage-standardised annual PPH episode rate (episodes per 100 000 population), PPH day rate (hospital days per 100 000) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (AIRR). RESULTS: MH service users had higher rates of PPH admission (AIRR 3.6, 95% CI 3.5–3.6) and a larger number of hospital days (AIRR 5.2, 95% CI 5.2–5.3) than other NSW residents due to increased likelihood of admission, more admissions per person and longer length of stay. Increases were greatest for vaccine-preventable conditions (AIRR 4.7, 95% CI 4.5–5.0), and chronic conditions (AIRR 3.7, 95% CI 3.6–3.7). The highest number of admissions and relative risks were for respiratory and metabolic conditions, including chronic obstructive airways disease (AIRR 5.8, 95% CI 5.5–6.0) and diabetic complications (AIRR 5.4, 95% CI 5.1–5.8). One-quarter of excess potentially preventable bed days in MH service users were due to vaccine-related conditions, including vaccine-preventable respiratory illness. Age-related increases in risk occurred earlier in MH service users, particularly for chronic and vaccine-preventable conditions. PPH rates in MH service users aged 20–29 were similar to population rates of people aged 60 and over. These substantial differences were not explained by socio-economic disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS: PPHs for physical health conditions are substantially increased in people with MH conditions. Short term (12-month) PPH rates may be a useful lead indicator of increased physical morbidity and less accessible, integrated or effective health care. High hospitalisation rates for vaccine-preventable respiratory infections and hepatitis underline the importance of vaccination in MH service users and suggests potential benefits of prioritising this group for COVID-19 vaccination.","Sara, G.; Chen, W.; Large, M.; Ramanuj, P.; Curtis, J.; McMillan, F.; Mulder, C.L.; Currow, D.; Burgess, P.",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,143,2

The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process. METHODS: Publicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (R(t)) based on retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t-tests were used to compare temperature and peak R(t) cross-sectionally. RESULTS: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a R(t) of 1 or below after April 15, 2020. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of mitigating interventions. However, the R(t)s remained around 1 for most areas since then and there were some small and short rebounds in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas when interventions were relaxed. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak R(t) than that of cities with cold temperature. However, they were not statistically significant and large geographic variations existed. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive interventions might have mitigated the current pandemic of COVID-19, while temperature might have weak effects on the virus transmission. We may need to prepare for a possible return of the coronavirus outbreak.","Yu, Xinhua",One Health,143,1

This has aroused concern regarding the ability of domestic cats to spread the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. We systematically demonstrated the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in cats. Serial passaging of the virus between cats dramatically attenuated the viral transmissibility, likely owing to variations of the amino acids in the receptor-binding domain sites of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 between humans and cats. These findings provide insight into the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and provide information for protecting the health of humans and cats. Article Summary Line: Domestic cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and have attenuated transmissibility after serial passaging.","Bao, Linlin; Song, Zhiqi; Xue, Jing; Gao, Hong; Liu, Jiangning; Wang, Jie; Guo, Qian; Zhao, Binbin; Qu, Yajin; Qi, Feifei; Gong, Shuran; Liu, Mingya; Qi, Lv; Li, Dan; Han, Yunlin; Zhao, Wenjie; Deng, Shoulong; Liu, Yunpeng; Xiang, Zhiguang; Yang, Bochao; Deng, Wei; Yu, Haisheng; Cong, Zhe; Wei, Qiang; Xu, Jianguo; Gao, George F; Qin, Chuan",J Infect Dis,143,14

This study aims to identify phytochemicals from P. amarus and assess their anti-viral activity through in silico methods against the main protease (MPro) enzyme of the novel coronavirus. 190 compounds were obtained from literature and docked against 3CLPro and 16 compounds showed great binding affinity with 3CLPro with their values lying between -8.9 kcal/mol to -9.6 kcal/mol. The top two compounds, Myricitrin (CID: 5352000) and Quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (CID: 12004528) gave high binding affinity values of -9.6 kcal/mol and -9.4 kcal/mol respectively and also display favourable binding interactions with the MPro. Both the compounds were further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA based binding free energy calculations. ADMET and drug-likeness properties were studied to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds. Favourable pharmacokinetic results reinforced the applicability of the compounds assessed. Along with continuous studies being carried out with chemical compounds, research needs to expand into all areas, including the use of natural compounds as drug compounds.

METHODS: We cloned and purified the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV and examined their immunogenicity with serum from patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. An ELISA based on recombinant nucleocapsid protein for IgG detection was tested with serum from 149 healthy blood donors who donated 3 years previously and with serum positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV (by indirect immunofluorescence assay) from 106 patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV was studied with the ELISA in healthy blood donors who donated during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, non-pneumonic hospital inpatients, and symptom-free health-care workers. All positive samples were confirmed by two separate western-blot assays (with recombinant nucleocapsid protein and recombinant spike polypeptide). FINDINGS: Western-blot analysis showed that the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV are highly immunogenic. The specificity of the IgG antibody test (ELISA with positive samples confirmed by the two western-blot assays) was 100%, and the sensitivity was 94·3%. Three of 400 healthy blood donors who donated during the SARS outbreak and one of 131 non-pneumonic paediatric inpatients were positive for IgG antibodies, confirmed by the two western-blot assays (total, 0·48% of our study population).

However, supply chain logistics have hampered global vaccine delivery, which is impacting mass vaccination strategies. Recent studies have identified different strategies for vaccine dose administration so that supply constraints issues are diminished. These include increasing the time between consecutive doses in a two-dose vaccine regimen and reducing the dosage of the second dose. We consider both of these strategies in a mathematical modeling study of a non-replicating viral vector adenovirus vaccine in this work. We investigate the impact of different prime-boost strategies by quantifying their effects on immunological outcomes based on simple ordinary differential equations. The boost dose is administered either at a standard dose (SD) of 1000 or at a low dose (LD) of 500 or 250 vaccine particles. Simulated Second dose fractionation highlights previously shown dose-dependent features of the immune mechanism. In agreement with clinical characteristics of 175 COVID-19 recovered patients, the model predictions for either SD/SD or SD/LD regimens mainly show that by stretching the prime-boost interval until 18 or 20 weeks, the minimum promoted antibody (Nab) response is comparable with the neutralizing antibody level of COVID-19 recovered patients. The minimum stimulated antibody in SD/SD regimen is identical with the high level of clinical trial data. It is at the same range of the medium-high level of Nab in SD/LD, where the second dose is half or quarter of the standard dose.","farhangsardroodi, s.; Korosec, C.; Gholami, S.; Craig, M.; Moyles, I.

To find a valid plan for these services, an optimization problem called the home healthcare routing and scheduling problem is motivated to perform the logistics of the home care services. Although most studies mainly focus on minimizing the total cost of logistics activities, no study, as far as we know, has treated the patients’ satisfaction as an objective function under uncertainty. To make this problem more practical, this study proposes a bi-objective optimization methodology to model a multi-period and multi-depot home healthcare routing and scheduling problem in a fuzzy environment. With regards to a group of uncertain parameters such as the time of travel and services as well as patients’ satisfaction, a fuzzy approach named as the Jimenez’s method, is also utilized. To address the proposed home healthcare problem, new and well-established metaheuristics are obtained. Although the social engineering optimizer (SEO) has been applied to several optimization problems, it has not yet been applied in the healthcare routing and scheduling area. Another innovation is to develop a new modified multi-objective version of SEO by using an adaptive memory strategy, so-called AMSEO. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided by comparing the algorithms based on multi-objective metrics and sensitivity analyses. The practicality and efficiency of the AMSEO in this context lends weight to the development and application of the approach more broadly.","Fathollahi-Fard, Amir Mohammad; Ahmadi, Abbas; Goodarzian, Fariba; Cheikhrouhou, Naoufel",Appl Soft Comput,143,16

Antibodies binding to either JS7 or the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD, as well as those that disrupt binding between a fragment of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD, are proportional to disease severity and clinical outcome. Binding to JS7 was inhibited by linear peptides from the RBD interface with ACE2.

Some antiviral drugs that can be used against COVID-19 are associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity. AIM: To analyze the clinical significance of the dynamic monitoring of the liver function of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 at the Department of Infection, Shantou Central Hospital. The exclusion criteria for all patients were: (1) History of chronic liver disease; (2) History of kidney disease; (3) History of coronary heart disease; (4) History of malignancy; or (5) History of diabetes. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase, and total bilirubin of patients with COVID-19 were measured on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 after admission, and compared to non-COVID-19 patents. RESULTS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 (seven men and five women) and twelve controls (eight men and four women) were included. There were one, two, and nine patients with severe, mild, and moderate COVID-19, respectively. There were no differences in age and sex between the two groups (both P > 0.05). No significant differences were found in albumin, ALT, AST, γ-glutamyltransferase, or total bilirubin between the controls and the patients with COVID-19 on day 1 of hospitalization (all P > 0.05). Serum albumin showed a decreasing trend from days 0 to 7 of hospitalization, reaching the lowest level on day 7. Total bilirubin was higher on day 3 than on day 7. ALT, AST, and γ-glutamyltransferase did not change significantly over time. The severe patient was observed to have ALT levels of 67 U/L and AST levels of 75 U/L on day 7, ALT of 71 U/L and AST of 35 U/L on day 14, and ALT of 210 U/L and AST of 123 U/L on day 21.

The latter has attracted attention as a viable alternative to disposable biosensors, also offering prospects for rapid screening of biomolecules or biomolecular interactions. In this context here, we developed an approach to successfully regenerate a fiber-optic (FO)-SPR surface when utilizing cobalt (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) surface chemistry. To achieve this, we tested multiple regeneration conditions that can disrupt the NTA chelate on a surface fully saturated with His(6)-tagged antibody fragments (scFv-33H1F7) over ten regeneration cycles. The best surface regeneration was obtained when combining 100 mM EDTA, 500 mM imidazole and 0.5% SDS at pH 8.0 for 1 min with shaking at 150 rpm followed by washing with 0.5 M NaOH for 3 min. The true versatility of the established approach was proven by regenerating the NTA surface for ten cycles with three other model system bioreceptors, different in their size and structure: His(6)-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment (receptor binding domain, RBD), a red fluorescent protein (RFP) and protein origami carrying 4 RFPs (Tet12SN-RRRR). Enabling the removal of His(6)-tagged bioreceptors from NTA surfaces in a fast and cost-effective manner can have broad applications, spanning from the development of biosensors and various biopharmaceutical analyses to the synthesis of novel biomaterials.","Qu, Jia-Huan; Leirs, Karen; Escudero, Remei; Strmšek, Žiga; Jerala, Roman; Spasic, Dragana; Lammertyn, Jeroen",Nanomaterials (Basel),143,3

In this rare disease local control is highly dependent on the extent of surgery. Further treatment options are urgently needed. Re-iradiation in combination with localized hyperthermia should be considered for adjuvant and definitive treatment of nonresectable radiation-associated angiosarcomas. The presented hypofractionated re-irradiation schedule with 5 × 4 Gy once per week immediately following wIRA-hyperthermia is a promising option to further reduce the radiation dose recommended so far. This could reduce side effects without compromising local control. ABSTRACT: Background: Radiation-associated angiosarcoma of the breast (RAASB) is a rare, challenging disease, with surgery being the accepted basic therapeutic approach. In contrast, the role of adjuvant and systemic therapies is a subject of some controversy. Local recurrence rates reported in the literature are mostly heterogeneous and are highly dependent on the extent of surgery. In cases of locally recurrent or unresectable RAASB, prognosis is very poor. Methods: We retrospectively report on 10 consecutive RAASB patients, most of them presenting with locally recurrent or unresectable RAASB, which were treated with thermography-controlled water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) superficial hyperthermia (HT) immediately followed by re-irradiation (re-RT). Patients with RAASB were graded based on their tumor extent before onset of radiotherapy (RT). Results: We recorded a local control (LC) rate dependent on tumor extent ranging from a high LC rate of 100% (two of two patients) in the adjuvant setting with an R0 or R2 resection to a limited LC rate of 33% (one of three patients) in patients with inoperable, macroscopic tumor lesions. Conclusion: Combined HT and re-RT should be considered as an option (a) for adjuvant treatment of RAASB, especially in cases with positive resection margins and after surgery of local recurrence (LR), and (b) for definitive treatment of unresectable RAASB.","Notter, Markus; Stutz, Emanuel; Thomsen, Andreas R.; Vaupel, Peter",Cancers (Basel),143,32

However, current residential mobility theories do not fully account for these preferences and behaviors because they focus on why older people move rather than on why they remain in their dwellings and do not consider the temporal or human developmental context of these residential decisions. It is essential to understand why older persons are reluctant to move because their ability to age successfully—have healthy, independent, active, and enjoyable lives—depends on where they live. When they stay put, they also rely more on family caregivers and paid home care providers to maintain their independence, rather than on the supportive services offered by senior group facilities, such as assisted living. They demand more home modification and financial service products, and their residential decisions influence the supply of housing that younger populations can potentially buy or rent. This paper's theoretical analysis proposes that Carstensen's socioemotional selectivity theory (SST), a lifespan theory of motivation, improves our understanding of why older persons age in place—either in their dwellings or more broadly in their communities. It offers an alternative interpretation of how life-changing events, such as retirement, lower incomes, spousal death, physical limitations, and health declines, influence their residential decisions. Whereas residential mobility theories view these transitions as disruptions that change the appropriateness or congruence of where older people live, SST proposes that older persons perceive these events as signs or cues that they are closer to death and must differently prioritize their goals and emotional experiences. Feeling their time is “running out,” older persons are motivated to stay put because moving requires preparations that are physically and emotionally trying and they are able to adapt to their current housing shortcomings. Their residential environments are now also a source of difficult-to-replace positive emotions and provide them with a supportive network of intimate and reliable interpersonal relationships. It is challenging for them to learn how to safely and efficiently conduct their usual activities and routines in another location and to establish new residential attachments and social connections. They would benefit from any net positive emotional payoffs only in a distant future, an unattractive prospect when they perceive a limited time left to live. Empirical studies must test the theoretical propositions presented in this paper. However, the disproportionally large projected future growth of the age 75 and older population with a heightened awareness of their limited time left to live should be a strong rationale for such investigations.","Golant, Stephen M.",J Aging Stud,143,16

The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in adolescents are unknown. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 2–3, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) in a 2:1 ratio to receive two injections of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (100 μg in each) or placebo, administered 28 days apart. The primary objectives were evaluation of the safety of mRNA-1273 in adolescents and the noninferiority of the immune response in adolescents as compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in a phase 3 trial. Secondary objectives included the efficacy of mRNA-1273 in preventing Covid-19 or asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 3732 participants were randomly assigned to receive mRNA-1273 (2489 participants) or placebo (1243 participants). In the mRNA-1273 group, the most common solicited adverse reactions after the first or second injections were injection-site pain (in 93.1% and 92.4%, respectively), headache (in 44.6% and 70.2%, respectively), and fatigue (in 47.9% and 67.8%, respectively); in the placebo group, the most common solicited adverse reactions after the first or second injections were injection-site pain (in 34.8% or 30.3%, respectively), headache (in 38.5% and 30.2%, respectively), and fatigue (in 36.6% and 28.9%, respectively). No serious adverse events related to mRNA-1273 or placebo were noted. The geometric mean titer ratio of pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers in adolescents relative to young adults was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.24), and the absolute difference in serologic response was 0.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.8 to 2.4), which met the noninferiority criterion. No cases of Covid-19 with an onset of 14 days after the second injection were reported in the mRNA-1273 group, and four cases occurred in the placebo group.

Although nucleic acid detection methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the gold standard, during the current pandemic, the deployment of RT-PCR tests has been extremely slow, and key reagents such as PCR primers and RNA extraction kits are at critical shortages. Rapid point-of-care viral antigen detection methods have been previously employed for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Therefore, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in patient samples could also be used for diagnosis of active infection, and alternative methodologies for specific and sensitive viral protein detection should be explored. Targeted mass spectrometry techniques have enabled the identification and quantitation of a defined subset of proteins/peptides at single amino acid resolution with attomole level sensitivity and high reproducibility. Herein, we report a targeted mass spectrometry assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein in a relevant biological matrix. Recombinant full-length spike protein and nucleoprotein were digested and proteotypic peptides were selected for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) quantitation using a high-resolution Orbitrap instrument. A spectral library, which contained seven proteotypic peptides (four from spike protein and three from nucleoprotein) and the top three to four transitions, was generated and evaluated. From the original spectral library, we selected two best performing peptides for the final PRM assay. The assay was evaluated using mock test samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions, added to in vitro derived mucus. The PRM assay provided a limit of detection of ∼200 attomoles and a limit of quantitation of ∼ 390 attomoles. Extrapolating from the test samples, the projected titer of virus particles necessary for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein detection was approximately 2 × 10(5) viral particles/mL, making it an attractive alternative to RT-PCR assays. Potentially, mass spectrometry-based methods for viral antigen detection may deliver higher throughput and could serve as a complementary diagnostic tool to RT-PCR. Furthermore, this assay could be used to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in archived or recently collected biological fluids, in vitro-derived research materials, and wastewater samples.","Cazares, Lisa H.; Chaerkady, Raghothama; Samuel Weng, Shao Huan; Boo, Chelsea C.; Cimbro, Raffaello; Hsu, Hsiang-En; Rajan, Sarav; Dall’Acqua, William; Clarke, Lori; Ren, Kuishu; McTamney, Patrick; Kallewaard-LeLay, Nicole; Ghaedi, Mahboobe; Ikeda, Yasuhiro; Hess, Sonja",Anal Chem,143,1

Given the most likely modes of transmission through droplets, aerosols, and fomite contact, airway procedures such as endotracheal intubation place air medical crews and other health care providers at high risk for exposure. This, together with data that suggest that a large cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients have better outcomes if we can avoid intubating them, creates a need for a safe method of NIV or high-flow oxygen delivery during transport. Commonly used and successful in-hospital regimens for these patients are high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. In some studies, helmet NIV has been shown to be a viable, if not superior, alternative to these therapies for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Furthermore, because it is a sealed and closed space that completely isolates the patient's airway and breathing, it provides a very high degree of protection from exposure to pathogens transmitted through droplets or aerosols. This article discusses practical implementation of helmet NIV in air medical transport.","Beckl, Robert",Air Med J,143,0

Other potential risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight, darker skin pigmentation, co-morbidities, poor diet, certain medications, disadvantaged social and economic status, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. A key question is to understand how and why certain groups of people are more susceptible to COVID-19, whether they have weakened immune systems and what the roles of good nutrition and specific micronutrients are in supporting immune functions. A varied and balanced diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables and the essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin A, B vitamins (folate, vitamin B(6) and vitamin B(12)), vitamin C and the minerals, Fe, Cu, Se and Zn are all known to contribute to the normal functions of the immune system. Avoidance of deficiencies and identification of suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients in targeted groups of patients and in distinct and highly sensitive populations could help to strengthen the resilience of people to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to highlight evidence-based public health messages, to prevent false and misleading claims about the benefits of foods and food supplements and to communicate clearly that the extent of knowledge between micronutrients and COVID-19 infection is still being explored and that no diet will prevent or cure COVID-19 infection. Frequent handwashing and social distancing will be critical to reduce transmission.","Richardson, David P.; Lovegrove, Julie A.",The British journal of nutrition,143,5

Methods The experiment consisted of four parts: therapeutic action, prophylaxsis action, inhibition of virus attachment, and direct virucidal action. Cytopathic effect (CPE) and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) were used to assess antiviral activity. Results CB, epigoitrin, PEP and PEP + ALK + OA fractions from Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) extract significantly increased the viability of MDCK cells pre-infected with the virus compared with the virus control group in all the dilutions (P < 0.01). Pretreated with either pure compounds or chemical fractions of Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) extract in all the dilutions significantly improved the viability of MDCK cells (P < 0.01). The inhibition of virus absorption to the host cells by CB, epigoitrin and PEP was in a dose dependent manner. Conclusion CB, epigoitrin, PEP and PEP + ALK + OA exert their anti-influenza activity by inhibiting the virus multiplication, prophylaxsis and blocking the virus attachment. The primary mode of action of PEP and PEP + ALK + OA is the inhibition of virus replication. The inhibitory effects on virus attachment and multiplication are the main modes for epigoitrin.","Ping, Xiao; Weiyang, Ye; Jianwei, Chen; Xiang, Li",Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine,143,16

In this study, we aimed to assess the psychopathological impact of the pandemic across the general population of Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, and to compare the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms between the general public and healthcare workers. Methods: Four hundred and thirty-two participants completed an online survey including: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale−21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale—Revised (IES-R) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI). Healthcare workers were also asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results: At the DASS-21, 33.3% of the responders presented pathological levels of stress, 25.5% of anxiety, and 35.9% of depression. At the IES-R, 13.9% appeared at risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the PSQI, 57.6% presented sleep disturbances. Female gender and younger age predicted higher scores of distress. Healthcare workers presented higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than the general public. Moreover, working in contact with COVID-19 patients predicted higher scores at the IES-R subscale Intrusion. Conclusion: Our results showed that about a third of our sample presented symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Lombardy; more than half of the responders presented sleep disturbances, and 13% appeared at risk of PTSD. Italian authorities should develop specific strategies to guarantee psychological support to the population of Lombardy, with particular attention to women, young people, and healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients.","Demartini, Benedetta; Nisticò, Veronica; D'Agostino, Armando; Priori, Alberto; Gambini, Orsola",Front Psychiatry,143,27

It is the notion of combining human, animal, and environmental components to address global health challenges that have an ecological interconnectedness. Methods. A cross-sectional study of the available literature cited was conducted from January 1984 when the one health concept was adopted till December 2012 to examine the role of the one health approach towards zoonoses. Inclusion criteria included publications, professional presentations, funding allocations, official documentation books, and book chapters, and exclusion criteria included those citations written outside the period of review. Results. A total of 737 resources met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. Resources showed a continuous upward trend for the years from 2006 to 2012. The predominant resources were journal publications with environmental health as the significant scope focus for one health. There was also an emphasis on the distribution of the work from developed countries. All categories of years, resources, scopes, and country locale differed from the means (P = 0.000). Year of initiative, scope, and country locale showed a dependent relationship (P = 0.022, P = 0.003, and P = 0.021, resp.). Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate the rapid growth in embracing the concept of one health, particularly in developed countries over the past six years. The advantages and benefits of this approach in tackling zoonoses are manifold, yet they are still not seemingly being embraced in developing countries where zoonoses have the greatest impact.","Bidaisee, Satesh; Macpherson, Calum N.

Till the current times, researchers have been able to design numerous types of nanoscale fluorescent tool kits for monitoring protein–protein interactions through real time cellular imagery in a fluorescence microscope. It is apparent that supplementing any protein of interest with a fluorescence habit traces its function and regulation within a cell. Our review therefore highlights the application of several fluorescent probes such as molecular organic dyes, quantum dots (QD) and fluorescent proteins (FPs) to determine activity state, expression and localization of proteins in live and fixed cells. The focus is on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based nanosensors that have been developed by researchers to visualize and monitor protein dynamics and quantify metabolites of diverse nature. FRET based toolkits permit the resolution of ambiguities that arise due to the rotation of sensor molecules and flexibility of the probe. Achievements of live cell imaging and efficient spatiotemporal resolution however have been possible only with the advent of fluorescence microscopic technology, equipped with precisely sensitive automated softwares.","Manzoor, Ovais; Soleja, Neha; Mohsin, Mohd.",Biochem Eng J,143,3

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding with the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). While ACE2 is expressed in multiple cell types, it has been implicated in the clinical progression of COVID-19 as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into respiratory cells. Human respiratory cells, such as airway and alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, are considered essential for COVID-19 research; however, primary human respiratory cells are difficult to obtain. In the present study, we generated ATII and club cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug testing. The differentiated cells expressed ATII markers (SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, SLC34A2) or club cell markers (SCGB1A1 and SCGB3A2). Differentiated cells, which express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir treatment decreased intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and, furthermore, treatment with bleomycin showed cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that hiPSC-derived AT2 and club cells provide a useful in vitro model for drug development.","Tsuji, Kayoko; Yamada, Shigeru; Hirai, Kazuya; Asakura, Hiroshi; Kanda, Yasunari",The Journal of toxicological sciences,143,1

Here, we provide an analysis of COVID-19 cases and their close contacts who worked for the same company on a project in Karbala, Iraq and returned back to Chengdu, China by a charter flight. Methods The data of imported COVID-19 cases and their close contacts were obtained from National Notifiable Disease Report System of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and field epidemiological investigation reports by CDCs in Chengdu. The information of general characteristics and laboratory findings of this cluster were collected and summarized. Results 106 (66.67%) of 159 charter flight passengers tested positive for COVID-19 before entry. Through treatment, all 159 people tested negative and meet the requirements of taking flights bound for China before boarding. However, there has been still 36 (22.64%) of them tested positive after entry. The median time from entry to confirmation was 1.0 day (IQR 0-4.3). The Ct values of 36 patients’ positive samples are all above 30 and most values are above 35.

In French Polynesia, marine-based tourism activities ceased in March 2020 with the suspension of international flights (i.e., 45 days - between 20th March and 04th May 2020), slowly restarting between May-July as domestic and international visitors returned. The impacts of this rapid change in human activity at reef tourism sites on associated reef fishes was examined at Bora-Bora Island through underwater surveys of five control and nine eco-tourism sites. Our results showed that fish density significantly increased from March to May (i.e., the overall density of fishes increased by 143% and harvested species by 215%), but returned to pre-lockdown levels by August 2020. At the usually busy eco-tourism sites, fish diversity, notably of piscivores, omnivores, and benthic feeders, was higher in the absence of tourists. The impact observed is almost certainly related to short term changes in fish behavior, as any density fluctuations at the population level are unlikely to have happened over such a short time frame. Overall, these findings highlight the influence of human activities on fish communities and underline the need for further research to evaluate the environmental impacts of eco-tourism.","Lecchini, David; Brooker, Rohan M; Waqalevu, Viliame; Gairin, Emma; Minier, Lana; Berthe, Cecile; Besineau, Rainui; Blay, Guilhem; Maueau, Tehani; Sturny, Vincent; Bambridge, Tamatoa; Sang, Gaston Tong; Bertucci, Frédéric",Marine environmental research,143,29

Our aim was to describe the planning of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in terms of timing related to the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and research question evaluated. Method We performed a living mapping of RCTs registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We systematically search the platform every week for all RCTs evaluating preventive interventions and treatments for COVID-19 and created a publicly available interactive mapping tool at https://covid-nma.com to visualize all trials registered. Results By August 12, 2020, 1,568 trials for COVID-19 were registered worldwide. Overall, the median ([Q1-Q3]; range) delay between the first case recorded in each country and the first RCT registered was 47 days ([33-67]; 15-163). For the 9 countries with the highest number of trials registered, most trials were registered after the peak of the epidemic (from 100% trials in Italy to 38% in the United States). Most trials evaluated treatments (1,333 trials; 85%); only 223 (14%) evaluated preventive strategies and 12 post-acute period intervention. A total of 254 trials were planned to assess different regimens of hydroxychloroquine with an expected sample size of 110,883 patients. Conclusion This living mapping analysis showed that COVID-19 trials have relatively small sample size with certain redundancy in research questions.

The environment inside a TEM is not favorable for biological material (high vacuum and high energy electrons). Also biological samples have little or no intrinsic electron contrast and rarely do they naturally exist in very thin sheets, as is required for optimum resolution in the TEM. To prepare these samples for imaging in the TEM therefore requires extensive processing which can alter the ultrastructure of the material. Here we describe a method which aims to minimize preparation artifacts by freezing the samples at high pressure to instantaneously preserve ultrastructural detail, then rapidly substituting the ice with resin to provide a firm matrix which can be cut into thin sections for imaging. Thicker sections of this material can also be imaged and reconstructed into 3D volumes using electron tomography.","Doyle, Nicole; Hawes, Philippa C.",Coronaviruses,143,0

We recently found that inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a physiological, metabolic energy (ATP)-providing polymer released from blood platelets, blocks the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) to the cellular ACE2 receptor in vitro. PolyP is a marine natural product and is abundantly present in marine bacteria. Now, we have approached the in vivo situation by studying the effect of polyP on the human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells in a mucus-like mucin environment. These cells express mucins as well as the ectoenzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and adenylate kinase (ADK), which are involved in the extracellular production of ATP from polyP. Mucin, integrated into a collagen-based hydrogel, stimulated cell growth and attachment. The addition of polyP to the hydrogel significantly increased cell attachment and also the expression of the membrane-tethered mucin MUC1 and the secreted mucin MUC5AC. The increased synthesis of MUC1 was also confirmed by immunostaining. This morphogenetic effect of polyP was associated with a rise in extracellular ATP level. We conclude that the nontoxic and non-immunogenic polymer polyP could possibly also exert a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2-cell attachment; first, by stimulating the innate antiviral response by strengthening the mucin barrier with its antimicrobial proteins, and second, by inhibiting virus attachment to the cells, as deduced from the reduction in the strength of binding between the viral RBD and the cellular ACE2 receptor.","Müller, Werner E.

Earlier studies have examined various factors that may contribute to the contagion rate of COVID-19, such as air pollution, smoking, humidity, and temperature.

Astroviruses infect diverse hosts and are typically associated with gastrointestinal illness; although disease can range from asymptomatic to encephalitis depending on the host and viral genotype. Astroviruses have high genetic variability due to an error prone polymerase and frequent recombination events between strains. Once thought to be species specific, recent evidence suggests astroviruses can spread between different host species, although the frequency with which this occurs and the restrictions that regulate the process are unknown.

Understanding the substantial differences observed in the trajectory of the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance at the moment. Numerous factors have been considered to explain the fact that symptoms vary highly among different people and the infection transmission rate varies among local populations. Virus replication within the host cell and the development of an immune response to virus antigens in the body are two interdependent processes, which have aftereffects and depend on the preexisting states of the cell and virus populations. Different scenarios with the same input parameters are necessary to consider for modeling the properties of the states. The efficiency of the immune response is the most important factor, including the time it takes to develop defense responses from three levels of the immune system, which is a complex system of the body. A computational description of infection scenarios was proposed on the basis of a delay differential equation with two values of the time lag. In the new model, transitions between phases of infectious disease depend on the initial virus dose and the delayed immune response to infection. A variation in the dose of the virus and response time can lead to a transition from an acute phase of the disease with overt symptoms to a chronic phase or fatal outcome. Asymptomatic transmission of viral infection was calculated and described in the model as a situation where the virus is rapidly and efficiently suppressed after a short replication phase, while still persisting in the body in minor amounts. An analysis of the model behavior is consistent with the theory that the initial number of virions can affect the quality of the immune response. The reasons that high individual differences are observed in the trajectory of COVID-19 disease and the formation of types of the immune response to coronavirus are still poorly understood. Known trajectories of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were used as a basis for model scenarios.","Perevaryukha, A. Yu.",Biophysics (Oxf),143,16

With limited access to vaccine or strong antiviral treatment for the novel coronavirus, actions in terms of prevention and containment of the virus transmission rely mostly on social distancing among susceptible and high-risk populations. Aside from the direct challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic, there are serious and growing secondary consequences caused by the physical distancing and isolation guidelines, among vulnerable populations. Moreover, the healthcare system’s resources and capacity have been focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, causing less urgent care, such as physical neurorehabilitation and assessment, to be paused, canceled, or delayed. Overall, this has left elderly adults, in particular those with neuromusculoskeletal (NMSK) conditions, without the required service support. However, in many cases, such as stroke, the available time window of recovery through rehabilitation is limited since neural plasticity decays quickly with time. Given that future waves of the outbreak are expected in the coming months worldwide, it is important to discuss the possibility of using available technologies to address this issue, as societies have a duty to protect the most vulnerable populations. In this perspective review article, we argue that intelligent robotics and wearable technologies can help with remote delivery of assessment, assistance, and rehabilitation services while physical distancing and isolation measures are in place to curtail the spread of the virus. By supporting patients and medical professionals during this pandemic, robots, and smart digital mechatronic systems can reduce the non-COVID-19 burden on healthcare systems. Digital health and cloud telehealth solutions that can complement remote delivery of assessment and physical rehabilitation services will be the subject of discussion in this article due to their potential in enabling more effective and safer NMSDK rehabilitation, assistance, and assessment service delivery. This article will hopefully lead to an interdisciplinary dialogue between the medical and engineering sectors, stake holders, and policy makers for a better delivery of care for those with NMSK conditions during a global health crisis including future pandemics.","Atashzar, S.

Few data are available about that impact in pediatric liver transplant (PLT) programs. This study aimed at comparing the data of our program in Brazil (2019 vs. 2020). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy‐four PLT were performed in the period (93% living donors). Patients were divided into two groups according to the LT date: pre‐COVID‐19 period (march/2019–February/2020) and COVID‐19 period (March/2020–February 2021). In the pre‐COVID‐19 period, 97 LTs were performed, and 77 LTs were performed in the COVID‐19 period. Patients in the COVID‐19 period were younger (10.9 months vs. 16 months, p 0.009), had higher PELD scores (15 vs. 14, p 0.04), more ascites (66.2 vs. 51.5%, p 0.03), and more frequently hospitalized before LT (27.3 vs. 17.5%). However, there was no difference in post‐LT complications, retransplantation nor survival rates. Six (6.2%) patients from pre‐COVID‐19 period were COVID positive at a median of 15.5 months (14–17.5), and 6 (7.8%) patients from COVID‐19 period were COVID positive at a median of 3 months (20 days–6 months) from LT. There was neither mortality nor complications in those patients. Four (33%) were hospitalized, and one had prolonged intubation. Four (33%) were asymptomatic, 4 (33%) had upper airways symptoms, and the remaining had gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Overall, PLT was not affected during COVID‐19 period. Even though patients from COVID‐19 period were sicker, there was no significant impact in LT outcomes. All the recipients who tested positive for COVID had a favorable outcome.","Fonseca, Eduardo A.; Feier, Flavia; Pugliese, Renata; Freitas, Aline F.; Porta, Gilda; Miura, Irene; Baggio, Vera; Kondo, Mario; Benavides, Marcel; Vincenzi, Rodrigo; Roda, Karina; Oliveira, Caio V.; Chapchap, Paulo; Seda‐Neto, João",Pediatr Transplant,143,22

Accumulating studies have reported that adiponectin concentrations are decreased during metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, with an emerging body of evidence providing support for its use as a biomarker for pregnancy complications. The identification of maternal factors that could predict the outcome of compromised pregnancies could act as valuable tools that allow the early recognition of high-risk pregnancies, facilitating close follow-up and prevention of pregnancy complications in mother and child. In this review we consider the role of adiponectin as a potential biomarker of disorders associated with pregnancy. We discuss common disorders associated with pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, preterm birth and abnormal intrauterine growth) and highlight studies that have investigated the potential of adiponectin to serve as biomarkers for these disorders.

Viral respiratory tract pathogens, like RSV, influenza and rhinoviruses cause major morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract disease. Furthermore, as viruses have limited means of transmission, viruses that cause pathogenicity in other tissues may be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It is therefore important to chart the human virome in this compartment. We have studied nasopharyngeal aspirate samples submitted to the Karolinska University Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden from March 2004 to May 2005 for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. We have used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to characterize viruses, as this provides the most unbiased view of the samples. Virus enrichment followed by 454 sequencing resulted in totally 703,790 reads and 110,931 of these were found to be of viral origin by using an automated classification pipeline. The snapshot of the respiratory tract virome of these 210 patients revealed 39 species and many more strains of viruses. Most of the viral sequences were classified into one of three major families; Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae or Orthomyxoviridae. The study also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C, and identified a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin.","Lysholm, Fredrik; Wetterbom, Anna; Lindau, Cecilia; Darban, Hamid; Bjerkner, Annelie; Fahlander, Kristina; Lindberg, A.

Positive strand RNA viruses express large portions, or all of their proteome via translation of large polyproteins that are processed by embedded viral proteinases or host proteinases. Several of these viral proteinases are known to interact with host proteins, particularly with the host translation machinery, and thus, encompass the dual functions of processing of viral polyproteins and exerting translation control. Picornaviruses are perhaps the best characterized in regards to interaction of their proteinases with the host translation machinery and will be emphasized here. However, new findings have shown that similar paradigms exist in other viral systems which will be discussed.","Lloyd, Richard E.",Virus Research,143,17

Compared with conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT, matrix 512), ultra-high resolution CT (U-HRCT, matrix 1024) can increase the effective pixel per unit volume by about 4 times. Our study is to evaluate the value of target reconstruction of U-HRCT in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 13 COVID-19 cases, 44 cases of other pneumonias, and 6 cases of ground-glass nodules were retrospectively analyzed. The data were categorized into groups A (C-HRCT) and B (U-HRCT), following which iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 were used for target reconstruction, respectively. CT value, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different reconstructed images were measured. Two senior imaging doctors scored the image quality and the structure of the lesions on a 5-point scale. Chi-square test, variance analysis, and binarylogistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: U-HRCT image can reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iterative reconstruction level. The SNR of U-HRCT image was lower than that of the C-HRCT image of the same iDose4level, and the noise of U-HRCT was higher than that of C-HRCT image; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed thatperipleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern were independent indictors of the COVID-19 on U-HRCT. U-HRCT was superior to C-HRCT in showing the blood vessels, bronchial wall, and interlobular septum in the ground-glass opacities; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions:Peripleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern on U-HRCT are favorable signs for COVID-19. U-HRCT is superior to C-HRCT in displaying the blood vessels, bronchial walls, and interlobular septum for evaluating COVID-19.

This required class consisted of eight, 2‐h sessions, which transitioned to remote learning in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic. The class was graded as pass/fail. Flipped classroom techniques, with multiple hands‐on exercises, were developed for first‐year medical students (MD/PhD [n = 9], Clinical and Translational Research Pathway (CTRP) students [n = 9]). Four focus groups (n = 13 students) and individual interviews with the two instructors were conducted in May 2020. From individual interviews with instructors and focus groups with medical students, the course and its components were favorably reviewed. Students thought the course was novel, important, relevant, and practical—and teaching strategies were effective (e.g., short lectures, interactive small group exercises, and projects). Most students expressed concerns about lack of time for course preparation. Sharper focus and streamlining of preparation work may be required. Pre‐ and post‐student self‐assessments of rigor and reproducibility competencies showed average post‐scores ranging from high/moderate to strong understanding (n = 11). We conclude that rigor and reproducibility can be taught to first‐year medical students in research pathways programs in a highly interactive and remote format. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS: WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? Formal training is needed to raise awareness of the reproducibility crisis and improve the rigor of research conducted. If techniques taught are used, the transparency and reproducibility of clinical and translational science will be improved.","Lapane, Kate L.; Dube, Catherine E.",Clin Transl Sci,143,20

Participants were recruited from the Promoting Independence in Seniors with Arthritis (PISA) pilot cohort through social media messaging. A four-week course of virtual group exercise was offered. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the last attended follow-up of the cohort study (pre-pandemic), pre-intervention, and post-intervention. Exercise adherence was recorded using diaries with daily entries and attendance to the virtual group exercise sessions were also captured electronically daily. The outcomes of interest were changes in anxiety and depression scores from baseline to pre-intervention (pandemic-related) and post-intervention (virtual exercise related). Forty-three individuals were recruited. A significant increase in anxiety scores from baseline to pre-intervention was observed. Comparisons using repeated-measures analysis of variance between those who attendance ≥14 and <14 group exercise sessions revealed no between-within subject differences in depression scores. There was a 23% dropout rate in the post intervention survey and 60.5% of diaries were returned. Virtual group exercises could be conducted among older adults residing in a middle-income country, though recruitment would have been limited to those with internet access.","Ibrahim, Amirah; Chong, Mei Chan; Khoo, Selina; Wong, Li Ping; Chung, Ivy; Tan, Maw Pin",Geriatrics (Basel),143,1

The relative sensitivity and specificity of RT‐LAMP was found to be 100% and 93.3%, respectively, based on 50 canine blood samples and using RT‐PCR as the gold standard. The detection limit of the RT‐LAMP method was 100 times lower than with RT‐PCR (10‐1TCID50 ml(−1) versus 10TCID50 ml(−1)). In addition to the advantage resulting from the visual detection of the end‐product, the LAMP method is fast, requiring only 1 h to complete the assay.

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of POPs in irrigation water, soil and in Amaranthus viridis (A. viridis) from different gardening sites in Kinshasa to evaluate the potential environmental and human health risks. A survey study for the use of pesticides and fertilizers was carried out with 740 market gardeners. The levels of POPs (including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) were analyzed in irrigation water and 144 vegetable samples collected from different gardening sites. The assessment of potential human health risk was estimated by calculating daily intake and toxic equivalency to quantify the carcinogenicity. The results show highest PAH levels in A. viridis from all studied sites. The concentrations of the sum of seven PCBs (Σ7PCBS) congeners in analyzed plants ranged between 15.89 and 401.36 ng g−1. The distributions of OCPs in both water and A. viridis were congener specific, chlorpyrifos-ethyl and p,p′-DDE were predominantly detected. Among PBDEs, only BDE47 was quantified with noticeable concentration in A. viridis, while no PBDEs were detected in irrigation water. Higher estimated daily intake values indicate that consuming leafy vegetables might associate with increased human health risks. However, calculated incremental lifetime cancer risk values indicates no potential carcinogenic risk for the local population. The results of this study provide important information on A. viridis contamination by POPs and strongly recommend implementing the appropriate measures to control the use of chemicals used in studied gardening areas.

AIM AND PARTICIPANTS: This study examines 24 primary and secondary school teachers’ MHWB experiences across three time points (April, July, and November 2020) using longitudinal qualitative trajectory analysis. METHOD: We used a mixture of inductive and deductive coding, based on the Job Demands–Resources Model, to identify the job demands (aspects of the job that can be physically or psychologically costly) and job resources (aspects of the job that can buffer the effects of job demands and promote achievement and growth) teachers reported experiencing across the three time points. RESULTS: Generally, teachers’ MHWB seemed to have declined throughout the pandemic, especially for primary school leaders. Six job demands contributed negatively to teachers’ MHWB (i.e., uncertainty, workload, negative perception of the profession, concern for others’ well‐being, health struggles, and multiple roles) and three job resources contributed positively to their MHWB (i.e., social support, work autonomy, and coping strategies). CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers and practitioners can support teachers’ MHWB by engaging in more collaborative communication and ensuring greater accessibility to sources of social support. These discussions and provisions will be crucial in supporting teachers, and thereby the educational system, both during and after the pandemic.","Kim, Lisa E.; Oxley, Laura; Asbury, Kathryn",Br J Educ Psychol,143,1

Atg5-deficiency did not alter reactivation from B cells, and effects on reactivation from macrophages were not explained by alterations in productive viral replication or the establishment of latency. Rather, chronic MHV68 infection triggered increased systemic inflammation, increased T cell production of IFN-γ and an IFN-γ-induced transcriptional signature in macrophages from Atg gene-deficient mice. The Atg5-related reactivation defect was partially reversed by neutralization of IFN-γ. Thus Atg genes in myeloid cells dampen virus-induced systemic inflammation, creating an environment that fosters efficient MHV68 reactivation from latency.","Park, Sunmin; Buck, Michael D.; Desai, Chandni; Zhang, Xin; Loginicheva, Ekaterina; Martinez, Jennifer; Freeman, Michael L.; Saitoh, Tatsuya; Akira, Shizuo; Guan, Jun-Lin; He, You-Wen; Blackman, Marcia A.; Handley, Scott A.; Levine, Beth; Green, Douglas R.; Reese, Tiffany A.; Artyomov, Maxim N.; Virgin, Herbert W.",Cell Host & Microbe,143,20

At present, only insufficient information is available on currently circulating PEDV strains in Europe and their impact on the European swine industry. In this case report, we present epidemic outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in three farms in South-Western Germany. CASE PRESENTATION: Epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea affecting pigs of all age groups were reported in three farms, one fattening farm and two piglet producing farms, in South-Western Germany between May and November 2014. In the fattening farm yellowish, watery diarrhea without evidence of mucus or blood was associated with a massive reduction of feed consumption. Severity of clinical signs and mortality in young suckling pigs varied significantly between the two affected sow farms. While mortality in suckling piglets reached almost 70 % in one sow herd, no increase in suckling piglet mortality was observed in the second sow farm. In all three cases, PEDV was confirmed in feces and small intestines by RT-qPCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on full-length PEDV genomes revealed high identity among strains from all three herds. Moreover, the German strains showed very high nucleotide identity (99.4 %) with a variant of PEDV (OH851) that was isolated in the United States in January 2014. This strain with insertions and deletions in the S-gene (so called INDEL strains) was reported to show lower virulence. Slightly lower identities were found with other strains from the US and Asia. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic information on the distribution of PEDV strains in Europe is severely lacking. In this case report we demonstrate that acute outbreaks of PEDV occurred in southern Germany in 2014. Current strains were clearly different from isolates found in the 1980s and were closely related to a PEDV variant found in the US in 2014. Moreover, the present case report indicates that variant strains of PEDV, containing insertions and deletions in the S gene, which were reported to be of lower virulence, might be able to cause high mortality in suckling piglets.","Stadler, Julia; Zoels, Susanne; Fux, Robert; Hanke, Dennis; Pohlmann, Anne; Blome, Sandra; Weissenböck, Herbert; Weissenbacher-Lang, Christiane; Ritzmann, Mathias; Ladinig, Andrea",BMC Vet Res,143,20

Although interferon gamma-release and polymerase chain reaction assays have been developed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, purified protein derivative (PPD)–based tuberculin skin testing (TST) remains the most widely used method. Indeed, the TST is a simple and cost-effective tool that can be easily applied for widespread screening for Mtb infection. However, the lack of specificity has been a limitation of these tests, and, more recently, supply issues have arisen. Building upon the skin tests that historically have been used within TB and leprosy control programs, we discuss recent developments using modern technologies for improving mycobacterial skin testing as well as practical advantages inherent to the technique. Furthermore, we outline how this knowledge could be applied to develop similar tests that could benefit diagnostic strategies for other infections. KEY POINTS: • Skin testing provides a significantly cheaper alternative to most modern technologies. • Skin tests provide a lab-independent diagnostic strategy that can be widely administered. • Diseases for which T cell responses are more robust or durable than antibody responses are accessible for skin testing.","Duthie, Malcolm S.; Reed, Steven G.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,143,1

METHODS: The incidence rates of cancers (2001-2014), communicable diseases (2003-2016), and non-communicable diseases (1990-2017) were retrieved, classified, and analyzed retrospectively during November 2017, based on data available with the Ministry of Health and were analyzed at the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University in Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) (per 100,000 population) of breast cancer among women increased dramatically from 11.8 in 2001 to 22.7 in 2014, indicating a 92.4% increase over the decade. Colorectal cancer incidence was the highest among men, and its ASR per 100,000 population increased from 5.0 to 10.6 in men and from 5.0 to 8.2 in women. Among communicable diseases, incidences of hepatitis B, measles, chickenpox, and brucellosis decreased while dengue fever increased. An alarming increase was observed in the incidence rate of non-communicable diseases namely, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of non-communicable diseases increased over the decade and was associated with increased mortality and disability, reduced quality of life, and increased health-care costs, indicating an urgent need to establish prevention and control programs. The rising trend in the incidence of cancers may also become a health care issue in Saudi Arabia in the coming years.","Herzallah, Hatem K.; Antonisamy, Belavendra R.; Shafee, Mohammed H.; Al-Otaibi, Sultan T.",Saudi Med J,143,11

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the seroprevalence and the quantity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a cohort of patients with MS or NMO-SD. METHODS: Blood samples were collected in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 19 February 2020 and 26 February 2021. SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and Ig levels (anti-S IgG titre, anti-S IgA index, anti-N IgG index) were compared between DMTs groups. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to estimate the influence of DMTs and other confounding variables on SARS-CoV-2 serological outcomes. RESULTS: 119 patients (115 MS, 4 NMO, mean age: 43.0 years) were analysed. Overall, seroconversion rate was 80.6% within 5.0 (SD 3.4) months after infection. 20/21 (95.2%) patients without DMT and 66/77 (85.7%) patients on DMTs other than anti-CD20 had at least one SARS-CoV-2 Ig positivity, while this rate decreased to only 10/21 (47.6%) for patients on anti-CD20 (p<0.001). Being on anti-CD20 was associated with a decreased odd of positive serology (OR, 0.07 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.69), p=0.02) independently from time to COVID-19, total IgG level, age, sex and COVID-19 severity.

We investigated changes in the prescription of psychotropic medications in the Danwon district of Ansan city (Ansan Danwon) compared to a control community before and after the Sewol Ferry disaster on April 16, 2014. METHODS: Data was collected from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. We analyzed the prescription rates of psychotropic medications including antidepressants, anxiolytics, and sedatives/hypnotics, and investigated whether the time-series pattern of monthly prescriptions per 100,000 people was different in Ansan Danwon compared to that in Cheonan city after the Sewol Ferry disaster through difference-in-differences regression analysis. RESULTS: Ansan Danwon showed a significantly greater increase (5.6%) in the prescription rate of antidepressants compared to Cheonan city following the Sewol Ferry disaster. There were no significant differences in changes in the prescription rates of anxiolytics or sedatives/hypnotics. In the secondary analysis, a significantly greater increase in the prescription rate of antipsychotics was observed in Ansan Danwon compared to a control community after the disaster. LIMITATIONS: We could not exclude the possibility that other events influenced changes in the prescription rates of psychotropic medications during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaco-epidemiological studies on psychotropic medication prescription after a disaster provide important information about population-level mental health.

Double immunolabeling demonstrated cytokeratin (CK) 18 expressing epithelial cells to be the prevailing target cell of MERS-CoV, while CK5/6 and CK14 expressing cells did not co-localize with virus. In addition, virus was occasionally detected in macrophages. The acute disease was further accompanied by ciliary loss along with a lack of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), known to mediate virus entry. DPP4 was mainly expressed by human lymphocytes and dromedary monocytes, but overall the expression level was lower in dromedaries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 fecal swabs were collected from clinically infected domestic dogs of 2-5 months of age, suspected to suffer from CPV infection, from Cairo and Giza Governorates. The samples were subjected to qualitative antigen detection using the rapid test, followed by isolation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, molecular characterization with partial amplification of VP2 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Out of 50 fecal samples, 20 samples were positive (40%) by Rapid CPV/canine coronavirus Ag Test Kit. These positive samples were cultured successfully on MDCK cells. Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c.

Emerging evidence has shown that small molecules can affect SG dynamics, including assembly, disassembly, maintenance and clearance. Thus, targeting SGs is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human diseases and the promotion of health. The established methods for detecting SGs provided ready tools for large-scale screening of agents that alter the dynamics of SGs. Here, we describe the effects of small molecules on SG assembly, disassembly, and their roles in the disease.

RESULTS: The main theme that emerged was “Standing on common ground enables individualized support.” To achieve such support, professionals needed to understand their own views on who bears the primary responsibility for patients’ self-management, as well as patients’ self-management abilities, needs, and perspectives. Personal continuity and trustful relationships facilitated this understanding. The findings also indicated that professionals should be accessible for patients with multimorbidity, function as knowledge translators (help patients understand their symptoms and how the symptoms correlated with diseases), and coordinate between levels of care. Telemedicine supported continual monitoring and facilitated patient access to PHC professionals. CONCLUSION: Through personal continuity and patient-centered consultations, professionals could collaborate with patients to individualize self-management support. For some patients, this means that PHC professionals are in control and monitor symptoms. For others, PHC professionals play a less controlling role, empowering patients’ self-management. Development and improvement of eHealth tools for patients with multimorbidity should focus on improving the ability to set mutual goals, strengthening patients’ inner motivation, and including multiple caregivers to enhance information-sharing and care coordination.

METHOD: We searched for clinical trial registrations of TCM in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) on April 30, 2020. The registration quality assessment is based on the WHO Trial Registration Data Set (Version 1.3.1) and extra items for TCM information, including TCM background, theoretical origin, specific diagnosis criteria, description of intervention, and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 136 records were examined, including 129 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and 7 H1N1 influenza (H1N1) patients. The deficiencies in the registration of TCM clinical trials (CTs) mainly focus on a low percentage reporting detailed information about interventions (46.6%), primary outcome(s) (37.7%), and key secondary outcome(s) (18.4%) and a lack of summary result (0%). For the TCM items, none of the clinical trial registrations reported the TCM background and rationale; only 6.6% provided the TCM diagnosis criteria or a description of the TCM intervention; and 27.9% provided TCM outcome(s). CONCLUSION: Overall, although the number of registrations of TCM CTs increased, the registration quality was low. The registration quality of TCM CTs should be improved by more detailed reporting of interventions and outcomes, TCM-specific information, and sharing of the result data.

This paper explores how a set of facilitation teams described enacting their learner-centered pedagogical aspirations through MOOC platforms. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we present a set of six facilitator actions: “giving up control,” “distributing facilitation,” “being live,” “amplifying,” “modeling,” and “being explicit.” We discuss these actions as emerging from the negotiation between existing pedagogical aspirations and the realities of a new medium, highlighting how they involve facilitators both stepping back (making space for and foregrounding learner expertise and perspectives) and stepping in (intervening and directing as a facilitator). This research contributes to the ongoing work of articulating the substance and specificity of teaching in learner-centered pedagogy and the persistent challenges of enacting that pedagogy in massive, online spaces.","Blum-Smith, Sarah; Yurkofsky, Maxwell M.; Brennan, Karen",Comput Educ,143,20

While thermal effects in ecologically important groups such as daphnids have been intensively studied at the ecosystem level and at least partly at the organismic level, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the acclimation to different temperatures. By using 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the present study identified the major elements of the temperature-induced subset of the proteome from differently acclimated Daphnia pulex. RESULTS: Specific sets of proteins were found to be differentially expressed in 10°C or 20°C acclimated D. pulex. Most cold-repressed proteins comprised secretory enzymes which are involved in protein digestion (trypsins, chymotrypsins, astacin, carboxypeptidases). The cold-induced sets of proteins included several vitellogenin and actin isoforms (cytoplasmic and muscle-specific), and an AAA+ ATPase. Carbohydrate-modifying enzymes were constitutively expressed or down-regulated in the cold. CONCLUSION: Specific sets of cold-repressed and cold-induced proteins in D. pulex can be related to changes in the cellular demand for amino acids or to the compensatory control of physiological processes. The increase of proteolytic enzyme concentration and the decrease of vitellogenin, actin and total protein concentration between 10°C and 20°C acclimated animals reflect the increased amino-acids demand and the reduced protein reserves in the animal's body. Conversely, the increase of actin concentration in cold-acclimated animals may contribute to a compensatory mechanism which ensures the relative constancy of muscular performance. The sheer number of peptidase genes (serine-peptidase-like: > 200, astacin-like: 36, carboxypeptidase-like: 30) in the D. pulex genome suggests large-scaled gene family expansions that might reflect specific adaptations to the lifestyle of a planktonic filter feeder in a highly variable aquatic environment.","Schwerin, Susanne; Zeis, Bettina; Lamkemeyer, Tobias; Paul, Rüdiger J; Koch, Marita; Madlung, Johannes; Fladerer, Claudia; Pirow, Ralph",BMC Physiol,143,16

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study invited farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley (Monterey County) receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites to participate. Individuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, were 18 years or older, had conducted farmwork since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish. Survey data were collected and SARS-CoV-2 tests were conducted among participants from July 16 to November 30, 2020. EXPOSURES: Sociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: TMA- and immunoglobulin G (IgG)–positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 1107 farmworkers (581 [52.5%] women; mean [SD] age, 39.7 [12.6] years) were included in these analyses. Most participants were born in Mexico (922 [83.3%]), were married or living with a partner (697 [63.0%]), and worked in the fields (825 [74.5%]). Overall, 118 of 911 (13.0%) had a positive result on their TMA test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas 201 of 1058 (19.0%) had antibody evidence of infection. In multivariable analyses accounting for recruitment venue and enrollment period, the incidence of TMA-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among those with lower than primary school–level education (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.32; 95% CI, 0.99-1.76; non–statistically significant finding), who spoke an Indigenous language at home (aRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.97-1.73; non–statistically significant finding), who worked in the fields (aRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.03-2.50), and who were exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (aRR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (aRR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.18-2.14). Positive results on IgG tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were more common among those who lived in crowded housing (aRR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.98-1.53; non–statistically significant finding), with children aged 5 years or younger (aRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.76), with unrelated roommates (aRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.19-1.64), and with an individual with known or suspected COVID-19 (aRR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.13-2.24). The risk of IgG positivity was also higher among those with body mass index of 30 or greater (aRR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.01-2.70) or diabetes (aRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.98-1.75; non–statistically significant finding). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of farmworkers in California, both residential and workplace exposures were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Urgent distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and intervention on modifiable risk factors are warranted given this population’s increased risk of infection and the essential nature of their work.","Mora, Ana M.; Lewnard, Joseph A.; Kogut, Katherine; Rauch, Stephen A.; Hernandez, Samantha; Wong, Marcus P.; Huen, Karen; Chang, Cynthia; Jewell, Nicholas P.; Holland, Nina; Harris, Eva; Cuevas, Maximiliano; Eskenazi, Brenda",JAMA Netw Open,143,16

Using real-time epidemiological data from Chile, the nation in Latin America with the highest testing rate for COVID-19, we derive delay-adjusted severity estimates by age group as of May 18th, 2020. Methods We employed statistical methods and daily series of age-stratified COVID-19 cases and deaths reported in Chile to estimate the delay-adjusted case fatality rate across six age groups. Results Our most recent estimates of the time-delay adjusted case fatality rate are 0.08% (95% Credible Interval CrI:0.04-0.13%) among persons aged 0-39, 0.61% (95%CrI:0.41-0.87%) for those aged 40-49, 1.06% (95%CrI:0.76-1.40%) for those aged 50-59, 3.79% (95%CrI:3.04-4.66%) for those aged 60-69, 12.22% (95%CrI:10.40-14.38%) for those aged 70-79, and 26.27% (95%CrI:22.95-2980%) for persons aged 80 and over. The overall time-delay adjusted case fatality rate is1.78% (95%CrI: 1.63-1.95%) across all age groups. Conclusions Severity estimates from COVID-19 in Chile indicate a disproportionate impact among seniors, especially among those aged [â¥] 70 years. COVID-19 is imposing a high death toll in Latin America. Case fatality rates in Chile suggest the health system is not yet overwhelmed, but the epidemic is expanding fast.","Undurraga, Eduardo A; Chowell, Gerardo; Mizumoto, Kenji",,143,30

Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped to study crime in society as never before. We encourage researchers to study specific types of crime, in a temporal fashion (following the stay-at-home orders), and placed-based. The results will reveal not only why, where, when, and to what extent crime changed, but also how to influence future crime reduction.","Stickle, Ben; Felson, Marcus",Am J Crim Justice,143,32

Indeed, the UK government has enacted emergency legislation in its response by passing the Coronavirus Act 2020. Amongst other things, this act extends existing statutory powers to impose deprivations of liberty for public health purposes. The extension of such powers naturally raises concerns about whether their use will be compatible with human rights law. In particular, it is unclear whether their use will fall within the public heath exception to the Article 5 right to liberty and security of the person in the European Convention of Human Rights, enshrined in the UK law by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998. In this paper, I use the Coronavirus Act introduced in the UK as a case study of how emergency legislation enacted in a pandemic may conflict with human rights law enshrined elsewhere in domestic law. Having outlined key features of existing statutory powers in the UK, and how they are extended under the Coronavirus Act, I briefly consider how the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the public health exception to Article 5 rights. This analysis suggests two grounds on which deprivations of liberty performed in accordance with the emergency legislation introduced in the UK might be vulnerable to claims of Article 5 rights violations. First, the absence of specified time limits on certain deprivations of liberty means that they may fail the requirement of legal certainty championed by the European Court in its interpretation of the public health exception. Second, the Coronavirus Act’s extension of powers to individual’s lacking public health expertise may undermine the extent to which the act will ensure that deprivations of liberty are both necessary and proportionate.","Pugh, Jonathan",J Law Biosci,143,1

Children have continued their education process at home, supervised by parents, who, in most cases, have adopted the role of prime drivers of their learning processes. In this study, the psychological impact of confinement was explored, as well as the relationship of the forced homeschooling situation with psychological well‐being. During their confinement, 400 individuals residing in Spain—165 without children at home (Group 1), 104 parents who dedicated little time to homeschooling (Group 2), and 131 who dedicated more time to homeschooling (Group 3)—responded to an online questionnaire. The results show that confinement threatened the mental health of all the participants but especially Group 3 individuals, who had the highest loneliness, anxiety, and stress levels. Moreover, loneliness, perception of discomfort due to homeschooling, and anxiety exacerbated the stress experienced during confinement. Discomfort due to the homeschooling situation was especially relevant in explaining anxiety and stress for Group 3 individuals. These results suggest that forced homeschooling could be associated with the negative consequences that confinement has on individuals’ mental health. Moreover, the results suggest that parents who dedicate more time to homeschooling feel more unprotected and more stressed due to the homeschooling in comparison to Group 2 individuals. Health professionals must pay special attention to parents who dedicate more time to homeschooling, and governments and schools must emphasize social support provision to families during homeschooling situations.","Cuadrado, Esther; Arenas, Alicia; Moyano, Manuel; Tabernero, Carmen",Fam Process,143,28

The animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV precursors still exist and the likelihood of future outbreaks in the human population is high. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human coronaviruses. A yeast-based assay was established for PLP activity that relies on the ability of PLP to induce a pronounced slow-growth phenotype when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Induction of the slow-growth phenotype was shown to take place over a 60-hour time course, providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibiting the function of PLP. Five chemical suppressors of the slow-growth phenotype were identified from the 2000 member NIH Diversity Set library. One of these, NSC158362, potently inhibited SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells, and it specifically inhibited SARS-CoV replication but not influenza virus replication. The effect of NSC158362 on PLP protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities. Another suppressor, NSC158011, demonstrated the ability to inhibit PLP protease activity in a cell-based assay. The identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the PLP-based yeast assay, the inhibitory compounds, and SARS-CoV biology. Furthermore the data with NSC158362 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication that may involve an unknown activity of PLP, or alternatively a direct effect on a cellular target that modifies or bypasses PLP function in yeast and mammalian cells.","Frieman, Matthew; Basu, Dipanwita; Matthews, Krystal; Taylor, Justin; Jones, Grant; Pickles, Raymond; Baric, Ralph; Engel, Daniel A.",PLoS One,143,20

It presents with a barky cough, stridor and hoarseness occurring secondary to inflammation of the subglottis and larynx. The clinical course of croup is well-described, however atypical presentations pose a diagnostic and management challenge. OBJECTIVES: This case report and systematic review aims to synthesize the published literature on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of atypical croup. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed journal publications in Ovid MEDLINE® and EMBASE from inception to January 1, 2019 in English, focusing on pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with diagnoses of atypical croup. DATA EXTRACTION: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 670 patients ranging from 6 months to 11 years of age presenting with atypical croup were selected. A variety of definitions of atypical croup were identified based on recurrence, duration of symptoms, severity, and etiology. Data on the incidence of atypical croup, the overall rates of intubation and tracheostomy, and patient characteristics leading to definitive airway management were not clearly characterized. LIMITATIONS: All studies were case series, case reports or retrospective chart reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical croup is a poorly defined clinical entity that is used to describe recurrent, refractory, or croup-like illness that follows an uncharacteristic natural history. Our case presentation and accompanying literature review highlights the variable, but limited, information available on the diagnosis of atypical croup. Given the commonality of its use in clinical practice, we propose some guidelines around the use of the term ‘atypical croup’ as well as a management algorithm.","Hanna, Raphael; Lee, Francisco; Drummond, Derek; Yunker, Warren K.",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,143,18

An important factor for this success is the production of venoms, a refined biological fluid rich in proteins, short peptides and cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). These toxins may present pharmacologically relevant biological actions, as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer activities, for instance. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the exploration of venom toxins for therapeutic reasons, such as drug development. However, the process of peptide sequencing and mainly the evaluation of potential biological activities of these peptides are laborious, considering the low yield of venom extraction and the high variability of toxins present in spider venoms. Here we show a robust methodology for identification, sequencing, and initial screening of potential bioactive peptides found in the venom of Acanthoscurria rondoniae. This methodology consists in a multiomics approach involving proteomics, peptidomics and transcriptomics analyses allied to in silico predictions of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer activities. Through the application of this strategy, a total of 92,889 venom gland transcripts were assembled and 84 novel toxins were identified at the protein level, including seven short peptides and 10 fully sequenced CRPs (belonging to seven toxin families). In silico analysis suggests that seven CRPs families may have potential antimicrobial or antiviral activities, while two CRPs and four short peptides are potentially anticancer. Taken together, our results demonstrate an effective multiomics strategy for the discovery of new toxins and in silico screening of potential bioactivities. This strategy may be useful in toxin discovery, as well as in the screening of possible activities for the vast diversity of molecules produced by venomous animals.","Câmara, Guilherme A.; Nishiyama-Jr, Milton Y.; Kitano, Eduardo S.; Oliveira, Ursula C.; da Silva, Pedro I.; Junqueira-de-Azevedo, Inácio L.; Tashima, Alexandre K.",Front Pharmacol,143,20

Methods: We used data from February 20, 2020, to February 18, 2021, on the number of COVID-19 cases reported by Iranian governments. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to investigate the correlation between different epidemic parameters. The number of daily deaths per daily new cases was averaged to calculate daily death rate and the same method was used to investigate the rate of daily positive tests. Furthermore, we employed two different methods to calculate the effective reproduction number using reported data. Results: The results showed that there was a strong correlation between the number of daily deaths and the number of daily new cases (specially the admitted cases). The results also indicated that the mean of daily death rate of COVID-19 during 365 days was 4.9 percent, and averagely 13.9 percent of daily tests results were positive. Furthermore, epidemic curves showed that implementing strict social distancing measures effectively reduced the number of confirmed cases. The effective reproduction curve indicated that social distancing is still necessary to control the spread of COVID-19 in Iran. Conclusions: Analyzing the prevention and control measures indicated that the strict social distancing implemented by the government effectively reduces the number of new cases and deaths. The curve of reproduction number also showed that effective reproduction number is still above one; hence, it is necessary to continue strict social distancing and control travelling to prevent causing another wave of outbreak especially in Persian New Year.","Sahafizadeh, E.; Talatian Azad, S.",,143,20

Methods: This retrospective study included confirmed cases with early-stage COVID-19 related pneumonia imported from the epicenter. Initial and early-phase follow-up UHR-CT scans (within 5 days) were reviewed for characterizing the radiological findings. The normalized total volumes of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were calculated and compared during the radiological follow-up by artificial-intelligence-based methods. Results: Eleven patients (3 males and 8 females, aged 32-74 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. Subpleural GGOs with inter/intralobular septal thickening were typical imaging findings.

In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus. METHODS: We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio, Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool. RESULTS: From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified few different clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: We analysed the conceptual structure maps with factorial analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and identified multiple relationships between keywords, synonyms and concepts, related to Covid-19 mortality, immunity, and vaccine development. We present integrated and corelated knowledge from 276 records on Covid-19 and mortality, 71 records on Covid-19 and immunity, and 189 records on Covid-19 vaccine.","Radanliev, Petar; De Roure, David; Walton, Rob",Diabetes Metab Syndr,143,20

Numerous teams are quickly developing artificial intelligence approaches to these problems, including using deep learning to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis from computed tomography (CT) imaging data. In this work, we assess the value of aggregated chest CT data for COVID-19 prognosis compared to clinical metadata alone. We develop a novel patient-level algorithm to aggregate the chest CT volume into a 2D representation that can be easily integrated with clinical metadata to distinguish Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19+) from other cases of viral pneumonia and normal healthy chest CT volumes with state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we present a multitask model for joint segmentation of different classes of pulmonary lesions present in COVID-19 infected lungs that can outperform individual segmentation models for each task. We directly compare this multitask segmentation approach to combining feature-agnostic volumetric CT classification feature maps with clinical metadata for predicting mortality. These approaches enable the automated extraction of clinically relevant features from chest CT volumes for risk stratification of COVID-19+ patients.","Trivedi, A.; Ortiz, A.; Desbiens, J.; Robinson, C.; Blazes, M.; Gupta, S.; Dodhia, R.; Bhatraju, P.; Liles, W.

Objective: Herein, we evaluated the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic. Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Air-bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients. Conclusions: In conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Chang, M.

Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a subclass of endogenous, non‐protein‐coding RNA, which lacks an open reading frame and is more than 200 nucleotides in length. However, the functions for lncRNAs in COVID‐19 have not been unravelled. The present study aimed at identifying the related lncRNAs based on RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as well as health individuals. Overall, 17 severe, 12 non‐severe patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Firstly, we reported some altered lncRNAs between severe, non‐severe COVID‐19 patients and healthy controls. Next, we developed a 7‐lncRNA panel with a good differential ability between severe and non‐severe COVID‐19 patients using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Finally, we observed that COVID‐19 is a heterogeneous disease among which severe COVID‐19 patients have two subtypes with similar risk score and immune score based on lncRNA panel using iCluster algorithm. As the roles of lncRNAs in COVID‐19 have not yet been fully identified and understood, our analysis should provide valuable resource and information for the future studies.","Cheng, Jie; Zhou, Xiang; Feng, Weijun; Jia, Min; Zhang, Xinlu; An, Taixue; Luan, Minyuan; Pan, Yi; Zhang, Shu; Zhou, Zhaoming; Wen, Lei; Sun, Yun; Zhou, Cheng",J Cell Mol Med,143,1

The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >20 million people worldwide, with >5 million cases in the United States (11 August 2020). The development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy is critically needed. We have developed multiple serologic assays using newly designed SARS-CoV-2 reagents for detecting the presence of receptor-binding antibodies in sera. The first assay is surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based and can quantitate both antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocking to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in a single experiment. The second assay is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based and can measure competition and blocking of the ACE2 receptor to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with antispike antibodies. The assay is highly versatile, and we demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring antibody functionality of sera from small animals and nonhuman primates immunized with an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, we employ the assay to measure receptor blocking of sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The assay is shown to correlate with pseudovirus neutralization titers. This type of rapid, surrogate neutralization diagnostic can be employed widely to help study SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the efficacy of vaccines.","Walker, Susanne N.; Chokkalingam, Neethu; Reuschel, Emma L.; Purwar, Mansi; Xu, Ziyang; Gary, Ebony N.; Kim, Kevin Y.; Helble, Michaela; Schultheis, Katherine; Walters, Jewell; Ramos, Stephanie; Muthumani, Kar; Smith, Trevor R.

This study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 among Syrians in a post-conflict context. METHOD: A cross sectional web-based survey was conducted on the Syrian residents of 16 years and above. It contains questions on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) with respect to COVID-19. Participants’ demographic characteristics are recorded and analyzed. The study is conducted during the global outbreak of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 706 participants (female, 444; male, 262) were enrolled. This study included 405 participants aged between 16 and 29, 204 aged between 30 and 49, and 97 aged above 60 years. There were 642 who have a university degree and 61 who have high school degree. Among the participants 253 were students, 316 were employed, 75 work as freelancers, and 62 were unemployed. Results showed that overall knowledge score towards the disease was about 60% (mean score 3.54 ± 1.20; range 0–6). Knowledge scores significantly differed across age groups (P < 0.05), education levels (P = 0.001), and occupations (P < 0.05). Attitude and practice scores were 2.45 ± 0.81 (range 0–4), 5.90 ± 1.52 (range 0–8), respectively. Attitude scores were significantly different between males and females (P < 0.05), whereas practice scores varied significantly across gender (P < 0.05), age groups (P = 0.01), education levels (P = 0.015), occupations (P < 0.05), and according to knowledge score (P = 0.000). Results from multiple linear regression indicated that lower knowledge scores were significantly associated with lower education level (P < 0.05), whereas poor preventive practices were common among male, young and unemployed participants with significance levels of P < 0.01, P = .000, P < 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the Syrian residents demonstrate modest knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 at the time of its global outbreak. Efforts should be directed towards raising the awareness of the disease to improve their practices in the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for future epidemics.

Fisher information provides a useful measure of the electronic structure in quantum systems, such as hydrogen-like atoms and under some potentials. By numerically evaluating the generalized Laguerre polynomials in the radial densities, we report that Fisher information increases linearly with the principal quantum number that specifies energy levels, but decreases monotonically with the azimuthal quantum number m. We also present relative Fisher information of the Landau states against the reference density with [Formula: see text] , which is proportional to the principal quantum number.

Although there have been an increasing number of reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is unclear why infected children show milder symptoms than adults. A retrospective case study was performed at two designated hospitals for COVID-19. Patients (56 children and 63 adults) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild pneumonia were randomly enrolled in this study. The median age of the children was 7.0 years, and 51.79% of them were boys. The median age of the adults was 57 years, and 47.62% were men. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, sputum and diarrhoea. There were no significant differences in symptoms between children and adult patients. In terms of immunological indices on admission, adult patients displayed typical leukopenia and markedly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 than child patients. The elevation of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 in adults induced more extensive lung injury. The effective and non-aggressive immune response successfully resisted SARS-CoV-2 invasion and maintained mild symptoms in child patients. The correlation of higher IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 with the lung injury might be evidence that preventing excessive cytokine production can avoid further lung damage in these patients.","Yuan, Yin; Wang, Qiu-peng; Sun, Dan; Wu, Zu-bo; Peng, Hua; Liu, Xin-wen; Liu, Ya-ling",Curr Med Sci,143,23

Based on the current understanding, COVID-19 has become a global issue. Presumably, numerous studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 also transpires in kidney tissue with permanent viral loads. However, it is elusive as to whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly damage the kidney or induce acute renal failure. Hence, to comprehensively understand the impact of COVID-19 on kidney damage, we conducted a retrospective series of case studies to assess kidney functions. Additionally, ACE2 distribution in kidney tissue was analyzed through RNAseq data in open-access databases. Results: According to the findings from transcriptome analysis, we revealed higher ACE2 expression levels in females than males. Similar results were more noticeable in the elderly than in young adults. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis showed high ACE2 expression in kidney tubule and collecting duct principal cells as well as glomerular parietal epithelial cells. On their admission, the patient's serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were elevated to between 36.13% and 16.80%, respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was reported in 10.92 % of the patients. Notably, at admission, increased BUN time varied linearly following the generalized additive mixed model. Thus, the hourly-increase of BUN in patients was 0.495 (95%CI: 0.263, 0.726). Conclusion: Based on clinical findings, it was ascertained that COVID-19 can damage renal function, but it seldom causes acute renal failure. Coronavirus may directly bind to ACE2-positive cells and damage kidney tissue in the analysis of scRNA-seq data in kidney tissue. Therefore, this evidence suggests that kidney tissue act as the SARS-CoV-2 infection site and the findings could provide insight into the pathophysiology of kidney damage. Methods: We systematically analyzed ACE2 expression profiles in organs based on open-access datasets for healthy individuals. Meanwhile, single-cell sequencing data for kidney samples were collected and analyzed. Assessments on kidney functions were conducted on 119 selected COVID-19 positive patients admitted from 10(th) February – 18(th) March 2020, in hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and diversity of CAM in patients with RD in Chihuahua, Mexico. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 500 patients with RD who were interviewed about the use of CAM to treat their disease. The interview included sociodemographic aspects, characteristics of the disease, as well as a description of CAM use, including type, frequency of use, perception of the benefit, communication with the rheumatologist, among others. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAM use was reported by 59.2% of patients, which informed a total of 155 different therapies. The herbal CAM group was the most used (31.4%) and included more than 50 different therapies. The use of menthol-based and arnica ointments was highly prevalent (35%). Most patients (62.3%) reported very little or no improvement in their symptoms. Only a fourth of the patients informed the rheumatologist of the use of CAM. The use of CAM was influenced by female sex, university degree, diagnosis delay, lack adherence to the rheumatologist’s treatment, family history of RD, and orthopedic devices. CONCLUSION: The use of CAM in our population is highly prevalent and similar to reports in different populations suggesting a widespread use in many different societies. We found high use of herbal remedies; however, there were many different types suggesting a lack of significant effect. Patients continue using CAM despite a perception of no-effectiveness. Recurrent use of CAM is explained by factors other than its efficacy.","Caballero-Hernández, Claudia Isabel; González-Chávez, Susana Aideé; Urenda-Quezada, Adelfia; Reyes-Cordero, Greta Cristina; Peláez-Ballestas, Ingris; Álvarez-Hernández, Everardo; Pacheco-Tena, César",PLoS One,143,24

However, several ICT solutions lack evidence-based content. Therefore, there is a need to identify important features that have the potential to efficiently and consistently support the PA of adolescents using ICT solutions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create evidence-based models of requirements for ICT solutions supporting PA by combining scientific evidence from literature and health experts. In addition, we test the suitability of agent-oriented goal models in this type of modeling process. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted to identify evidence-based functional, quality, and emotional goals that have previously been proven to be relevant in supporting PAs among youth using ICT solutions. The identified goals were presented in the form of goal models. These models were used to collaborate with health experts to receive their input on the topic and suggestions for improvement. The initial goal models were improved based on the feedback from the experts. RESULTS: The results indicated that agent-oriented goal modeling is a suitable method for merging information from the literature and experts. One strength of agent-oriented goal models is that they present emotional requirements together with quality and functional requirements. Another strength is the possibility of presenting results from a literature review in a systematic manner and using them thereafter in the communication process with stakeholders. Agent-oriented goal models that were created were easy to understand for health experts without previous experience in requirements engineering, which facilitates and supports collaboration with nontechnical stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed agent-oriented goal models effectively merged information from scientific literature and experts in the field and presented early functional, quality, and emotional requirements in a holistic and coherent manner. We believe that the created models have high potential to help requirements engineers and developers to provide more efficient ICT solutions that support PA among adolescents in the future.","Mooses, Kerli; Taveter, Kuldar",J Med Internet Res,143,10

Although outbreaks have emerged amongst communities of international migrant workers worldwide, little is known about how they perceive the government's response or their exposure to rumors. METHODS: : Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, we surveyed 1011 low-waged migrant workers involved in dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Participants reported their confidence in the government; whether they had heard, shared, or believed widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors; and their socio-demographics. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with confidence and rumor exposure. RESULTS: : 1 in 2 participants (54.2%, 95% CI: 51.1-57.3%) reported that they believed at least one COVID-19 rumor. This incidence was higher than that observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). Nonetheless, most participants (90.0%, 95% CI: 87.6-91.5%) reported being confident that the government could control the spread of COVID-19.

Because situations that increase stress and anxiety are associated with higher smoking prevalence, we examined self-reported smoking before and during the lockdown, and analyzed factors associated with reported changes in cigarette consumption. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown; the final, weighted sample included 261 daily smokers and 71 weekly smokers. We measured psychological distress and anxiety, as well as situational factors, tobacco consumption, and demographic attributes. RESULTS: Nearly half of daily smokers reported smoking more during than before the lockdown, on average, an increase of six cigarettes a day; increased daily cigarette consumption was associated with loneliness and isolation. Most weekly smokers reported either that their smoking during the lockdown had not changed or had slightly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with increased daily tobacco consumption, and that this increase may be sustained after lockdown. While public health responses to pandemics predictably focus on immediate and obvious consequences, interventions to support recent quitters and those making quit attempts should also form a key component of pandemic planning. IMPLICATIONS: As governments introduce unprecedented measures to manage COVID-19, they need also to consider other public health risks, such as increased smoking among current smokers or relapse among recent quitters. Evidence that loneliness was associated with increased smoking during a lockdown suggests a need for cessation out-reach strategies that promote and support smoke-free practices.","Gendall, Philip; Hoek, Janet; Stanley, James; Jenkins, Mathew; Every-Palmer, Susanna",Nicotine Tob Res,143,16

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a molecular platform that promotes inflammation via cleavage and activation of key inflammatory molecules including active caspase-1 (Casp1p20), IL-1β, and IL-18. Although participation of the inflammasome in COVID-19 has been highly speculated, the inflammasome activation and participation in the outcome of the disease are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and is active in COVID-19 patients. Studying moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, we found active NLRP3 inflammasome in PBMCs and tissues of postmortem patients upon autopsy. Inflammasome-derived products such as Casp1p20 and IL-18 in the sera correlated with the markers of COVID-19 severity, including IL-6 and LDH. Moreover, higher levels of IL-18 and Casp1p20 are associated with disease severity and poor clinical outcome. Our results suggest that inflammasomes participate in the pathophysiology of the disease, indicating that these platforms might be a marker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Rodrigues, Tamara S.; de Sá, Keyla S.G.; Ishimoto, Adriene Y.; Becerra, Amanda; Oliveira, Samuel; Almeida, Leticia; Gonçalves, Augusto V.; Perucello, Debora B.; Andrade, Warrison A.; Castro, Ricardo; Veras, Flavio P.; Toller-Kawahisa, Juliana E.; Nascimento, Daniele C.; de Lima, Mikhael H.F.; Silva, Camila M.S.; Caetite, Diego B.; Martins, Ronaldo B.; Castro, Italo A.; Pontelli, Marjorie C.; de Barros, Fabio C.; do Amaral, Natália B.; Giannini, Marcela C.; Bonjorno, Letícia P.; Lopes, Maria Isabel F.; Santana, Rodrigo C.; Vilar, Fernando C.; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Luppino-Assad, Rodrigo; de Almeida, Sergio C.L.; de Oliveira, Fabiola R.; Batah, Sabrina S.; Siyuan, Li; Benatti, Maira N.; Cunha, Thiago M.; Alves-Filho, José C.; Cunha, Fernando Q.; Cunha, Larissa D.; Frantz, Fabiani G.; Kohlsdorf, Tiana; Fabro, Alexandre T.; Arruda, Eurico; de Oliveira, Renê D.R.; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Zamboni, Dario S.",J Exp Med,143,28

The resulting hybrid, serologically A-like/Tn (T-nouvelle) structure potentially acts as a host–pathogen functional molecular bridge. In humans, this intermediate structure will hypothetically be replaced by ABO(H) blood group-specific, mucin-type structures, in the case of infection hybrid epitopes, implicating the phenotypically glycosidic accommodation of plasma proteins. The virus may, by mimicking the synthetic pathways of the ABO(H) blood groups, bind to the cell surfaces of the blood group O(H) by formation of a hybrid H-type antigen as the potential precursor of hybrid non-O blood groups, which does not affect the highly anti-glycan aggressive anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin activities, exerted by the germline-encoded nonimmune immunoglobulin M (IgM). In the non-O blood groups, which have developed from the H-type antigen, these IgM activities are downregulated by phenotypic glycosylation, while adaptive immunoglobulins might arise in response to the hybrid A and B blood group structures, suggesting the exertion of autoreactivity. The non-O blood groups thus become a preferred target for the virus, whereas blood group O(H) individuals, lacking the A/B phenotype-determining enzymes and binding the virus alone by hybrid H-type antigen formation, have the least molecular contact with the virus and maintain the critical anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin activities, exerted by the ancestral IgM, which is considered the humoral spearhead of innate immunity.","Arend, Peter",Immunobiology,143,15

A total of 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from infants suffering from bronchiolitis since October 2000 to June 2003 and shown previously as negative to common respiratory viruses were examined. Matrix and polymerase viral genes, which show a low rate of variation, were chosen to design amplification assays to ensure that any genotype of the human metapneumovirus could be detected. A RT-PCR followed by a reverse line blotting hybridisation was developed for viral polymerase gene. For the matrix gene, after the RT-PCR assay, a subsequent nested PCR was carried out. Both assays had similar sensitivity, equivalent to 0.1 TCID(50) of human metapneumovirus strain NL/1/99 which was used as the positive control. The human metapneumovirus was present in 16.6% of the specimens studied. The approaches described below are not only a robust method for rapid diagnosis of the human metapneumovirus, but also to establish an etiological surveillance tool for epidemiological studies.

This study analyzed the epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya, examined the impact of the armed conflict in Libya on the spread of the pandemic, and proposes strategies for dealing with the pandemic during this conflict. We collected the available information on all COVID-19 cases in the different regions of Libya, covering the period from March 25(th) to May 25(th) 2020. The cumulative number of cases and the daily new cases are presented in a way to illustrate the patterns and trends of COVID-19, and the effect of the ongoing armed conflict was assessed regionally. A total of 698 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya within a period of three months. The number of cases varied from one region to another and was affected by the fighting. The largest number of cases were reported in the southern part of the country, which has been severely affected by the conflict in comparison to the eastern and western parts of the country. This study describes the epidemiological pattern of COVID-19 in Libya and how it has been affected by the ongoing-armed conflict.

The volume percentage of inflammation and the volume percentage of “ground glass” were significantly higher in the atypical (respectively, 11.04%, 8.61%) and the COVID-19 (12.41%, 10.41%) subgroups compared to the bronchopneumonia (5.12%, 3.42%) subgroup. The volume percentage of consolidation was significantly higher in the COVID-19 (2.95%) subgroup compared to the atypical (1.26%) subgroup. The percentage of “ground glass” in the volume of inflammation was significantly higher in the atypical (89.85%) subgroup compared to the COVID-19 (79.06%) subgroup, which in turn was significantly higher compared to the bronchopneumonia (68.26%) subgroup. HRCT chest images, analyzed automatically by artificial intelligence software, taking into account the structure including “ground glass” and consolidation, significantly differ in three subgroups: COVID-19 pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and atypical pneumonia. However, the partial overlap, particularly between COVID-19 pneumonia and atypical pneumonia, may limit the usefulness of automatic analysis in differentiating the etiology.

The continuously emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants present a major challenge to the development of antiviral agents and vaccines. In this study, we identified that EK1 and cholesterol-coupled derivative of EK1, EK1C4, as pan-CoV fusion inhibitors, exhibit potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in both lung- and intestine-derived cell lines (Calu-3 and Caco2, respectively). They are also effective against infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.1.248 (Gamma) as well as those with mutations in S protein, including N417T, E484K, N501Y, and D614G, which are common in South African and Brazilian variants. Crystal structure revealed that EK1 targets the HR1 domain in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to block virus-cell fusion and provide mechanistic insights into its broad and effective antiviral activity. Nasal administration of EK1 peptides to hACE2 transgenic mice significantly reduced viral titers in lung and intestinal tissues.

The median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4‐12); 44.2% cases were of clustered occurrences, 40.4% patients had fever, 48.1% had cough, and 46.2% had a high lymphocyte count. No abnormalities were found in the liver and kidney function. Also, 82.7% of patients received antiviral therapy, but such therapy did not shorten the time to virus negativity or hospital stay (P = .082). The time to virus negativity was 12.0 days (IQR, 8.0‐16.8) and hospital stay was 14.5 days (IQR, 10.3‐17.9). Compared with reports in Wuhan, there were more acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and fewer pneumonia cases (P = .000). Compared with the non‐ICU adult COVID‐19 in Wuhan, these children's diseases were relatively mild, with fewer complications.

In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases. III. JHM virus infection of rats. Arch Neurol 1980; 37: 478-84. Two types of studies were conducted to ascertain the involvement of the cellular immune system in development of resistance. Immunosuppression of WL rats with cyclosporin A (CsA) following onset of the age-related resistance demonstrated that this drug was partially able to abrogate resistance. In the other studies nude (rnu/rnu) rats, their heterozygous (rnu/+) litter mates and genetically related LE rats of various ages were challenged with JHMV. The rnu/+ and LE animals became completely resistant before the age of weaning, whereas some rnu/rnu rats, challenged as late as 70 days of age, showed disease symptoms—albeit after a long latent period. These observations indicated that the cellular immune system plays an important role in suppressing the disease process in the CNS. When the infection of nude rats was initiated on or after the 15th day of life, the histological lesions were generally small and present in both grey and white matter but were seldom seen in the spinal cord. Mononuclear infiltrates were evident throughout the CNS. In some nude rats there was massive mononuclear cell infiltration towards the meningies and into ventricular spaces. By contrast in rnu/+, LE and WL rats with late-onset disease symptoms, demyelinating-type lesions were confined to the white matter and only minor infiltration of mononuclear cells was evident. JHMV RNA was detectable by dot-blotting analysis in the CNS of both paralysed and asymptomatic rnu/rnu and rnu/+ rats, but less RNA was usually detected in heterozygous animals. In-situ hybridization with cDNA probes for JHMV RNA showed that neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as cells in the white matter, were frequently infected. The present data indicate that in the rat T cells have an important function in maintaining resistance to the JHMV related disease process. However, even without a functional T cell compartment nude rats challenged after 15 days of age did not develop an acute encephalitis, suggesting that an age-dependent, non-immunological mechanism is also involved in restricting the spread of infection. It is possible that resistance in euthymic rats sets in because: (1) at the time of weaning the CNS matures, so that the number of targets available for infection is reduced, (2) T cells prevent the late-onset disease by clearing persistent, low grade infections from the CNS.","Sorensen, O.; Saravani, A.; Dales, S.",Microbial Pathogenesis,143,20

There is limited literature on prevalence of pre-existing CeVD in COVID-19 patients, and outcomes are unknown. The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD. METHODS: English full-text-observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using MeSH-terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. Studies having CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities and described outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation utilization, and mortality were selected with consensus of three reviewers. Following MOOSE protocol, 11 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of CeVD and outcomes were calculated. Meta-regression was performed, and correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated to evaluate the effects of pre-existing CeVD on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Meta-analysis with random-effects model was used to calculate OR along with its 95% CI from the studies containing data on composite poor outcome. RESULTS: Out of 8/11 studies showing data on mortality and mechanical ventilation, and 7/11 on ICU admission, pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.4% (244/4987). In age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, pre-existing CeVD was associated with ICU admission [r: 0.60; OR: 1.82 (1.25–2.69)], mechanical ventilation [r: 0.29; OR: 1.33 (1.09–1.63)], and mortality [r: 0.35; OR: 1.42 (1.14–1.77)] amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations. 9/11 studies reported data on binary composite outcomes, the pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.3% (155/3603) and 7.46% (83/1113) amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 hospitalization-related poor outcomes, respectively.

In China, three types of facilities for centralized isolation (Fangcang shelter hospitals, refitted non-designated hospitals, and quarantine hotels) underwent retrofitting for the treatment and isolation of confirmed and suspected cases. These facilities mitigated the immediate high demand for space. Moreover, in order to minimize infection risks in these facilities, regulators and governmental agencies implemented new designs, management measures, and precautionary measures to minimize infection risk. Other countries and regions could refer to China's experience in optimally allocating social resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23).

The proposed automated classification framework for DED was achieved in several steps: image quality enhancement, image segmentation (region of interest), image augmentation (geometric transformation), and classification. The optimal results were obtained using traditional image processing methods with a new build convolution neural network (CNN) architecture. The new built CNN combined with the traditional image processing approach presented the best performance with accuracy for DED classification problems. The results of the experiments conducted showed adequate accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.","Sarki, Rubina; Ahmed, Khandakar; Wang, Hua; Zhang, Yanchun; Ma, Jiangang; Wang, Kate",Data Sci Eng,143,16

Recently, associations between SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia and disease severity and mortality have been reported in adults, while no reports are available in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality, severity, clinical, and laboratory findings of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detection in blood in 96 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID‐19. Among all patients, 6 (6%) had SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia. Out of the six patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia, four (67%) had a severe form of the disease, and two out of the 6 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia passed away (33%). Our results show that the symptoms more commonly found in the cases of COVID‐19 in the study (fever, cough, tachypnea, and vomiting), were found at a higher percentage in the patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia. Creatine phosphokinase and magnesium tests showed significant differences between the positive and negative SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia groups. Among all laboratory tests, magnesium and creatine phosphokinase could better predict SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAemia with area under the curve levels of 0.808 and 0.748, respectively. In conclusion, 67% of individuals with SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia showed a severe COVID‐19 and one‐third of the patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia passed away. Our findings suggest that magnesium and creatine phosphokinase might be considered as markers to estimate the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNAaemia.","Pourakbari, Babak; Mahmoudi, Shima; Mahmoudieh, Yasmine; Eshaghi, Hamid; Navaeian, Amene; Rostamyan, Maryam; Mamishi, Setareh",J Med Virol,143,20

Design Retrospective case series. Setting A COVID-19 ward of a secondary Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants Consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients between Jan 3, 2020 and Feb 27, 2020. Outcomes were followed up to discharge or death. Results Of 121 patients included, 66 (54.6%) were males. The median age was 59 (IQR: 46 to 67) years, and hypertension (33 patients; 27.3%) the leading comorbidity. Lymphopenia (83 of 115 patients; 72.2%) frequently occurred and then normalized on day 4 (IQR: 3 to 6) after admission in the survivors, with lung lesion absorbed gradually on day 8 (IQR: 6 to10) after onset (33 of 57 patients; 57.9%). The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in 78 (78/108; 72.2%) patients, and a false-negative RT-PCR occurred in 15 (13.9%) patients. Hypoxemia occurred in 94 (94/117; 80.3%) patients, and supplemental oxygen was given in 88 (72.7%) patients, and mon-invasive or invasive ventilation in 20 (16.5%) cases. Corticosteroid use might link to death. The case fatality rates were 4.4% (one of 23 patients), 29.3% (12/41), 22.8% (13/57) or 45% (9/20) for patients with moderate, severe, critical illness or on ventilator. The length of hospital stay was 14 (IQR: 10 to 20) days, and selfcare ability worsened in 21 patients (21/66; 31.8%) cases. Patients over 60 years were most likely to have poorer outcomes, and increasing in age by one-year increased risk for death by 18% (CI: 1.04-1.32). Conclusions In management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially the elderly with hypertension, close monitoring and appropriate supportive treatment should be taken earlier and aggressively to prevent from developing severe or critical illness. Corticosteroid use might link to death. Repeated RT-PCR tests or novel detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 should be adopted to improve diagnostic efficiency.","Wang, H.; Lu, Y.; Lv, Q.; Wu, X.; Hu, T.; Wang, K.; Liu, Y.; Hu, Y.; Yu, L.; Fei, H.; Ba, Z.; Lin, X.",,143,32

Pyrazoles are widely available in pharmaceutical and agrochemical products. Some pyrazoles are essential parts of commercial drugs in the market. This inspired us to collect the pharmacological activities of bipyrazoles that have potential therapeutic behaviours in several biological aspects but none of them were included in commercial drugs. AREAS COVERED This review covers all biological and pharmacological potentials of bipyrazole derivatives during 2010-2021. The topics of this review comprised anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitubercular, antimalarial, insecticidal activities as well as enzymatic inhibitions. EXPERT OPINION Bipyrazoles demonstrated a wide array of potent activities against various diseases such as anticancer, antitubercular, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Those are of great benefits for medicinal researchers to develop promising building blocks of bipyrazoles for treatment of diseases. The SAR studies showed that metallated bipyrazoles had better biological activities than bipyrazole ligands. For example, gold(III) and iridium(II) complexes of bipyrazoles were proved to be anticancer agents, and copper(I) as well as silver(I) complexes had excellent antibacterial activities. Several bipyrazoles were reported as antimalarial inhibitors better than chloroquine, the possible COVID-19 drug.","Abbas, Ashraf A; Abdellattif, Magda H; Dawood, Kamal M",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,143,21

Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies assist data mapping and analysis, and the prediction of the spatial distribution of infection in relation to environmental variables. The influence of socioeconomic, environmental and soil characteristics on hookworm infection at the individual and household level is explored in order to identify spatial patterns of infection in rural villages from Zenzelema (Amhara region). Inhabitants greater than 5 years old were recruited in order to assess the presence of STH. Socioeconomic and hookworm infection variables at the household level and environmental variables and soil characteristics using RS were obtained. The dominant STH found was hookworm. Individuals which practiced open defecation and those without electricity had a significant higher number of hookworm eggs in their stool. Additionally, adults showed statistically higher hookworm egg counts than children. Nonetheless, the probability of hookworm infection was not determined by socioeconomic conditions but by environmental characteristics surrounding the households, including a combination of vigorous vegetation and bare soil, high temperatures, and compacted soils (high bulk density) with more acidic pH, given a pH of 6.0 is optimal for hatching of hookworm eggs. The identification of high-risk environmental areas provides a useful tool for planning, targeting and monitoring of control measures, including not only children but also adults when hookworm is concerned.","Anegagrie, Melaku; Lanfri, Sofía; Aramendia, Aranzazu Amor; Scavuzzo, Carlos Matías; Herrador, Zaida; Benito, Agustín; Periago, Maria Victoria",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,143,1

Korth., commonly known as “Kadam,” is an endangered and pharmaceutically valued tree of the family Rubiaceae. The numerous medicinal properties are attributed to the various alkaloids of this plant. Poor seedling survival (due to very small size of seeds, approximately 10,000 per gm), overexploitation and habitat destruction are the major constraints in conserving the wild stocks of this species. This paper reports a significant, improved, and repeatable micropropagation protocol of M. parvifolia using nodal explants of a mature tree. Nodal explants harvested during spring season from the lopped tree differentiated the maximum number of axillary shoots (5.3 ± 0.82 per node) on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 3.0 mg L(−1) 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and additives (25 mg L(−1) each of adenine sulfate, L-arginine, and citric acid and 50 mg L(−1) ascorbic acid). Shoots were amplified in vitro through (1) recurrent transfer of mother explants and (2) subculturing on fresh nutrient medium. The greatest number of shoots (13.4 ± 1.26) with an average length of 6.2 ± 1.03 cm was produced after 4 wk on MS medium containing 0.5 mg L(−1) BAP, 0.25 mg L(−1) kinetin (Kin), 0.1 mg L(−1) Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), additives, 100 mg L(−1) activated charcoal (AC), and 0.8% (w/v) agar. This is the first report of concurrent ex vitro rooting and acclimatization (CEVRA) in M. parvifolia. About 90% micropropagated shoots rooted ex vitro on pulse treatment of 500 mg L(−1) Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA; for 5 min) and produced 8.5 ± 0.97 roots per shoot with an average length of 9.40 ± 1.06 cm, after 5 wk. Over 80% of CEVRA plantlets were successfully transplanted to the soil in field. The defined protocol can be employed for conservation ex situ and restoration/rehabilitation/reintroduction in situ of M. parvifolia.

Compared to organic fluorophores, the narrower emission band and wider absorption bands of QDs offer great advantages in cell imaging and biosensor applications. The optoelectronic features of QDs have prompted their intensive use in bioanalytical, biophysical, and biomedical research. As the nanomaterials have been integrated into microfluidic systems, microfluidic technology has accelerated the adaptation of nanomaterials to clinical evaluation together with the advantages such as being more economical, more reproducible, and more susceptible to modification and integration with other technologies. Microfluidic systems serve an important role by being a platform in which QDs are integrated for biosensing applications. As we combine the advantages of QDs and microfluidic technology for biosensing technology, QD-based biosensor integrated with microfluidic systems can be used as an advanced and versatile diagnostic technology in case of pandemic. Specifically, there is an urgent necessity to have reliable and fast detection systems for COVID-19 virus. In this review, affinity-based biosensing mechanisms which are developed with QDs are examined in the domain of microfluidic approach. The combination of microfluidic technology and QD-based affinity biosensors are presented with examples in order to develop a better technological framework of diagnostic for COVID-19 virus.","Şahin, Sultan; Ünlü, Caner; Trabzon, Levent",Emergent Mater,143,1

Yet the exact link between climate and COVID-19 is still not well-explored. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hot geographical region weather [like United Arab Emirates (UAE)] on COVID-19 clinical profile and outcomes. Temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, precipitation, and other weather-related variables were studied concerning COVID-19 patients outcomes and laboratory results. Methodology: A total of 434 COVID-19 positive patients admitted between January and June 2020, were recruited from Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE. Temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, and precipitation rate were retrieved from history+ for the day when COVID-19 patients presented to the hospital. These weather parameters were correlated with COVID-19 clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: Our results showed that patients needed admission in days with higher temperatures, higher solar radiation, and less humidity were associated with higher deaths. This association can be linked to the association of these weather parameters with age at diagnosis; higher C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, white cell count (WCC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and lower lymphocyte count, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin (Hb), Na, and albumin, all of which are considered poor prognostic factors for COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study highlighted the importance of weather-related variables on the dynamics of mortality and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The hot weather might makes some people, especially those with comorbidities or older ages, develop aggressive inflammation that ends up with complications and mortality.","Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen; Hachim, Ibrahim Y.; Naeem, Kashif; Hannawi, Haifa; Al Salmi, Issa; Hannawi, Suad",Front Public Health,143,16

Celui ci est par ailleurs touché par une épidémie de dengue depuis l’année 2017, dont le pic est habituellement situé entre mars et juin. L’objectif de cette étude était d’identifier les symptômes discriminants entre les deux infections virales lors de la présentation clinique en centre de dépistage COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Étude observationnelle rétrospective réalisée entre le 23 mars et le 10 mai 2020 sur l’ensemble des sujets dépistés pour la COVID-19. Ce dépistage comprenait un hétéro-questionnaire standardisé, une prise des paramètres vitaux, un écouvillonage nasopharyngé ainsi qu’un test rapide d’orientation diagnostique (TROD) chez les patients suspects de dengue. En cas de positivité de l’antigène NS1, un bilan biologique était prescrit. Les données ont été analysées à l’aide de tests du Chi2 ou de Fisher exact, de Student ou de Mann–Whitney, dans leurs conditions d’application. Résultats Sur les 1715 sujets dépistés pendant la période d’étude, 91 étaient positifs ou diagnostiqués malades pour la COVID-19. Le résultat du TROD était connu pour 66 sujets, et positif pour 48 sujets (72,7 %). Par ailleurs, 5 sujets avec TROD négatif ont été identifiés comme dengue secondaire et assemblés aux 48 cas. Les sujets COVID-19 avaient voyagé pour 52 % d’entre eux (vs 7,5 % pour la dengue, p <0,001). Le sexe, l’obésité, ou les comorbidités n’étaient pas associés à l’une ou l’autre des infections. Un tabagisme actif était deux fois moins rapporté dans la COVID-19 que dans la dengue (33 % vs 67 %, p <0,001). La dengue était symptomatique dans 100 % des cas, le COVID dans 88 % (p <0,01), ce qui traduisait un mode différencié de recrutement. La fièvre était plus fréquente en cas de dengue (90 % vs 49 %, p <0,001), tout comme les céphalées (94 % vs 34 %, p <0,001) et notamment les douleurs rétro-orbitaires (30 % vs 1 %, p <0,001), les courbatures (83 % vs 35 %, p <0,001), l’asthénie (77 % vs 42 %, p <0,001). L’anosmie était le seul symptôme associé à la COVID-19 (31 % vs 6 %, p <0,001). Rhinorrhée, toux et dyspnée n’étaient pas discriminantes. La température, la fréquence cardiaque et la SpO2 étaient similaires pour les deux infections. Les taux d’hospitalisation étaient également proches (11 % pour la dengue et 12 % pour la COVID-19). Le délai de présentation était plus court en cas de dengue qu’en cas de COVID-19 (4,4 vs 7,5jours, p =0,0001). Conclusion Les infections par le virus de la dengue et du SARS-CoV-2 sont deux entités cliniquement très proches. Il est difficile de poser un diagnostic en l’absence de TROD dengue ou de PCR SARS-CoV-2.

We augment a heterogeneous SIR model with a two-way feedback between contagion and economic activity, allowing for firm and sector heterogeneity. While protocols are a burden for firms (especially SMEs), they may enhance economic activity by avoiding infections that reduce the labor supply. Using Chilean data, we calibrate the model and assess the impact of recommended firm protocols on contagion and economic activity in the after-lockdown period. Our quantitative results suggest that: (i) A second wave of infections is likely in the absence of protocols; (ii) Protocols targeted at some sectors can reduce deaths while at the same time improving economic conditions; (iii) Protocols applied widely have a negative effect on the economy. We also find that applying strict protocols to a few sectors is generally preferable to applying milder protocols to a larger number of sectors, both in terms of health and economic benefits.","Janiak, Alexandre; Machado, Caio; Turen, Javier",J Econ Behav Organ,143,16

Burnout may substantially hinder the well-being and morale of healthcare providers, challenging our efforts at disease containment. This study investigated the relationship between perceived COVID-19 stigma and burnout symptoms among physicians and nurses. We further aimed to identify potential factors that may moderate this relationship, including profession, clinical contact with COVID-19 patients, and prior experience with 2003 SARS-CoV-1. METHODS: We used a web-based, structured survey from March 12th to 29th, 2020 to collect cross-sectional, self-reported data. Participants were provided with a link to the survey which took them on average 5-8 minutes. Survey consisted of demographic characteristics, clinical experiences, perceived COVID-19 related stigma, and burnout symptoms. Linear regression with bootstrapping techniques was adopted to test the relations between stigma and burnout, as well as other potential moderators, while adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Of the 1421 consented respondents, 357 identified as physicians while 1064 identified as nurses. Participants reported some levels of stigma, and noticeable burnout symptoms. Burnout symptoms were positively correlated with COVID-19 stigma, profession, and currently care for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients. The interaction between stigma and profession (Stigma × Nurses) but no other interaction terms reached the significance level, suggesting that the slope for nurses was flatter than the slope for physicians. CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that COVID-19 stigma may contribute to burnout among physicians and nurses, and this relation may not vary across clinical roles and experiences but profession.","Shiu, Chengshi; Chen, Wei-Ti; Hung, Chia-Chun; Huang, Edward Pei-Chuan; Lee, Tony Szu-Hsien",J Formos Med Assoc,143,1

A wide variety of viruses play a role in the development of cough after acute infection and all of these manifest a similar clinical picture across different age groups. Despite the large disease burden surprisingly little is known about the mechanism of acute cough following viral infection. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that increased production of neuropeptides and leukotrienes mediate cough after viral infection, along with altered expression of neural receptors. Increased airway mucus production is also likely to play a significant role. This work is reviewed in this article. Following the recent development of a mouse model for rhinovirus infection and the establishment of experimental models of rhinovirus challenge in human subjects with both asthma and COPD the field is expanding to translate in vitro research into clinical studies and hopefully eventually into clinical practice.

Methods: A meta-analysis was performed with randomized controlled trials of carers' tele-health interventions from the literature inception to December 31, 2019, using PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for articles. Results: The meta-analysis identified 1,043 results, of which 11 were randomized control trials. Among all 11 randomized control trials, only one study addressed face-to-face contact with online modules of interventions, four studies addressed telephone-based interventions, two studies reported on combined face-to-face contact and phone call interventions, two studies focused on web-based interventions, one study used video and telephone interventions, and one study conducted a computer-telephone integration system of intervention. The updated evidence suggested that there was more efficacy via tele-health interventions in lowering depression for carers of people with dementia. We outlined the delivery formation of intervention to evaluate the effectiveness and processes of major mental health improvements, including depression, burden, anxiety, and quality of life. Conclusions: In this study, tele-health intervention was shown to significantly lower depression and also lower the risk of mental health impairment. Although there was a significant decrease of depression, there were no significant differences in burden, anxiety, and quality of life. Future researchers are encouraged to carry out larger-scale studies; also, further analysis using a standardized assessment tool is suggested for future multi-component tele-health interventions.","Zhu, Aiyong; Cao, Wenting; Zhou, Yinghua; Xie, Anan; Cheng, Yun; Chu, Shu-Fen",Front Aging Neurosci,143,16

However, there are limited clinical data and guidelines for the management of influenza and other severe illness in these settings. Life‐saving supportive care through syndromic case management is used successfully in high‐resource intensive care units and in global programs such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). While there are a variety of challenges to the management of the severely ill in resource‐limited settings, several new international initiatives have begun to develop syndromic management strategies for these environments, including the World Health Organization's Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness Program.

These efforts must be enhanced by quality clinical research to provide missing evidence and to refine recommendations, which must be carefully integrated into existing healthcare systems. Realizing a sustainable, global impact on death and suffering due to severe influenza and other severe illness necessitates an ongoing and concerted international effort to iteratively generate, implement, and evaluate best‐practice management guidelines for use in resource‐limited settings.","Ortiz, Justin R.; Jacob, Shevin T.; Eoin West, T.",Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses,143,1

The purpose of our current study was to investigate the role of immune imprinting by influenza on pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness during Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in the aged murine lung. Aged adult (18 months) mice were vaccinated with the pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine Pneumovax (5 mg/mouse). Fourteen days post vaccination, mice were instilled with PBS or influenza A/PR8/34 virus (3.5 × 10(2) PFU). Control and influenza-infected mice were instilled with PBS or S. pneumoniae (1 × 10(3) CFU, ATCC 6303) on day 7 of infection and antibacterial immune responses were assessed in the lung. Our results illustrate that, in response to a primary influenza infection, there was diminished bacterial clearance and heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and IL1β. Vaccination with Pneumovax decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production by modulating NFҡB expression; however, these responses were significantly diminished after influenza infection. Taken together, the data in our current study illustrate that immune imprinting by influenza diminishes pneumococcal vaccine efficacy and, thereby, may contribute to increased susceptibility of older persons to a secondary infection with S. pneumoniae.","Jirru, Ermias; Lee, Stefi; Harris, Rebecca; Yang, Jianjun; Cho, Soo Jung; Stout-Delgado, Heather",Vaccines (Basel),143,30

Drawing on PPP case-studies as well as on Israel’s pandemic preparedness policies during the Covid-19 outbreak, we examine potential implications for the populations in question and for health systems. In our view, Chemtob et al. describe an exceptional achievement, where a PPP served as a stepping stone for the subsequent integration of irregular migrants’ in publicly funded HIV care. However, we argue that in many other cases PPPs are liable to undermine public healthcare and inclusionary claims. This view is informed by the fundamentally different concepts of healthcare that underlie PPPs and public healthcare provision (namely, health care as a commodity vs. access to healthcare as a right) and existing evidence on PPPs’ role in facilitating welfare retrenchment. In contexts that are dominated by an exclusionary stance toward irregular migrants, such as contemporary Israel, we believe that PPPs will become stopgaps that undermine health rights, rather than a first foot in the door that leads toward equitable provision of healthcare for all.","Gottlieb, Nora; Filc, Dani; Davidovitch, Nadav",Isr J Health Policy Res,143,20

The reason older patients and males show increased risk of severe disease and death remains uncertain. Sex hormones, such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, might be implicated in the age-dependent and sex-specific severity of COVID-19. High testosterone levels could upregulate transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), facilitating the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Data from patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy seem to confirm this hypothesis. Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women. In this perspective, we discuss the available evidence on sex hormones and hormone therapy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and we highlight the possible implications for cancer patients, who can receive hormonal therapies during their treatment plans.","Cattrini, Carlo; Bersanelli, Melissa; Latocca, Maria Maddalena; Conte, Benedetta; Vallome, Giacomo; Boccardo, Francesco",Cancers (Basel),143,1

Accident statistics show that E-bikes are growingly involved in traffic accidents. This study evaluates the injury pattern and severity of E-bike injuries in direct comparison to injuries in motorcycle and bicycle accidents. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the data of 1796 patients who were treated at a Level I Trauma Center between 2009 and 2018 due to traffic accident, involving bicycles, E-bikes or motorcycles, were evaluated and compared with regard to injury patterns and injury severity. Accident victims treated as inpatients with at least 16 years of age were included in this study. Pillion passengers and outpatients were excluded. RESULTS: The following distribution was found in the individual groups: 67 E-bike, 1141 bicycle and 588 motorcycle accidents. The injury pattern of E-bikers resembled that of bicyclists much more than that of motorcyclists. The patients with E-bike accidents were almost 14 years older and had a higher incidence of moderate traumatic brain injuries than patients with bicycle accidents. Considering the E-bike riders wore nearly twice as often a helmet as bicycle riders. In comparison, the motorcyclists involved in an accident had fewer facial injuries, but more frequent and more serious injuries to the spine, abdomen and lower extremities. CONCLUSION: The overall E-bike injury pattern is similar to that of cyclists. The differences in the injury pattern to motorcycle accidents could be due to the higher speeds at the time of the accident, the different protection and vehicle architecture. What is striking, however, is the higher age and the increased craniocerebral trauma of the E-bikers involved in accidents compared to the cyclists. Older and untrained people who have a slower reaction time and less control over the E-bike could benefit from head protection or practical courses similar to motorcyclists.","Spörri, E; Pape, H -C; Rauer, T",Br J Surg,143,1

To identify antiviral compounds against Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a model positive stranded RNA virus, we tested acridine derivatives, such as chlorpromazine (CPZ) and quinacrine (QC), which are active against prion-based diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that CPZ and QC compounds inhibited TBSV RNA accumulation in plants and in protoplasts. In vitro assays revealed that the inhibitory effects of these compounds were manifested at different steps of TBSV replication. QC was shown to have an effect on multiple steps, including: (i) inhibition of the selective binding of the p33 replication protein to the viral RNA template, which is required for recruitment of viral RNA for replication; (ii) reduction of minus-strand synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase; and (iii) inhibition of translation of the uncapped TBSV genomic RNA. In contrast, CPZ was shown to inhibit the in vitro assembly of the TBSV replicase, likely due to binding of CPZ to intracellular membranes, which are important for RNA virus replication. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Since we found that CPZ was also an effective inhibitor of other plant viruses, including Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip crinkle virus, it seems likely that CPZ has a broad range of antiviral activity. Thus, these inhibitors constitute effective tools to study similarities in replication strategies of various RNA viruses.","Sasvari, Zsuzsanna; Bach, Stéphane; Blondel, Marc; Nagy, Peter D.",PLoS One,143,6

In this study we explore the same philosophy in the context of immunology. Our objective was to assess the correlation of “size” (number of edges and minimum vertex cover) of the JAK/STAT network with treatment effect in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), phenotype of viral infection and effect of immunosuppressive agents on a system infected with the coronavirus. We extracted the JAK/STAT pathway from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, hsa04630). The effects of the following drugs, and their combinations, commonly used in RA were tested: methotrexate, prednisolone, rituximab, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and baricitinib. Following viral systems were also tested for their ability to evade the JAK/STAT pathway: Measles, Influenza A, West Nile virus, Japanese B virus, Yellow Fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, Hendra and Nipah virus and Coronavirus. Good correlation of edges and minimum vertex cover with clinical efficacy were observed (for edge, rho = − 0.815, R(2) = 0.676, p = 0.007, for vertex cover rho = − 0.793, R(2) = 0.635, p = 0.011). In the viral systems both edges and vertex cover were associated with acuteness of viral infections. In the JAK/STAT system already infected with coronavirus, maximum reduction in size was achieved with baricitinib. To conclude, algebraic and combinatorial invariant of a network may explain its biological behaviour. At least theoretically, baricitinib may be an attractive target for treatment of coronavirus infection.","Banerjee, Arindam; Goswami, Rudra Prosad; Chatterjee, Moumita",Sci Rep,143,1

In Saudi Arabia, many attempts have been made to raise public awareness about COVID-19 infection and precautionary health measures. However, most of the health information delivered through the national dashboard and the COVID-19 awareness campaigns are generic and do not necessarily make the impact needed to be seen on individuals’ behavior. Health messages need to be applicable and reverent to the individual in the audience. OBJECTIVE: In light of Fogg-Behavior model, this research aims to build and validate a behavior-change-based messaging campaign to promote precautionary health behavior in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention messages can then be targeted appropriately during the pandemic. METHODS: An initial library of 32 text-based and video-based messages were developed and validated based on Fogg behavior model for behavior change. Based on this model, three groups of messages were created to reflect the model’s three theoretical concepts of motivation, ability and triggers. Each group of messages is designed to target different segment of the audience. The content of the messages was developed based on resources from the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. The validity of this content was evaluated by domain experts through the content validity index. RESULTS: Fogg-behavior model was used to segment the audience into three different groups based on their perceived ability and motivation. The three groups of messages designed for those groups were found relevant to Fogg theoretical concepts. Thirteen professional health care workers (n = 13) evaluated the content of the message libraries in Arabic and English. Thirty-two messages were found to have acceptable content validity (I-CVI = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This research introduced Fogg Behavior Model as a behavior change model to develop targeted messages for three groups of the audience based on their motivation and ability level toward maintaining precautionary behavior during the pandemic. This targeted awareness messaging campaign can be utilized by health authorities to raise individuals' awareness about the precautionary measures that should be taken, maintain these measures and hence help in reducing the number of positive cases in the city of Jeddah.","Alrige, Mayda; Bitar, Hind; Meccawy, Maram",J Infect Public Health,143,1

Left unchecked, these emotional changes might have a wide array of adverse impacts. To reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions, we tested the effectiveness of reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy that modifies how one thinks about a situation. Participants from 87 countries and regions (n = 21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control conditions (active or passive). Results revealed that both reappraisal interventions (vesus both control conditions) consistently reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions across different measures. Reconstrual and repurposing interventions had similar effects. Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal interventions did not reduce intentions to practice preventive health behaviours.

Therefore, the regulation of cellular levels of 2-5A is a key point of control in antiviral innate immunity. Cellular 2-5A levels are determined by IFN-inducible 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) and by enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Importantly, many coronaviruses (CoVs) and rotaviruses encode 2-5A-degrading enzymes, thereby antagonizing RNase L and its antiviral effects. A-kinase-anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), a mammalian counterpart, could possibly limit tissue damage from excessive or prolonged RNase L activation during viral infections or from self-double-stranded RNAs that activate OAS. We show that these enzymes, members of the two-histidine phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily, constitute a subfamily referred here as 2′,5′-PEs. 2′,5′-PEs from the mouse CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (NS2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (NS4b), group A rotavirus (VP3), and mouse (AKAP7) were investigated for their evolutionary relationships and activities. While there was no activity against 3′,5′-oligoribonucleotides, they all cleaved 2′,5′-oligoadenylates efficiently but with variable activity against other 2′,5′-oligonucleotides. The 2′,5′-PEs are shown to be metal ion-independent enzymes that cleave trimer 2-5A (2′,5′-p(3)A(3)) producing mono- or diadenylates with 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini. Our results suggest that the elimination of 2-5A might be the sole function of viral 2′,5′-PEs, thereby promoting viral escape from innate immunity by preventing or limiting the activation of RNase L.","Asthana, Abhishek; Gaughan, Christina; Dong, Beihua; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.",mBio,143,16

However, few US population-based studies have assessed whether these patients are at increased risk of hospitalization or death due to COVID-19 compared with those without RD. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using national Veterans Affairs Health Care System data for individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Outcomes of interest were hospitalization or death due to any cause within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes were compared among veterans with RD and those without RD by using propensity score matching (PSM) and mixed-effects multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Of 26,116 veterans with COVID-19, 501 (1.9%) had an underlying RD. Prior to matching, patients with RD were more likely to have poor outcomes compared with controls (37.7% vs. 28.5% hospitalized; 6.4% vs. 4.5% died). In the PSM analysis, RD was not a significant predictor for poor outcomes; however, patients with prescriptions for glucocorticoids had increased odds of poor outcomes in a dose-dependent manner (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for hospitalization or death: 1.33 [1.20-1.48] for doses >0 and ≤10 mg/day; 1.29 [1.09-1.52] for doses >10 mg/day). CONCLUSION Among US veterans with COVID-19, we did not find a significant association between RD and hospitalization or death. Poor outcomes appear to be mostly driven by age and other comorbidities, similar to the general veteran population. However, we observed an increased risk for poor outcomes among patients who received glucocorticoids, even at daily doses less than or equal to 10 mg.","Schmajuk, Gabriela; Montgomery, Anna D; Leonard, Samuel; Li, Jing; Gianfrancesco, Milena; Seet, Andrea; Izadi, Zara; Yazdany, Jinoos; Keyhani, Salomeh",ACR open rheumatology,143,6

One group is that of nitric oxide increasing supplements, so-called “NO-boosters,” which are claimed to improve the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the muscle by enhancing vasodilation. The aim of this study was to investigate 3 of these supplements in healthy male athletes for their muscle perfusion-enhancing potential using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). METHODS: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized cross-over trial will be carried out at the Center for Orthopedics, Trauma Surgery and Spinal Cord Injury of the University Hospital Heidelberg. Three commercial NO enhancing products including 300 mg of the specific green tea extract VASO6 and a combination of 8 g L-citrulline malate and 3 g L-arginine hydrochloride will be examined for their potential to increase muscular perfusion in 30-male athletes between 18 and 40 years and will be compared with a placebo. On each of the 3 appointments CEUS of the dominant biceps muscle will be performed at rest and after a standardized resistance training. Every athlete receives each of the 3 supplements once after a wash-out period of at least 1 week. Perfusion will be quantified via VueBox quantification software. The results of CEUS perfusion measurements will be compared intra- and interindividually and correlated with clinical parameters. DISCUSSION: The results of this study may help to establish CEUS as a suitable imaging modality for the evaluation of potentially vasodilatory drugs in the field of sports. Other supplements could also be evaluated in this way to verify the content of their advertising claims.

Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic, which renders neuronal tissue vulnerable to infection, especially in elderly individuals or in those with neuro-comorbid conditions. Complaints of ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, and headache; reports of diseases such as stroke, encephalopathy, seizure, and encephalitis; and loss of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 confirm the neuropathophysiological aspect of this disease. The brain is linked to pulmonary organs, physiologically through blood circulation, and functionally through the nervous system. The interdependence of these vital organs may further aggravate the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19. The induction of a cytokine storm in systemic circulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory cascade, which can subsequently compromise the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, thereby leading to neuronal tissue damage. Hence, a holistic approach should be adopted by healthcare professionals while treating COVID-19 patients with a history of neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychological complications, or any other neuro-compromised conditions. Imperatively, vaccines are being developed at top priority to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and different vaccines are at different stages of development globally. This review discusses the concerns regarding the neuronal complications of COVID-19 and the possible mechanisms of amelioration.","Kumar, Dipak; Jahan, Sadaf; Khan, Andleeb; Siddiqui, Arif Jamal; Redhu, Neeru Singh; Wahajuddin; Khan, Johra; Banwas, Saeed; Alshehri, Bader; Alaidarous, Mohammed",Mol Neurobiol,143,1
