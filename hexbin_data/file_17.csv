17,17,17,Logistics of community smallpox control through contact tracing and ring vaccination: a stochastic network model,19.413767,1.2066925,2004-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Previous smallpox ring vaccination models based on contact tracing over a network suggest that ring vaccination would be effective, but have not explicitly included response logistics and limited numbers of vaccinators. METHODS: We developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission, including network structure, post-exposure vaccination, vaccination of contacts of contacts, limited response capacity, heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness, vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness, surveillance of asymptomatic contacts, and isolation of cases. RESULTS: We found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox, ring vaccination (when coupled with surveillance) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly, assuming that 95% of household contacts are traced, 80% of workplace or social contacts are traced, and no casual contacts are traced, and that in most cases the ability to trace 1–5 individuals per day per index case is sufficient. If smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts, it may at times escape containment by ring vaccination, but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Small introductions of smallpox are likely to be easily contained by ring vaccination, provided contact tracing is feasible. Uncertainties in the nature of bioterrorist smallpox (infectiousness, vaccine efficacy) support continued planning for ring vaccination as well as mass vaccination. If initiated, ring vaccination should be conducted without delays in vaccination, should include contacts of contacts (whenever there is sufficient capacity) and should be accompanied by increased public awareness and surveillance.","Porco, Travis C; Holbrook, Karen A; Fernyak, Susan E; Portnoy, Diane L; Reiter, Randy; Aragón, Tomás J",BMC Public Health,17,30
31,31,31,Australian public health policy in 2003 – 2004,19.545464,1.1544338,2005-04-06,"In Australia, compared with other developed countries the many and varied programs which comprise public health have continued to be funded poorly and unsystematically, particularly given the amount of publicly voiced political support. In 2003, the major public health policy developments in communicable disease control were in the fields of SARS, and vaccine funding, whilst the TGA was focused on the Pan Pharmaceutical crisis. Programs directed to health maintenance and healthy ageing were approved. The tertiary education sector was involved in the development of programs for training the public health workforce and new professional qualifications and competencies. The Abelson Report received support from overseas experts, providing a potential platform for calls to improve national funding for future Australian preventive programs; however, inconsistencies continued across all jurisdictions in their approaches to tackling national health priorities. Despite 2004 being an election year, public health policy was not visible, with the bulk of the public health funding available in the 2004/05 federal budget allocated to managing such emerging risks as avian flu. We conclude by suggesting several implications for the future.","Lin, Vivian; Robinson, Priscilla",Aust New Zealand Health Policy,17,30

602,602,602,Strengthening systems for communicable disease surveillance: creating a laboratory network in Rwanda,19.551662,1.5386258,2011-06-24,"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of a novel strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential underscores the need for quality surveillance and laboratory services to contribute to the timely detection and confirmation of public health threats. To provide a framework for strengthening disease surveillance and response capacities in African countries, the World Health Organization Regional Headquarters for Africa (AFRO) developed Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) aimed at improving national surveillance and laboratory systems. IDSR emphasizes the linkage of information provided by public health laboratories to the selection of relevant, appropriate and effective public health responses to disease outbreaks. METHODS: We reviewed the development of Rwanda's National Reference Laboratory (NRL) to understand essential structures involved in creating a national public health laboratory network. We reviewed documents describing the NRL's organization and record of test results, conducted site visits, and interviewed health staff in the Ministry of Health and in partner agencies. Findings were developed by organizing thematic categories and grouping examples within them. We purposefully sought to identify success factors as well as challenges inherent in developing a national public health laboratory system. RESULTS: Among the identified success factors were: a structured governing framework for public health surveillance; political commitment to promote leadership for stronger laboratory capacities in Rwanda; defined roles and responsibilities for each level; coordinated approaches between technical and funding partners; collaboration with external laboratories; and use of performance results in advocacy with national stakeholders. Major challenges involved general infrastructure, human resources, and budgetary constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Rwanda's experience with collaborative partnerships contributed to creation of a functional public health laboratory network.","Kebede, Senait; Gatabazi, John B; Rugimbanya, Pierre; Mukankwiro, Therese; Perry, Helen N; Alemu, Wondimagegnehu; Ndihokubwayo, Jean B; Kramer, Michael H; Mukabayire, Odette",Health Res Policy Syst,17,5
1738,1738,1738,Why language matters: insights and challenges in applying a social determination of health approach in a North-South collaborative research program,19.756243,1.2806481,2015-02-27,"BACKGROUND: Focus on “social determinants of health” provides a welcome alternative to the bio-medical illness paradigm. However, the tendency to concentrate on the influence of “risk factors” related to living and working conditions of individuals, rather than to more broadly examine dynamics of the social processes that affect population health, has triggered critical reaction not only from the Global North but especially from voices the Global South where there is a long history of addressing questions of health equity. In this article, we elaborate on how focusing instead on the language of “social determination of health” has prompted us to attempt to apply a more equity-sensitive approaches to research and related policy and praxis. DISCUSSION: In this debate, we briefly explore the epistemological and historical roots of epidemiological approaches to health and health equity that have emerged in Latin America to consider its relevance to global discourse. In this region marked by pronounced inequity, context-sensitive concepts such as “collective health” and “critical epidemiology” have been prominent, albeit with limited acknowledgement by the Global North. We illustrate our attempts to apply a social determination approach (and the “4 S” elements of bio-Security, Sovereignty, Solidarity and Sustainability) in five projects within our research collaboration linking researchers and knowledge users in Ecuador and Canada, in diverse settings (health of healthcare workers; food systems; antibiotic resistance; vector borne disease [dengue]; and social circus with street youth). CONCLUSIONS: We argue that the language of social determinants lends itself to research that is more reductionist and beckons the development of different skills than would be applied when adopting the language of social determination. We conclude that this language leads to more direct analysis of the systemic factors that drive, promote and reinforce disparities, while at the same time directly considering the emancipatory forces capable of countering negative health impacts. It follows that “reverse innovation” must not only recognize practical solutions being developed in low and middle income countries, but must also build on the strengths of the theoretical-methodological reasoning that has emerged in the South.","Spiegel, Jerry M; Breilh, Jaime; Yassi, Annalee",Global Health,17,5

2484,2484,2484,"In the eye of the beholder: to make global health estimates useful, make them more socially robust",19.760351,1.2361724,2017-05-22,"A plethora of new development goals and funding institutions have greatly increased the demand for internationally comparable health estimates in recent years, and have brought important new players into the field of health estimate production. These changes have rekindled debates about the validity and legitimacy of global health estimates. This paper draws on country case studies and personal experience to support our opinion that the production and use of estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political and ideational contexts, which differ at different levels of the global health architecture. Broadly, most global health estimates tend to be made far from the local contexts in which the data upon which they are based are collected, and where the results of estimation processes must ultimately be used if they are to make a difference to the health of individuals. Internationally standardised indicators are necessary, but they are no substitute for data that meet local needs, and that fit with local ideas of what is credible and useful. In other words, data that are both technically and socially robust for those who make key decisions about health. We suggest that greater engagement of local actors (and local data) in the formulation, communication and interpretation of health estimates would increase the likelihood that these data will be used by those most able to translate them into health gains for the longer term. Besides strengthening national information systems, this requires ongoing interaction, building trust and establishing a communicative infrastructure. Local capacities to use knowledge to improve health must be supported.","Pisani, Elizabeth; Kok, Maarten",Glob Health Action,17,5

We evaluated characteristics of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak to elucidate lessons learned for managing transnational public health security threats. METHODS: We used publically available data to compare demographic and outbreak-specific data for Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, including key indicator data by the World Health Organization. Pearson correlation statistics were calculated to compare country-level infrastructure characteristics with outbreak size and duration. RESULTS: Hospital bed density was inversely correlated with longer EVD outbreak duration (r = − 0.99). Country-specific funding amount allocations were more likely associated with number of incident cases than the population at-risk or infrastructure needs. Key indicators demonstrating challenges for Guinea included: number of unsafe burials, percent of EVD-positive samples, and days between symptom onset and case hospitalization. Sierra Leone’s primary key indicator was the number of districts with ≥1 security incident. Liberia controlled their outbreak before much of the key-indicator data were collected. CONCLUSION: Many of the country-level factors, particularly the WHO key indicators were associated with controlling the epidemic. The infrastructure of countries affected by communicable diseases should be assessed by international political and public health leaders.","Wendelboe, Aaron M.; McCumber, Micah; Erb-Alvarez, Julie; Mould, Nicholas; Childs, Richard W.; Regens, James L.",Global Health,17,30

4354,4354,4354,Is countries’ transparency associated with gaps between countries’ self and external evaluations for IHR core capacity?,19.357151,1.1541197,2020-01-20,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the gap between countries’ self-evaluation and external evaluation regarding core capacity of infectious disease control required by International Health Regulations and the influence factors of the gap. METHODS: We collected countries’ self-evaluated scores (International Health Regulations Monitoring tool, IHRMT) of 2016 and 2017, and external evaluation scores (Joint External Evaluation, JEE) from WHO website on 4rd and 27rd November, 2018. There were 127 and 163 countries with IHRMT scores in 2016 and in 2017, and 74 countries with JEE scores included in the analysis. The gap between countries’ self-evaluation and external evaluation was represented by the difference between condensed IHR scores and JEE. Civil liberties (CL) scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index (HDI) and data indicating the density of physicians and nurses (HWD) were collected to reflect countries’ development and health workforce statuses. Then, chi-square test and logistic regression were performed to determine the correlation between the gap of IHRMT and JEE, and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status. RESULTS: Countries’ self-evaluation scores significantly decreased from 2016 to 2017. Countries’ external evaluation scores are consistently 1 to 1.5 lower than self-evaluation scores. There were significantly more countries with high HDI status, high CL status and high HWD status in groups with bigger gap between IHRMT and JEE. And countries with higher HDI status presented a higher risk of having bigger gap between countries’ self and external scores (OR = 3.181). CONCLUSION: Our study result indicated that countries’ transparency represented by CL status do play a role in the gap between IHR and JEE scores. But HDI status is the key factor which significantly associated with the gap. The main reason for the gap in the current world is the different interpretation of evaluation of high HDI countries, though low CL countries tended to over-scored their capacity.","Tsai, Feng-Jen; Turbat, Battsetseg",Global Health,17,5

Although its etiology is as yet unknown current evidence suggests that tissue damage is mediated by autoimmune T cells. The examination of an experimental animal model for MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), has demonstrated that myelin basic protein (MBP)- or proteolipid protein (PLP)-specific T cells mediate the destruction of CNS myelin. In recent years, elegant studies in EAE have shown that encephalitogenic T cells recognize short peptides of MBP or PLP in the context of MHC/HLA-class II molecules, express a restricted number of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules and secrete interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-a/β. Understanding the pathogenetic steps in lesion development at the molecular level led to highly specific immunotherapies for EAE targeting each individual molecule. It has been the hope of many investigators that immunological events resembling those in EAE can be found in patients with MS and that the specific immunotherapies effective in EAE could also be applied to MS. However, to date, the evidence for a unique immunological abnormality in MS is notstrong. Although MBP- and PLP-specific T cells with properties similar to those that are encephalitogenic in animals can be isolated from patients, they are not specific for MS and occur with similar frequency in controls. In addition, the variability in specificity and TCR usage has raised questions regarding the relevance of these cells in patients. The importance of the T cell responses to myelin antigens in MS may not be established until the effects of abrogating their activity through specific therapies targeting the trimolecular complex (TMC) have been demonstrated. Consequently, attention has begun to focus on modifying the biology of the MS lesion rather than targeting the initiating event at the level of the TMC, and the success of this approach is reflected by the effect of interferon-β on lesion development in MS. The recent approval for the use of interferon-β for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS has raised great interest in examining novel strategies for immunotherapies in MS. The basic concepts as well as the current candidates for such new immunotherapies will be outlined in this short review.","Martin, Roland; McFarland, Henry",Springer Semin Immunopathol,17,1

Evidence suggests that atopic individuals may be predisposed to more severe rhinoviral colds coupled to a worsening of existing airway disease than those with asthma. The role of atopy and IgE levels, as well as their relationship to clinical disease expression have not been defined. We hypothesized that an allergic diathesis modulates rhinoviral colds and have initiated studies of normal, atopic and asthmatic subjects employing experimental rhinoviral infection, with measurements of symptom scores, viral shedding and cultures, albumin in nasal washes and serological responses. Twenty‐two subjects (11 normal, 5 atopic, 6 atopic and asthmatic) participated and were inoculated with human rhinovirus serotype 16 (HRV 16). Measurements of neutralizing antibody and viral culture were performed at screening, pre‐inoculation, during the cold and at 8–10 weeks convalescence. Daily symptoms were noted, nasal washes done, IgE measured and atopy was diagnosed by skin tests. Seventeen volunteers developed clinical colds as assessed by symptom scores, virus shedding was demonstrated (with positive culture) in all subjects and a fourfold or higher seroconversion occurred in 11/22. Neutralizing HRV antibody developed unexpectedly in 10 subjects between screening and inoculation and the presence or absence of this pre‐inoculation antibody determined subsequent severity of colds in normal but not in atopic subjects. Atopic antibody positive individuals developed severe clinical colds that were independent of preinoculation antibody in contrast to normal subjects who developed mild colds in the presence of a neutralizing antibody (.P= 0.01). Both atopic and normal antibody negative subjects developed severe colds. This differential response was matched by nasal wash albumin levels which were significantly increased (P= 0–01) during the cold in atopic (but not in normal) volunteers with pre‐inoculation antibody. Levels of IgE were not correlated with severity of clinical disease or viral shedding. Our studies of HRV disease in atopic subjects suggest heightened susceptibility to the detrimental effects of colds; additional studies are needed to clarify the relevant mechanisms.","BARDIN, P.

All piglets inoculated by the combined oral — nasal route (16) or into the infraorbital nerve (3) became sick after an incubation period of 5 days. Six of the 7 pigs inoculated into the stomach wall, 6 of the 8 pigs inoculated intramuscularly and 3 of the 5 pigs inoculated intracerebrally became ill after an incubation period of 3–3.5 days. None of the pigs inoculated either intravenously or into the abdominal cavity or into the stomach lumen became sick. All diseased pigs showed the vomiting and wasting syndrome. In oronasally inoculated pigs, killed during the early stages of disease, the virus was reisolated consistently from the tonsils and respiratory tract but irregularly from the pons + medulla and the stomach wall. Pigs inoculated by other routes were positive for virus when sick. All except one of the pigs which remained healthy had seroconverted. The site of virus replication which gives rise to the vomition could not be determined. It was concluded from the present studies that virus spread within the body occurs along nerve pathways. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Pathogenität von hämagglutinierendem Enzephalomyelitis‐Virus (Kümmern und Erbrechen) bei Shweinen nach Infektion über vershiedene Inokulationswege Achtundvierzig Schweine wurden übegr verschiedene Inokulationswege mit dem VW 572‐Isolat des hämagglutinierendtn Enzephalomyelitis‐Virus (Kümmern und Erbrechen) infiziert. Alle Schweine, die entweder kombiniert oro‐nasal (16) oder über den Infraorbitalnerv (3) infiziert wurden, erkrankten nach einer Inkubationszeit von 5 Tagen. Sechs der sieben über die Magenwand inokulierten, 6 oder 8 intramuskulär und 3 der 5 intrazerebral infizierten Tiere wurden nach einer Inkubationszeit von 3–3,5 Tagen krank. Bei den Schweinen, die intravenös oder in die Bauchhöhle bzw. direkt in den Magen inokuliert wurden, kamen Erkrankungsfälle nicht vor. Alle erkrankten Schweine zeigten das Syndrom des Kümmerns und Erbrechens. Von oro‐nasal infizierten Schweinen, die während des Frühstadiums der Erkrankung getötet wurden, konnte das Virus regelmäßig von den Tonsillen und dem Respirationstrakt und gelegentlich vom Gewebe des Pons‐Medulla‐Bereiches sowie aus der Magenwand reisoliert werden. Von Schweinen, die nach Infektion über andere Routen erkrankten, ließ sich immer Virus isolieren. Alle Tiere, die nicht erkrankten (mit Ausnahme eines Ferkels) bildeten jedoch Antikörper. Der Ort der Virusvermehrung, mit dem das Erbrechen zusammenhängt, ließ sich nicht ermitteln.

RÉSUMÉ: Pathogénicité du virus hémagglutinant de l'encéphalomyélite du porc (dépérissement et vomissement) après infection par différents modes d'inoculation 48 porcs ont été infectés selon différents procédés d'inoculation avec l'isolement VW 572 du virus hémagglutinant de l'encéphalomyélite (dépérissement et vomissement). Tous les porcs infectés soit par la voie combinée oronasale (16) soit par le nerf infraorbital (3) tombèrent malades après une incubation de 5 jours. 6 des 7 animaux infectés par la paroi stomacale, 6 des 8 par voie intramusculaire et 3 des 5 intracérébralement tombèrent malades après un temps d'incubation de 3–3,5 jours. Il n'y a pas eu de maladie chez les porcs inoculés par voie intraveineuse, dans l'abdomen ou directement dans l'estomac. Tous les porcs malades ont présenté le syndrome de dépérissement et de vomissement. Chez les animaux infectés par voie oro‐nasale et sacrifiés au début de la maladie, on a pu régulièrement réisoler le virus à partir des amygdales et de l'appareil respiratoire, parfois du tissu de la région «Pons‐Medulla» et de la paroi stomacale. Le virus a toujours été isolé chez les porcs tombés malades après un mode d'infection différent. Tous les animaux qui ne furent pas malades (à l'exception d'un porcelet) formèrent des anticorps. L'endroit de multiplication du virus lié au syndrome de vomissement n'a pas été déterminé. Les résultats de ces essais permettent de conclure que la propagation du virus dans le corps se fait par voie nerveuse. RESUMEN: La patogeneidad del virus hemoaglutinante de la encéfalomielitis (hipotrepsia y vómitos) en el cerdo tras infección a través de vías diversas de inoculación Se infectaron cuarenta y ocho cerdos a través de diferentes vías de inoculación con el aislamiento VW 572 del virus hemoaglutinante de la encéfalomielitis (hipotrepsia y vómitos). Todos los cerdos infectados bien con arreglo al procedimiento combinado buco‐nasal (16) o bien a través del nervio infraorbitario (3) enfermaron tras un tiempo de incubación de 5 días. Seis de siete animales inoculados a través de la pared gástrica, 6 de 8 por vía intramuscular y 3 de 5 por vía intracerebral enfermaron tras un tiempo de incubación de 3–3,5 días. No se registraron casos de enfermedad en los cerdos inoculados por vía intravenosa o en la cavidad abdominal resp. directamente en el estómago. Todos los cerdos que enfermaron presentaban el síndrome de hipotrepsia y vómitos. De los cerdos infectados por vía buco‐nasal, que se sacrificaron durante el estadio precoz de la enfermedad, se pudo reaislar el virus con regularidad de las tonsilas y del tracto respiratorio y, en ocasiones, del tejido correspondiente al ámbito puente de Varolio‐medula, así como de la pared gástrica. Se logró siempre aislar virus de cerdos que enfermaron tras infección por otras vías. Sin embargo, todos los animales que no enfermaron (excepción hecha por un lechón) produjeron anticuerpos. No se logró descubrir el lugar en donde se multiplicaba el virus, hecho relacionado con los vómitos. Los resultados de los estudios presentados permiten llegar a la conclusión de que la propagación del virus en el organismo acontece a través de las vías nerviosas.","Andries, K.; Pensaert, M.; Callebaut, P.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,17,30

In this context, the marine brown seaweed Canistrocarpus cervicornis has been proved to hold great antiviral potential. Hence, the aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-ZIKV and anti-CHIKV activity of a marine dolastane isolated from brown seaweed C. cervicornis and its crude extract. Vero cells were used in antiviral assays, submitted to ZIKV and CHIKV, and treated with different concentrations of C. cervicornis extract or dolastane. The crude extract of C. cervicornis showed inhibitory activities for both ZIKV and CHIKV, with EC(50) values of 3.3 μg/mL and 3.1 μg/mL, respectively. However, the isolated dolastane showed a more significant and promising inhibitory effect (EC(50) = 0.95 µM for ZIKV and 1.3 µM for CHIKV) when compared to both the crude extract and ribavirin, which was used as control. Also, the dolastane showed a very potent virucidal activity against CHIKV and was able to inhibit around 90% of the virus infectivity at 10 μM. For the ZIKV, the effects were somewhat lower, although interesting, at approximately 64% in this same concentration. Further, we observed that both the extract and the dolastane were able to inhibit the replication of ZIKV and CHIKV at different times of addition post-infection, remaining efficient even if added after 8 hours post-infection, but declining soon after. A synergistic effect using sub-doses of the extract and isolates was associated with ribavirin, inhibiting above 80% replication even at the lowest concentrations. Therefore, this work has unveiled the anti-ZIKV and CHIKV potential of C. cervicornis crude extract and an isolated dolastane, which, in turn, can be used as a preventive or therapeutic strategy in the future.","Cirne-Santos, Claudio Cesar; de Souza Barros, Caroline; de Oliveira, Mariana Cavalcante; Rabelo, Vitor Won-Held; Azevedo, Renata Campos; Teixeira, Valeria Laneuville; Ferreira, Davis Fernandes; de Palmer Paixão, Izabel Christina Nunes",Sci Rep,17,3

Previous studies showed positive results on accuracy, effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility, but also found some ineffective implementations. In this paper, we assessed the effect of implementation of EMMs on treatment outcomes. METHODS: The longitudinal ecological method was used at the county level with aggregate secondary programmatic data. All the notified TB cases in 138 counties were involved in this study from April 2017 to June 2019, and rifampicin-resistant cases were excluded. We fitted a multilevel model to assess the relative change in the quarterly treatment success rate with increasing quarterly EMM coverage rate, in which a mixed effects maximum likelihood regression using random intercept model was applied, by adjusting for seasonal trends, population size, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and clustering within counties. RESULTS: Among all 69 678 notified TB cases, the treatment success rate was slightly increased from 93.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 93.0–94.0] in second quarter of 2018 to 94.9% (95% CI: 94.4–95.4) in second quarter of 2019 after implementing EMMs. There was a statistically significant effect between quarterly EMM coverage and treatment success rate after adjusting for potential confounders (P = 0.0036), increasing 10% of EMM coverage rate will lead to 0.2% treatment success rate augment. Besides, an increase of 10% of elderly or bacteriologically confirmed TB will lead to a decrease of 0.4% and 0.9% of the treatment success rate. CONCLUSIONS: Under programmatic settings, we found a statistically significant effect between increasing coverage of EMM and treatment success rate at the county level. More prospective studies are needed to confirm the effect of using EMM on TB treatment outcomes. We suggest performing operational research on EMMs that provides real-time data under programmatic conditions in the future.

We demonstrated the highly sensitive and multiplexed one-step RT-qPCR platform for RNA analysis using microparticles as individual reactors. Those particles are equipped with a controlled release system of thermo-responsive materials, and are able to capture RNA targets inside. The particle-based assay can successfully quantify multiple target RNAs from only 200 pg of total RNA. The assay can also quantify target RNAs from a single cell with the aid of a pre-concentration process. We carried out 8-plex one-step RT-qPCR using tens of microparticles, which allowed extensive mRNA profiling. The circadian cycles were shown by the multiplex one-step RT-qPCR in human cell and human hair follicles. Reliable 24-plex one-step RT-qPCR was developed using a single operation in a PCR chip without any loss of performance (i.e., selectivity and sensitivity), even from a single hair. Many other disease-related transcripts can be monitored using this versatile platform. It can also be used non–invasively for samples obtained in clinics.","Kim, Mi Yeon; Jung, Seungwon; Kim, Junsun; Lee, Heon Jeong; Jeong, Seunghwa; Sim, Sang Jun; Kim, Sang Kyung",Sci Rep,17,17

Existing computational methods to generate 3D atlases from 2D-derived atlases result in extensive artifacts, while manual curation approaches are labor-intensive. We present a computational approach for 3D atlas construction that substantially reduces artifacts by identifying anatomical boundaries in the underlying imaging data and using these to guide 3D transformation. Anatomical boundaries also allow extension of atlases to complete edge regions. Applying these methods to the eight developmental stages in the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (ADMBA) led to more comprehensive and accurate atlases. We generated imaging data from 15 whole mouse brains to validate atlas performance and observed qualitative and quantitative improvement (37% greater alignment between atlas and anatomical boundaries). We provide the pipeline as the MagellanMapper software and the eight 3D reconstructed ADMBA atlases. These resources facilitate whole-organ quantitative analysis between samples and across development.","Young, David M; Fazel Darbandi, Siavash; Schwartz, Grace; Bonzell, Zachary; Yuruk, Deniz; Nojima, Mai; Gole, Laurent C; Rubenstein, John LR; Yu, Weimiao; Sanders, Stephan J",,17,5

Ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMAI) uses mobile technology to gather data and deliver timely, personalized behavior change interventions in an individual’s natural setting. To our knowledge, there have been no previous trials of EMAI in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To advance the evidence base for mobile health (mHealth) interventions in LMICs, we conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility of EMAI and establish estimates of the potential effect of EMAI on a range of health-related behaviors in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS: This prospective, parallel-group, randomized pilot trial compared health behaviors between adult participants submitting ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data and receiving behaviorally responsive interventional health messaging (EMAI) with those submitting EMA data alone. Using a fully automated mobile phone app, participants submitted daily reports on 5 different health behaviors (fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and condomless sex with a non–long-term partner) during a 30-day period before randomization (P1). Participants were then block randomized to the control arm, continuing EMA reporting through exit, or the intervention arm, EMA reporting and behavioral health messaging receipt. Participants exited after 90 days of follow-up, divided into study periods 2 (P2: randomization + 29 days) and 3 (P3: 30 days postrandomization to exit). We used descriptive statistics to assess the feasibility of EMAI through the completeness of data and differences in reported behaviors between periods and study arms. RESULTS: The study included 48 participants (24 per arm; 23/48, 48% women; median age 31 years). EMA data collection was feasible, with 85.5% (3777/4418) of the combined days reporting behavioral data. There was a decrease in the mean proportion of days when alcohol was consumed in both arms over time (control: P1, 9.6% of days to P2, 4.3% of days; intervention: P1, 7.2% of days to P3, 2.4% of days). Decreases in sex with a non–long-term partner without a condom were also reported in both arms (P1 to P3 control: 1.9% of days to 1% of days; intervention: 6.6% of days to 1.3% of days). An increase in vegetable consumption was found in the intervention (vegetable: 65.6% of days to 76.6% of days) but not in the control arm. Between arms, there was a significant difference in the change in reported vegetable consumption between P1 and P3 (control: 8% decrease in the mean proportion of days vegetables consumed; intervention: 11.1% increase; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary estimates suggest that EMAI may be a promising strategy for promoting behavior change across a range of behaviors. Larger trials examining the effectiveness of EMAI in LMICs are warranted.

Generally, interest has been in the ability of vaccination to prevent or to ameliorate disease rather than to prevent infection (Clements-Mann 1998). Ascertainment of cases is often done by finding suspected cases in the population under study in people who exhibit a set of symptoms. The suspected cases are then tested for biological confirmation of the infectious agent of interest. Alternatively, surveillance can ascertain cases reported in central registries. However they are ascertained, with most vaccines, clinical disease is the primary outcome of interest. When ascertainment is on clinical cases, most asymptomatic infections may go undetected. A different situation arises when infection is the primary outcome. To ascertain infections in asymptomatic people, an active follow-up method of testing asymptomatic people is needed. In this chapter we consider estimation and inference for direct protective effects of vaccination, VE(S) and VE(SP), in studies that do not condition on exposure to infection.We consider aspects of the design of such studies. Several examples of randomized, double-blind (double-masked) controlled vaccine trials illustrate the standard approach to design and analysis of such studies. Our choice of studies to present was motivated largely because of their use as illustrations in other sections of the book. Most randomized and pivotal studies of vaccines have been based on VE(SP) or VE(S). Much has been written on studies to meet the approval of the regulatory agencies, and the design of clinical trials generally. Our goal here is to consider how VE(S) and VE(SP) relate to other measures of vaccine effects within the dependent happening context, and consider a few design considerations. Because VE(S) and VE(SP) do not condition on exposure to infection, assumptions about the relative exposure opportunity in the vaccine and control groups are important.","Halloran, M.

While the operating and anesthesiology teams are engaged in maintaining the vital signs and controlling blood loss of the injured, the transfusion service representatives follow the information on the amount of blood products given and the latest laboratory tests, as well as provide consultations regarding further blood component requirements on the basis of data obtained. A major effort of the treating team should be aimed at diagnosis and correction of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia. For the massively bleeding combat trauma injured, which can amount to as high as 8% of all trauma patients, a generous use of plasma at a one-to-one ratio with packed cells, along with the early addition of platelets and cryoprecipitates, should be considered. Early point-of-care thromboelastography is helpful for identification of coagulopathies. The use of a preset massive transfusion protocol is beneficial; however, it should be tailored according to the patient’s actual needs, depending on the type of injury and the individual’s general condition.","Dann, Eldad J.",Armed Conflict Injuries to the Extremities,17,5

Thus, although their origins are as separate as a virus and the self-determinant of a human or lower animal, two molecules' linear amino acid sequences or their conformational fits may be shared. Such molecular homologies between proteins occur frequently and likely play roles in the processing of viral proteins inside cells. The homologies shared between viruses and host cytoskeletal proteins likely indicate that shared determinants on cell linker proteins guided viral proteins along highways and stop points inside cells. Most importantly, these unexpected cross-reactivities have broad and major implications for understanding autoimmune disease. Molecular mimicry is detected either by using humoral or cellular immune components, that cross-react with two presumably unrelated protein structures, or by computer searches to match descriptions of proteins in storage banks. The use of both these approaches to define molecular mimicry and establish its potential role in autoimmune disease is the topic of this chapter.","Oldstone, Michael B.A.; Schwimmbeck, Peter; Dyrberg, Thomas; Fujinami, Robert",Progress in Immunology,17,5

In PDBFO, the step size of bacteria is segmented and adjusted in accordance with fitness value to accelerate convergence and enhance the search capability. Moreover, the differential operator and the Poisson Distribution strategy are incorporated to enrich individual diversity, which prevents algorithm from being trapped in the local optimum. Experimental simulations on eleven benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed PDBFO has better convergence behavior in comparison to other six algorithms. Additionally, to verify the effectiveness of the method in solving the real-world complex problems, the PDBFO is also applied to the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP).

The core elements building the innovativeness of the concept of this educational initiative are analyzed. First, it is the complementarity of expertise which shapes a teachers’ learning community’. Second, it is the active involvement of students achieved through preselection of motivated participants, coaching, and an individual and group work. Third, it is a creation of a safety feeling among participants to increase the mutual trust and intensive interactions among students. Forth, it is the co-opetition among students collaborating but also competing with the group-project presentations. Fifth, it is the pre-school preparation of students to achieve a minimal level of common knowledge of related concepts and techniques. The limitations of the EESS model are: (1) the international team of teachers, (2) the geographical dispersion which negatively contributes to the students’ pre-school learning community, (3) the volunteering activity of the organizers and teaching staff, which is limited by their main workload, (4) the financial model which does not allow to become sustainable without a support of the participating universities.","Chepurenko, Alexander; Belousova, Olga; Groen, Aard",Entrep Educ,17,30

However, AM is not only about new production equipment and processes. Given the decreasing degree of vertical integration in many companies, suppliers add significant value to the finished product. AM might lead to the redesign of production networks, including a scenario in which the buyer uses AM to produce parts with data provided by suppliers. Overall, AM could have a major impact on the ways in which buyers and suppliers collaborate in the future. Nevertheless, research on AM in the field of industrial procurement remains scarce. This is surprising, given that AM is not only changing traditional procurement categories and creating new ones (comprising printers, powder raw materials, data and the associated engineering services) but AM’s widely discussed potential for decentralisation might also restructure the logistical aspects (transport, stocks) of supply chains. In addition, AM may resurrect the old procurement question of ‘make or buy’. Current research focuses on the logistical aspects of AM and concerns such issues of decentralisation (such as the diminishing need for transportation and the design of transport networks). In contrast, this research addresses the question of whether AM demands new answers to strategic sourcing questions. For this purpose, academic journal literature concerning procurement and AM search strings is reviewed. Selected articles are analysed using a fine-grained analytical framework of procurement strategies. The findings show that existing research lacks theoretical approaches and a systematic view of the topic.

The results showed that E. faecium R1 had the characteristics of effective bacteriostatic activity, acid resistance, bile salt resistance, and high-temperature resistance. Dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 (6.5 × 10(6) CFU/g) improved intestinal function of weaning piglets by decreasing diarrhea incidence. Further research found that dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 (6.5 × 10(6) CFU/g) attenuated intestinal and liver injury in piglets challenged by lipopolysaccharide. ABSTRACT: In this study, a strain of E. faecium R1 with effective bacteriostatic activity, acid resistance, bile salt resistance, high-temperature resistance was screened. To study the effect of E. faecium R1 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal and liver injury in piglets, twenty-four weaned female piglets were randomly assigned into one of three groups (8 piglets per group). Piglets in the control group and LPS group were fed a basal diet, piglets in the E. faecium group were fed the basal diet supplemented with E. faecium R1 (6.5 × 10(6) CFU/g). On day 21 of the trial, piglets in the LPS group and E. faecium group were intraperitoneally administered LPS (100 μg/kg), piglets in the control group were administered the same volume of saline. Subsequently, blood samples were collected at 3 h, and intestinal, liver, and pancreas samples were collected at 6 h. Results showed that E. faecium R1 supplementation significantly decreased the diarrhea rate and feed to gain ratio, and dramatically reduced LPS-induced intestinal and liver injury in piglets. Compared with the LPS group, E. faecium R1 supplementation significantly increased the content of glucagon in plasma and IL-1β in the liver, and the mRNA levels of villin in jejunum and ileum and Bcl-xL and pBD-L in the ileum, and significantly decreased the contents of prostaglandin 2 and malondialdehyde in the liver and the activities of myeloperoxidase and aspartate aminotransferase in plasma in piglets. Moreover, E. faecium R1 improved the pancreatic antioxidant capacity in piglets, which was indicated by a significant increase in catalase activity and a decrease in total nitric oxide synthase activity. In summary, dietary supplementation with E. faecium R1 alleviates intestinal and liver injury in LPS-challenged piglets.","Zhang, Yanyan; Wu, Tao; Chen, Zhenqiang; Meng, Yuxuan; Zhu, Zhekun; Wang, Qian; Tian, Junjie; Yi, Dan; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Di; Hou, Yongqing",Animals (Basel),17,24

This paper was set out to explore the challenges faced by different frontline workers in health and social care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research utilized an explorative qualitative approach. A total of forty (N = 40) in-depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HSCFW who included support workers (n = 15), nurses (n = 15), and managers (N = 10). Health and social care workers were drawn from domiciliary care and care homes (with and without nursing services). All the interviews were done online. The data were thematically analyzed, and the emergent themes were supported by quotes from the interviews held with participants. Following data analysis the research study found that lack of pandemic preparedness, shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), anxiety and fear amongst professionals, challenges in enforcing social distancing, challenges in fulfilling social shielding responsibility, anxiety and fear amongst residents and service users, delay in testing, evolving PPE guidance and shortage of staff were challenges faced by frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the current study point to a need for adequate pandemic preparedness within the health and social care sector to protect both frontline workers and the individuals they look after.","Nyashanu, Mathew; Pfende, Farai; Ekpenyong, Mandu",Journal of interprofessional care,17,27

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) may imply fetal hypoxia, resulting in blood flow centralization in favour of vital organs (brain, heart, adrenals--""brain sparing effect""). Based on the latter, we hypothesized that cord blood IMA levels should not differ between IUGR and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) full-term pregnancies. IMA was measured in blood samples from doubly-clamped umbilical cords of 110 AGA and 57 asymmetric IUGR pregnancies. No significant differences in IMA levels were documented between AGA and IUGR groups. IMA levels were elevated in cases of elective cesarean section (P = .035), and offspring of multigravidas (P = .021). In conclusion, ""brain sparing effect"" is possibly responsible for the lack of differences in cord blood IMA levels at term, between IUGR and AGA groups. Furthermore, higher oxidative stress could account for the elevated IMA levels in cases of elective cesarean section, and offspring of multigravidas.","Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Briana, Despina D; Boutsikou, Maria; Liosi, Sophia; Baka, Stavroula; Boutsikou, Theodora; Hassiakos, Demetrios; Malamitsi-Puchner, Ariadne",Mediators of inflammation,17,1

AIMS We sought to summarize the existing evidence regarding the frequency and predictors of cancer after an ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW We searched seven databases from January 1980 to September 2019 for articles reporting malignant tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms diagnosed after an ischemic stroke (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42019132455). We screened 15,400 records and included 51 articles. The pooled cumulative incidence of cancer within one year after an ischemic stroke was 13.6 per thousand (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-24.8), higher in studies focusing on cryptogenic stroke (62.0 per thousand; 95% CI, 13.6-139.3 vs 9.6 per thousand; 95% CI, 4.0-17.3; p = 0.02) and those reporting cancer screening (39.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 16.4-70.6 vs 7.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 2.5-14.1; p = 0.003). Incidence of cancer after stroke was generally higher compared to people without stroke. Most cases were diagnosed within the first few months after stroke. Several predictors of cancer were identified, namely older age, smoking, and involvement of multiple vascular territories as well as elevated C-reactive protein and d-dimers. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of incident cancer after an ischemic stroke is low, but higher in cryptogenic stroke and after cancer screening. Several predictors may increase the yield of cancer screening after an ischemic stroke. The pooled incidence of post-stroke cancer is likely underestimated, and larger studies with systematic assessment of cancer after stroke are needed to produce more precise and valid estimates.","Rioux, Bastien; Touma, Lahoud; Nehme, Ahmad; Gore, Genevieve; Keezer, Mark R; Gioia, Laura C",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,17,29

In contrast, APOE promotes antitumor immunity in other cancer types including melanoma, highlighting the context dependency of APOE signaling and its impact on the tumor microenvironment. As new immunotherapy approaches increasingly aim to modulate both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments of the PDAC immune milieu, identification of specific mechanisms that foster macrophage-mediated immune suppression may facilitate the development of effective strategies that enable the immune system to tackle these tumors.See related article by Kemp et al., p. 4305.","Sherman, Mara H",Cancer research,17,28

Here, we show that macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) senses renal tubular cell death to induce sustained inflammation after acute kidney injury in mice. Mincle-deficient mice were protected against tissue damage and subsequent atrophy of the kidney after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using lipophilic extract from the injured kidney, we identified β-glucosylceramide as an endogenous Mincle ligand. Notably, free cholesterol markedly enhanced the agonistic effect of β-glucosylceramide on Mincle. Moreover, β-glucosylceramide and free cholesterol accumulated in dead renal tubules in proximity to Mincle-expressing macrophages, where Mincle was supposed to inhibit clearance of dead cells and increase proinflammatory cytokine production. This study demonstrates that β-glucosylceramide in combination with free cholesterol acts on Mincle as an endogenous ligand to induce cell death-triggered, sustained inflammation after acute kidney injury.","Tanaka, Miyako; Saka-Tanaka, Marie; Ochi, Kozue; Fujieda, Kumiko; Sugiura, Yuki; Miyamoto, Tomofumi; Kohda, Hiro; Ito, Ayaka; Miyazawa, Taiki; Matsumoto, Akira; Aoe, Seiichiro; Miyamoto, Yoshihiro; Tsuboi, Naotake; Maruyama, Shoichi; Suematsu, Makoto; Yamasaki, Sho; Ogawa, Yoshihiro; Suganami, Takayoshi",The Journal of experimental medicine,17,14

HFOT might therefore be considered as a first-line strategy of oxygenation in these patients. The beneficial effects of HFOT may be explained by its good tolerance and by physiological characteristics including delivery of high FiO2 , positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect and continuous dead space washout contributing to decreased work of breathing. In contrast, NIV should be used cautiously in patients with de novo ARF due to high tidal volumes promoted by pressure support and that may potentially worsen pre-existing lung injury. Although recent studies have reported no benefit and even deleterious effects of NIV in immunocompromised patients with ARF, the experts have recommended its use as a first-line strategy. In patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis, it has been clearly shown that NIV is the best strategy of oxygenation. However, HFOT seems able to reverse respiratory acidosis and further studies are needed to evaluate whether HFOT could represent an alternative to standard oxygen. Although NIV is recommended to treat ARF in post-operative patients or to prevent post-extubation respiratory failure in ICU, recent large-scale randomized studies suggest that HFOT could be equivalent to NIV. While recent recommendations have been established from studies comparing NIV with standard oxygen, new studies are needed to compare NIV versus HFOT in order to better define the appropriate indications for both treatments.","Frat, Jean-Pierre; Coudroy, Rémi; Thille, Arnaud W",Respirology,17,20

This association is not a new concept, as several infections have long been recognized to contribute to stroke risk. The association of infection and stroke is also bidirectional. Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes.

Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%) and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads (2ΔΔCt range 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years-old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first two days post-infection with a sharp decline thereafter. Cases between 10 and 49 years-old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first two days post-infection (range 0.03-17.24; -1.50-1.24). Patients over 60 years-old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them.

OBJECTIVE To pilot the use of a standard test for support surfaces to compare microclimate at the skin surface in three scenarios: (1) on a low-air-loss (LAL) surface, (2) on a representative TRD with a basic underpad (TRDU) placed on a LAL surface, and (3) on a negative control with full occlusion. The results are designed to inform clinical decision-making in using a TRD on a LAL surface and the viability of using this test to study TRDs. DESIGN Measuring humidity and temperature at the device-surface interface using a heated moisture-exuding bronze thermodynamic human model in a laboratory setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Humidity and temperature levels across 3 hours 15 minutes of continuous loading with a 45-second complete unloading to simulate a position change at 3 hours. MAIN RESULTS Relative humidity on the TRDU was below that on the LAL surface for the first 110 minutes and was markedly lower than the negative control for the remainder of humidity testing. Temperature on the TRDU was well below the negative control and negligibly higher than the surface alone throughout testing. The position change enhanced the effects of the TRDU. CONCLUSIONS The support surface standard test appears useful in evaluating TRDs. This TRD along with the basic underpad is more comparable to a LAL surface than to full occlusion in managing the microclimate of the skin and pressure ulcer risk.","Call, Evan; Oberg, Craig; Rappl, Laurie M",Advances in skin & wound care,17,11

In some plants it also serves as a precursor of phytosiderophores, which are used for extracellular iron scavenging. Previous studies have also established the presence of NA in filamentous fungi and some mosses, whereas an analogue of NA was inferred in an archaeon. More recently, opine-type metallophores with homology to NA were uncovered in bacteria, especially in human pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Yersinia pestis, synthesizing respectively staphylopine, pseudopaline and yersinopine. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the discovery, biosynthesis, function and regulation of these metallophores. We also discuss the genomic environment of the cntL gene, which is homologous to the plant NA synthase (NAS) gene, and plays a central role in the synthesis of NA-like metallophores. This reveals a large diversity of biosynthetic, export and import pathways. Using sequence similarity networks, we uncovered that these metallophores are widespread in numerous bacteria thriving in very different environments, such as those living at the host-pathogen interface, but also in the soil. We additionally established a phylogeny of the NAS/cntL gene and, as a result, we propose that this gene is an ancient gene and NA, or its derivatives, is an ancient metallophore that played a prominent role in metal acquisition or metal resistance. Indeed, our phylogenetic analysis suggests an evolutionary model where the possibility to synthesize this metallophore was present early in the appearance of life, although it was later lost by most living microorganisms, unless facing metal starvation such as at the host-pathogen interface or in some soils. According to our model, NA then re-emerged as a central metabolite for metal homeostasis in fungi, mosses and all known higher plants.","Laffont, Clémentine; Arnoux, Pascal",Metallomics : integrated biometal science,17,28

RESULTS Uniportal VATS pulmonary segmentectomy was successfully completed in 151 (96.8%) patients. Most cases involved the right apical and apical posterior segments and the left trisegment. Only 1 patient had a right middle interior segmentectomy, left upper apical anterior segmentectomy or a right lower posteriolateral segmentectomy, respectively. There were 26 cases of benign lesions (including 17 cases of atypical hyperplasia) and 130 cases of non-small-cell lung cancer. Operation time (146 ± 56 vs 113 ± 32 min), blood loss (63 ± 17 vs 54 ± 13 ml) and complication rates (13.5% vs 5.8%) were obviously lower in 2016 compared with 2015 (P < 0.01). In contrast, the preoperative hookwire localization rate was markedly higher in 2016 compared with 2015. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS anatomical pulmonary segmentectomy is safe and feasible in clinical applications. Compared with the 2- or 3-port method, there were some technical difficulties in the early phase of the learning curve for uniportal VATS that were overcome through a period of practice.","Duan, Liang; Jiang, Gening; Yang, Yong",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,17,12

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched to March 2016. Reference lists of relevant publications were searched. No language restrictions were applied. STUDY SELECTION Eligible qualitative studies reported the experiences of carers of stroke survivors who underwent inpatient rehabilitation. The search yielded 3532 records; 93 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility, and 34 documents (33 studies) were included. Comprehensiveness of reporting was assessed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Health Research framework. DATA EXTRACTION Data on the characteristics of included studies were independently extracted by 2 authors. Differences in data extraction between authors were resolved through discussion or by a third author. All text in studies' results and discussion sections were extracted for analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS Extracted texts were analyzed inductively using thematic synthesis. Seven analytical themes were developed that related to the carers' experiences, needs, and preferences: (1) overwhelmed with emotions; (2) recognition as a stakeholder in recovery; (3) desire to be heard and informed; (4) persisting for action and outcomes; (5) being legitimate clients; (6) navigating an alien culture and environment; and (7) managing the transition home. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review provides new insights into the experiences, needs, and preferences of carers of stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Carers experienced distress as they navigated a foreign culture and environment without adequate communication and processes in place for their inclusion. We recommend deliberate efforts to provide a more inclusive environment that better supports and prepares carers for their new role.","Luker, Julie; Murray, Carolyn; Lynch, Elizabeth; Bernhardsson, Susanne; Shannon, Michelle; Bernhardt, Julie",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,17,1

Development of this guideline update followed a rigorous process of evidence review and appraisal. Guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence. The strength of recommendations is based on the ""Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation"" (GRADE) approach. The scope includes topics covered in the original guideline, such as optimal blood pressure targets, lifestyle interventions, antihypertensive medications, and specific management in kidney transplant recipients and children. Some aspects of general and cardiovascular health, such as lipid and smoking management, are excluded. This guideline also introduces a chapter dedicated to proper blood pressure measurement since all large randomized trials targeting blood pressure with pivotal outcomes used standardized preparation and measurement protocols adhered to by patients and clinicians. Based on previous and new evidence, in particular the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) results, we propose a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg using standardized office reading for most people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis, the exception being children and kidney transplant recipients. The goal of this guideline is to provide clinicians and patients a useful resource with actionable recommendations supplemented with practice points. The burden of the recommendations on patients and resources, public policy implications, and limitations of the evidence are taken into consideration. Lastly, knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are provided.","Cheung, Alfred K; Chang, Tara I; Cushman, William C; Furth, Susan L; Hou, Fan Fan; Ix, Joachim H; Knoll, Gregory A; Muntner, Paul; Pecoits-Filho, Roberto; Sarnak, Mark J; Tobe, Sheldon W; Tomson, Charles R V; Lytvyn, Lyubov; Craig, Jonathan C; Tunnicliffe, David J; Howell, Martin; Tonelli, Marcello; Cheung, Michael; Earley, Amy; Mann, Johannes F E",Kidney international,17,29

There are no population-based studies from the United States (U.S.) analyzing this association. The aim of the study is to analyze the trends, predictors of mortality, and outcomes of VTE in AML patients. Methods We analyzed the publicly available Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for years 2010-2014. Hospitalizations due to AML were identified by previously validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes as the primary diagnosis. VTE was identified by ICD-9-CM codes as secondary diagnosis. Hospitalizations with age less than 18 years of age were excluded. The trends and outcomes were determined using Chi-squared (χ2) test and multivariate regression models. Results From 2010 to 2014, there were 313,282 hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of AML and 1,633 hospitalizations (0.1%) had VTE as a concurrent diagnosis. There was a significant increase in the proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE from 0.47% in 2010 to 0.56% in 2014 (P = 0.014). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the odds of in-hospital mortality were not higher in AML hospitalizations with VTE (odds ratio [OR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 - 1.52; P = 0.5) than those without VTE. Age group above 84 years carried the highest risk of mortality (OR 3.20; 95% CI 2.77 - 3.70; P <0.0001) in AML-VTE patients. Black (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.13 - 1.35; P <0.0001) and uninsured patients (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.31 - 1.73; P <0.0001) were at significantly higher odds of in-hospital mortality amongst the AML-VTE hospitalizations. Conclusion The proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE continues to rise in the U.S. After adjusting for confounders, increasing age, Black race, and lack of insurance were found to have higher risk of in-hospital mortality in the AML-VTE cohort. The odds of in-hospital mortality in AML hospitalizations with VTE are not higher than those without VTE.","Khadka, Sushmita; Solanki, Dhanshree; Singh, Jagmeet; Kichloo, Asim; Patel, Neil R; Sharma, Purnima; Chugh, Savneek; Solanki, Shantanu",Postgraduate medicine,17,1

However, massive and uncontrolled release of these cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, can also result in a great deal of additional brain damage. Levels of these cytokines may increase in the brain thousands of times more than do the corresponding levels in serum. RESEARCH DESIGN Narrative literature review. Outcome and conclusions: Strategies to control the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and to reduce the cytokine-induced brain damage are discussed.

However, there are still many devices that fail to have the required hardware to export real time data into an acceptable digital format or in a continuously updating manner. This is particularly the case for many intravenous pumps and older technological systems. Such accurate and digital real time data integration within TBI care and other fields is critical as we move towards digitizing healthcare information and integrating clinical data streams to improve bedside care. We propose to address this gap in technology by building a system that employs Optical Character Recognition through computer vision, using real time images from a pump monitor to extract the desired real time information. Methods: Using freely available software and readily available technology, we built a script that extracts real time images from a medication pump and then processes them using Optical Character Recognition to create digital text from the image. This text was then transferred to an ICM + real-time monitoring software in parallel with other retrieved physiological data. Results: The prototype that was built works effectively for our device, with source code openly available to interested end-users. However, future work is required for a more universal application of such a system. Conclusion: Advances here can improve medical information collection in the clinical environment, eliminating human error with bedside charting, and aid in data integration for biomedical research where many complex data sets can be seamlessly integrated digitally. Our design demonstrates a simple adaptation of current technology to help with this integration.","Froese, Logan; Dian, Joshua; Batson, Carleen; Gomez, Alwyn; Sainbhi, Amanjyot Singh; Unger, Bertram; Zeiler, Frederick A",Frontiers in big data,17,16

To understand their appropriate application, we asked 3 key questions: (1) To what extent are hard-stop alerts effective in improving patient health and healthcare delivery outcomes? (2) What are the adverse events and unintended consequences of hard-stop alerts? (3) How do hard-stop alerts compare to soft-stop alerts? Methods and Materials Studies evaluating computerized hard-stop alerts in healthcare settings were identified from biomedical and computer science databases, gray literature sites, reference lists, and reviews. Articles were extracted for process outcomes, health outcomes, unintended consequences, user experience, and technical details. Results Of 32 studies, 15 evaluated health outcomes, 16 process outcomes only, 10 user experience, and 4 compared hard and soft stops. Seventy-nine percent showed improvement in health outcomes and 88% in process outcomes. Studies reporting good user experience cited heavy user involvement and iterative design. Eleven studies reported on unintended consequences including avoidance of hard-stopped workflow, increased alert frequency, and delay to care. Hard stops were superior to soft stops in 3 of 4 studies. Conclusions Hard stops can be effective and powerful tools in the CDS armamentarium, but they must be implemented judiciously with continuous user feedback informing rapid, iterative design. Investigators must report on associated health outcomes and unintended consequences when implementing IT solutions to clinical problems.","Powers, Emily M; Shiffman, Richard N; Melnick, Edward R; Hickner, Andrew; Sharifi, Mona",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,17,27

Endovascular therapy (EVT) utilizing thrombectomy assisted by carotid stenting was long considered risky because of procedural complexities and necessity of potent platelet inhibition-in particular following IVT. This study assesses the benefits and harms of thrombectomy assisted by carotid stenting and identifies factors associated with clinical outcome and procedural complications. Retrospective single-center analysis of 47 consecutive stroke patients with carotid occlusion or high-grade stenosis and concomitant intracranial embolus treated between September 2011 and December 2014. Benefits included early improvement of stroke severity (NIHSS ≥ 10) or complete remission within 72 h and favorable long-term outcome (mRS ≤ 2). Harms included complications during and following EVT. Mean age was 64.3 years (standard deviation ±12.5), 40 (85%) patients received IVT initially. Median NIHSS was 16 (inter-quartile range 14-19). Mean time from stroke onset to recanalization was 311 min (standard deviation ±78.0). Early clinical improvement was detected in 22 (46%) patients. Favorable outcome at 3 months occurred in 32 (68%) patients. Expedited patient management was associated with favorable clinical outcome. Two (4%) patients experienced symptomatic hemorrhage. Eight (17%) patients experienced stent thrombosis. Four (9%) patients died. Thrombectomy assisted by carotid stenting seems beneficial and reasonably safe with a promising rate of favorable outcome. Nevertheless, adverse events and complications call for additional clinical investigations prior to recommendation as clinical standard. Expeditious patient management is central to achieve good clinical outcome.","Steglich-Arnholm, Henrik; Holtmannspötter, Markus; Kondziella, Daniel; Wagner, Aase; Stavngaard, Trine; Cronqvist, Mats E; Hansen, Klaus; Højgaard, Joan; Taudorf, Sarah; Krieger, Derk Wolfgang",Journal of neurology,17,5

The purpose of this review is to examine oral health workforce planning models on supply, demand and needs, mainly in respect to their data sources, modelling technique and use of skill mix. A limited search was carried out on PubMed and Web of Science for published scientific articles on oral health workforce planning models between 2010 to 2020. No restrictions were placed on the type of modelling philosophy, and all studies including supply, demand or needs based models were included. Rapid review methods guided the review process. Twenty-three studies from 15 countries were included in the review. A majority were from high-income countries (n = 17). Dentists were the sole oral health workforce group modelled in 13 studies; only five studies included skill mix (allied dental personnel) considerations. The most common application of modelling was a workforce to population ratio or a needs-based demand weighted variant. Nearly all studies presented weaknesses in modelling process due to the limitations in data sources and/or non-availability of the necessary data to inform oral health workforce planning. Skill mix considerations in planning models were also limited to horizontal integration within oral health professionals. Planning for the future oral health workforce is heavily reliant on quality data being available for supply, demand and needs models. Integrated methodologies that expand skill mix considerations and account for uncertainty are essential for future planning exercises.","Balasubramanian, Madhan; Hasan, Aliya; Ganbavale, Suruchi; Alolayah, Anfal; Gallagher, Jennifer",International journal of environmental research and public health,17,19

However, the effects of PG on the proliferation and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have not been clarified. In this study, MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted to investigate the effect of PG on proliferation and apoptosis of NSCLC cells in vitro, respectively. A xenograft model of A549 cell was established in nude mice to validate the in vitro findings. Western blot were performed to measure the expression of molecules involved in AMPK/ERK/NF-κB pathway. Results suggested that PG (50 or 100 μM) was significantly cytotoxic to A549 cells and SPC-A1 cells in vitro. PG treatment also inhibited the tumor growth of NSCLC cell mouse xenografts in vivo. These anti-proliferative and pro-apoptosis effects of PG were found to be regulated by the AMPK/ERK/NF-κB pathway. Consequently, PG suppressed proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in NSCLC cells. In conclusions, PG regulates AMPK/ERK/NF-κB axis in NSCLC cells, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis of NSCLC cells.","Wu, Shuo; Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Yan; Chen, Lizhan; Xu, Xi; Dang, Yinli; Ti, Xinyu",Die Pharmazie,17,1

Ultrasonic tissue transection occurs as a result of mechanical friction between the oscillating blade and the tissue. We hypothesized that blade surface structures and characteristics would affect tissue transection and sealing. The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of blade surface structures and characteristics in vessel sealing with an ultrasonic vibration. METHODS We developed an ultrasonic energy device with 50-kHz vibration frequency and 50 μm amplitude. We manufactured four types of blade surface of the ultrasonic device using microprocessing technology: (1) a non-coated blade without microgrooves, (2) a non-coated blade with microgrooves, (3) a water-repellent-coated blade without microgrooves, and (4) a water-repellent-coated blade with microgrooves. We compared the performance of the four devices and a commercially available ultrasonic device with a non-coated blade without microgrooves in an ex vivo vessel-sealing experiment. We sealed porcine carotid arteries (3-5 mm diameter) using each device 20 times. RESULTS The cutting time of the water-repellent-coated blade with microgrooves was the shortest (11.0 ± 3.4 s); however, it did not differ significantly from that of the commercial ultrasonic device (12.9 ± 2.9 s, p = 0.73). The burst pressure of the water-repellent-coated blade without microgrooves (1456 ± 425 mmHg) was significantly higher than that of the commercial ultrasonic device (966 ± 559 mmHg, p = 0.04). The sealing failure rate of the water-repellent blade with microgrooves was the lowest of all devices (0 %). Instrumental sticking of tissue decreased in the water-repellent devices. The sealing width was not significantly different. CONCLUSION The surface-processing of microgrooves and water-repellent coatings will improve the potential of ultrasonic devices with a fast transection and a high sealing reliability.","Okada, Satoru; Shimada, Junichi; Ito, Kazuhiro; Ishii, Tatsuo; Oshiumi, Koichiro",Surgical endoscopy,17,1

It could be hypothesized that complications influence postoperative weight loss, which is one of the most important endpoints of bariatric surgery. Therefore, this study inventoried the effect of complications on postoperative weight loss. METHODS A consecutive database including patients who were operated from November 2007 onwards was retrospectively reviewed. All short-term complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Weight loss was assessed at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 1130 patients underwent either primary (n = 907, 80.3 %) or revisional (n = 233, 19.7 %) surgery till October 2013. Short-term complications occurred in 115 (10.2 %) patients, of whom 48 (41.7 %) had a severe (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3) complication. One year post surgery, 184 patients (16.3 %) were lost to follow-up. Patients with a short-term complication had a higher percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 6 months (58.6 (SD 16.6) versus 52.9 (SD 17.6), p = 0.003) and 1 year (71.9 (SD 22.3) versus 65.9 (SD 21.3), p = 0.017) of follow-up. Although a trend was seen toward higher BMI loss and total weight loss (TWL) after 6 months, no effect was seen 1 year postoperatively. In multivariable linear regression analysis, complications were not a significant predictor for 1-year %EWL. CONCLUSIONS Although short-term complications alter 1-year %EWL, no effect was seen on BMI loss and TWL. In addition, complications were not a predictor in a multivariable linear regression model for 1-year %EWL. It can be concluded that short-term complications do not impair weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","Coblijn, U K; de Raaff, C A L; Lagarde, S M; de Castro, S M M; Vrouenraets, B C; van Wagensveld, B A",Obesity surgery,17,31

Classically, we usually think of a clinical syndrome as the consequence of infection by a single virus that is isolated from clinical specimens. However, this biased laboratory approach omits detection of additional agents that could be contributing to the clinical outcome, including novel agents not usually considered pathogens. The presence of an additional agent may also interfere with the targeted isolation of a known virus. Viral interference, a phenomenon where one virus competitively suppresses replication of other coinfecting viruses, is the most common outcome of viral coinfections. In addition, coinfections can modulate virus virulence and cell death, thereby altering disease severity and epidemiology. Immunity to primary virus infection can also modulate immune responses to subsequent secondary infections. In this review, various virological mechanisms that determine viral persistence/exclusion during coinfections are discussed, and insights into the isolation/detection of multiple viruses are provided. We also discuss features of heterologous infections that impact the pattern of immune responsiveness that develops.","Kumar, Naveen; Sharma, Shalini; Barua, Sanjay; Tripathi, Bhupendra N; Rouse, Barry T",Clinical microbiology reviews,17,27

Their ability to perceive moderate acoustic environmental changes has not been fully investigated. RESULTS Physiological values of the 598 isolated sound peaks (SPs) that were 5-10 and 10-15 dB slow-response A (dBA) above background noise levels and that occurred during infants' sleep varied significantly, indicating that VPIs detect them. Exposure to 10-15 dBA SPs during active sleep significantly increased mean heart rate and decreased mean respiratory rate and mean systemic and cerebral oxygen saturations relative to baseline. DISCUSSION VPIs are sensitive to changes in their nosocomial acoustic environment, with a minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 5-10 dBA. These acoustic changes can alter their well-being. METHODS In this observational study, we evaluated their differential auditory sensitivity to sound-pressure level (SPL) increments below 70-75 dBA equivalent continuous level in their incubators. Environmental (SPL and audio recording), physiological, cerebral, and behavioral data were prospectively collected over 10 h in 26 VPIs (GA 28 (26-31) wk). SPs emerging from background noise levels were identified and newborns' arousal states at the time of SPs were determined. Changes in parameters were compared over 5-s periods between baseline and the 40 s following the SPs depending on their SNR thresholds above background noise.","Kuhn, Pierre; Zores, Claire; Pebayle, Thierry; Hoeft, Alain; Langlet, Claire; Escande, Benoît; Astruc, Dominique; Dufour, André",Pediatric research,17,27

METHODS In this retrospective study, from 560 patients with acute ICH 91 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were classified into neoplastic and non-neoplastic ICH. For each patient, ICH and total hemorrhage volume (ICH + PHE) were segmented semiautomatically. The PHE volume and relative PHE were further calculated and all parameters were compared between the different groups. Additionally, hematoma density was measured and compared between the groups. RESULTS The PHE volume and relative PHE on NECT were significantly higher in neoplastic vs. the non-neoplastic ICH (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Absolute ICH volume, symptom time onset to CT and ICH localization showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.1). Univariate receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed a high diagnostic performance for relative PHE in the discrimination of neoplastic and non-neoplastic ICH with an optimal cut-off of 0.50 (area under the curve, AUC 0.81, 60.0% sensitivity, 91.8% specificity), followed by PHE (AUC 0.69) and hematoma density (AUC 0.68). CONCLUSION Relative PHE with a cut-off of >0.50 is a specific and simple indicator for neoplastic causes of acute ICH and a potential tool for clinical implementation. This observation needs to be validated in an independent patient cohort.","Nawabi, Jawed; Hanning, Uta; Broocks, Gabriel; Schön, Gerhard; Schneider, Tanja; Fiehler, Jens; Thaler, Christian; Gellissen, Susanne",Clinical neuroradiology,17,33

The aim of the current study was to investigate how well the olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can effectively distinguish between normosmic people and subjects with olfactory dysfunction. METHODS Thirty-eight participants were recruited for the study. Group 1 consisted of 22 subjects with olfactory dysfunction (mean age = 44.3 years, SD = 18.6), and Group two consisted of 16 participants with normal olfactory function (mean age = 49.6 years, SD = 11.6). Olfactory functions were assessed in great detail for all participants, and brain activation in response to odorous stimulation was assessed using fMRI. RESULTS The between-group comparison showed stronger odor induced brain activation of the primary olfactory area and the insular cortex among the normosmic group as compared to the dysosmic group. As indicated by the individual analysis, positive responses in the primary olfactory cortex were significantly higher in normosmic people (94%) than in subjects with olfactory dysfunction (41%). However, there was no association between individual fMRI parameters (including the percentage of BOLD signal change, activated cluster size and peak z value), and psychophysical olfactory test scores. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested the subjects could not be differentiated from normosmics based on their BOLD signal from the primary olfactory area, orbitofrontal cortex, or the insular cortex. CONCLUSION There are large inter-individual variabilities for odor-induced brain activation among normosmic subjects and subjects with olfactory dysfunction, due to this variation, at present it appears problematic to diagnose olfactory dysfunction on an individual level using fMRI.","Yunpeng, Zang; Han, Pengfei; Joshi, Akshita; Hummel, Thomas",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,17,5

METHODS A national questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted to identify the incidence of specific diseases, and circumstances of trauma affecting working farm dogs that presented to rural veterinary practices over a 12-month period, between April 2008 and April 2009. The practices were convenience-sampled on the basis of geography and size. RESULTS Sixty-six practices were approached, and veterinarians from 30 practices agreed to participate, with representation from all major rural regions of New Zealand. Data were provided on 2,214 presentations, excluding revisits, of which 51% were for Huntaways and 39% Heading dogs. Trauma was identified as a cause of injury in 848 (38%) visits. Huntaways were apparently over-represented in cases of constipation, gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), theriogenological problems, laryngitis, hip dysplasia, and degenerative lumbosacral disease. In contrast, Heading dogs were over-represented among cases of multiple ligamentous injury of the stifle, disruption of the gastrocnemius or Achilles tendon, tarsal injuries, and hip luxation. Traumatic injury involved injury by stock (20%), automotive incidents (19%), transit across fence lines (16%), and dog bites (12%). Loss occurred following 10% of visits, of which trauma was known to be involved in 32%. The most important non-traumatic causes of loss were GDV, degenerative joint disease, mammary neoplasia and diseases involving the female reproductive tract, cardiac disease, and poisoning. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Several important diseases appear amenable to intervention through nutrition, neutering, or behavioural modification, including constipation, GDV, theriogenological problems, dog-bite injuries, and laryngitis. Altering modes of transit across fence lines has the potential to reduce large numbers of serious orthopaedic injuries to working farm dogs.","Cave, N J; Bridges, J P; Cogger, N; Farman, R S",New Zealand veterinary journal,17,17

We aimed to characterize a large-animal model for studying the ""Small-for-Flow"" syndrome. METHODS We performed subtotal (90%) hepatectomies in 10 female MiniPigs using a simplified transection technique with a tourniquet. Blood tests, hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, and hepatic function and histology were assessed before (Bas), 15 min (t-15 min) and 24 h (t-24 h) after the operation. Some pigs underwent computed tomography (CT) scans for hepatic volumetry (n = 4) and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (n = 3). Postoperative care was performed in an intensive care unit environment. RESULTS All hepatectomies were successfully performed, and hepatic volumetry confirmed liver remnant volumes of 9.2% [6.2-11.2]. The hepatectomy resulted in characteristic hepatic hemodynamic alterations, including portal hyperperfusion, relative decrease of hepatic arterial blood flow, and increased portal pressure (PP) and portal-systemic pressure gradient. The model reproduced major diagnostic features including the development of cholestasis, coagulopathy, encephalopathy with increased ICP, ascites, and renal failure, hyperdynamic circulation, and hyperlactatemia. Two animals (20%) died before t-24 h. Histological liver damage was observed at t-15 min and at t-24 h. The degree of histological damage at t-24 h correlated with intraoperative PP (r = 0.689, p = 0.028), hepatic arterial blood flow (r = 0.655, p = 0.040), and hepatic arterial pulsatility index (r = 0.724, p = 0.066). All animals with intraoperative PP > 20 mmHg presented liver damage at t-24 h.

Dentistry uses rotary, ultrasonic, and laser-based instruments that produce water-based aerosols in the daily, routine treatment of patients. Abundant aerosols are generated, which reach health care workers and other patients. Viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 virus and related coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, continued expansion throughout the USA and the world. The virus is spread by both droplet (visible drops) and aerosol (practically invisible drops) transmission. The generation of aerosols in dentistry-an unavoidable part of most dental treatments-creates a high-risk situation. The US Centers for Disease Control and The Occupational Safety and Health Administration consider dental procedures to be of ""highest risk"" in the potential spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. There are several ways to reduce or eliminate the virus: (i) cease or postpone dentistry (public and personal health risk), (ii) screen patients immediately prior to dental treatment (by appropriate testing, if any), (iii) block/remove the virus containing aerosol by engineering controls together with stringent personal protective equipment use. The present work takes a novel, fourth approach. By altering the physical response of water to the rotary or ultrasonic forces that are used in dentistry, the generation of aerosol particles and the distance any aerosol may spread beyond the point of generation can be markedly suppressed or completely eliminated in comparison to water for both the ultrasonic scaler and dental handpiece.","Plog, Jevon; Wu, Jingwei; Dias, Yasmin J; Mashayek, Farzad; Cooper, Lyndon F; Yarin, Alexander L",Physics of fluids,17,27

ANP affects vasodilation, natriuresis, and inflammation, but the integrated biological effects of ANP on myocardial infarction are unknown. To elucidate these effects, the left anterior coronary artery was ligated in anesthetized, ANP-deficient (ANP(-/-)) and congenic wild-type (ANP(+/+)) mice. The survival of ANP(-/-) mice was markedly better (56%) at 30 days postinfarction than the survival of ANP(+/+) mice (20%, P < 0.01). Surviving mice were comparable initially, but ANP(-/-) mice developed more cardiac hypertrophy (P < 0.001) and had lower contractility indexes 30 days after infarction (P < 0.05). An analysis 24 h after coronary occlusion showed that ANP(-/-) mice had smaller infarcts than ANP(+/+) mice (62.6 +/- 12.1 vs. 100.8 +/- 3.8%, P < 0.001) adjusted for comparable areas at risk for ischemia. The administration of ANP to ANP(-/-) mice via osmotic minipumps significantly enlarged infarct size to levels comparable with those observed in ANP(+/+) mice (P < 0.05). There was no difference in neutrophil migration into the noninfarcted myocardium of ANP(-/-) mice undergoing actual versus sham-operated coronary occlusion. By comparison, after coronary occlusion, the neutrophil infiltration into the myocardium was enhanced in ANP(+/+) (P < 0.0005) and ANP(-/-) mice administered ANP (P < 0.0005). The expression of P-selectin, a molecule that mediates neutrophil adhesion, was significantly greater after coronary occlusion in the vasculature of ANP(+/+) or ANP(-/-) mice treated with ANP than in ANP(-/-) mice (P < 0.002).

Cisplatin is a particularly potent chemotherapeutic agent, but its use to treat GBM is limited by severe systemic toxicity and inefficient penetration of brain tumor tissue even when it is placed directly in the brain within standard delivery systems. We describe the development of cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles that are small enough (70nm in diameter) to move within the porous extracellular matrix between cells and that possess a dense polyethylene glycol (PEG) corona that prevents them from being trapped by adhesion as they move through the brain tumor parenchyma. As a result, these ""brain penetrating nanoparticles"" penetrate much deeper into brain tumor tissue compared to nanoparticles without a dense PEG corona following local administration by either manual injection or convection enhanced delivery. The nanoparticles also provide controlled release of cisplatin in effective concentrations to kill the tumor cells that they reach without causing toxicity-related deaths that were observed when cisplatin was infused into the brain without a delivery system.

Recently, use of the self-gripping mesh demonstrated a beneficial effect on postoperative pain in inguinal hernia repairs. However, in intra-abdominal placement, the use of this novel mesh requires greater laparoscopic skill and dexterity because of the mesh's tendency to fold and adhere to itself and to any surrounding tissues. We hypothesized that gel-like coverage of a self-gripping mesh with a water-soluble film would allow delaying the immediate surface adhesion of the mesh to the tissue, which may allow greater freedom and ease in mesh placement for laparoscopic surgeons. METHODS In this ex vivo animal study, gel-coated self-gripping mesh (ProGrip) was compared with a control uncoated mesh in bovine and porcine tissue specimens and assessed for dislodgement shear forces before and after dissolving of the gel. RESULTS Gel coating of the mesh reduced preperitoneal dislodgement forces in a porcine abdominal wall specimen by 81% (8.05 ± 0.66 vs 1.53 ± 0.82 N, P < .01). Dissolving the gel markedly increased the anchoring forces (10.62 ± 3.70 vs 1.53 ± 0.82 N, P < .0001), and after dissolving the gel, the mesh shear dislodgement forces were similar and noninferior to the control mesh (8.05 ± 0.66 vs 10.62 ± 3.70 N, P = NS). CONCLUSIONS We believe that water-soluble gel coating does not impair the adhesive features of the self-gripping mesh and may simplify its use in open and laparoscopic procedures by allowing controlled activation of the self-gripping mechanism.","Nevler, Avinoam; Gutman, Mordechai; Lebedyev, Alexander",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,17,33

In the current study, gene encoding of 381aa-792aa spike protein (S1) with the main epitope relative to virus neutralization of PEDV was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into vector pET-30A(+). The plasmid was transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Meanwhile, recombinant protein expression was induced by isopropy1-β-galactopyranoside (IPTG). After denaturation and renaturation of inclusion bodies, the S1 protein was obtained by using purified recombinant S1 protein in immunized female BALB/c mice. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against S1 protein, named 4C7 by hybridoma technique were gained successfully. The result showed that MAb can specifically respond to S1 protein and PEDV via ELISA, Western bolt and immunofluorescence assay methods. A sandwich ELISA (S-ELISA) was established by using the captured monoclonal antibodies 4C7. The sensitivity and specificity were compared between S-ELISA and RT-PCR, which showed similar sensitivity and specificity. This work indicated that S-ELISA would be a significant tool alongside a specific diagnostic reagent for PEDV in future.","Gui, Rui; Shi, Hong-Yan; Liu, Wei; Feng, Li; Yang, Ke-Li; Guo, Rui; Liang, Wan; Yuan, Fang-Yan; Duan, Zheng-Ying; Liu, Ze-Wen; Mehmood, Khalid; Hussain, Riaz; Zhou, Dan-Na; Tian, Yong-Xiang",Microbial pathogenesis,17,20

Our objective was to determine differences in drug deposition based on different nebulizer positions in the ventilator circuit, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. METHODS An 8.0-mm inner diameter endotracheal tube (ETT) was connected to a training test lung, compliance of 30 mL/cm H2O, with a collecting filter placed at the ETT-test lung junction. A mechanical ventilator, heated wire circuit, and pass-over humidifier were utilized. A syringe pump continuously instilled a 15,000-ng/mL epoprostenol solution at 30, 50, and 70 ng/kg/min into the vibrating mesh nebulizer at all 4 positions. Tidal volumes (VT) were set at 4, 6, and 8 mL/kg for a 70-kg patient with breathing frequencies of 25, 16, and 12 breaths/min, respectively. Epoprostenol was eluted from the filters (no. = 180) and analyzed with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry at 205 nm to estimate drug deposition. RESULTS Epoprostenol deposition increased significantly (P = .02) as the dosage increased from 30 ng/kg/min (median 4,520.0 ng, interquartile range [IQR] 2,285.0-6,712.2 ng) to 50 ng/kg/min (median 6,065.0 ng, IQR 3,220.0-13,002.5 ng) and 70 ng/kg/min (median 9,890.0 ng, IQR 6,270.0-16,140.0 ng). No significant difference was found between variations in ventilator settings. No difference in deposition was found between the humidifier inlet and outlet, but these positions resulted in greater deposition compared with the inspiratory limb and between the ETT and Y-piece. CONCLUSIONS The greatest amount of mean epoprostenol deposition resulted with the nebulizer placed at the humidifier inlet or outlet in a ventilator with bias flow.","Anderson, Allison C; Dubosky, Meagan N; Fiorino, Kelly A; Quintana, Vanessa; Kaplan, Carl A; Vines, David L",Respiratory care,17,24

Consequently, clinicians must constantly learn new skills (such as clinical evaluations or image interpretation), stay up to date with the literature and incorporate advances into everyday practice. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinical decision making could reduce inter-rater variation in routine clinical practice and facilitate the extraction of vital information that could improve identification of patients with stroke, prediction of treatment responses and patient outcomes. Such support systems would be ideal for centres that deal with few patients with stroke or for regional hubs, and could assist informed discussions with the patients and their families. Moreover, the use of AI for image processing and interpretation in stroke could provide any clinician with an imaging assessment equivalent to that of an expert. However, any AI-based decision support system should allow for expert clinician interaction to enable identification of errors (for example, in automated image processing). In this Review, we discuss the increasing importance of imaging in stroke management before exploring the potential and pitfalls of AI-assisted treatment decision support in acute stroke.","Bivard, Andrew; Churilov, Leonid; Parsons, Mark",Nature reviews.

Moreover, prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes in children. OBJECTIVES Assess prenatal exposure to GDM on anxiety levels and physical activity in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Sixty-five children age 9 to 15 reported their physical activity and anxiety levels using the 24-hours physical activity recall and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children via phone or video meetings. Prenatal exposure to GDM was obtained from maternal electronic medical records. RESULTS The 38 GDM-exposed children reported significantly higher anxiety levels and were less likely to engage in any vigorous physical activity (VPA) (5% vs 30%) compared to the 27 GDM-unexposed children. Lower levels of physical activity were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety. Less engagement in VPA explained 75% of the association between GDM exposure and anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly amongst GDM-exposed children.","Alves, Jasmin M; Yunker, Alexandra G; DeFendis, Alexis; Xiang, Anny H; Page, Kathleen A",Clinical obesity,17,31

METHODS A database of all patients whose aneurysms were treated with the PED since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 was retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, aneurysm characteristics, treatment technique, antiplatelet regimen, and follow-up data were collected. A literature review of all papers that describe PED treatment of CCA was then completed. RESULTS A total of 44 patients with 45 CCAs were identified (38 women, 6 men). The mean age was 59.9±9.0 years. The mean maximal aneurysm diameter was 15.9±6.9 mm (mean neck 7.1±3.6 mm). A single PED was deployed in 32 patients, with two PEDs deployed in 10 patients and three PEDs in 3 patients. Adjunctive coiling was performed in 3 patients. Mean follow-up duration based on final imaging (MR angiography or digital subtraction angiography) was 14.1±12.2 months. Five patients (11.4%) developed CCFs in the post-procedural period after PED treatment, all within 2 weeks of device placement. These CCFs were treated with a balloon test occlusion followed by parent artery sacrifice. Our literature review yielded only three reports of CCFs after PED placement, with the largest series having a CCF rate of 2.3%. CONCLUSIONS CCF formation is a known risk of PED treatment of CCA. Although transvenous embolization can be used for treating CCFs, parent artery sacrifice remains a viable option on the basis of these data. Studies support the view that adjunctive coiling may have a protective effect against post-PED CCF formation. None of the coiled aneurysms in our database or in the literature have ruptured. Follow-up data will lead to a better understanding of the safety profile of the PED for CCA.","Roy, Anil K; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Osbun, Joshua W; Skukalek, Susana L; Howard, Brian M; Ahmad, Faiz U; Tong, Frank; Dion, Jacques E; Cawley, Charles M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,17,1

This work further expands their activity profile by identifying seven benzylamine-containing dithiocarbamate derivatives with piperazine and piperidine substitutions at the main moiety, and five piperazine-containing dithiocarbamates with various substitutions at the piperazine moiety as new inhibitors of α-glucosidase. Compounds bearing the benzylamine moiety exhibited more potent inhibition of the enzyme than the piperazine derivatives. Majority of the compounds noncompetitively inhibited α-glucosidase that led to the identification of a new allosteric site on the enzyme with the help of molecular dynamics and docking studies. These studies suggest that the compounds regulate inhibition of the enzyme by binding to an allosteric site that is located in the vicinity of the active site. This is the first report on the allosteric inhibition of α-glucosidase by dithiocarbamate derivatives that provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme at molecular level. Moreover, it also explores new avenues for drug development of α-glucosidase inhibitors as antidiabetic drugs.","Ghani, Usman; Ashraf, Sajda; Ul-Haq, Zaheer; Mujamammi, Ahmed H; Özkay, Yusuf; Demirci, Fatih; Kaplancikli, Zafer Asim",Chemical biology & drug design,17,1

METHODS Non-ambulant DMD patients (≥8 years) were included. 4-point Dixon MRI scans of the right upper arm were performed at baseline and at 12, 18 or 24 months follow-up. Elbow flexor FFs were determined from five central slices. Loss of hand-to-mouth movement was determined at study visits and by phone-calls every four months. FFs were fitted to a sigmoidal curve using a mixed model with random slope to predict individual trajectories. The added predictive value of elbow flexor FF to age on loss of hand-to-mouth movement was calculated from a Cox model with the predicted FF as a time varying covariate, yielding a hazard ratio. RESULTS Forty-eight MRIs of 20 DMD patients were included. The hazard ratio of a percent-point increase in elbow flexor FF for the time to loss of hand-to-mouth movement was 1.12 (95%-confidence interval 1.04-1.21; p=0.002). This corresponded to a 3.13-fold increase of the instantaneous risk of loss of hand-to-mouth movement in patients with a 10 percent-points higher elbow flexor FF at any age. CONCLUSION In this prospective study, elbow flexor FF predicted loss of hand-to-mouth movement independent of age. qMRI measured elbow flexor FF can be used as surrogate endpoint or stratification tool for clinical trials in non-ambulant DMD patients. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that qMRI FF of elbow flexor muscles in patients with DMD predicts loss of hand-to-mouth movement independent of age.","Naarding, Karin J; van der Holst, Menno; van Zwet, Erik W; van de Velde, Nienke M; de Groot, Imelda J M; Verschuuren, Jan J G M; Kan, Hermien E; Niks, Erik H",Neurology,17,19

METHODS We reviewed the data for 164 consecutive patients who had undergone transperitoneal robotic partial nephrectomy at a tertiary care center from February 2007 to June 2010. Of the 112 patients who had available imaging studies to review, 67 were identified and classified as having a moderately or highly complex renal mass according to the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score (≥7) (tumor size-[R]adius, location and depth-[E]xophytic or endophytic; nearness to the renal sinus fat or collecting system [N]; anterior or posterior position [A], and polar vs non-polar location [L]). The preoperative, perioperative, pathologic, and functional outcomes data were analyzed. RESULTS The median body mass index was 29.6 kg/m(2) (range 19.9-44.8). Of the 67 patients, 32 were men and 35 were women, with 32 right-sided masses and 35 left-sided masses. The median tumor size was 3.7 cm (range 1.2-11), and the median operative time was 180 minutes (range 150-180). The median estimated blood loss was 200 mL (range 100-375), and the warm ischemia time was 19.0 minutes (range 15-26). The median hospital stay was 3.0 days (range 3-4). The estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated at a median decrease of 11.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (range 9-1.3). According to the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications, 2 grade 1, 12 grade 2, and 1 grade 3 complication occurred. All margins were pathologically negative, except for 1, and, after a mean follow-up of 10 months, no recurrences had developed. CONCLUSIONS Robotic partial nephrectomy is a safe and feasible option for moderately or highly complex renal masses determined by the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score. The warm ischemia time, blood loss, and complications were increased with highly complex masses.","White, Michael A; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Autorino, Riccardo; Khanna, Rakesh; Hernandez, Adrian V; Forest, Sylvain; Yang, Bo; Altunrende, Fatih; Stein, Robert J; Kaouk, Jihad H",Urology,17,16

Well-developed bibliographic searches are generally created with thesaurus or index terms in combination with keywords found in the title and/or abstract fields of citation records. Records in the bibliographic database Embase contain many more thesaurus terms than MEDLINE. Here, we aim to examine how limiting searches to major thesaurus terms (in MEDLINE called focus terms) in Embase and MEDLINE as well as limiting to words in the title and abstract fields of those databases affects the overall recall of SR searches. METHODS To examine the impact of using search techniques aimed at higher precision, we analyzed previously completed SRs and focused our original searches to major thesaurus terms or terms in title and/or abstract only in Embase.com or in Embase.com and MEDLINE (Ovid) combined. We examined the total number of search results in both Embase and MEDLINE and checked whether included references were retrieved by these more focused approaches. RESULTS For 73 SRs, we limited Embase searches to major terms only while keeping the search in MEDLINE and other databases such as Web of Science as they were. The overall search yield (or total number of search results) was reduced by 8%. Six reviews (9%) lost more than 5% of the relevant references. Limiting Embase and MEDLINE to major thesaurus terms, the number of references was 13% lower. For 15% of the reviews, the loss of relevant references was more than 5%. Searching Embase for title and abstract caused a loss of more than 5% in 16 reviews (22%), while limiting Embase and MEDLINE that way this happened in 24 reviews (33%). CONCLUSIONS Of the four search options, two options substantially reduced the overall search yield. However, this also resulted in a greater chance of losing relevant references, even though many references were still found in other databases such as Web of Science.","Bramer, Wichor M; Giustini, Dean; Kleijnen, Jos; Franco, Oscar H",Systematic reviews,17,31

Safety precautions limited in-person urgent care options, despite high patient demand. This study describes how one children's health system redeployed clinical health professionals to expand existing pediatric, urgent care, on-demand telemedicine in the early months of the United States' pandemic response. Patient utilization and visit characteristics during the pandemic are contextualized relative to pre-pandemic, business-as-usual (BAU) operations. Materials and Methods: This IRB-approved study is a descriptive, retrospective analysis. Key elements of the clinician redeployment process and shift in physician workflow are described. Retrospective data analysis included routine patient and visit characteristics for urgent care, on-demand telemedicine services received January to May 2020. BAU represented telemedicine encounters between January and May 2019. Results: Twenty-eight redeployed pediatricians and advanced practice registered nurses were trained and credentialed to assist the on-demand pediatrician team on the existing telemedicine platform. During 2020, providers completed 5,055 telemedicine visits, a 168% increase over the same timeframe in 2019. Pre-pandemic visit wait time was 6.29 ± 5.4 min, which increased to 23.25 ± 34.30 min during 2020. Top chief complaints included skin-related concerns (27.9%) and upper respiratory infections (20.2%) and were consistent across years. Patient satisfaction with provider and platform were high.

Here we assess the dynamics of respiratory viral co-infections in children and adults and determine predisposition for or against specific viral pairings. METHODS Over 5 respiratory seasons from November 30, 2013 through June 6, 2018, mono- and co-infection prevalence of 13 viral pathogens were tabulated at The Cleveland Clinic. Employing a model to proportionally distribute viral pairs utilizing individual virus' co-infection rate with prevalence patterns of concurrent co-circulating viruses, we compared predicted-to-observed occurrences of 132 viral pairing permutations using binomial analysis. RESULTS Of 30,535 respiratory samples, 9,843 (32.2%) were positive for ≥1 virus of which 1,018 (10.8%) were co-infected. Co-infected samples predominantly originated from children. Co-infection rate in pediatric population was 35.0% (2068/5906), compared to only 5.8% (270/4591) in adults. Adenovirus C (ADVC) had the highest co-infection rate (426/623, 68.3%) while influenza B had the lowest (55/546, 10.0%). ADVC-rhinovirus (HRV), RSVA-HRV, and RSVB-HRV pairings occurred at significantly higher frequencies than predicted by the proportional distribution model (p<0.05). Additionally, several viral pairings had fewer co-infections than predicted by our model: notably metapneumovirus (hMPV)-PIV3, hMPV-RSVA, and RSVA-RSVB. CONCLUSIONS This is one of the largest studies on respiratory viral co-infections in children and adults. Co-infections are substantially more common in children, especially under 5 years of age and the most frequent pairings occurred at a higher frequency than would be expected by random. Specific pairings occur at altered rates than those predicted by proportional distribution suggesting either direct or indirect interactions result between specific viral pathogens.","Mandelia, Yamini; Procop, Gary W; Richter, Sandra S; Worley, Sarah; Liu, Wei; Esper, Frank",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,17,33

We present such a case that led to renal failure and necessitated emergent urologic intervention. Case Presentation: A 60-year-old Caucasian man presented with right flank pain, dizziness, and dyspnea at the emergency room. History was significant for a previous diagnosis of right renal pelvic stone that was scheduled for retrograde intrarenal surgery before the pandemic lockdown. Upon evaluation, he was found to have an elevated creatinine of 40.2 mg/dL, bilateral hydronephrosis, pericardial and pleural effusion. The patient underwent emergency hemodialysis, followed by preliminary bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy, and subsequently by ureteral stenting. He was discharged stable with the future plan for endoscopic stone management. Conclusions: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, urologists should follow up all known kidney stone patients, regularly assess their condition, and prioritize those who need urgent care. Patient education and telemedicine are useful tools for this purpose and may help minimize the risk of complications during a community lockdown.","Romantini, Federico; Saldutto, Pietro; Maselli, Guevar; Ferritto, Mario; Ranieri, Maurizio; Castellani, Daniele; Vicentini, Carlo",Journal of endourology case reports,17,30

METHODS We conducted a multinational (Australia, France, Italy, Lebanon, Morocco, Spain, and The Netherlands) 4-week cohort study involving 1,532 patients who were prescribed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for ankylosing spondylitis, chronic back pain, hand osteoarthritis, hip and/or knee osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. The MCII and PASS values were estimated with the 75th percentile approach for 4 generic outcomes: pain, patient global assessment, functional disability, and physician global assessment, all normalized to a 0-100 score. RESULTS For the whole sample, the estimated MCII values for absolute change at 4 weeks were -17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -18, -15) for pain; -15 (95% CI -16, -14) for patient global assessment; -12 (95% CI -13, -11) for functional disability assessment; and -14 (95% CI -15, -14) for physician global assessment. For the whole sample, the estimated PASS values were 42 (95% CI 40, 44) for pain; 43 (95% CI 41, 45) for patient global assessment; 43 (95% CI 41, 44) for functional disability assessment; and 39 (95% CI 37, 40) for physician global assessment. Estimates were consistent across diseases and countries (for subgroups ≥20 patients). CONCLUSION This work allows for promoting the use of values of MCII (15 of 100 for absolute improvement, 20% for relative improvement) and PASS (40 of 100) in reporting the results of trials of any of the 5 involved rheumatic diseases with pain, patient global assessment, physical function, or physician global assessment used as outcome criteria.","Tubach, F; Ravaud, P; Martin-Mola, E; Awada, H; Bellamy, N; Bombardier, C; Felson, D T; Hajjaj-Hassouni, N; Hochberg, M; Logeart, I; Matucci-Cerinic, M; van de Laar, M; van der Heijde, D; Dougados, M",Arthritis care & research,17,27

Also, HFD consumption can alter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) metabolism. H2S is an important signaling molecule with antioxidant effects that regulates multiple functions in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H2S donor) on cognitive impairment and oxidative stress changes induced by HFD consumption. Following 11 weeks of HFD regimes in Wistar rats, elevated plus-maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and passive avoidance learning (PAL) tasks were used to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior and spatial and passive learning and memory, respectively. Daily intraperitoneal injection of NaHS was done during the dietary regimen. Serum and hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS)) were measured. We demonstrated that treatment with NaHS ameliorated the impairment in the retrieval of reference memory and passive avoidance learning. Moreover, HFD increased anxiety-like behavior, which was reversed by the administration of NaHS. Additionally, the increase in MDA and TOS and the decrease in TAC induced by HFD in the serum and hippocampus were significantly reduced following administration of NaHS. These results indicate that NaHS could significantly ameliorate HFD-induced spatial and passive learning and memory impairment and anxiety-like behavior, at least in part, via its antioxidant activities. Therefore, the administration of NaHS can provide a therapeutic approach for HFD-induced memory impairment.","Habibitabar, Elahe; Moridi, Heresh; Shateri, Hossein; Karimi, Seyed Asaad; Salehi, Iraj; Komaki, Alireza; Sarihi, Abdolrahman",Brain research bulletin,17,1

Today, for treatment of simple and uncomplicated cysts, we have a variety of choices: antihelmintic therapy, the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, and respiration) technique, and the laparoscopic approach. We reviewed our series of 267 cases of hepatic hydatidosis submitted to surgery over a period of 20 years, from 1995 through 2014, comparing the results of these minimally invasive treatments. METHODS In 92 patients (25.7% of cases) who presented with complicated liver hydatid cysts, we performed open surgery. In 16.4% of cases (59 patients), we used a laparoscopic approach, and in 208 patients (57.9% of cases), we used the PAIR technique. All patients were monitored after surgery for a mean of 61.7 months (range, 16-127). Postoperative follow-up consisted of clinical examination, laboratory investigation, abdominal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS Almost all patients (198, 95.2%) treated with the PAIR technique and 55 patients (93.2%) treated with the laparoscopic approach were cured. Six patients (2.8%) from the echo-guided puncture group had to undergo a repeat of the procedure because the cavity did not disappear after 2 years. In 4 patients (2%), we performed open surgery for 2 biliary fistulas and 2 hepatic abscesses. Four patients from the laparoscopic group needed additional procedures. Open surgery was necessary in 2 patients for a recurrence after 2 years; 1 patient had developed a liver abscess and the other had a biliary fistula. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, open surgery remains the viable option for complicated cysts, with biliary communication, with multiple daughter vesicles, or with calcified walls. For simple, uncomplicated hydatid cysts, both methods (the PAIR technique and laparoscopic procedure) are safe and efficient, with very good results and low morbidity rates.","Duta, Ciprian; Pantea, Stelian; Lazar, Caius; Salim, Abdullah; Barjica, Daniela",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,17,8

Use of synthetic mesh in the pelvis may be associated with complications such as fistulation, erosion and dyspareunia. Biological meshes may avoid these complications, but the long-term outcome is uncertain. Debate continues as to which type of mesh is optimal for laparoscopic VMR. METHOD A literature search was performed of electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus (2000-12). Studies describing outcomes relating to the mesh were included for review. Only English language studies were included. RESULTS Thirteen observational studies reported the outcome of 866 patients following laparoscopic VMR. Eleven reported the outcome using synthetic mesh with a median follow-up ranging from 7 to 74 months. Two studies reported the outcome with biological mesh with a median follow-up of 12 months. Pooled analysis of the studies demonstrated that 767 patients had a repair with synthetic mesh and 99 with a biological implant. There was no difference in recurrence (3.7 vs 4.0%, P = 0.78) or mesh complications (0.7 vs 0%, P = 1.0%) between synthetic and biological mesh repair. CONCLUSION Biological meshes appear to be as effective as synthetic meshes in the short term for laparoscopic VMR. Mesh complication rates are low in both groups. Long-term follow-up is required to ascertain if these findings persist.","Smart, N J; Pathak, S; Boorman, P; Daniels, I R",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,17,11

In contrast to classic stent-assisted coiling, the fully retrievable stent is recaptured prior to detachment of the last coil. The presented technical nuance hence does not require institution of prolonged antiplatelet coverage. But the door is left open for coil-repositioning in case of coil basket instability. Permanent stent redeployment remains a fall-back option if critical hardware conflict occurs. In comparison to classic balloon remodeling, the presented method may offer easier distal access, particularly in tortuous arterial anatomy. Temporary occlusion of the parent artery, side branches, and perforators is also avoided. Given its specific potential advantages, temporary stent scaffolding using the fully retrievable Solitaire FR device may find its niche as a bailout option, primarily in a very specific subset of distally located wide neck aneurysms.","Zumofen, Daniel W; Sahasrabudhe, Nikhil; Riina, Howard A; Raz, Eytan; Shapiro, Maksim; Becske, Tibor; Nelson, Peter K",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,17,31

METHODS The technical feasibility of SDI was evaluated by a series of anthropomorphic phantom studies on a standard SPECT camera. The attenuation map was created by a moving transmission line source. Iterative reconstruction including attenuation correction, resolution recovery and Monte Carlo simulation of scatter was used for simultaneous reconstruction of dual tracer distribution. For clinical evaluation, patient studies were compared to stress (99m)Tc and rest (99m)Tc reference images acquired in a 2-day protocol. Clinical follow-up examinations like coronary angiography (CAG) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were included in the assessment if available. RESULTS Phantom studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of SDI. Artificial lesions inserted in the phantom mimicking ischaemia could be clearly identified. In 51/53 patients, the image quality was adequate for clinical evaluation. For the remaining two obese patients with body mass index > 32 the injected (201)Tl dose of 74 MBq was insufficient for clinical assessment. In answer to this the (201)Tl dose was adapted for obese patients in the rest of the study. In 31 patients, SDI and (99m)Tc reference images resulted in equivalent clinical assessment. Significant differences were found in 20 patients. In 18 of these 20 patients additional examinations were available. In 15 patients the diagnosis based on the SDI images was confirmed by the results of CAG or FFR. In these patients the SDI images were more accurate than the (99m)Tc reference study. In three patients minor ischaemic lesions were detected by SDI but were not confirmed by CAG. In one of these cases this was probably caused by pronounced apical thinning. For two patients no relevant clinical follow-up information was available for evaluation. CONCLUSION The proposed SDI protocol has the potential to improve clinical workflow and patient comfort and suggests improved accuracy as demonstrated in the clinical feasibility study.","Dey, Thomas; Backus, Barbra E; Romijn, R Leo; Wieczorek, Herfried; Verzijlbergen, J Fred",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,17,15

This review summarises the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. The prevalence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than adults, but paediatric disease is likely underdiagnosed as a result of the high numbers of asymptomatic or mild cases. Children are vulnerable to family cluster outbreaks, but are unlikely to be index cases within a household. Vertical transmission or breast milk transmission are yet to be proven. Between 10 and 90% of paediatric COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases typically present with mild symptoms, including cough, fever and sore throat. Intensive care admission and mortality are rare. Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 is a rare, but severe, newly emerging phenotype. At present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 in adults or children; management is usually supportive. For severe or critical disease, including paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19, the decision to start antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy should be on a case-by-case basis; in the UK, this should be done within a clinical trial.

RNA viruses contain capsid proteins that interact with the genome during morphogenesis. The sequence and properties of the protein and genome determine the structure of the virus. For example, the Pariacoto virus ssRNA genome assembles into a dodecahedron. Virus-inspired nanotechnology has progressed remarkably due to the unique structural and functional properties of viruses, which can inspire the design of novel nanomaterials. RNA is a programmable biopolymer able to self-assemble sophisticated 3D structures with rich functionalities. RNA dodecahedrons mimicking the Pariacoto virus quasi-icosahedral genome structures were constructed from both native and 2'-F modified RNA oligos. The RNA dodecahedron easily self-assembled using the stable pRNA three-way junction of bacteriophage phi29 as building blocks. The RNA dodecahedron cage was further characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, confirming the spontaneous and homogenous formation of the RNA cage. The reported RNA dodecahedron cage will likely provide further studies on the mechanisms of interaction of the capsid protein with the viral genome while providing a template for further construction of the viral RNA scaffold to add capsid proteins for the assembly of the viral nucleocapsid as a model. Understanding the self-assembly and RNA folding of this RNA cage may offer new insights into the 3D organization of viral RNA genomes. The reported RNA cage also has the potential to be explored as a novel virus-inspired nanocarrier.","Li, Hui; Zhang, Kaiming; Binzel, Daniel W; Shlyakhtenko, Lyudmila S; Lyubchenko, Yuri; Chiu, Wah; Guo, Peixuan",RNA biology,17,1

Medical professionals took a broadly proactive stance to the issue, highlighting the need to implement education and advocacy strategies. Politics was the least pertinent motivation for climate change-related recommendations. Furthermore, partnerships between health care and public agencies were identified as holding the greatest potential for meaningful change.

Though many approaches have been developed to generate desired structures in polymeric films, few of them can effectively and dynamically achieve periodic porous structures. Here, a facile way is proposed to introduce periodic stratified porous structures into polyelectrolyte films. A photo-crosslinkable polyelectrolyte film of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and photoreactive poly(acrylic acid) derivative (PAA-N3 ) is prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly. Stratified crosslinking of the PEI/PAA-N3 film is generated basing on standing-wave optics. The periodic stratified porous structure is constructed by forming pores in noncrosslinked regions in the film. Thanks to the dynamic mobility of polyelectrolytes, this structural controlment can be repeated several times. The size of pores corresponding to the layer spacing of the film contributes to the structural colors. Furthermore, structural color patterns are fabricated in the film by selective photo-crosslinking using photomasks. Although the large-scale structural controlment in thick (micron-scale and above) films needs to be explored further, this work highlights the periodic structural controlment in polymeric films and thus presents an approach for application potentials in sensor, detection, and ink-free printing.","Huang, Wei-Pin; Qian, Hong-Lin; Wang, Jing; Ren, Ke-Feng; Ji, Jian",Advanced science,17,16

The results of CXR were classified as positive or negative according to the original prospective radiologic reports. To overcome the limitations of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab, especially oscillating sensitivity, we added the information obtained from phone calls to discharged patients with negative initial RT-PCR. Thus, we included 535 patients with concomitant CXR and RT-PCR on admission (aged 65±17 y; 340 males, 195 females), resulting in 408 RT-PCR positive and 127 negative patients at the composite reference standard.

This article explains the steps required to verify the death of an adult patient. Verification of death is not a mechanistic task, but one that requires sensitivity and compassion. It is also crucial that nurses understand the legal implications of verifying a patient's death. With the development of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nurses must also understand any changes in their role when verifying the death of a patient. Verification or confirmation of death is the process of ascertaining whether a patient is deceased, based on a physical assessment. Nurses can only verify a death if the patient is expected to die and has a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) order in place. A DNACPR order is essential because it allows the nurse to verify the death without being concerned with the need to resuscitate the patient. Nurses should ensure they act in accordance with local and national guidance regarding the verification of a patient's death.

Ventrain® was originally designed to facilitate emergency ventilation using active expiration through short, small-bore cannulas. Herein, we studied its efficacy (oxygenation and ventilation) and safety (avoidance of hyperinflation) in a long, small-bore AEC. METHODS In six anesthetized pigs, the upper airway was obstructed, except for a 100 cm long, 3 mm internal diameter AEC. After apneic desaturation to a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of < 70%, ventilation through the AEC was started with Ventrain at an oxygen flow of 15 L·min-1, a frequency of 30 breaths·min-1, and an inspiration/expiration ratio of approximately 1:1. It was continued for ten minutes. RESULTS Within one minute, severe hypoxia was reversed from a median [interquartile range] arterial saturation (SaO2) of 48 [34-56] % before initiation of Ventrain ventilation to 100 [99-100] % afterward (median difference 54%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 44 to 67; P = 0.028). In addition, hypercarbia was reversed from PaCO2 of 59 [53-61] mmHg to 40 [38-42] mmHg (median difference of -18 mmHg; 95% CI -21 to -15; P = 0.028). After ten minutes of Ventrain use, peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures were lower than during baseline pressure-controlled ventilation (8 [7-9] mmHg vs 12 [10-14] mmHg and -2 [-3 to +1] mmHg vs 4 [2 to 4] mmHg, respectively; P = 0.027 for both). No hemodynamic deterioration occurred. CONCLUSION Ventrain provides rapid reoxygenation and effective ventilation through a small-bore AEC in pigs with an obstructed airway. In clinical emergency situations of obstructed airways, this device may be able to overcome problems of unintentional hyperinflation and high intrapulmonary pressures when ventilating through long, small-bore catheters and could therefore minimize the risks of barotrauma and hemodynamic instability.","de Wolf, Michiel W P; Gottschall, Reiner; Preussler, Niels P; Paxian, Markus; Enk, Dietmar",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,17,1

Paramyxovirus infection also gives rise to the formation of multinuclear, fused cells (syncytia). Both types of fusion are mediated by the viral fusion (F) protein, which requires proteolytic processing at a basic cleavage site in order to be active for fusion. In common with most paramyxoviruses, fusion mediated by Sendai virus F protein (F(SeV)) requires coexpression of the homologous attachment (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) protein, which binds to cell surface sialic acid receptors. In contrast, respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein (F(RSV)) is capable of fusing membranes in the absence of the viral attachment (G) protein. Moreover, F(RSV) is unique among paramyxovirus fusion proteins since F(RSV) possesses two multibasic cleavage sites, which are separated by an intervening region of 27 amino acids. We have previously shown that insertion of both F(RSV) cleavage sites in F(SeV) decreases dependency on the HN attachment protein for syncytium formation in transfected cells. We now describe recombinant Sendai viruses (rSeV) that express mutant F proteins containing one or both F(RSV) cleavage sites. All cleavage-site mutant viruses displayed reduced thermostability, with double-cleavage-site mutants exhibiting a hyperfusogenic phenotype in infected cells. Furthermore, insertion of both F(RSV) cleavage sites in F(SeV) reduced dependency on the interaction of HN with sialic acid for infection, thus mimicking the unique ability of RSV to fuse and infect cells in the absence of a separate attachment protein.","Rawling, Joanna; Cano, Olga; Garcin, Dominique; Kolakofsky, Daniel; Melero, José A",Journal of virology,17,7

In this manuscript we aim to summarize recent AI impact on endoscopy. RECENT FINDINGS AI for detecting colon polyps has been the most promising area for application of AI in endoscopy. Recent prospective randomized studies showed that AI assisted colonoscopy increased adenoma detection rate and the mean number of adenomas per patient compared to standard colonoscopy alone. AI for optical biopsy of colon polyp showed a negative predictive value of ≥90%. For capsule endoscopy, applying AI to pre-read the video images decreased physician reading time significantly. Recently, researchers are broadening the area of AI to quality assessment of endoscopy such as bowel preparation and automated report generation. AI systems have shown great potential to increase physician performance by enhancing detection, reducing procedure time, and providing real-time feedback of endoscopy quality. To build a generally applicable AI, we need further investigations in real world settings and also integration of AI tools into pragmatic platforms.","Lee, Jiyoung; Wallace, Michael B",Current gastroenterology reports,17,17

The aim was to assess the adherence to and effectiveness of WATs to increase physical activity levels in patients with RMDs. METHODS A systematic review was performed to identify all cohorts and controlled trials evaluating WATs in patients with RMDs, published between 2000 and 2018, by searching Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane. Data collected pertained to adherence, effectiveness on physical activity, or effectiveness on symptoms (pain, function, quality of life, or fatigue). Meta-analyses were performed with a random effects model. RESULTS Of 2,806 references, 17 studies were included, with a total of 1,588 patients: 8 studies (47%) in osteoarthritis, 5 (29%) in low-back pain, and 3 (18%) in inflammatory arthritis. Adherence assessed in 4 studies was high (weighted mean ± SD time worn was 92.7% ± 4.6%). A significant increase in physical activity was noted (mean difference 1,520 steps [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 580, 2,460], I² = 77%; or 16 minutes [95% CI 2, 29] of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, I² = 0%). A significant increase in pain was found for long interventions (>8 weeks) (standardized mean difference 0.25 [95% CI 0.07, 0.43], I² = 0%). CONCLUSION WATs in patients with RMDs had a high short-term adherence, with a significant increase in the number of steps and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, although pain should be monitored. WATs may be an effective option to increase physical activity in this at-risk population.","Davergne, Thomas; Pallot, Adrien; Dechartres, Agnès; Fautrel, Bruno; Gossec, Laure",Arthritis care & research,17,29

The sEMG signals of deltoid, erector spines (ES), multifidus (MF), rectus abdominis (RA), and transversus abdominus/internal oblique muscles (TrA/IO) were recorded before and after the intervention in the weight-shifting task. The relative activation time of each muscle was calculated. Results In the WBV group, the relative activation time of bilateral MF and bilateral TrA/IO was significantly reduced on shoulder flexion (right MF: P=0.014; left MF: P=0.011; right TrA/IO: P=0.008; left TrA/IO: P=0.026). As for shoulder abduction, except for the left TrA/IO and the left RA, the relative activation time of other muscles was significantly reduced (right ES: P=0.001; left ES: P < 0.001; right MF: P=0.001; left MF: P=0.009; right TrA/IO: P < 0.001; right RA: P=0.001). In the control group, there was no significant difference in the relative activation time of each muscle before and after the intervention (P > 0.05).

We hypothesize that a rapid 15-minute Point-Of-Care serological test to evaluate past infection complements diagnostic testing for Covid-19 and significantly enhances testing availability. Method: A three arm observational study at Sharp Healthcare, San Diego, California was conducted using the Clungene (R) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) and compared with the Cobas (R) Roche real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Arm 1: Thirty-five (35) subjects with confirmed Covid-19 using RT-PCR were tested twice: prior to 14 days following symptom onset and once between 12 and 70 days. Arm 2: Thirty (30) subjects with confirmed Covid-19 using RT-PCR were tested 12-70 days post symptom onset. Arm 3: Thirty (30) subjects with a negative RT-PCR for Covid-19 were tested 1-10 days following the RT-PCR test date. Results: Specificity of confirmed negative Covid-19 by RT-PCR was 100% (95% CI, 88.4%-100.0%);meaning there was 100% negative positive agreement between the RT-PCR and the Clungene (R) serological test results. Covid-19 subjects tested prior to day 7 of symptom onset were antibody negative. In subjects 7-12 days following symptom onset with a confirmed positive Covid-19 by RT-PCR, the combined sensitivity of IgM and IgG was 58.6% (95% CI, 38.9%-76.5%). In subjects 13-70 days following symptom onset with a confirmed positive Covid-19 by RT-PCR, the combined sensitivity of IgM and IgG was 90.5% (95% CI, 80.4%-96.4%). Conclusion: The Clungene (R) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) is a useful tool to confirm individuals with an adaptive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) indicating past infection. Providing Point-Of-Care results within 15 minutes without any laboratory instrumentation or specialized software has an added value of increasing test availability to patients who have been symptomatic for more than 1 week to confirm past infection. Performance characteristics are optimal after 13 days with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. Statement of novelty: Formal controlled clinical studies of Covid-19 antibody tests have been limited. This study demonstrates the utility of the 15 minute rapid Clungene (R) test and the potential for expanded use where Covid-19 RT-PCR testing and vaccination is limited.","Haddad, F.; Lamb, C.

This research is quantitative with a quasi-experimental method. The research sample consisted of 48 people who were taken using purposive sampling based on the criteria that the referee had a provincial level referee license (Code C2) and has led a provincial level competition. Data collection techniques are through pre-test, post-test and treatment during the study. The data analysis technique used two-way ANOVA analysis followed by the Tukey test. The findings showed that psychological skill training, both relaxation, imagery, or a combination of imagery-relaxation and physical fitness, had a positive effect on the performance of the referee in leading the match.

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of mavrilimumab on clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Methods: This on-going, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled seamless transition Phase 2/3 trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavrilimumab in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation. The Phase 2 portion comprised two groups: Cohort 1 patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation (to maintain SpO2 ≥92%) and Cohort 2 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, initiated ≤48 hours before randomization. Here, we report results for Phase 2, Cohort 1: 116 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation from USA, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and South Africa;randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single intravenous administration of mavrilimumab (10 or 6 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients alive and free of mechanical ventilation at Day 29. Secondary endpoints included [1] time to 2-point clinical improvement (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases COVID-19 ordinal scale), [2] time to return to room air, and [3] mortality, all measured through Day 29. The prespecified evidentiary standard was a 2-sided α of 0.2 (not adjusted for multiplicity). Results: Baseline demographics were balanced among the intervention groups;patients were racially diverse (43% non-white), had a mean age of 57 years, and 49% were obese (BMI ≥ 30). All patients received the local standard of care: 96% received corticosteroids (including dexamethasone) and 29% received remdesivir. No differences in outcomes were observed between the 10 mg/kg and 6 mg/ kg mavrilimumab arms. Results for these groups are presented together. Mavrilimumab recipients had a reduced requirement for mechanical ventilation and improved survival: at day 29, the proportion of patients alive and free of mechanical ventilation was 12.3 percentage points higher with mavrilimumab (86.7% of patients) than placebo (74.4% of patients) (Primary endpoint;p=0.1224). Mavrilimumab recipients experienced a 65% reduction in the risk of mechanical ventilation or death through Day 29 (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.35;p=0.0175). Day 29 mortality was 12.5 percentage points lower in mavrilimumab recipients (8%) compared to placebo (20.5%) (p=0.0718). Mavrilimumab recipients had a 61% reduction in the risk of death through Day 29 (HR= 0.39;p=0.0726). Adverse events occurred less frequently in mavrilimumab recipients compared to placebo, including secondary infections and thrombotic events (known complications of COVID-19). Thrombotic events occurred only in the placebo arm (5/40 [12.5%]). Conclusion: In a global, diverse population of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation receiving supplemental oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, and remdesivir, a single infusion of mavrilimumab reduced progression to mechanical ventilation and improved survival. Results indicate mavrilimumab, a potent inhibitor of GM-CSF signaling, may have added clinical benefit on top of the current standard therapy for COVID-19. Of potential importance is that this treatment strategy is mechanistically independent of the specific virus or viral variant.","Pupim, L.; Wang, T.

While video chat allows for genuine social interaction—in which the partner can see and hear you—affordances in other modalities are limited (e.g., touch). Do children understand the nuanced affordances and limitations of video chat? Here we provide evidence of these abilities at preschool age. Prior to COVID‐19, we conducted an experiment with 4‐year‐old children (N = 44). Each child was introduced to people over video chat, in person, and in a photograph. Children judged whether each person could see, hear, feel, and physically interact with them. We found that children made nuanced judgments about the affordances of video chat, judging that a person over video chat can see, but cannot feel a touch nor physically interact through the screen. Children's answers about hearing were divided, with children answering that the person over video chat could hear more often than for a photograph, but less often than for in‐person interaction. Overall, by age four, children understand that video chat has a mixture of life‐like affordances and picture‐like limitations, showing the presence of a necessary cognitive prerequisite to effective use of video chat in early education.

Coronaviruses known to infect humans were all associated to mammal sources, with different species acting as both natural and/or intermediate hosts of these viruses. Although the zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses is well accepted, a great number of mammal species were not yet investigated as their potential to carry these viruses. This work aimed to provide an overview of the current state of scientific knowledge about what are the mammal groups well known to be associated to coronaviruses and other viruses and what are the most neglected groups in these studies. Here we analyze the production of scientific publications about these and other viruses in association with the 29 taxonomic orders of the Mammalia class. Our results highlighted that most of these taxonomic orders have been little studied or completely unexplored in researches with this focus, with only six orders accumulating more than 99% of the articles on coronaviruses in mammals. Ten mammal groups were not found in any scientific publication in association with coronaviruses, with four of them not found even in works mentioning any type of viruses. These results reinforce the importance of identify all the natural and intermediate hosts for viruses to improve monitoring of potential zoonosis and reduce the chances of new disease outbreaks.","Nunes, R.; Dias, R.

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more infectious than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is concerning. Several of these viral variants have the potential to partially escape neutralizing antibody responses warranting continued immune-monitoring. Here, we tested a number of currently circulating viral variants of concern/interest, including B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.1.7+E484K (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and C.37 (Lambda) in neutralization assays using a panel of post-mRNA vaccination sera. The assays were performed with authentic SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in an assay that mimics physiological conditions. We found only small decreases in neutralization against B.1.526 and an intermediate phenotype for B.617.2. The reduction was stronger against a sub-variant of C.37, followed by B.1.351 and B.1.1.7+E484K. C.37 is currently circulating in parts of Latin America and was detected in Germany, the US and Israel. Of note, reduction in a binding assay that also included P.1, B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and A.23.1 was negligible. Taken together, these findings suggest that mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may remain effective against these viral variants of concern/interest and that spike binding antibody tests likely retain specificity in the face of evolving SARS-CoV-2 diversity.","Carreno, J.

TNF-alpha exerts damaging effects on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cell of the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin itself. We have recently demonstrated TNF- alpha expression from astrocytes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). Astrocytes secrete TNF-alpha in response to LPS alone, and can be primed by IFN-gamma to enhance LPS-induced TNF-alpha production. IFN- gamma and IL-1 beta, cytokines known to be present in the CNS during neurological disease states, do not induce TNF-alpha production alone, but act synergistically to stimulate astrocyte TNF-alpha expression. Inbred Lewis and Brown-Norway (BN) rats differ in genetic susceptibility to EAE, which is controlled in part by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. We examined TNF-alpha gene expression by astrocytes derived from BN rats (resistant to EAE) and Lewis rats (highly susceptible). Astrocytes from BN rats express TNF- alpha mRNA and protein in response to LPS alone, yet IFN-gamma does not significantly enhance LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression, nor do they express appreciable TNF-alpha in response to the combined stimuli of IFN-gamma/IL-1 beta. In contrast, astrocytes from Lewis rats express low levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein in response to LPS, and are extremely responsive to the priming effect of IFN-gamma for subsequent TNF-alpha gene expression. Also, Lewis astrocytes produce TNF-alpha in response to IFN-gamma/IL-1 beta. The differential TNF-alpha production by astrocytes from BN and Lewis strains is not due to the suppressive effect of prostaglandins, because the addition of indomethacin does not alter the differential pattern of TNF-alpha expression. Furthermore, Lewis and BN astrocytes produce another cytokine, IL-6, in response to LPS, IFN-gamma, and IL-1 beta in a comparable fashion. Peritoneal macrophages and neonatal microglia from Lewis and BN rats are responsive to both LPS and IFN-gamma priming signals for subsequent TNF- alpha production, suggesting that differential TNF-alpha expression by the astrocyte is cell type specific. Taken together, these results suggest that differential TNF-alpha gene expression in response to LPS and IFN-gamma is strain and cell specific, and reflects both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,J Exp Med,17,19

The PRRSV-specific humoral immune response has been dismissed as being ineffective and perhaps deleterious for the host. The function of PRRSV antibodies in protective immunity against infection with a highly abortifacient strain of this virus was examined by passive transfer experiments in pregnant swine. All of a group of pregnant gilts (n = 6) that received PRRSV immunoglobulin (Ig) from PRRSV-convalescent, hyperimmune animals were fully protected from reproductive failure as judged by 95% viability of offspring at weaning (15 days of age). On the other hand, the totality of animals in a matched control group (n = 6) receiving anti-pseudorabies virus (PRV) Ig exhibited marked reproductive failure with 4% survival at weaning. Besides protecting the pregnant females from clinical reproductive disease, the passive transfer of PRRSV Ig prevented the challenge virus from infecting the dams and precluded its vertical transmission, as evidenced by the complete absence of infectious PRRSV from the tissues of the dams and lack of infection in their offspring. In summary, these results indicate that PRRSV-Igs are capable of conferring protective immunity against PRRSV and furthermore that these Igs can provide sterilizing immunity in vivo.","Osorio, F A; Galeota, J A; Nelson, E; Brodersen, B; Doster, A; Wills, R; Zuckermann, F; Laegreid, W W",Virology,17,20

DESIGN This study was conducted as part of the service evaluation audit. SETTING Tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS All patients with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus referred for RFA were included for analysis. White light high-resolution endoscopy (HRE), autofluorescence imaging and narrow band imaging were sequentially performed. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was performed for all VL. Three to six months after EMR, all patients underwent initial RFA and then repeat RFA procedures at three monthly intervals. INTERVENTIONS All endoscopy reports and final staging by EMR/surgery were evaluated and included for analysis. RESULTS Fifty patients were analysed; median age 73 years, 84% men. 38/50 patients (76%) had a previous EMR due to the presence of VL before referred for ablation; twelve patients had no previous treatment. In total, 151 ablation procedures were performed, median per patient 2.68. Twenty metachronous VL were identified in 14 patients before the first ablation or during the RFA protocol; incidence was 28%. All metachronous lesions were successfully resected by EMR. Upstaging after rescue EMR compared with the initial histology was observed in four patients (28%). CONCLUSIONS In total, 28% of patients enrolled in the RFA programme were diagnosed to have metachronous lesions. This high-incidence rate highlights the importance of a meticulous examination to identify and resect any VL before every ablation session. RFA treatment for early Barrett's neoplasia should be performed in tertiary referral centres with HRE and EMR facilities and expertise.","Ortiz-Fernández-Sordo, J; Sami, S; Mansilla-Vivar, R; De Caestecker, J; Cole, A; Ragunath, K",Frontline gastroenterology,17,1

Since then, the teaching staff have had to adapt to the new telematic classes, and in September 2020 they have had to return to face-to-face classes, taking different hygiene measures to prevent contagion. The changes in teaching methods and the lack of guidelines for the new teaching challenges have created a lot of uncertainty in this sector. The aim of the present study was to measure the levels of stress, anxiety and depression of teaching staff in the face of the reopening of schools and universities after 6 months of absence from face-to-face classes. METHODS A total of 1,633 teachers from the Department of Education of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) took part, all of them professionals working in different educational centres, from early childhood education to university studies. The questionnaire, DASS-21, was applied to measure the symptomatology presented by the teaching staff in relation to the reopening of the centres. RESULTS The results show that 32.2% of the participants had symptoms of depression, 49.4% had symptoms of anxiety and 50.6% had symptoms of stress. CONCLUSIONS The results show that teachers have symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. Therefore, it is important to take care of the mental health of teachers in order to take care of the mental health of students and the quality of teaching.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Dosil Santamaría, María; Idoiaga Mondragon, Nahia; Berasategi Santxo, Naiara",Revista espanola de salud publica,17,29

Management of high-risk patients with early intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, as a majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction. The proposed methods were thoroughly evaluated on datasets separately collected from three hospitals, one in the United States, one in Iran, and another in Italy, with a total 295 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay positive COVID-19 pneumonia. Our experimental results demonstrate that adding non-imaging features can significantly improve the performance of prediction to achieve AUC up to 0.884 and sensitivity as high as 96.1%, which can be valuable to provide clinical decision support in managing COVID-19 patients. Our methods may also be applied to other lung diseases including but not limited to community acquired pneumonia.","Chao, Hanqing; Fang, Xi; Zhang, Jiajin; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Arru, Chiara D; Digumarthy, Subba R; Babaei, Rosa; Mobin, Hadi K; Mohseni, Iman; Saba, Luca; Carriero, Alessandro; Falaschi, Zeno; Pasche, Alessio; Wang, Ge; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Yan, Pingkun",ArXiv,17,9

STUDY DESIGN Morbidly obese patients aged 18 years or older were identified in an employer claims database of more than 5 million beneficiaries (1999-2005) using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 278.01. Each of 3651 patients who underwent bariatric surgery during this period was matched to a control subject who was morbidly obese and never underwent bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery patients and controls were matched based on patient demographics, selected comorbidities, and costs. METHODS Total healthcare costs for bariatric surgery patients and their controls were recorded for 6 months before surgery through the end their continuous enrollment. To account for potential differences in patient characteristics, we calculated the cost differential by estimating a Tobit model. A return on investment was estimated from the resulting coefficients. Costs were inflation adjusted to 2005 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Care, and the cost savings were discounted by 3.07%, the month Treasury bill rate during the same period. RESULTS The mean bariatric surgery investment ranged from approximately $17,000 to $26,000. After controlling for observable patient characteristics, we estimated all costs to have been recouped within 2 years for laparoscopic surgery patients and within 4 years for open surgery patients. CONCLUSIONS Downstream savings associated with bariatric surgery are estimated to offset the initial costs in 2 to 4 years. Randomized or quasiexperimental studies would be useful to confirm this conclusion, as unobserved characteristics may influence the decision to undergo surgery and cannot be controlled for in this analysis.","Cremieux, Pierre-Yves; Buchwald, Henry; Shikora, Scott A; Ghosh, Arindam; Yang, Haixia Elaine; Buessing, Marric",The American journal of managed care,17,10

METHODS After the preliminary research of the normal values, rats were infected by E. coli intraperitoneally. Four groups were assigned into ""no therapy"", ""given NO"", ""given antibiotic"", ""given antibiotic + NO"" groups. RESULTS The decline of RF and WBC levels on 3rd and 5th days was recorded in antibiotic + NO group versus the other groups. It was observed that group 4 was superior to the others. The positivity of periton cultures and the inflammation in the muscle were found to be less in antibiotic + NO group. No correlation was found between pathological and microbiological recovery and blood CRP level in all groups. But a significant decrease in blood procalcitonin level was determined in group 4 compared to the other groups. On day 3, procalcitonin and CRP levels increased with increasing WBC levels. On day 5, procalcitonin levels also decreased in groups with decreased WBC levels, but no significant correlation was found between CRP and WBC levels. CONCLUSION It was concluded that using of NO in addition to antibiotherapy could increase the success rate of experimental intraabdominal sepsis therapy and blood procalcitonin and WBC levels could be more beneficial than CRP levels in monitoring of the severity of the sepsis.","Yücel, Tayfun; Gönüllü, Doğan; Güçlü, Salih; Sit, Mustafa; Adaleti, Riza; Tetikkurt, Seza; Ozcan, Ali; Köksoy, Ferda Nihat",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,17,33

Wentworth, S. G. Sawicki, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 71:9499-9507, 1997). The spike (S) gene of MHV/BHK had 63 point mutations and a 21-bp insert that encoded 56 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert compared to the parental MHV strain A59. Recombinant viruses between MHV-A59 and MHV/BHK were selected in hamster cells. All of the recombinants retained 21 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert found in the N-terminal region of S of MHV/BHK, suggesting that these residues were responsible for the extended host range of MHV/BHK. Flow cytometry showed that MHV-A59 bound only to cells that expressed the murine glycoprotein receptor CEACAM1a. In contrast, MHV/BHK and a recombinant virus, k6c, with the 21 amino acid substitutions and 7-amino-acid insert in S bound to hamster (BHK) and ST cells as well as murine cells. Thus, 21 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert in the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein of MHV/BHK confer the ability to bind and in some cases infect cells of nonmurine species.","Schickli, Jeanne H; Thackray, Larissa B; Sawicki, Stanley G; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,17,1

The inhibitor was identified through high-throughput screening of a compound library using a luciferase-expressing West Nile (WN) virus infection assay. The compound inhibited an epidemic strain of WN virus without detectable cytotoxicity (a 50% effective concentration of 28 microM and a compound concentration of >or=300 microM required to reduce 50% cell viability). Besides WN virus, the compound also inhibited other flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses), an alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus), a coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus), and a rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus). However, the compound did not suppress an orthomyxovirus (influenza virus) or a retrovirus (human immunodeficiency virus type 1). Mode-of-action analyses in WN virus showed that the compound did not inhibit viral entry or virion assembly but specifically suppressed viral RNA synthesis. To examine the mechanism of inhibition of dengue virus, we developed two replicon systems for dengue type 1 virus: (i) a stable cell line that harbored replicons containing a luciferase reporter and a neomycin phosphotransferase selection marker and (ii) a luciferase-expressing replicon that could differentiate between viral translation and RNA replication. Analyses of the compound in the dengue type 1 virus replicon systems showed that it weakly suppressed viral translation but significantly inhibited viral RNA synthesis. Overall, the results demonstrate that triaryl pyrazoline exerts a broad spectrum of antiflavivirus activity through potent inhibition of viral RNA replication.

In first group 44.85 % mild, 36.17 % moderate and 13.98 % had severe disease, while in second group figure is 3.39 % 1.21 % and 0.40 % respectively. Probability of TB providing immunity against developing moderate or severe form of Covid-19 pneumonia is 0.6778. CONCLUSIONS Patients with active or past history of TB are less prone to develop moderate or severe form of Covid-19 pneumonia. It may be the reason for less mortality in health resource poor India as compared to Europe or America.","Sharma, Rajaram; Lodha, Sambhav; Mehta, Ritu; Chugh, Sunil; Mathur, Girish",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,17,16

Although there are some jurisdictional differences in legislation operating at sub-national levels, this article addresses some common themes that have emerged since the outbreak of the pandemic in Australia in early 2020. One of the major concerns which has emerged is the issue of proving the causal link between COVID-19 and work. In some jurisdictions, legislation has specifically addressed these causation concerns. While the number of workers' compensation claims overall is low, there are specific industries which have been heavily affected by the pandemic which may result in a spike in claims in areas such as aged care and the medical and allied professions. We speculate that a number of legal and practical concerns will emerge that may in time contribute to some new jurisprudence in the workers' compensation arena.","Guthrie, Robert; Aurbach, Robert; Ciccarelli, Marina",Journal of law and medicine,17,16

In both L-2 cells and Roc-1 cells the enzyme was found to be localized predominantly in the endosomal fraction. The enzyme is optimally active at pH 7.0 and has a requirement for Mn++ ions. This PPPase activity is distinguishable from acidic and alkaline phosphatases.

Radioimmunoprecipitation of intracellular viral polypeptides showed that 17 hybridomas recognized both the peplomer protein [E2, 220 X 10(3) mol. wt. (220K)] and a lower mol. wt. species (E'2, 175K), which was characterized as a precursor of E2. Six MAbs selectively immunoprecipitated the E'2 protein. Four hybridomas were directed against the low mol. wt. envelope protein (E1, 29K), and three against the nucleoprotein (N, 47K). All major neutralization-mediating determinants were found to be carried by the peplomers. Several anti-E2 MAbs displayed an intrinsic neutralizing activity close to that of the most potent anti-TGEV polyclonal reagents tested (including ascitic fluid of feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cats). None of the anti-E'2 MAbs induced significant neutralization, although this protein might be incorporated to some extent into the virions. Immunofluorescence patterns obtained with MAbs directed against either the envelope glycoproteins or the nucleocapsid revealed distinctly different distributions of these antigens within the cells. Comparison of nine TGEV strains using our panel of MAbs confirmed their close antigenic relationship, but revealed the occurrence of distinct antigenic differences.","Laude, H; Chapsal, J M; Gelfi, J; Labiau, S; Grosclaude, J",The Journal of general virology,17,1

The symptoms most commonly reported by patients affected by COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. In this report, we present a case of a 57-year-old woman who presented to the clinic's infectious department with swelling, pain, warmth, and redness in the left leg who was treated with therapeutic heparin. There were no typical and distinguished symptoms of COVID-19, and she had no risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. Then chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacity, and computed tomography angiography was performed to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism, which showed no evidence of thrombosis. Left lower limb venous color Doppler ultrasound revealed dilatation and thrombosis in the external iliac and left iliac veins up to the level of the bifurcation of the common iliac veins, as well as thrombosis to the superficial and small saphenous veins. Because of ground-glass opacity and lymphopenia, nasal swabs were used for sampling, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472). Results from this study showed that the need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations mediate the relationship between COVID-19 concern and prejudice against migrants in both countries. When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor.The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants.","Bianco, Fleur; Kosic, Ankica; Pierro, Antonio",J Soc Psychol,17,22

Clinically, this is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections or development of several diseases. Since lifestyle factors can play a significant role in reducing the hallmarks of immune aging and inflammation, we investigated the effect of a 6 week low-dose combined resistance and endurance training program. Forty participants (70.3 ± 5.0 years) were randomly assigned to either a training (TG) or control group (CG) and performed a controlled low-threshold and care-oriented 6-week-long combined resistance and endurance training program. Changes in anthropometrics as well as strength capacity were measured. In subgroups of TG and CG, T cells and their subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, naïve, central, effector memory, T-EMRA) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The changes of various plasma cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adipokines were analyzed by luminex assays. The exercise program was followed by an increase in strength capacities. Participants of TG showed an increase of the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio over time (p < 0.05). Significant decreases in systemic levels of interleukin (IL-) 6, IL-8, IL-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (p < 0.05) were observed for participants of TG over time.

METHODS: A total of 8,940 adolescents (45.77% males; Mean age=15.31±0.018 years old) and their parents (24.34% males; Mean age=40.78±0.60 years old) from Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, participated in the survey and completed several questionnaires online. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Family Adaptability Cohesion Scale, Second Edition, Chinese version (FACES II-CV) to evaluate depressive symptoms and family cohesion and family adaptability from the perception of parents and adolescents. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences between adolescents' and parents' perspectives of family functions. Significant negative correlations exist between depressive symptoms and family cohesion and family adaptability from the perspectives of both adolescents and parents. In addition, regression models with demographic characteristics adjusted showed that the perceived family cohesion and adaptability of parents and adolescents and the agreements between them could be predicted by their depressive symptoms. LIMITATION: Cross-sectional study and limited population-wide are limitations. CONCLUSION: Detecting the depressive symptoms of adolescents and parents earlier and promptly providing family intervention are of great significance to promote their perceptions of family cohesion and adaptability, which contribute to the mental health development of adolescents and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Mengxue; Li, Lili; Wu, Feng; Cao, Yang; Zhang, Huanrui; Li, Xin; Zou, Jie; Guo, Zhongwu; Kong, Lingtao",J Affect Disord,17,30

In Experiment 1, corn and sorghum grains were milled, reconstituted to 35% moisture, and ensiled in a bag silo for 10 different times. There were three replications per ensiling time and grain source. Samples from each replication were analyzed in triplicate for total nitrogen (N), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), soluble N, insoluble N, and neutral detergent insoluble nitrogen (NDIN). In Experiment 2, five Nellore bulls were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Four diets were comprised of 28.4% corn silage, 10.7% supplement, and 60.9% dry ground corn, dry ground sorghum, reconstituted and ensiled corn, or reconstituted and ensiled ground sorghum. An additional diet comprised of 45% corn silage, 10.7% supplement, and 44.3% dry ground corn (Roughage+) was used.

Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4. The reconstitution and ensiling process reduced (P < 0.05) the insoluble N fraction, increased (P < 0.05) non-protein nitrogen of corn and sorghum grains, tended (P = 0.052) to increase microbial efficiency, and increased (P < 0.05) intestinal and total digestion of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), and starch. The concentrate level affected neither (P > 0.05) DM intake nor rumen pH. On the other hand, bulls fed diets based on 72% concentrate showed greater (P < 0.05) DM, OM, and CP digestibility compared with those fed a diet based on 55% concentrate. In addition, animals fed diets based on corn grains (both reconstituted and ensiled or dry) presented greater (P < 0.05) intestinal and total starch digestion compared to those fed sorghum grain. Therefore, the reconstitution process can reduce the insoluble N fraction and increase nutrient availability.","Silva, Breno de Castro; Pacheco, Marcos Vinicius Carneiro; Godoi, Letícia Artuzo; Alhadas, Herlon Menegueli; Pereira, Jéssica Marcela Vieira; Rennó, Luciana Navajas; Detmann, Edenio; Paulino, Pedro Veiga Rodrigues; Schoonmaker, Jon Patrick; Valadares Filho, Sebastião de Campos",PLoS One,17,30

Residency programme stakeholders would benefit from knowledge on what students and physicians expect from this process. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to describe and contrast the perspectives of student applicants and interviewing physicians related to the residency programme virtual interview process. METHODS: A survey consisting of 24 Likert statements was administered across listservs in summer 2020 to physicians (attendings and residents who interview medical students). Medical students also received an anonymous survey and were recruited via email to participate. RESULTS: A total of 155 individuals (104 fourth-year medical students and 51 physicians) completed a survey. Results showed students would prefer in-person interviews over virtual. Residency applicants had high agreement on the limited ability to fully assess the programme and city due to virtual interviews. Individuals with lower step 1 scores had higher agreement on preferring in-person interviews. Individuals in the lowest and highest scoring groups appear more worried about the representation of themselves as a result of virtual interviews. Furthermore, applicants feel that more weight will be placed on steps 1 and 2 scores and class ranks, and they may not be able to fully demonstrate their personality compared with interviewers.

Yet, description of acute invasive fungal sinusitis with its management in those patients is still scarce. This study aims to describe this recently increasing clinical entity in relation to COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective study. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study included patients diagnosed with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis after a recent COVID-19 infection. Antifungal agents given included amphotericin B, voriconazole, and/or posaconazole. Surgical treatment was restricted to patients with PCR negative results for COVID-19. Endoscopic, open, and combined approaches were utilized to eradicate infection. Follow-up for survived patients was maintained regularly for the first postoperative month. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients with a mean age of 52.92 ± 11.30 years old were included. Most common associated disease was diabetes mellitus (27.8%). Mycological analysis revealed infection with Mucor and Aspergillus species in 77.8% and 30.6% of patients, respectively. Sino-nasal, orbital, cerebral, and palatine involvement was found in 100%, 80.6%, 27.8%, and 33.3% of patients, respectively. The most common reported symptoms and signs are facial pain (75%), facial numbness (66.7%), ophthalmoplegia, and visual loss (63.9%). All patients were treated simultaneously by surgical debridement with antifungal medications except for two patients with PCR-positive swab for COVID-19. These two patients received antifungal therapy alone. Overall survival rate was 63.89% (23/36). CONCLUSION: Clinical suspicion of acute invasive fungal sinusitis among COVID-19 patients and early management with antifungal therapy and surgical debridement is essential for better outcomes and higher survival.

The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) reports almost everyone who is sexually active will encounter the virus at some time during their life. Most of the estimated 79 million infections occur among people who are in their late teens or early 20s. Since 2006, there has been a vaccine available to prevent HPV infections in both males and females; however, administration of this vaccine has only been about half the rate of other vaccines and vaccine hesitancy may play a role.

Molecular dynamics simulations with the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics potentials (QM(DFT)/MM-MD) followed by the electron density analysis are employed to evaluate geometry and electronic properties of the enzyme with different substrates along MD trajectories. We demonstrate that mapping the Laplacian of the electron density and the electron localization function provides easily visible images of the substrate activation that allow one to distinguish rES and nES. The computed fractions of reactive enzyme-substrate complexes along MD trajectories well correlate with the findings of recent experimental studies on the substrate specificity of Mpro. The results of our simulations demonstrate the role of the theory level used in QM subsystems for a proper description of the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine residue in Mpro. The activation of the carbonyl group of a substrate is correctly characterized with the hybrid DFT functional PBE0, whereas the use of a GGA-type PBE functional, that lacks the admixture of the Hartree-Fock exchange fails to describe activation.","Khrenova, Maria G; Tsirelson, Vladimir G; Nemukhin, Alexander V",Phys Chem Chem Phys,17,23

To shed light on how the Philippines initially managed the disease, our paper analyzed the early phase of the government's pandemic response. Using machine learning, we compiled the official press releases issued by the Department of Health from early January to mid-April 2020 where a total of 283,560 datasets amounting to 2.5 megabytes (Mb) were analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. Our results revealed five latent themes: the highest effort (40%) centered on ""Nationwide Reporting of COVID-19 Status"", while ""Contact Tracing of Suspected and Infected Individuals"" had the least focus at only 11.68%- indicating a lack of priority in this area. Our findings suggest that while the government was ill-prepared in the early phase of the pandemic, it exerted efforts in rearranging its fiscal and operational priorities toward the management of the disease. However, we emphasize that this article should be read and understood with caution. More than a year has already passed since the outbreak in the country and many (in)actions and challenges have adversely impacted its response. These include the Duterte administration's securitization and militarization of pandemic response and its apparent failure to find a balance between the lives and livelihoods of Filipinos, to name a few. We strongly recommend that other scholars study the various aspects of the government's response, i.e., economic, peace and security, agriculture, and business, to assess better how the country responded and continually responds to the pandemic.","Cuaton, Ginbert Permejo; Caluza, Las Johansen Balios; Neo, Joshua Francisco Vibar",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,17,16

We aimed to assess the incidence and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in an urban region during the pandemic, compared with non-pandemic periods. METHODS: We did a population-based, observational study using data for non-traumatic OHCA (N=30â768), systematically collected since May 15, 2011, in Paris and its suburbs, France, using the Paris Fire Brigade database, together with in-hospital data. We evaluated OHCA incidence and outcomes over a 6-week period during the pandemic in adult inhabitants of the study area. FINDINGS: Comparing the 521 OHCAs of the pandemic period (March 16 to April 26, 2020) to the mean of the 3052 total of the same weeks in the non-pandemic period (weeks 12-17, 2012-19), the maximum weekly OHCA incidence increased from 13·42 (95% CI 12·77-14·07) to 26·64 (25·72-27·53) per million inhabitants (p<0·0001), before returning to normal in the final weeks of the pandemic period. Although patient demographics did not change substantially during the pandemic compared with the non-pandemic period (mean age 69·7 years [SD 17] vs 68·5 [18], 334 males [64·4%] vs 1826 [59·9%]), there was a higher rate of OHCA at home (460 [90·2%] vs 2336 [76·8%]; p<0·0001), less bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (239 [47·8%] vs 1165 [63·9%]; p<0·0001) and shockable rhythm (46 [9·2%] vs 472 [19·1%]; p<0·0001), and longer delays to intervention (median 10·4 min [IQR 8·4-13·8] vs 9·4 min [7·9-12·6]; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who had an OHCA and were admitted alive decreased from 22·8% to 12·8% (p<0·0001) in the pandemic period. After adjustment for potential confounders, the pandemic period remained significantly associated with lower survival rate at hospital admission (odds ratio 0·36, 95% CI 0·24-0·52; p<0·0001). COVID-19 infection, confirmed or suspected, accounted for approximately a third of the increase in OHCA incidence during the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: A transient two-times increase in OHCA incidence, coupled with a reduction in survival, was observed during the specified time period of the pandemic when compared with the equivalent time period in previous years with no pandemic. Although this result might be partly related to COVID-19 infections, indirect effects associated with lockdown and adjustment of health-care services to the pandemic are probable. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when considering mortality data and public health strategies.

PACT focuses on the transitional phase between hospital and primary care for elderly patients in Northern Norway with complex and long-term needs (CLN). PACT emphasises a person-centred care approach whereby the sharing of power and the patient's response to ""What matters to you?"" drives care decisions. However, during the Covid-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic, VC was the only option for assessing, planning, coordinating and performing treatment and care. This study explores how PACT managed to maintain person-centred care under these conditions. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we address the following research questions: How does PACT preserve a person-centred focus on care for persons with CLN in care services when VC becomes the main mode of clinical communication due to the social distancing measures during the Covid-19 pandemic? What are the challenges and opportunities for healthcare personnel in PACT when it is necessary to make a rapid transfer from face-to-face care to video meetings? METHODS: This case study takes a qualitative approach based on four semi-structured focus group interviews carried out in May and June 2020 with 19 PACT members and leaders. RESULTS: The case study illustrates that VC is a good solution for many persons with CLN and generates new opportunities for interaction between patients and healthcare personnel. Persons with CLN are a heterogeneous group, and for many patients with reduced cognitive capacity and/or hearing and seeing disabilities, the use of VC was challenging and required support from relatives or healthcare personnel. The study shows that using VC offered an opportunity to use healthcare personnel more efficiently, reduce travelling time for patients and improve the information exchange between healthcare levels. This suggests that the integration of VC contributed to the preservation of the person-centred focus on care during the Covid-19 pandemic. There was an overall agreement in PACT that face-to-face care needed to be at the core of the person-centred care approach; the main use of VC was to support follow-up and coordination. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic and the rapid adoption of digital care has generated a unique opportunity to continue developing a health service to not only preserve but also improve the person-centred care approach for persons with CLN. This creates demand for overall agreements, including guidelines and procedures for how and when VC is a useful supplement to face-to-face treatment and care. Implementing VC in clinical practice generates a need for systematic training and familiarisation with the equipment and technology, as well as for an extensive support organisation. VC can then contribute to making healthcare services better prepared for future scenarios.","Silsand, Line; Severinsen, Gro-Hilde; Berntsen, Gro",,17,1

To resolve these complications the local FeH needs to be recovered. Hepcidin, as a master regulator of FeH is both a major player in the recovery and a marker of an efficacy of the restoration. Therefore, both local and systemic hepcidin levels could serve as a dynamic marker of disease progression (the more hepcidin the worse is disease) and treatment efficacy (after iron homeostasis is recovered hepcidin disappears). On the contrast, artificial attempts to suppress hepcidin expression directly or application of hepcidin antagonists could be detrimental. Overall, more comprehensive research of hepcidin role in COVID-19 pathology is needed.","Sukhomlin, Tatiana",Acta Biomed,17,24

OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the immune status of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 in the third trimester. METHODS: Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns. RESULTS: None of the 51 newborns showed fever or respiratory distress during hospitalization. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs was negative. Except for the low level of CD16-CD56 cells, the count and proportion of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 were all in the normal range. Moreover, the serum IgG and IgM levels were within the normal range, whereas IL-6 showed increased levels. There was no correlation between maternal COVID-19 duration and the lymphocyte subsets or cytokine levels (IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels and CD16-CD56 cells.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and test an accurate detection and severity classification methodology that may help medical professionals and non-radiologists recognize the behavior and propagation mechanisms of the virus by viewing computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs with implicit materials. METHODS: In this study, the process of detecting the virus began with the deployment of a virtual material inside CT images of the lungs of 128 patients. Virtual material is a hypothetical material that can penetrate the healthy regions in the image by performing sequential numerical measurements to interpret images with high data accuracy. The proposed method also provides a segmented image of only the healthy parts of the lung. RESULTS: The resulting segmented images, which represent healthy parts of the lung, are classified into six levels of severity. These levels are classified according to physical symptoms. The results of the proposed methodology are compared with those of the radiologists' reports. This comparison revealed that the gold-standard reports correlated with the results of the proposed methodology with a high accuracy rate of 93%.

METHODS: This observational study recruited a convenience sample of three patients. Procedures were performed in a positive pressure operating room. Particle image velocimetry and spectrometry with air sampling were used for aerosol detection. RESULTS: Intubation and extubation generated small particles (< 5 µm) in mean concentrations 12 times greater than background noise (p < 0.001). The mean particle concentrations during endonasal access were 4.5 times greater than background (p = 0.01). Particles were typically large (> 75 µm), remained airborne for up to 10 s and travelled up to 1.1 m. Use of a microdebrider generated mean aerosol concentrations 18 times above baseline (p = 0.005). High-speed drilling did not produce aerosols greater than baseline. Pituitary tumour resection generated mean aerosol concentrations less than background (p = 0.18). Surgical drape removal generated small and large particles in mean concentrations 6.4 times greater than background (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Intubation and extubation generate large amounts of small particles that remain suspended in air for long durations and disperse through theatre.

The goal of this work was the development, characterization, and evaluation of the cytocompatibility of otoliths-incorporated sodium alginate and gelatin scaffolds. Cynoscion acoupa-derived otoliths were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (FRX), particle size, free lime, and weight loss by calcination. Furthermore, otoliths were incorporated into sodium alginate (ALG/OTL-s) or gelatin (GEL/OTL-s) scaffolds, previously developed by freeze-drying. Then, the scaffolds were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transform (FTIR), swelling tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytotoxicity assays were run against J774.G8 macrophages and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Data obtained from TGA/DTG, DSC, and FTIR analyses confirmed the interaction between otoliths and the polymeric scaffolds. SEM showed the homogeneous porous 3D structure rich in otolith micro-fragments in both scaffolds. Swelling of the GEL/OTL-s (63.54 ± 3.0%) was greater than of ALG/OTL-s (13.36 ± 9.9%) (p < 0.001). The viability of J774.G8 macrophages treated with both scaffolds was statistically similar to the group treated with DMEM only (p > 0.05) and significantly higher than that treated with Triton-X (p < 0.01) at 72 h. Both scaffolds showed approximately 100% growth of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts by 24 h, similarly to control (p > 0.05). However, by 48 h, only ALG/OTL-s showed growth similar to control (p > 0.05), whereas GEL/OTL showed a significantly lower growth index (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the physicochemical profiles suggest proper interaction between the otoliths and the two developed polymeric 3D scaffolds. Moreover, both materials showed cytocompatibility with J774.G8 macrophages but the growth of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts was higher when exposed to ALG/OTL-s. These data suggest that sodium alginate/otoliths scaffolds are potential biomaterials to be used in bone regeneration applications.

The therapeutic effects of MSCs have been extensively investigated in several pre-clinical models of critical illness as well as in phase I and II clinical cell therapy trials with mixed results. Whilst these studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential for MSC therapy in critical illness, optimization for clinical use is an ongoing challenge. MSCs can be readily genetically modified by application of different techniques and tools leading to overexpress or inhibit genes related to their immunomodulatory or regenerative functions. Here we will review recent approaches designed to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs with an emphasis on the technology used to generate genetically modified cells, target genes, target diseases and the implication of genetically modified MSCs in cell therapy for critical illness.","Varkouhi, Amir K; Monteiro, Ana Paula Teixeira; Tsoporis, James N; Mei, Shirley H J; Stewart, Duncan J; Dos Santos, Claudia C",Stem Cell Rev Rep,17,16

The clinical features of COVID-19 were mentioned in previous studies. However, risk factors for COVID-19 are not fully recognized. The aim of this study is to characterize risk factors and clinical features of COVID-19 disease in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective, chart-review, case-control study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data on patients diagnosed between March 18 and May 18, 2020 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We reviewed medical records on 297 suspected cases of COVID-19. Of these, 175 (59%) tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and considered as cases, while 122 (41%) tested negative and considered as control. COVID-19 positive cases were more likely to be males, and non-health care providers. Hypertension (15%), diabetes (10%) and two or more concurrent comorbidities (54.4%) were more prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Patients presented with fever, cough, and loss of taste/smell were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (P = 0.001, 0.008, 0.008; respectively). Radiological evidence of pneumonia was associated with confirmed COVID-19 disease (P = 0.001). Shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 at presentation. On admission, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets were significantly lower among COVID-19 patients compared with controls. Surprisingly, D-Dimer levels were lower among COVID-19 positive patients when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Male gender, hypertension, and diabetes are the most commonly observed risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. COVID-19 patient had significantly lower lymphocyte and neutrophil counts.","Kamel, Fatemah O; Magadmi, Rania M; Alqutub, Sulafa T; Badawi, Maha; Al-Sayes, Fatin; Badawi, Mazen; Madni, Tariq A; Alhothali, Areej; Abozinadah, Ehab A; Adam, Soheir",J Infect Public Health,17,1

RESULTS: Of 1289 DEGs identified, 568 were downregulated and 721 were upregulated. The DEGs were mainly associated with oxidative stress, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, inflammation, cell cycle, and protein binding. Eight DEGs were identified as hub genes, including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (Cxcl5), connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), interleukin 6 (IL6), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (Mapk14), platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (Timp1), and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (Timp2). IL6 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of neonates with BPD. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, BPD involves complex biological changes.

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50 % detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity often increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.","Belloir, Antoine; Blanquart, François",Epidemics,17,1

DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases were searched using a combination of key words such as ""Coronavirus and/or pregnancy,"" ""COVID and/or pregnancy,"" ""COVID disease and/or pregnancy,"" and ""COVID pneumonia and/or pregnancy."" There was no restriction of language to allow collection of as many cases as possible. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies of pregnant women who received a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis using acid nucleic test, with reported data about pregnancy, and, in case of delivery, reported outcomes, were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: All the studies included have been evaluated according to the tool for evaluating the methodological quality of case reports and case series described by Murad et al. RESULTS: Six studies that involved 51 pregnant women were eligible for the systematic review. At the time of the report, 3 pregnancies were ongoing; of the remaining 48 pregnant women, 46 gave birth by cesarean delivery, and 2 gave birth vaginally; in this study, 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death were reported. CONCLUSION: Although vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and neonates has been generally good, the high rate of preterm delivery by cesarean delivery is a reason for concern. Cesarean delivery was typically an elective surgical intervention, and it is reasonable to question whether cesarean delivery for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was warranted. Coronavirus disease 2019 associated with respiratory insufficiency in late pregnancies certainly creates a complex clinical scenario.","Della Gatta, Anna Nunzia; Rizzo, Roberta; Pilu, Gianluigi; Simonazzi, Giuliana",Am J Obstet Gynecol,17,1

The transcriptional antiviral response is known to vary between infected cells from a single individual, yet how genetic variants across individuals modulate the antiviral response (and its cell-to-cell variability) is not well understood. Here, we triggered the antiviral response in human fibroblasts from 68 healthy donors, and profiled tens of thousands of cells using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed GASPACHO (GAuSsian Processes for Association mapping leveraging Cell HeterOgeneity), the first statistical approach designed to identify dynamic eQTLs across a transcriptional trajectory of cell populations, without aggregating single-cell data into pseudo-bulk. This allows us to uncover the underlying architecture and variability of antiviral response across responding cells, and to identify more than two thousands eQTLs modulating the dynamic changes during this response. Many of these eQTLs colocalise with risk loci identified in GWAS of infectious and autoimmune diseases. As a case study, we focus on a COVID-19 susceptibility locus, colocalised with the antiviral OAS1 splicing QTL. We validated it in blood cells from a patient cohort and in the infected nasal cells of a patient with the risk allele, demonstrating the utility of GASPACHO to fine-map and functionally characterise a genetic locus. In summary, our novel analytical approach provides a new framework for delineation of the genetic variants that shape a wide spectrum of transcriptional responses at single-cell resolution.","Kumasaka, Natsuhiko; Rostom, Raghd; Huang, Ni; Polanski, Krzysztof; Meyer, Kerstin; Patel, Sharad; Boyd, Rachel; Gomez, Celine; Barnett, Sam; Panousis, Nikolaos; Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Ghoussaini, Maya; Lyons, Paul A.; Calero-Nieto, Fernando J.; Göttgens, Berthold; Barnes, Josephine L.; Worlock, Kaylee B.; Yoshida, Masahiro; Nikolic, Marko; Stephenson, Emily; Reynolds, Gary; Haniffa, Muzlifah; Marioni, John; Stegle, Oliver; Hagai, Tzachi; Teichmann, Sarah A.",,17,16

However, still, there is scarce information regarding the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of students towards COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to assess the KAP and associated factors of preventive measures against COVID-19 among students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 422 students. The sample was proportionally allocated into the randomly selected four colleges, and the students were recruited using a systematic random sampling technique. Variables with p-value < 0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression analysis were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model. Results: This study involved 408 students with response rate of 96.6%. The levels of good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19 were 69.6%, 56.6% and 65% respectively. After adjusting for covariates, being in the late adolescent age group (16-20), living with > 5 family size, and being single were predictors of knowledge level. Besides, being single, attending diploma (TVET) level trainings, and being year-two students were predictors of attitude levels. Similarly, urban residence, being regular students, and being year-one students were the independent predictors of practice level of students. Conclusion: In this study, only two-third of the students had good preventive practice level towards COVID-19, which is below the Organization's recommendation. Thus, the national, regional and local governments should develop effective and inclusive prevention strategies to address students who are at home due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Tadesse, Abay Woday; Abebe, Negesse Melese; Tadesse, Sisay Eshete; Wube, Mulugeta Chanie; Abate, Ahmed Ali",Ethiop J Health Sci,17,8

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of abnormal liver tests on admission of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 1611 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through July 31, 2020 in 38 different Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters, including liver function tests, on admission and during hospitalization. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We fit multivariable logistic regression models, further post-estimation effect through margins and inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Overall, 57.8% of the patients were male with a mean age of 52.3 years, 8.5% had chronic liver disease and 3.4% had cirrhosis. Abnormal liver tests on admission were present on 45.2% (CI 42.7-47.7) of the cohort (nâ¯=â¯726). Overall, 15.1% (CI 13.4-16.9) of patients died (nâ¯=â¯244). Patients with abnormal liver tests on admission presented higher mortality 18.7% (CI 15.9-21.7), compared to those with normal liver biochemistries 12.2% (CI 10.1-14.6); Pâ¯<â¯.0001). After excluding patients with history of chronic liver disease, abnormal liver tests on admission were independently associated with death [OR 1.5 (CI 1.1-2.0); Pâ¯=â¯0.01], and severe COVID-19 (2.6 [2.0-3.3], Pâ¯<â¯.0001), both adjusted by age, gender, diabetes, pneumonia and body mass index >30.

Empirical evidence has been provided regarding role of air pollution in accelerated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy as well as Wuhan. Lockdown-related reduction in PM2.5levels in ambient air may have contributed to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. High PM2.5levels in the past might have added to SARS-CoV-2 related mortality due to air pollution relate comorbidities.

Methods: This is a prospective observational study conducted on patients with SARS-Co-V-2 infection, at a dedicated tertiary COVID-19 hospital in South India from April 1 to July 31, 2020. At the time of their admission to the COVID hospital, demographic data such as name, age, sex was recorded. A thorough history regarding the onset, duration, progression, nature of symptoms and its associated factors, medication history, treatment history were elicited and documented. Ocular examination was performed under torchlight by an ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Further investigations including imaging were sought for, depending on clinical indications. Serial follow-up examinations of all patients were carried out every 72 hours or when patients complained of any ocular symptoms whichever earlier, until discharge. All relevant data were compiled and statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 2742 patients were examined. Of them, 1461 (53.28%) were males and 1281 (46.72%) were females. The mean age (±SD) was 39.46 ± 17.63 years. None of the patients in our study had any ocular symptoms or signs as the presenting complaint at the time of their admission.

However, the total deficit in screening in the US associated with the pandemic and the differential impact on individuals in different geographic regions and by socioeconomic status (SES) index have yet to be fully characterized. Objectives: To quantify the screening rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different geographic regions and for individuals in different SES index quartiles and estimate the overall cancer screening deficit in 2020 across the US population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study uses the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which comprises single-payer administrative claims data and enrollment information covering approximately 60 million people in Medicare Advantage and commercial health plans from across geographically diverse regions of the US. Participants were individuals in the database in January through July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 without diagnosis of the cancer of interest prior to the analytic index month. Exposures: Analytic index month and year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening. Results: Screening for all 3 cancers declined sharply in March through May of 2020 compared with 2019, with the sharpest decline in April (breast, -90.8%; colorectal, -79.3%; prostate, -63.4%) and near complete recovery of monthly screening rates by July for breast and prostate cancers. The absolute deficit across the US population in screening associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be 3.9 million (breast), 3.8 million (colorectal), and 1.6 million (prostate). Geographic differences were observed: the Northeast experienced the sharpest declines in screening, while the West had a slower recovery compared with the Midwest and South. For example, percentage change in breast cancer screening rate (2020 vs 2019) for the month of April ranged from -87.3% (95% CI, -87.9% to -86.7%) in the West to -94.5% (95% CI, -94.9% to -94.1%) in the Northeast (decline). For the month of July, it ranged from -0.3% (95% CI, -2.1% to 1.5%) in the Midwest to -10.6% (-12.6% to -8.4%) in the West (recovery). By SES, the largest screening decline was observed in individuals in the highest SES index quartile, leading to a narrowing in the disparity in cancer screening by SES in 2020. For example, prostate cancer screening rates per 100â¯000 enrollees for individuals in the lowest and highest SES index quartiles, respectively, were 3525 (95% CI, 3444 to 3607) and 4329 (95% CI, 4271 to 4386) in April 2019 compared with 1535 (95% CI, 1480 to 1589) and 1338 (95% CI, 1306 to 1370) in April 2020. Multivariable analysis showed that telehealth use was associated with higher cancer screening. Conclusions and Relevance: Public health efforts are needed to address the large cancer screening deficit associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased use of screening modalities that do not require a procedure.","Chen, Ronald C; Haynes, Kevin; Du, Simo; Barron, John; Katz, Aaron J",JAMA oncol.

While mHealth apps offer many compelling benefits, identifying effective apps in the crowded and largely unregulated marketplace is laborious. Consumer demand and industry productivity are increasing, although research is slower, making it challenging for providers to determine the most credible and safe apps for patients in need. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: This commentary offers a practical, empirically guided framework and associated resources for selecting appropriate mHealth apps for pediatric populations during the pandemic and beyond. RESULTS: In the first stage, Narrow the target problem, end user, and contender apps. Beginning the search with continuously updated websites that contain expert app ratings can help expedite this process (e.g., Psyberguide). Second, Explore each contender app's: (a) scientific and theoretical support (e.g., are app components consistent with health behavior change theories?), (b) privacy policies, and (c) user experience (e.g., through crowdsourcing feedback about app usability and appeal via social media). Third, use clinical expertise and stakeholder feedback to Contextualize whether the selected app is a good fit for a particular patient and/or caregiver (e.g., by considering age, race/ethnicity, ability, gender, sexual orientation, technology access), including conducting a brief self-pilot of the app. CONCLUSION: Youth are increasingly turning to technology for support, especially during the pandemic, and pediatric psychologists must be primed to recommend the most credible tools.

They harbor the catalytic cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The light-driven electron transfer from the excited state of the fully-reduced form of FAD to the DNA lesions causes rearrangement of the covalent bonds, leading to the restoration of intact nucleobases. In addition to the catalytic chromophore, some photolyases bear a secondary chromophore with better light absorption capability than FAD, acting as a light-harvesting chromophore that harvests photons in sunlight efficiently and transfers light energy to the catalytic center, as observed in natural photoreceptor proteins. Inspired by nature, we covalently and site-specifically attached a synthetic chromophore to the surface of photolyase using oligonucleotides containing a modified nucleoside and a cyclobutane-type DNA lesion, and successfully enhanced its enzymatic activity in the light-driven DNA repair. Peptide mapping in combination with theoretical calculations identified the amino acid residue that binds to the chromophore, working as an artificial light-harvesting chromophore. Our results broaden the strategies for protein engineering and provide a guideline for tuning of the light perception abilities and enzymatic activity of the photoreceptor proteins.","Terai, Yuma; Sato, Ryuma; Matsumura, Risa; Iwai, Shigenori; Yamamoto, Junpei",,17,1

Mobile applications for mental health have been growing exponentially in the last decade and they are emerging in university settings as a promising tool to promote and intervene in college students' mental health. Additionally, considering the recent covid-19 pandemic, mHealth interventions, due to its nature and possibilities, may play an important role in these institutions. Our main objectives are to explore mhealth interventions in universities, regarding its conceptual framework, acceptability and efficacy outcomes and understand its impact and contributions to address treatment delivery and psychological difficulties resulting from covid-19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in scientific databases, namely, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus. A search in app stores was not conducted, thus regarding commercially available apps, only those found in our database search were included in our review. We selected studies with mobile applications addressing psychological interventions for college students. A total of 2,158 participants were included in the 8 selected studies and most interventions were delivered through mobile apps only and based in cognitive behavioral therapy. Results suggested that college students accept and adhere to these interventions and preliminary evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in different disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression and risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse and sexual knowledge. We conclude that universities, particularly college counseling services, may benefit from mhealth interventions, not only to address college students' mental health but to decrease some of its difficulties related to lack of human resources. Specifically in covid-19 pandemic context, these interventions may contribute significantly by promoting and delivering psychological interventions at a safe distance.","Oliveira, C.; Pereira, A.; Vagos, P.; Nobrega, C.; Goncalves, J.; Afonso, B.",Frontiers in Psychology,17,20

Several biomolecules have been explored for possible biomarkers for prognosis outcome. Although increased C reactive protein (CRP) is associated with death due to COVID-19 infections, results from different populations remain inconsistent. For a conclusive result, the present meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Scopus database for the association of CRP concentration with COVID-19 disease outcomes. A total of 16 eligible studies were enrolled in the present analysis comprising of 1896 survivors and 849 non-survivors cases. Concentrations of CRP were compared and analyzed by a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Egger's regression analysis (intercept = 0.04, P = 0.98, 95%CI = -5.48 to 5.58) and funnel plot revealed an absence of publication bias in the included studies. Due to the presence of significant heterogeneity across the studies (Q = 252.03, Pheterogeneity = 0.000, I2 = 93.65) random model was used for the analysis of the present study. The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated a significant role of CRP in COVID-19 infection outcome (Standard difference in means = 1.371, P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of CRP remained high in patients who died of COVID-19 infection and could be a promising biomarker for assessing disease lethality.","Sahu, Bikash R; Kampa, Raj Kishor; Padhi, Archana; Panda, Aditya K",Clin Chim Acta,17,24

Reporting odds ratio (ROR) compared the number of ARF cases reported with remdesivir, with those reported with other drugs prescribed in comparable situations of COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir). The combination of the terms ""acute renal failure"" and ""remdesivir"" yielded a statistically significant disproportionality signal with 138 observed cases instead of the 9 expected.

We speculated that the COVID-19 lockdown regulations (travel restriction and alcohol ban) would affect trauma patterns. OBJECTIVES: To compare the burden and nature of trauma over the COVID-19 lockdown period with the equivalent period over the past 5 years using routinely collected data from the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA. METHODS: All trauma patients admitted to Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg between 23 March 2015 and 31 May 2020 were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 8 859 trauma patients were admitted over the 6-year period, with a total of 1 676 admitted during the periods 23 March - 31 May. These 1 676 formed the study cohort. Of these patients, 998 had sustained blunt trauma, 665 penetrating trauma, and 13 a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma. A total of 14 categories of blunt trauma were reviewed, of which the three most common were assault, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and pedestrian vehicle accidents (PVAs). Between 23 March and 31 May 2020, a total of 23 patients were victims of blunt assault. The median number of assault victims over the equivalent period during the previous 5 years was 48. The 5 preceding years had a median of 56 MVAs and 33 PVAs, compared with 23 and 10 during the lockdown. The median number of gunshot wound (GSW) victims for the preceding years was 41, compared with 30 during the lockdown. During the lockdown, 24 stab wound victims were admitted, compared with a median of 73 for the preceding years.

The aim of the current study is to elucidate the specific miRNA profile which can act as new biomarkers for distinguishing acute COVID-19 disease from the healthy group and those in the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The expression level of selected miRNAs including let-7b-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-3p and miR-155-5p were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients, in both the acute and post-acute COVID-19 phase of the disease and healthy groups, by real-time PCR assays. Specificity and sensitivity of miRNAs was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The expression level of all miRNAs in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than in the healthy group. Therefore, the expression pattern of miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-3p and let-7b-3p in the post-acute COVID-19 phase was significantly different from the acute COVID-19 phase. ROC analyses demonstrated that miR-29a-3p, -155-5p and -146a-3p may serve as the novel biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. In addition, miR-29a-3p, and -146a-3p can maybe act as novel biomarkers for distinguishing acute from post-acute phase of COVID-19 disease. DISCUSSION: The difference in miRNA expression pattern between COVID-19 patients and those in the healthy group, and between acute COVID-19 with post-acute COVID-19, suggested that cellular miRNAs could be used as promising biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19.","Donyavi, Tahereh; Bokharaei-Salim, Farah; Baghi, Hossein Bannazadeh; Khanaliha, Khadijeh; Alaei Janat-Makan, Mahrokh; Karimi, Bahareh; Sadri Nahand, Javid; Mirzaei, Hamed; Khatami, AliReza; Garshasbi, Saba; Khoshmirsafa, Majid; Jalal Kiani, Seyed",Int Immunopharmacol,17,24

At low temperatures, iQC and 2/1 ACs exhibit spin-glass-like freezing for RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho, while Er and Tm systems do not show freezing behaviour down to the base temperature ~ 2 K. The 1/1 ACs exhibit either spin-glass-like freezing or antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering depending on their constituent Mg content. The Tf values show increasing trend from iQC to 2/1 and 1/1 ACs. In contrast, the absolute values of Weiss temperature for iQCs are larger than those in 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, indicating that the total AFM interactions between the neighboring spins are larger in aperiodic, rather than periodic systems. Competing spin interactions originating from the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida mechanism along with chemical disorder of Cd/Mg ions presumably account for the observed spin-glass-like behavior in Cd-Mg-RE iQCs and ACs.","Labib, Farid; Okuyama, Daisuke; Fujita, Nobuhisa; Yamada, Tsunetomo; Ohhashi, Satoshi; Sato, Taku J; Tsai, An-Pang",J. phys. condens. matter,17,20

Evidence from China,19.500797,1.464475,2021,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic. To date, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread to over 200 countries, leading to over 1.6 million cases and over 99,000 deaths. Given that there is neither a vaccine nor proven treatment for COVID-19, there is currently an urgent need for effective pharmacotherapy. To address the need for an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the worldwide pandemic, this systematic review of intravenous (IV) remdesivir was performed. Remdesivir, an anti-viral prodrug originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease, has shown broad spectrum activity against the Coronavirus family. A recent case report reported improvement of clinical symptoms with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19. After conducting a systematic search of 18 clinical trial registries and three large scientific databases, we identified 86 potentially eligible items. Following removal of duplicates (n = 21), eligible studies were reviewed independently by two authors. After the first round of screening, inter-rater agreement was 98.5% (&#954; = 0.925). After the second round of full-text screening, inter-rater agreement was 100%. A total of seven ongoing and recruiting clinical trials of remdesivir (100-200 milligrams, intravenous [IV]) were included. We identified the following primary outcomes: patients discharged (n = 2); time to clinical status improvement (n = 2); improved O2 saturation (n = 2); body temperature normalization (n = 2); and clinical status (n = 1). Secondary outcomes in all identified studies included documentation of adverse events. Phase 3 trials are expected to be completed between April 2020-2023. Therefore, despite supportive data from in vitro and in vivo studies, the clinical effectiveness of IV remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 and potential side effects remain incompletely defined in the human population.","Musa, Arif; Pendi, Kasim; Hashemi, Areio; Warbasse, Elizabeth; Kouyoumjian, Sarkis; Yousif, Jenna; Blodget, Emily; Stevens, Susan; Aly, Besma; Baron, David A",West J Emerg Med,17,17

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. Materials and Methods: A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using resting-state and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. Results: EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy. Conclusion: EEG can identify distinct neurophysiological changes among Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder that are akin to substance abuse disorders.","Sharifat, H.; Suppiah, S.",Medical Journal of Malaysia,17,16

Supplementary data were obtained from the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) to compare health services activity data provided by different health professionals before and after COVID-19 (from January 2019 to June 2020).ResultsThere was variation in access to different health services by patients with chronic conditions during COVID-19. The introduction of telehealth facilitated continuity of general practitioner (GP) services, with a high level of satisfaction among patients. Changes in medicines regulation, including the home delivery of medications, enabled timely access to medications for patients. The use of telehealth was less common for specialist and particularly allied health services. Dental check-ups that are important for the management of some chronic conditions were disrupted the most during COVID-19.ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that the policy measures introduced in Australia provided an opportunity to maintain multidisciplinary care for patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19. GPs, as core members of the primary healthcare team, as well as pharmacy and pathology services, were highly accessible. Telehealth was less accessed for chronic care services provided by specialists and allied health professionals.What is known about the topic?Access to multidisciplinary care is critical to ensure continuity and quality of care for patients with chronic health conditions. Evidence suggests disruptions in health services can occur during pandemics. To continue access to routine care, the Australian Government introduced several policy initiatives during COVID-19 to enhance access to multidisciplinary care.What does this paper add?Telehealth policy was particularly effective in facilitating patients' access to general practice services during COVID-19 particularly those services that did not need physical examinations. This policy complemented changes in medicines regulations that enabled timely and convenient access to medications for patients with chronic conditions. Allied health services, as important elements of multidisciplinary care, were more likely to be disrupted during COVID-19.What are the implications for practitioners?Continuation of telehealth services is likely to enhance access to general practice services. The acceptability and use of telehealth for allied health services may require more flexibility, and training for both practitioners and patients.","Javanparast, Sara; Roeger, Leigh; Reed, Richard L",,17,1

We examined how aesthetic appeal and informational factors could influence human attitudes towards bats in a survey of 1966 participants from Spanish-speaking countries. Gender, educational level, religiousness and previous experiences with bats were relevant variables to understand attitudes towards them. The results indicate that both aesthetic and informational stimuli increase the positive responses, reducing the negatives on the participants' attitudes. Our results show the importance of public attitudes to achieve conservation goals, especially in the context of human-wildlife conflict. Bats are not charismatic animals and are still surrounded in mystery; however, our findings could benefit bat conservation plans, allowing the development of new communication strategies both locally and nationally and increasing public acceptance that will facilitate bat conservation.","Boso, Àlex; Álvarez, Boris; Pérez, Beatriz; Imio, Juan Carlos; Altamirano, Adison; Lisón, Fulgencio",,17,29

Only using the average backyard resources, soybean cultivation can provide 80-160% of household protein and 0- 50% of a household’s protein needs can be provided by pasture-fed rabbits using only the yard grass as feed. If external supplementation of feed is available, raising 52 chickens while also harvesting the concomitant eggs or alternately 107 grain-fed rabbits can meet 100% of an average household’s protein requirements. These results show that resilience to future pandemics and challenges associated with growing meat demands can be incrementally addressed through backyard distributed protein production. Backyard production of chicken meat, eggs, and rabbit meat reduces the environmental costs of protein due to savings in production, transportation, and refrigeration of meat products and even more so with soybeans. Generally, distributed production of protein was found to be economically competitive with centralized production of meat if distributed labor costs were ignored. © 2021 by the author.

The first cases in Italy were reported on January 30, 2020, and the outbreak quickly escalated. On March 19, 2020, deaths in Italy surpassed those in China. The Italian government implemented progressively restrictive measures leading to a nationwide lockdown on March 8, 2020. This study aimed to assess the impact of mitigation measures implemented in Italy on the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Publicly available data were used to evaluate changes in the growth curve of the number of patients hospitalized in intensive care (IC) at three time intervals between February 19, 2020, and April 9, 2020, after the implementation of progressive measures: (1) containment and travel restrictions, (2) lockdown of the epicenter of the outbreak, and (3) school closures and nationwide lockdown. The models that showed the highest reliability according to the Akaike information criterion and based on data from the three time intervals were projected to assess how the epidemic would have evolved if no other measure had been implemented. RESULTS: The most reliable models were (1) exponential, (2) quadratic, and (3) cubic (R2 = 0.99, >0.99, and > 0.99 respectively), indicating a progressive decrease in the growth of the curve. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the measures were effective in flattening the epidemic curve and bought valuable time, allowing for the number of IC beds to be nearly doubled before the national health system reached maximum capacity.","Vicentini, C; Bordino, V; Gardois, P; Zotti, C M",Public Health,17,4

In this study, a robot-assisted US-navigation platform has been developed for 3D US guidance and planning of conformal HIFU ablations. The platform was used to evaluate a conformal therapeutic strategy associated with an interstitial dual-mode USgHIFU catheter prototype (64 elements linear-array, measured central frequency f = 6.5 MHz), developed for the treatment of HepatoCellular Carcinoma (HCC). The platform included a 3D navigation environment communicating in real-time with an open research dual-mode US scanner/HIFU generator and a robotic arm, on which the USgHIFU catheter was mounted. 3D US-navigation was evaluated in vitro for guiding and planning conformal HIFU ablations using a tumor-mimic model in porcine liver. Tumor-mimic volumes were then used as targets for evaluating conformal HIFU treatment planning in simulation. Height tumor-mimics (ovoid- or disc-shaped, sizes: 3-29 cm3) were created and visualized in liver using interstitial 2D US imaging. Robot-assisted spatial manipulation of these images and real-time 3D navigation allowed reconstructions of 3D B-mode US images for accurate tumor-mimic volume estimation (relative error: 4 ± 5%). Sectorial and full-revolution HIFU scanning (angular sectors: 88-360°) could both result in conformal ablations of the tumor volumes, as soon as their radii remained &#8804; 24 mm. The presented US navigation-guided HIFU procedure demonstrated advantages for developing conformal interstitial therapies in standard operative rooms. Moreover, the modularity of the developed platform makes it potentially useful for developing other HIFU approaches.","Daunizeau, L; Nguyen, A; Le Garrec, M; Chapelon, J Y; N039,; Djin, W A",Comput Biol Med,17,24

The health systems of each country are reorganizing to cope with an influx of patients. This crisis reorganization is the source of psychological tension that can lead to symptomatic manifestations in many caregivers. This situation is similar in many points to that encountered by soldiers on external operations (loss of usual bearings, feeling of threat, focusing of attention on the crisis, deterioration of living conditions with limitation of the possibility of taking breaks). The aim of this work is to describe at the hospital level the changes in the professional and personal environment linked to the crisis likely to cause stress and then to describe the clinical manifestations observed both on an individual and collective level. Analysis of the situation: In this chapter, after having described the reorganization of the hospital in which we operate, we try to identify various factors likely to have psychological repercussions such as: the perceived urgency of the situation, the achievement of privacy, the reorganization of the work tool and the exercise of unusual tasks in newly formed teams, but also the fear of lack, the anxiety linked to contamination, the uncertainties linked to the threat. Clinical description: In this chapter, we describe the clinical manifestations observed in the caregivers of the hospital in reaction to the crisis. Rather than decompensations, they are mainly anxious manifestations characterized by an increase in somatic concerns, an accentuation of verification rituals, an increase in snacking and the consumption of certain psychoactive substances (coffee, tobacco) and for certain people a character stiffening. On a collective level, it was mainly the misuse of social networks reflecting the group's anxieties (search for meaning and responsibility, need for certainty) that was observed. Conclusion: We then conclude with a description of the approach that led to the establishment of a support system by offering a graduated response, re-assessable over time, compatible with the maintenance of usual activity while maintaining a therapeutic distance.","Gilles, Thomas",Ann.

Androgen suppression by androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors form the foundation of prostate cancer treatment. In this review, we highlight the growing evidence in support of androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 and the potential clinical implications of using androgen suppression to downregulate TMPRSS2 to target SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the future directions and controversies that need to be addressed in order to establish the viability of targeting TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 through androgen signaling regulation for COVID-19 treatment, particularly its relevance in the context of prostate cancer management.","Bhowmick, Neil A; Oft, Jillian; Dorff, Tanya; Pal, Sumanta; Agarwal, Neeraj; Figlin, Robert A; Posadas, Edwin M; Freedland, Steven; Gong, Jun",Endocr. relat. cancer,17,24

Reusable masks made from surgical sterilization wrap represent such an innovative approach with social media frequently referring to them as ""N95 alternatives."" This material was tested for particle filtration efficiency and breathability to clarify what role they might have in infection prevention and control. METHODS: A heavyweight, double layer sterilization wrap was tested when new and after 2, 4, 6, and 10 autoclave sterilizing cycles and compared with an approved N95 respirator and a surgical mask via testing procedures using a sodium chloride aerosol for N95 efficiency testing similar to 42 CFR 84.181. Pressure testing to indicate breathability was also conducted. RESULTS: The particle filtration efficiency for the sterilization wrap ranged between 58% to 66%, with similar performance when new and after sterilizing cycles. The N95 respirator and surgical mask performed at 95% and 68% respectively. Pressure drops for the sterilization wrap, N95 and surgical mask were 10.4 mmH2O, 5.9 mmH2O, and 5.1 mmH2O, respectively, well below the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health limits of 35 mmH2O during initial inhalation and 25 mmH2O during initial exhalation.

Therefore, a quantitative risk assessment for otologic surgery would be desirable. This study aims to quantitatively compare the risk of perioperative droplet formation between microscopic and endoscopic approaches. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental research. SETTING: Temporal bone laboratory. METHODS: The middle ear of whole head specimens was injected with fluorescein (0.2 mg/10 mL) before endoscopic and microscopic epitympanectomy and mastoidectomy. Fluorescent droplet deposition on the surgical table was recorded under ultraviolet light, quantified, and compared among the interventions. Drilling time, droplet proportion, fluorescein intensity, and droplet size were assessed for every procedure. RESULTS: A total of 12 procedures were performed: 4 endoscopic epitympanectomies, 4 microscopic epitympanectomies, and 4 mastoidectomies. The mean (SD) proportion of fluorescein droplets was 0.14 (0.10) for endoscopic epitympanectomy and 0.64 (0.31) for microscopic epitympanectomy. During mastoidectomy, the deposition of droplets was 8.77 (6.71). Statistical comparison based on a mixed effects model revealed a significant increase (0.50) in droplet deposition during microscopic epitympanectomy as compared with endoscopic epitympanectomy (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable droplet generation during otologic surgery, and this represents a risk for the spread of airborne infectious diseases. The endoscopic technique offers the lowest risk of droplet formation as compared with microscopic approaches, with a significant 4.5-fold reduction of droplets between endoscopic and microscopic epitympanectomy and a 62-fold reduction between endoscopic epitympanectomy and cortical mastoidectomy.","Anschuetz, Lukas; Yacoub, Abraam; Buetzer, Tobias; Fernandez, Ignacio J; Wimmer, Wilhelm; Caversaccio, Marco",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,17,16

The goal of this study is to develop dNTP/NTP analogues directly from nucleotides. Tenofovir (TFV) analogues were synthesized by conjugating with amino acids. We demonstrate that some conjugates act as dNTP analogues and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) catalytically incorporates the TFV part as the chain terminator. X-ray structures in complex with HIV-1 RT/dsDNA showed binding of the conjugates at the polymerase active site, however, in different modes in the presence of Mg2+ versus Mn2+ ions. The adaptability of the compounds is seemingly essential for catalytic incorporation of TFV by RT. 4d with a carboxyl sidechain demonstrated the highest incorporation. 4e showed weak incorporation and rather behaved as a dNTP-competitive inhibitor.

Due to the need to establish infection prevention and control guidance in dental health settings to enable a safe clinical practice, this review aims to list the challenges and perspectives in managing dental care in services and schools. This review employed materials collected from PubMed and the main guidelines and studies on the novel coronavirus to provide an overview of the clinical procedures and decisions made by health care personnel in dental offices and dental schools. We expect the COVID-19 scenario to promote significant changes in clinical practice and dental education; dentists should seek specific and particular regulations for dental practice established by their state or country. Biosafety checklists are strongly recommended for appointments at dental services and face-to-face activities in dental schools.","Gurgel, Bruno César de Vasconcelos; Borges, Samuel Batista; Borges, Raul Elton Araújo; Calderon, Patrícia Dos Santos",J Appl Oral Sci,17,21

Noting high morbidity and mortality from early invasive mechanical ventilation, we implemented a COVID-19 respiratory protocol employing HFNC in severe COVID-19 and HCW exposed to COVID-19 patients on HFNC wore N95/KN95 masks. Utilization of HFNC increased significantly but questions remained regarding HCW infection rate. METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of employee infections in our healthcare system using the Employee Health Services database and unit records of employees tested between March 15, 2020 and May 23, 2020. We assessed the incidence of infections before and after the implementation of the protocol, stratifying by clinical or non-clinical role as well as inpatient COVID-19 unit. RESULTS: During the study period, 13.9% (228/1635) of employees tested for COVID-19 were positive. Forty-six percent of infections were in non-clinical staff. After implementation of the respiratory protocol, the proportion of positive tests in clinical staff (41.5%) was not higher than that in non-clinical staff (43.8%). Of the clinicians working in the high-risk COVID-19 unit, there was no increase in infections after protocol implementation compared with clinicians working in COVID-19 units that did not use HFNC. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of increased COVID-19 infections in HCW after the implementation of a respiratory protocol that increased use of HFNC in patients with COVID-19; however, these results are hypothesis generating.","Westafer, Lauren M; Soares, William E; Salvador, Doug; Medarametla, Venkatrao; Schoenfeld, Elizabeth M",Am J Emerg Med,17,28

This immunity can be due to vaccination or to the recovery post-disease. Effective herd immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection has several hurdles upon achievement. Herd immunity cannot be obtained concomitantly in many geographical areas because the areas have different population density and the societal measures to contain the spreading are different. A proportion of 50-66% of the population needs to be immunized naturally or artificially in this SARS-Cov2 pandemic and this percentage is not easily achievable. The duration of herd immunity is another issue while information on the long-term immune response against SARS-CoV2 is yet scarce. Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment. The societal tactics to achieve the much-needed herd immunity should be developed keeping in mind the welfare of the population. Without being exhaustive, throughout our paper we will elaborate on each of the hurdles encountered in developing herd immunity to SARS-Cov2 infection.","Neagu, Monica",J Immunoassay Immunochem,17,1

The interaction of viral spike proteins with their host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical determinant of potential hosts and cross-species transmission. Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to examine 46 ACE2 orthologues from phylogenetically diverse bat species, including those in close and distant contact with humans. We found that 24, 21 and 16 of them failed to support infection by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or both viruses, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed that infection assays in human cells were consistent with those in two bat cell lines. Additionally, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify critical residues in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our results suggest that many bat species may not be the potential hosts of one or both viruses and that no correlation was identified between proximity to humans and probability of being natural hosts of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. This study demonstrates dramatic variation in susceptibility to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection among bat species and adds knowledge towards a better understanding of coronavirus-bat interaction.","Yan, Huan; Jiao, Hengwu; Liu, Qianyun; Zhang, Zhen; Xiong, Qing; Wang, Bing-Jun; Wang, Xin; Guo, Ming; Wang, Lin-Fa; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu; Zhao, Huabin",Nat Ecol Evol,17,1

Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","Huang, Chunmei; Xu, Xinjie; Cai, Yuyang; Ge, Qinmin; Zeng, Guangwang; Li, Xiaopan; Zhang, Weide; Ji, Chen; Yang, Ling",J Med Internet Res,17,0

Methods: Two hypothetical geriatric suicide cases (1 low lethality and 1 high lethality) are presented and categorized according to 3 suicide theories: interpersonal theory of suicide, three-step theory of suicide, and hopelessness theory of depression. Results: In crisis intervention, the clinician's interview must match the intrinsic belief of the suicide attempter to enable engagement and rapport. Use of different aspects of the 3 suicide theories can be useful but are dependent on the emergent nature of the attempt. Conclusion: The need for identification and treatment of those with mental health issues, especially among the elderly population, and collaborative multidiscipline management teams is increasing during the current global pandemic.

Report from the US,19.548857,1.4460514,2020,"Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related myocarditis cases have been reported. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. The clinical findings include changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function. When cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not feasible, cardiac computed tomographic angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns. Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression. Arrhythmias are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, but the pathophysiology is still speculative. Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatment. The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown.","Siripanthong, Bhurint; Nazarian, Saman; Muser, Daniele; Deo, Rajat; Santangeli, Pasquale; Khanji, Mohammed Y; Cooper, Leslie T; Chahal, C Anwar A",Heart Rhythm,17,16

However, the detection of viruses in sewage is challenging and to date there is no standard method available which has been validated for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we describe a simple concentration method based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, followed by RNA extraction and a one-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for viral detection in wastewater. PEG-based concentration of viruses is a simple procedure which is not limited by the availability of expensive equipment and has reduced risk of disruption to consumable supply chains. The concentration and RNA extraction steps enable 900-1500× concentration of wastewater samples and sufficiently eliminates the majority of organic matter, which could inhibit the subsequent qRT-PCR assay. Due to the high variation in the physico-chemical properties of wastewater samples, we recommend the use of process control viruses to determine the efficiency of each step.

Dentists come across countless routes of stress in dental schools. Onset foot in clinical training, they can find that the number and type of stressors often grow. Dental students encounter high levels of academic stress, which can adversely influence them from their study years working with phantom teeth through their preclinical and clinical practice years. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the world population to a high risk of infection that comprises a major stress factor, especially for vulnerable groups such as dental students. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the levels of COVID-19-related stress and anxiety, changes in hygienic and social habits, as well as subjective worries regarding the dental profession among dental students. Materials and Methods: A self-structured questionnaire was sent to dental students of two dental schools in the city of Jeddah. It included demographic data, questions about the level of change in personal hygiene and social habits, students' perception about the sufficiency of information received during the outbreak and its source, subjective worries regarding the dental profession, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale. Three hundred and eight responses were received. Results: Moderate and severe anxieties were reported in 41% and 7% of students, respectively. About 57% of respondents agreed to continue e-learning in the theoretical part only, 1% for the clinical part only, 32% in both, and 10% were not interested in continuing e-learning. Most of the students reported that they received excellent information about COVID-19 during the outbreak, with social media as the main source of information for the majority, followed by the Health Department. A significant number of dentists (66%) wanted to temporarily shut their dental practices until the number of COVID-19 case rates reduces considerably. Conclusion: A considerable percentage of dental students are anxious and changed their hygienic and social habits due to COVID-19. This anxiety reflects worries about the dental profession in one-third of participants that necessitate counseling services and psychological support.","Mahmoud El, Homossany Alrowaily Ghada Allugmani Wysal Abo-Atwan Waleed Al-Sulaiman Rafat Al-Mofareh Obayy Alharbi Aseel Almuqrin Abdulrahman",Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,17,16

SOURCE: Relevant articles in PubMed MEDLINE from the first publication (2003) until 2020. N=101 articles were included in this review. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Type III IFNs represent a relatively newly described inflammatory cytokine family. Although they induce substantially similar signalling to the well-known type I IFNs, significant functional differences make these molecules remarkable. Type III IFNs have extensive biological effects, contributing to the pathogenesis of several diseases and also offering new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: 1) their potent anti-viral properties make them promising therapeutics against viral hepatitis and even against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; 2) imbalances in the IFN-&#955;s contribute to several forms of chronic inflammation (e.g., systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases) and potentially predict disease progression and therapeutic response to biologic therapies; and 3) the antitumor properties of the type III IFNs open up new therapeutic perspectives against malignant diseases. CONCLUSION: Over the last 18 years, researchers have gathered extensive information about the presence and role of these versatile inflammatory cytokines in human diseases, but further research is needed to clarify the mechanistic background of those observations. Better understanding of their biological activities will permit us to use type III IFNs more efficiently in new diagnostic approaches and individualized therapies, consequently improving patient care.","Malik, Aniko E; Issekutz, Thomas B; Derfalvi, Beata",Clin Invest Med,17,16

Minimising the impact of FT requires early assessment and intervention. General practice plays a significant role in the support of a person with cancer and may have an important role in the management of FT. The purpose of this study was to understand perspectives of general practitioners (GP) on addressing FT in the primary care setting, which may then help inform strategies to further support collaborative efforts to address FT. METHODS: A qualitative interpretive approach was utilised for this study. GPs were recruited through a GP conference and other professional networks using purposive, snowballing sampling techniques. Data collection continued until sufficient rich data had been obtained. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analysed using inductive analysis techniques. RESULTS: Twenty (n = 20) GPs participated in semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews. GPs identified that their role positions them well to provide some FT support, but there are limitations. Perceptions and philosophies about cancer management were drivers of referrals and financial conversations. Priorities for care of FT by GPs included improved cost information provision and accessible support. CONCLUSION: GPs can play an important role in helping to address FT associated with cancer and its treatments if supported with the right information.","Thamm, Carla; Fox, Jennifer; Hart, Nicolas H.; Rhee, Joel; Koczwara, Bogda; Emery, Jon; Milley, Kristi; Nund, Rebecca L.; Chan, Raymond J.",Support Care Cancer,17,1

However, there is little information on the prevalence of loneliness among people with disability or the association between disability, loneliness and wellbeing. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: For a nationally representative sample of adults (age 16-64) with/without disability, to examine exposure to three indicators of low social connectedness (loneliness, low perceived social support, social isolation), and to evaluate the association between low social connectedness and wellbeing. To test whether disability status moderated the relationship between low social connectedness and wellbeing. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from three annual rounds of the cross-sectional English Community Life Survey (CLS) 2016-19. RESULTS: People with disability experienced loneliness, low perceived social support and social isolation at significantly higher rates than people without disability. Effect sizes were significantly greater for loneliness. Disability was associated with lower wellbeing. With one exception, low social connectedness was associated with lower wellbeing. Again, effect sizes were significantly greater for loneliness. The prevalence of loneliness was highest among adults with disability who were younger, economically inactive, living in rented or other accommodation, living alone and with low levels of access to environmental assets. There was no evidence that disability status moderated the association between exposure to low social connectedness and low wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was a particularly significant driver of poor wellbeing among people with disability. The relative independence between different indicators of social connectedness suggests that interventions to reduce loneliness will need to do more than simply increase rates of social contact or social support.","Emerson, Eric; Fortune, Nicola; Llewellyn, Gwynnyth; Stancliffe, Roger",Disabil Health J,17,28

This virus was responsible for the pandemic with more than 84 million cases and 1.82 million deaths worldwide. In Sudan till now the reported cases exceed 23,000 with 1.400 deaths. This study aims to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 suspected cases, health seeking behavior and public adherence to protective measures. METHODS: Descriptive community based cross-sectional study using nonprobability snowball sampling technique, conducted in Khartoum state 2020. 3499 respondents with diverse socio-demographic backgrounds were finally enrolled in the study. Data was collected through Manitoba Coronavirus 2019 screening form which distributed through online anonymous Google forms. Data was entered and analyzed by Statistical Package of Social Sciences version 23. RESULTS: The study revealed that 26.5% of the respondents were clinically suspected with headache or fatigability being the most common symptom followed by pharyngitis and then dry cough. Asthma and chronic respiratory disease as the commonest comorbidities. Wearing facial masks and regular hand washing were found to be the most used protective measures with only 39.4% implicates social distancing in their daily life. Health seeking behavior was significantly different among suspected respondents the majority tend to use antibiotics than to isolate themselves or undergo testing. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 suspected cases were prevalent among Sudanese population; screening capacity has to be increased with more strong policies for implications of personal protective measures in the daily life.","BARA’A, HASSAN MOHAMMED IBRAHIM; NORI, MUNEER MAKKI MUSA; ABDALLAH, WAHEEBA SIDDIG; ALI, SUAD MOHAMMED",J Prev Med Hyg,17,16

A recently designed novel system, which utilises a low pressure ultrasonic activated, cold water stream, has previously demonstrated efficient hard surface cleaning of several biological contaminants. AIM: To test the efficacy of an ultrasonically activated stream for the removal of tissue proteins, including prion-associated amyloid, from surgical stainless steel (SS) surfaces. METHODS: Test surfaces were contaminated with 22L, ME7 or 263K prion infected brain homogenates. The surfaces were treated with the ultrasonically activated water stream for contact times of 5 and 10 seconds. Residual proteinaceous and amyloid contamination were quantified using sensitive microscopic analysis, and immunoblotting was used to characterize the eluted prion residues before and after treatment with the ultrasonically activated stream. FINDINGS: Efficient removal of the different prion strains from the surgical SS surfaces was observed, and reduced levels of protease sensitive and resistant prion protein was detected in recovered supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that an ultrasonically activated stream has the potential to be a cost-effective solution to improve current decontamination practices and has the potential to reduce hospital acquired infections.","Secker, Thomas.J.; Leighton, Timothy.G.; Offin, Douglas.G.; Birkin, Peter.R.; Hervé, Rodolphe.C.; Keevil, Charles.W.",J Hosp Infect,17,26

Though direct evidence from specific trials is still lacking, several studies have suggested that metformin may protect from diabetes- and nondiabetes-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and neoplastic diseases. In the past few decades, several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain metformin’s protective effects, none being final. It is certain, however, that metformin increases lactate production, concentration, and, possibly, oxidation. Once considered a mere waste product of exercising skeletal muscle or anaerobiosis, lactate is now known to act as a major energy shuttle, redistributed from production sites to where it is needed. Through the direct uptake and oxidation of lactate produced elsewhere, all end organs can be rapidly supplied with fundamental energy, skipping glycolysis and its possible byproducts. Increased lactate production (and consequent oxidation) could therefore be considered a positive mechanism of action of metformin, except when, under specific circumstances, metformin and lactate become excessive, increasing the risk of lactic acidosis. We are proposing that, rather than considering metformin-induced lactate production as dangerous, it could be considered a mechanism through which metformin exerts its possible protective effect on the heart, kidneys, and brain and, to some extent, its antineoplastic action.","Giaccari, Andrea; Solini, Anna; Frontoni, Simona; Del Prato, Stefano",Diabetes Care,17,30

To ensure meaningful data, particularly in a low seroprevalence population, assays need to be rigorously characterized with high specificity. METHODS: We evaluated two commercial (Roche Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics IgM/IgG) and two non-commercial (Simoa and Ragon/MGH IgG) immunoassays against 68 confirmed positive and 232 pre-pandemic negative controls. Sensitivity was stratified by time from symptom onset. The Simoa multiplex assay applied three pre-defined algorithm models to determine sample result. RESULTS: The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays each registered 1/232 false positive, the primary Simoa model registered 2/232 false positives, and the Epitope registered 2/230 and 3/230 false positives for the IgG and IgM assays respectively. Sensitivity >21 days post symptom-onset was 100% for all assays except Epitope IgM, but lower and/or with greater variability between assays for samples collected 9–14 days (67–100%) and 15–21 days (69–100%) post-symptom onset. The Simoa and Epitope IgG assays demonstrated excellent sensitivity earlier in the disease course. The Roche and Ragon/MGH assays were less sensitive during early disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The Epitope IgG demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays registered rare false positives with lower early sensitivity. The Simoa assay primary model had excellent sensitivity and few false positives.","Nilles, Eric J.; Karlson, Elizabeth W.; Norman, Maia; Gilboa, Tal; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Zhou, Guohai; Bennett, Christopher L.; Tolan, Nicole V.; Oganezova, Karina; Walt, David R.; Alter, Galit; Simmons, Daimon P.; Schur, Peter; Jarolim, Petr; Baden, Lindsey R.",medRxiv,17,20

We start with the problem of the older people affected by dementia and Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia for which also the execution of a simple diagnostic test (such as nasopharyngeal swab) could be problematic. Another important problem is the management of wandering patients for which the re-organization of the spaces and vaccination could be the solutions. The relationship with families is another important problem, also from a medico-legal point of view, that can be faced using video conferencing tools. Moreover, we discussed the importance of stratifying prognosis in older nursing home residents for the best management and therapeutically approach, including palliative care, also using telemedicine and the inclusion of prognostic tools in daily clinical practice.

RESULTS: According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes staging, 14% (n = 21) of the patients had category 1 proteinuria (< 150 mg/g of urine creatinine), 42% (n = 64) had category 2 (between 150 and 500 mg/g) and 44% (n = 68) had category 3 proteinuria (over 500 mg/g). Urine α(1)-microglobulin concentration was higher than 15 mg/g in 89% of patients. After a median follow-up of 27 [14;30] days, the mortality rate reached 18%. Total proteinuria and urinary α(1)-microglobulin were associated with mortality in unadjusted and adjusted models. This association was stronger in subgroups of patients with normal renal function and without a urinary catheter. CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria is frequent in patients with COVID-19. Its characterization suggests a tubular origin, with increased urinary α(1)-microglobulin. Tubular proteinuria was associated with mortality in COVID-19 in our restropective, observational study.

Inappropriate antibiotic use for pharyngitis contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. However, a small proportion of sore throats caused by group A streptococcal (GAS) infection may benefit from the provision of antibiotics. Establishing the cause of infection is therefore an important step in effective antibiotic stewardship. Point-of-care (POC) tests, where results are available within minutes, can distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and can therefore guide treatment in primary healthcare settings such as community pharmacies, which are often the first point of contact with the healthcare system. In this opinion article, the evidence for the use of POC testing in the community pharmacy has been discussed. Evidence suggests that pharmacy POC testing can promote appropriate antibiotic use and reduce the need for general practitioner consultations. Challenges to implementation include cost, training and ‘who prescribes’, with country and regional differences presenting a particular issue. Despite these challenges, POC testing for pharyngitis has become widely available in pharmacies in some countries and may represent a strategy to contain antibiotic resistance and contribute to antimicrobial stewardship.","Essack, Sabiha; Bell, John; Burgoyne, Douglas; Tongrod, Wirat; Duerden, Martin; Sessa, Aurelio; Altiner, Attila; Shephard, Adrian",Antibiotics (Basel),17,2

It is believed that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with more than 90,000,000 infections and 1,900,000 deaths is partly due to its successful glycosylation strategy. On the other hand, while glycan patches on S protein have been reported to shield the host immune response by masking “nonself” viral peptides with “self-glycans,” the epitopes are also important in eliciting neutralizing antibodies.

Currently with just under 7000 cases and 100 deaths, Australia is seeing less than 20 new cases per day. This is a positive outcome, but makes estimation of current effective reproduction numbers difficult to estimate. Australia, like much of the world is poised to step out of lockdown and looking at which measures to relax first. We use age-based contact matrices, calibrated to Chinese data on reproduction numbers and difference in infectiousness and susceptibility of children to generate next generation matrices (NGMs) for Australia. These matrices have a spectral radius of 2.49, which is hence our estimated basic reproduction number for Australia. The effective reproduction number (Reff) for Australia during the April/May lockdown period is estimated by other means to be around 0.8. We simulate the impact of lockdown on the NGM by first applying observations through Google Mobility Report for Australia at 3 locations: home (increased contacts by 18%), work (reduced contacts by 34%) and other (reduced contacts by 40%), and we reduce schools to 3% reflecting attendance rates during lockdown. Applying macro-distancing to the NGM leads to a spectral radius of 1.76. We estimate that the further reduction of the reproduction number to current levels of Reff = 0.8 is achieved by a micro-distancing factor of 0.26. That is, in a given location, people are 26% as likely as usual to have an effective contact with another person. We apply both macro and micro-distancing to the NGMs to examine the impact of different exit strategies. We find that reopening schools is estimated to reduce Reff from 0.8 to 0.78. This is because increase in school contact is offset by decrease in home contact. The NGMs all estimate that adults aged 30-50 are responsible for the majority of transmission. We also find that micro-distancing is critically important to maintain Reff <1. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is presented.","McBryde, E. S.; Trauer, J. M.; Adekunle, A.; Ragonnet, R.; Meehan, M. T.",,17,23

In addition, the authors point to non‐anticoagulant activities of heparin, in particular anti‐inflammatory effects with potential to prevent deterioration of the disease. We would like to use this opportunity to clarify the biochemical background of the diverse activities of heparin, and further, how this information may be exploited to generate more efficient treatment of the viral infection. Mechanisms to consider relate to the functional roles of proteins interacting with heparan sulfate (HS), a polysaccharide closely related to heparin.","Lindahl, Ulf; Li, Jin‐Ping",J Thromb Haemost,17,23

Here, we find that a simple virus-free model, based on publicly available transcriptional data from human cell lines, is surprisingly able to recapitulate several features of the clinically relevant infections. By segregating cell lines (n = 1305) from the CCLE project on the base of their sole angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mRNA content, we found that overexpressing cells present with molecular features resembling those of at-risk patients, including senescence, impairment of antibody production, epigenetic regulation, DNA repair and apoptosis, neutralization of the interferon response, proneness to an overemphasized innate immune activity, hyperinflammation by IL-1, diabetes, hypercoagulation and hypogonadism. Likewise, several pathways were found to display a differential expression between sexes, with males being in the least advantageous position, thus suggesting that the model could reproduce even the sex-related disparities observed in the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. Overall, besides validating a new disease model, our data suggest that, in patients with severe COVID-19, a baseline ground could be already present and, as a consequence, the viral infection might simply exacerbate a variety of latent (or inherent) pre-existing conditions, representing therefore a tipping point at which they become clinically significant.","Lavorgna, Giovanni; Cavalli, Giulio; Dagna, Lorenzo; Gregori, Silvia; Larcher, Alessandro; Landoni, Giovanni; Ciceri, Fabio; Montorsi, Francesco; Salonia, Andrea",Sci Rep,17,24

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is used to support ARDS patients failing conventional management. Scoring systems to predict mortality in VV-ECMO remain unvalidated in COVID-19 ARDS. We describe the largest COVID-19 VV-ECMO single-center experience to date and assess the utility of standard risk calculators. Methods A retrospective review of a prospective database of all COVID-19 VV-ECMO patients, cannulated between March 15th and June 27th, 2020, at a single academic center was performed. Demographic, clinical, and ECMO characteristics were collected. The primary outcome was in hospital mortality; survivor and non-survivor cohorts were compared utilizing univariate and bivariate analyses. Results Forty COVID-19 ECMO patients were identified. Of the 33 patients (82.5%) off ECMO at time of analysis, 18 patients (54.5%) survived to hospital discharge and 15 (45.5%) died on ECMO. Non-survivors presented with a statistically significant higher Prediction of Survival on ECMO Therapy (PRESET)-Score (mean ± standard deviation 8.33 ± 0.8 vs. 6.17 ± 1.8, P = 0.001). The PRESET-Score demonstrated accurate mortality prediction. All patients with a PRESET-Score of ≤ 6 survived, and a score ≥ 7 was associated with a dramatic increase in mortality. Conclusions These results suggest favorable outcomes are possible in COVID-19 ECMO patients at high volume centers.

In many places, however, besides the limited availability of test reagents, laboratory personnel face the challenge of adapting their working routines to manipulate highly infective clinical samples. Here, we proposed the use of a virus-inactivating solution as part of a sample collection kit to decrease the infectious potential of the collected material without affecting the integrity of RNA samples used in diagnostic tests based on RT-qPCR. Methods Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available viral transport solution (VTM) and the denaturing solution (DS) described here. RNA extracted from all samples was tested by RT-qPCR using probes for viral and human genes. Exposure of laboratory personnel to infective viruses was also accessed using ELISA tests. Findings The use of the DS did not interfere with the detection of viral genome or the endogenous human mRNA, since similar results were obtained from samples collected with VTM or DS.

We discuss the components of creating such a strategy including the mechanics of constructing the portfolio. Using simulations, in which securities lending data is modeled as geometric brownian motions, we provide a few flavors of creating a ranking of securities to identity the ones that are heavily shorted.

Early cohort studies have suggested declines in levels of antibodies in individuals, associated with, for example, illness severity, age and co-morbidities. This protocol focuses on the seroprevalence among primary health care providers (PHCPs) in Belgium. They manage the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in addition to other patients and therefore play an essential role in the efficient organisation of health care. Currently, evidence is lacking on 1. how many PHCPs get infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium, 2. the rate at which this happens, 3. their clinical spectrum, 4. their risk factors, 5. the effectiveness of the measures to prevent infection and 6. the accuracy of the serology-based point-of-care test in a primary care setting. Methods and analysis This study will be set up as a prospective cohort study. General practitioners (GPs) and other PHCPs (working in a GP practice) will be recruited via professional networks and professional media outlets to register online to participate. Registered GPs and other PHCPs will be asked at each testing point (n=9) to perform a capillary blood sample antibody point-of-care test (OrientGene) and complete an online questionnaire. The primary outcomes are the prevalence and incidence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in PHCPs during a 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes include the longevity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been granted by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Antwerp/University of Antwerp (Belgian registration number: 3002020000237). Alongside journal publications, dissemination activities include the publication of monthly reports to be shared with the participants and the general population through the publicly available website of the Belgian health authorities (Sciensano).","Adriaenssens, N.; Scholtes, B.; Bruyndonckx, R.; Verbakel, J.

Thus, this study aims to provide epidemiological evidence of the changes in smoking behavior among British smokers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the impact of psychosocial factors on these behaviors. METHODS: A nationwide survey of a representative sample of 4075 UK respondents aged >16 years was conducted between 27 April and 24 May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial and demographic variables between different smoking behavior groups were compared using Pearson’s χ(2) test and Cramer’s V. RESULTS: Among current smokers (n=329), one-quarter (25.2%, n=86) reported smoking more than usual, 50.9% (n=174) reported smoking the same amount, and 20.2% (n=69) reported smoking less. Significant associations were observed between different smoking behavior groups and psychosocial factors. Pearson’s χ(2) test revealed significant differences between different smoking behavior groups in their concerns about mental health (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and stress (p<0.001), state of low mood (p=0.012), in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) score (p=0.018) and ranking on the Cantril Ladder scale (p<0.001). Many respondents expressed that the pandemic had a more negative impact on their mental health and the impact was more pronounced among those who smoked more. CONCLUSIONS: Deterioration of mental health and psychosocial well-being were linked to increased smoking. Public health authorities should take proactive measures to provide mental healthcare and smoking cessation support as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic.","Tzu-Hsuan Chen, Daniel",Tob Prev Cessat,17,10

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a single institution. Patients were categorized based on obesity class. The main outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE) and myocardial injury, a marker of microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19. Adjustments were made for sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors and comorbidities. RESULTS: 609 patients with COVID-19 were included. 351 (58%) patients were without obesity, 110 (18%) were patients with class I obesity, 76 (12%) were patients with class II obesity, and 72 (12%) were patients with class III obesity. Patients with class I and III obesity had significantly higher risk-adjusted odds of VTE compared to patients without obesity (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.05–6.14 for class I obesity; and OR = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.40–11.14 for class III obesity). Patients with class III obesity had significantly higher risk-adjusted odds of myocardial injury compared to patients without obesity (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.12–4.12). Both VTE and myocardial injury were significantly associated with greater risk-adjusted odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that both macrovascular and microvascular thromboses may contribute to the elevated morbidity and mortality in patients with obesity and COVID-19.","Wang, Stephen Y.; Singh, Avinainder; Eder, Maxwell D.; Vadlamani, Lina; Lee, Alfred I.; Chun, Hyung J.; Desai, Nihar R.",Obes Res Clin Pract,17,16

COVID-19 declared as a global pandemic by the WHO was the most rapidly spreading disease all across the world. India, the second most populated nation in the world, is still fighting it, when coronavirus reached the stage where community transmission takes place at an exponential rate. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the future trends of COVID-19 in India and anticipate how it will affect economic and social growth in a short run. In this paper, a new deep learning framework using CNN and stacked Bi-GRU has been developed for predicting and analyzing the COVID-19 cases in India. The proposed model can predict the next 30 days’ new positive cases, new death cases, recovery rate and containment and health index values with high accuracy. The proposed method is compared against Gaussian process regression (GPR) model on COVID-19 datasets. The experimental result shows that the proposed framework is highly reliable for COVID-19 prediction over the GPR model.","Ahuja, Sahil; Shelke, Nitin Arvind; Singh, Pawan Kumar",Signal Image Video Process,17,4

METHODS: Seventy-nine COVID-19 patients, 78 healthy controls (HCs) and 30 COVID-19-like patients were recruited in a prospective cohort study. Samples were collected from COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms on admission, patients who progressed from mild to severe symptoms, and patients who were followed from hospital admission to discharge. The metabolome was assayed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Serum butyric acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, l-glutamic acid, l-phenylalanine, l-serine, l-lactic acid, and cholesterol were enriched in COVID-19 and COVID-19-like patients versus HCs. Notably, d-fructose and succinic acid were enriched, and citric acid and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol were depleted in COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19-like patients and HCs, and these four metabolites were not differentially distributed in non-COVID-19 groups. COVID-19 patients had enriched 4-deoxythreonic acid and depleted 1,5-anhydroglucitol compared to HCs and enriched oxalic acid and depleted phosphoric acid compared to COVID-19-like patients. A combination of d-fructose, citric acid and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol distinguished COVID-19 patients from HCs and COVID-19-like patients, with an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.92 after validation. The combination of 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol, succinic acid, L-ornithine, oleic acid and palmitelaidic acid predicted patients who progressed from mild to severe COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.969. After discharge, nearly one-third of metabolites were recovered in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The serum metabolome of COVID-19 patients is distinctive and has important value in investigating pathogenesis, determining a diagnosis, predicting severe cases, and improving treatment.","Shi, Ding; Yan, Ren; Lv, Longxian; Jiang, Huiyong; Lu, Yingfeng; Sheng, Jifang; Xie, Jiaojiao; Wu, Wenrui; Xia, Jiafeng; Xu, Kaijin; Gu, Silan; Chen, Yanfei; Huang, Chenjie; Guo, Jing; Du, Yiling; Li, Lanjuan",Metabolism,17,1

We present three lines of evidence using methods that have increasing model dependency, including an inverse model to estimate relative emissions changes in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019. The March decrease (25%) in Washington DC/Baltimore is largely supported by a drop in natural gas consumption associated with a warm spring whereas the decrease in April (33%) correlates with changes in gasoline fuel sales. In contrast, only a fraction of the March (17%) and April (34%) reduction in Los Angeles is explained by traffic declines.

The paucity of data from low-middle income countries has limited our understanding of the consequential burden in the developing world. We aim to compare volumes, presentations, management strategies, and outcomes of IHD amongst patients presenting in the same calendar months before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis at the Aga Khan University Hospital, one of the premier tertiary care centres in Pakistan. Data were collected on all adult patients (>18 years) who were admitted with IHD (acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable angina) from March 1 to June 30, 2019 (pre-COVID) and March 1 to June 30, 2020 (during-COVID), respectively. Group differences for continuous variables were evaluated using student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-squared test or Fisher test was used for categorical variables. Values of p less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. P-value trend calculation and graphical visualization were done using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results Data were assimilated on 1019 patients, with 706 (69.3%) and 313 (30.7%) patients presenting in each respective group (pre-COVID and during-COVID). Current smoking status (p=0.019), admission source (p<0.001), month of admission (p<0.001), proportions ACS (p<0.001), non-ST-elevation-myocardial-infarction (NSTEMI; p<0.001), unstable angina (p=0.025) and medical management (p=0.002) showed significant differences between the two groups, with a sharp decline in the during-COVID group. Monthly trend analysis of ACS patients showed the most significant differences in admissions (p=0.001), geographic region (intra-district vs intracity vs outside city) (p<0.001), time of admission (p=0.038), NSTEMI (p=0.002) and medical management (p=0.001). Conclusion These data showcase stark declines in ACS admissions, diagnostic procedures (angiography) and revascularization interventions (angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery, CABG) in a developing country where resources and research are already inadequate.

To better understand these factors, we investigated racial disparities in COVID‐19 mortality among America's essential workers. Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID‐19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID‐19 mortality was higher among non‐Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential‐worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID‐19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic. Policies mandating the disaggregation of state‐level data by race/ethnicity are vital to ensure equitable and evidence‐based response and recovery efforts.","Rogers, Tiana N.; Rogers, Charles R.; VanSant‐Webb, Elizabeth; Gu, Lily Y.; Yan, Bin; Qeadan, Fares",World Med Health Policy,17,1

We aimed to characterise the trends in emergency general surgery at a district general hospital in Scotland. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed from 23/03/20 to 07/05/20. All emergency general surgery patients were included. Demographics, diagnosis and management were recorded along with Covid-19 testing and results. Thirty-day mortality and readmission rates were also noted. Similar data were collected on patients admitted during the same period in 2019 to allow for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 294 patients were included. There was a 58.3 per cent reduction in admissions when comparing 2020 with 2019 (85 vs 209); however, there was no difference in age (53.2 vs 57.2 years, p = 0.169) or length of stay (4.8 vs 3.7 days, p = 0.133). During 2020, the diagnosis of appendicitis increased (4.3 vs 18.8 per cent, p = < 0.05) as did severity (0 per cent > grade 1 vs 58.3 per cent > grade 1, p = < 0.05). The proportion of patients undergoing surgery increased (19.1 vs 42.3 per cent, p = < 0.05) as did the mean operating time (102.4 vs 145.7 min, p = < 0.05). Surgery was performed in 1 confirmed and 1 suspected Covid-19 patient. The latter died within 30 days. There were no 30-day readmissions with Covid-19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 has significantly impacted the number of admissions to emergency general surgery. However, emergency operating continues to be needed at pre-Covid-19 levels and as such provisions need to be made to facilitate this.","Dick, Lachlan; Green, James; Brown, Jasmine; Kennedy, Ewan; Cassidy, Richard; Othman, Salasiah; Berlansky, Martin",World J Surg,17,20

Researches are ongoing to develop vaccines and traditional methods of Medicine and Biology have been applied in diagnosis and treatment. Though there are success stories of recovered cases as of November 10, 2020, there are no approved treatments and vaccines for COVID‐19. As the pandemic continues to spread, current measures rely on prevention, surveillance, and containment. In light of this, emerging technologies for tackling COVID‐19 become inevitable. Emerging technologies including geospatial technology, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, telemedicine, blockchain, 5G technology, smart applications, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), robotics, and additive manufacturing are substantially important for COVID‐19 detecting, monitoring, diagnosing, screening, surveillance, mapping, tracking, and creating awareness. Therefore, this study aimed at providing a comprehensive review of these technologies for tackling COVID‐19 with emphasis on the features, challenges, and country of domiciliation. Our results show that performance of the emerging technologies is not yet stable due to nonavailability of enough COVID‐19 dataset, inconsistency in some of the dataset available, nonaggregation of the dataset due to contrasting data format, missing data, and noise.

Objectives: To identify the cumulative incidence of ECMO use in the first pandemic wave and to describe the Nationwide Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a population-based study from March 3 to August 31, 2020, using linked data from national agencies. The cumulative incidence of ECMO use and mortality risk of ECMO-supported patients were calculated and age standardized. In addition, a retrospective cohort analysis was performed. Outcomes were 90-day mortality after ECMO initiation, ECMO-associated complications, and hospital length of stay. Cox regression models were used to explore risk factors for mortality in a time-to-event analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Ninety-four patients with COVID-19 were supported with ECMO (0.42 per population of 100,000, 14.89 per 100,000 positive cases, and 1.2% of intubated patients with COVID-19); 85 were included in the cohort analysis, and the median age was 48 (interquartile range [IQR], 41–55) years, 83.5% were men, and 42.4% had obesity. The median number of pre-ECMO intubation days was 4 (IQR, 2–7), the median Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) ratio was 86.8 (IQR, 64–99) mm Hg, 91.8% of patients were prone positioned, and 14 patients had refractory respiratory acidosis. Main complications were infections (70.6%), bleeding (38.8%), and thromboembolism (22.4%); 52 patients were discharged home, and 33 died. The hospital length of stay was a median of 50 (IQR, 24–69) days. Lower respiratory system compliance and higher driving pressure before ECMO initiation were associated with increased mortality. A duration of pre-ECMO intubation ≥10 days was not associated with mortality. Conclusions: Documenting nationwide ECMO needs may help in planning ECMO provision for future COVID-19 pandemic waves. The 90-day mortality of the Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 (38.8%) is comparable to that of previous reports.","Diaz, Rodrigo A.; Graf, Jerónimo; Zambrano, José M.; Ruiz, Carolina; Espinoza, Juan A.; Bravo, Sebastian I.; Salazar, Pablo A.; Bahamondes, Juan C.; Castillo, Luis B.; Gajardo, Abraham I.

To secure the full benefits of mass vaccination, which started in early January 2021, it is of utmost importance to complement it with mid-term non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The objective was to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until 15 February 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from 15 February 2021 to 30 June 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed for the first phase: (a) A baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs in January 2021; (b) a “semi-lockdown” scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing, and social distancing/teleworking in January 2021; and (c) a “rolling lockdown” scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the “semi-lockdown” scenario clearly outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities); the second phase is extremely sensitive on the availability of sufficient vaccine supplies and high vaccination rates.","Rachaniotis, Nikolaos P.; Dasaklis, Thomas K.; Fotopoulos, Filippos; Tinios, Platon",Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,1

To assist pathologists and radiologists in the detection of the novel coronavirus, in this paper we propose a two-tiered method, based on formal methods (to the best of authors knowledge never previously introduced in this context), aimed to (i) detect whether the patient lungs are healthy or present a generic pulmonary infection; (ii) in the case of the previous tier, a generic pulmonary disease is detected to identify whether the patient under analysis is affected by the novel Coronavirus disease. The proposed approach relies on the extraction of radiomic features from medical images and on the generation of a formal model that can be automatically checked using the model checking technique. We perform an experimental analysis using a set of computed tomography medical images obtained by the authors, achieving an accuracy of higher than 81% in disease detection.","Santone, Antonella; Belfiore, Maria Paola; Mercaldo, Francesco; Varriano, Giulia; Brunese, Luca",Diagnostics (Basel),17,26

As of 19 February 2020, there had been 333 confirmed cases reported in Shanghai, China. This study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with COVID‐19 in Shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference. Among the 333 confirmed cases in Shanghai, 172 (51.7%) were males and 161 (48.3%) were females, with a median age of 50 years. 299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms. 139 (41.7%) and 111 (33.3%) cases were infected in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively. 148 (44.4%) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset, while 103 (30.9%) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in Wuhan. The onset date of the first case in Shanghai was 28 December, with the peak appearing on 27 January. The median incubation period of COVID‐19 was estimated to be 7.2 days. 207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization. 56 (18.6%) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 (42.9%) had increased C‐reactive protein after onset. Elderly, male and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia. These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia. Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia. Time intervals from onset to visit, hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after Shanghai's first‐level public health emergency response. Shanghai's experience proves that COVID‐19 can be controlled well in megacities.","Yu, Xiao; Sun, Xiaodong; Cui, Peng; Pan, Hao; Lin, Sheng; Han, Ruobing; Jiang, Chenyan; Fang, Qiwen; Kong, Dechuan; Zhu, Yiyi; Zheng, Yaxu; Gong, Xiaohuan; Xiao, Wenjia; Mao, Shenghua; Jin, Bihong; Wu, Huanyu; Fu, Chen",Transbound Emerg Dis,17,21

These changes were described by survey data collected by the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program which were interpreted by a multi-institutional team of AMC pharmacists and physician investigators. METHODS: The CTSA program surveyed 60 AMC pharmacy departments. The survey included event timing, impact on pharmacy services, and corrective actions taken. RESULTS: Almost all departments (98.4%) reported at least one disruption. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) were common (91.5%) as were drug shortages (66.0%). To manage drug shortages, drug prioritization protocols were utilized, new drug supply vendors were identified (79.3%), and onsite compounding was initiated. PPE shortages were managed by incorporating the risk mitigation strategies recommended by FDA and others. Research pharmacists supported new clinical research initiatives at most institutions (84.0%), introduced use of virtual site visits, and shipped investigational drugs directly to patients. Some pharmacies formulated novel investigational products for clinical trial use. Those AMC pharmacies within networked health systems assisted partner rural and inner-city hospitals by sourcing commercial and investigational drugs to alleviate local disease outbreaks and shortages in underserved populations. Pharmacy-based vaccination practice was expanded to include a wider range of pediatric and adult vaccines. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic radically altered hospital pharmacy practice. By adopting innovative methods and adapting to regulatory imperatives, pharmacies at CTSA sites played an extremely important role supporting continuity of care and collaborating on critical clinical research initiatives.","MacArthur, Robert B.; Bentur, Ohad S.; MacArthur, Ian C.; Bartoo, Anna S.; Capozzi, Donna L.; Christensen, Jason A.; Johnson, Amber L.; Patel, Kuldip; Coller, Barry S.",Journal of clinical and translational science,17,3

We aimed to assess the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on all cause mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation at Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan from February 12th to March 2nd, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. All patients were followed until death or end of follow up (March 9th), and all survivors were followed for at least one week. Findings: Of 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (SD 1.8) years and 30 (83.3%) were men. 22 (61.1%) patients received CRRT (CRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed in conventional strategy (non CRRT group). There was no difference in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings, except for patients in the CRRT group with higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and serum creatinine. During the average follow-up period of 10.4 days, 12 of 22 (54.5%) patients in CRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in non CRRT group died. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated a prolonged survival in patients in CRRT group than non CRRT group (P=0.032). The association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors in seven different models, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) varying between 0.283 and 0.424. Older age, higher levels of IL1b, IL2 receptor, hs cTnI and NT proBNP were independently associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with CRRT treatment. Interpretation: CRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.","Yang, Yi; Shi, Jia; Ge, Shuwang; Guo, Shuiming; Xing, Xue; Wang, Yanan; Cheng, Anying; Liu, Qingquan; Li, Junhua; Ning, Yong; He, Fan; Xu, Gang",,17,20

The study aims at determining the effect of the current coronavirus epidemic in the form of stress perceived among the medical workers in Pakistan and to discover the moderating role played by a healthy climate in offsetting it. The data was collected from 255 medical workers through a self-administered online questionnaire. Multiple Hierarchical Regression was used as a tool to test the hypotheses of the study. The results obtained indicate a correlation between the pandemic and the stress caused by it among the health workers, whereas, the role of a wholesome climate in the reduction of stress among them was found lacking. Sub-hypotheses indicate that the healthy environment provided by supervisors is effective in reducing the impact of workers’ handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and perceived stress, while the healthy environment provided by hospitals in general or by workgroups fails to cause such positive change. This revelation necessitates the adoption of compulsory precautionary measures on the part of relevant authorities, because increase in stress caused by the pandemic can prove more lethal than the pandemic itself. The threat of the coronavirus pandemic has emerged as a massive socio-economic challenge for the global community, especially for the developing countries like Pakistan which faces serious socio-economic challenges in the current scenario. On account of the similarity of situations, the results obtained through this study can be safely generalized to other developing countries, particularly from the South Asian region.","Abbas, Sammar; AL-Abrrow, Hadi; Abdullah, Hasan Oudah; Alnoor, Alhamzah; Khattak, Zeeshan Zaib; Khaw, Khai Wah",Curr Psychol,17,11

However, the effect of SSS mobility on mental health among ASR has been underexplored so far. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study among a random sample of 560 adult ASR living in 64 collective accommodation centres in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. SSS in the country of origin before emigration and in Germany was assessed with a multi-lingual, adapted version of the MacArthur social ladder. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured as mental health outcomes. Generalized linear regression models were fitted to estimate associations between changes in SSS and each outcome. RESULTS: A perceived loss of three or more steps in SSS from origin to Germany (compared to no change) was associated with poorer scores in HRQoL (B, standardized coefficient = -2.679, standard error, se = 1.351, p = 0.047), with more depressive symptoms (B = 1.156, se = 0.389, p = 0.003) and anxiety (B = 0.971, se = 0.432, p = 0.025), in models adjusted for SSS in country of origin. The strength and direction of associations remained after adjusting for sex, age, education and time since arrival (HRQoL: B = -2.494, se = 1.351, p = 0.066; depression: B = 1.048, se = 0.393, p = 0.008; anxiety: B = 1.006, se = 0.438, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: ASR experiencing downward SSS mobility present poorer mental health compared to those experiencing no change in SSS. Early integration efforts and intersectoral measures to counter social downward mobility could prevent poor mental health among ASR.","Costa, Diogo; Biddle, Louise; Mühling, Catharina; Bozorgmehr, Kayvan",J Migr Health,17,1

RT-qPCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are ideal in a hospital environment. However, mass testing requires cheaper and simpler tests, especially in settings that lack sophisticated machinery. The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60–93% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests. A series of simple modifications to standard RT-LAMP published methods to stabilize pH fluctuations due to salivary acidity resulted in a significant improvement in reliability, opening new avenues for efficient, low-cost testing of COVID-19 infection.","Uribe-Alvarez, Cristina; Lam, Quynh; Baldwin, Don A.; Chernoff, Jonathan",PLoS One,17,21

First, we predict the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals by supervised learning methods, i.e., logistic Lasso regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and support vector machine, using survey data we collected of personal attributes and frequency of visits to specific facilities, to test our conjecture. We find that gender, a crucial attribute, is as highly predictable from locations as from other sources such as social networking services, as done by existing studies. Second, we apply the model trained with the survey data to actual GPS log data to check the performance of our approach in a real-world setting. Though our approach does not perform as well as for the survey data, the results suggest that we can infer gender from a GPS log.","Doi, Shohei; Mizuno, Takayuki; Fujiwara, Naoya",J Comput Soc Sci,17,9

Paternal depression is associated with less responsive parenting, greater parenting stress, and suboptimal child development. In response to a lack of existing interventions that directly focus on fathers’ mental health in the United States, we developed and pilot tested the Fathers and Babies (FAB) intervention for use with partners of women enrolled in home visiting (HV) programs. After a review of the extant literature, FAB was developed with input from HV stakeholders and infant mental health consultants. FAB was subsequently pilot tested with 30 father-mother dyads, with mixed-method data collected from a subset of intervention participants to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability and guide intervention refinement. Five themes related to FAB content and delivery considerations emerged from the initial focus groups that were used to guide FAB development. Mixed-method data collected during the pilot study established that fathers receiving FAB reported its content appropriate and thought it was feasible to receive the intervention. Several recommendations for FAB revisions were also provided. FAB is an innovative intervention developed for fathers from contemporary family structures that was well-received during its pilot testing.

These neural signals may become dysregulated in several genitourinary (GU) disease states, both benign and malignant. Accordingly, the autonomic nervous system is a therapeutic target for several genitourinary pathologies including cancer, voiding dysfunction, and obstructing nephrolithiasis. Adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors) are G-Protein coupled-receptors that are distributed throughout the body. The major function of α1-adrenoceptors is signaling smooth muscle contractions through GPCR and intracellular calcium influx. Pharmacologic intervention of α-and β-adrenoceptors is routinely and successfully implemented in the treatment of benign urologic illnesses, through the use of α-adrenoceptor antagonists. Furthermore, cell-based evidence recently established the antitumor effect of α1-adrenoceptor antagonists in prostate, bladder and renal tumors by reducing neovascularity and impairing growth within the tumor microenvironment via regulation of the phenotypic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). There has been a significant focus on repurposing the routinely used, Food and Drug Administration-approved α1-adrenoceptor antagonists to inhibit GU tumor growth and angiogenesis in patients with advanced prostate, bladder, and renal cancer. In this review we discuss the current evidence on (a) the signaling events of the autonomic nervous system mediated by its cognate α- and β-adrenoceptors in regulating the phenotypic landscape (EMT) of genitourinary organs; and (b) the therapeutic significance of targeting this signaling pathway in benign and malignant urologic disease.

Family and clinician perspectives about phone and video communication in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet well understood. Increased knowledge about clinicians’ and families’ experiences with telehealth may help to improve the quality of remote interactions with families during periods of hospital visitor restrictions during COVID-19. Objectives: To explore experiences, perspectives, and attitudes of family members and ICU clinicians about phone and video interactions during COVID-19 hospital visitor restrictions. Methods: We conducted a qualitative interviewing study with an intentional sample of 21 family members and 14 treating clinicians of cardiothoracic and neurologic ICU patients at an academic medical center in April 2020. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with each participant. We used content analysis to develop a codebook and analyze interview transcripts. We specifically explored themes of effectiveness, benefits and limitations, communication strategies, and discordant perspectives between families and clinicians related to remote discussions. Results: Respondents viewed phone and video communication as somewhat effective but inferior to in-person communication. Both clinicians and families believed phone calls were useful for information sharing and brief updates, whereas video calls were preferable for aligning clinician and family perspectives. Clinicians and families expressed discordant views on multiple topics—for example, clinicians worried they were unsuccessful in conveying empathy remotely, whereas families believed empathy was conveyed successfully via phone and video. Communication strategies suggested by families and clinicians for remote interactions include identifying a family point person to receive updates, frequently checking family understanding, positioning the camera on video calls to help family see the patient and their clinical setting, and offering time for the family and patient to interact without clinicians participating. Conclusions: Telehealth communication between families and clinicians of ICU patients appears to be a somewhat effective alternative when in-person communication is not possible. Use of communication strategies specific to phone and video can improve clinician and family experiences with telehealth.","Kennedy, Niki R.; Steinberg, Alexis; Arnold, Robert M.; Doshi, Ankur A.; White, Douglas B.; DeLair, Will; Nigra, Karen; Elmer, Jonathan",Ann Am Thorac Soc,17,21

This study focused on describing air quality during the initial phase of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (since there were fewer anthropogenic activities) in 10 Chinese mega-cities. Using the independent t-test, the means of air quality index (AQI) scores and individual air pollutants concentration during the outbreak were compared with the means before the outbreak. Cohen’s d was estimated to quantify how much difference was observed. Based on the AQI score, the air quality in these 10 cities ranged from excellent (Shenzhen) to light pollution (Xi’an) with 44.8 μg m(−3) and 119.7 μg m(−3), respectively. In comparison to the 2019 air quality, Guangzhou and Wuhan noted major differences in air quality during the outbreak. Indicators of traffic pollution, particularly NO(2), were significantly lower during the outbreak in all cities. Particulate matter pollution varied, with some cities observing lower concentrations and other higher concentrations during the outbreak. There was a significant decrease in air pollution levels during the outbreak. More researchers should observe changes in air quality during peculiar or major events. Implementation of stringent regulation on vehicle use should be considered in mega-cities. Relevant findings should be employed in emphasizing the detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities and support the need for stringent emission control regulations.","Ethan, Crystal Jane; Mokoena, Kingsley Katleho; Yu, Yan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,1

However, the duration of RNA shedding in Wuhan is rarely known and the meaning of the prolonged shedding is still under investigation. Almost 10% patients diagnosed of COVID-19 had a RNA shedding longer than 30 days even if the symptom elimination. The IgM was in a high level in the 9th week after symptom onset in these prolonged-RNA-shedding patients. Further study should be conducted to know the infectivity of the virus and the relationship between RNA shedding and antibody expression. This article is protected by copyright.

The way the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the cell is a complex process and comprises four main stages: attachment to the cognate receptor, cellular entry, replication and cellular egress. Since, this is a multi-part process, it creates many opportunities to develop effective interventions. Targeting binding of the virus to the host receptor in order to prevent its entry has been of particular interest. Here, we provide experimental evidence that, among 56 tested polyphenols, including plant extracts, brazilin, theaflavin-3,3’-digallate, and curcumin displayed the highest binding with the receptor-binding domain of spike protein, inhibiting viral attachment to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and thus cellular entry of pseudo-typed SARS-CoV-2 virions. Both, theaflavin-3,3’-digallate at 25 μg/ml and curcumin above 10 μg/ml concentration, showed binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor reducing at the same time its activity in both cell-free and cell-based assays. Our study also demonstrates that brazilin and theaflavin-3,3’-digallate, and to a still greater extent, curcumin, decrease the activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 both in cell-free and cell-based assays. Similar pattern was observed with cathepsin L, although only theaflavin-3,3’-digallate showed a modest diminution of cathepsin L expression at protein level. Finally, each of these three compounds moderately increased endosomal/lysosomal pH. In conclusion, this study demonstrates pleiotropic anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of specific polyphenols and their prospects for further scientific and clinical investigations.","Goc, Anna; Sumera, Waldemar; Rath, Matthias; Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra",PLoS One,17,10

To our knowledge, no studies have examined infant and toddler sleep during this pandemic. We sought to compare parent-reported sleep characteristics of infants and toddlers over successive quarters of the past year. METHODS: Parents of children aged 0–36 months were surveyed primarily in the Midwestern USA between 01/17/2020 and 12/07/2020. Each parent responded only once. Age was categorized as: <6 months, 6–12 months, 12–24 months, and 24–36 months. Income was categorized as: <$50,000, $50-100,000, $100-150,000, and >$150,000. The year was divided into quarters. Multivariable linear regression included Total Sleep Time (TST), Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) and parental frustration with sleep (any frustration, scale of 1–5) as dependent variables and year quarter, child’s age, prematurity, child’s comorbidities, maternal age (during their child’s birth), parenting experience, household income, and room sharing as independent variables. Logistic regression included nap consistency (napping at the same time daily) as the dependent variable, and year quarter, child’s age, prematurity, comorbidity, maternal age, parenting experience, household income, and room sharing as independent variables. RESULTS: Of 594 children, mean age was 18.5±9.7 months and 52% were female. Prematurity and comorbidities were reported for 8% and 15%, respectively. Mean maternal age was 31.8±4.5 years. Neither TST (β=-0.488; p= 0.16) nor SOL (β= 0.029; p=0.23) were associated with year quarter. SOL was 3 minutes less for each increase in income category (β =-0.051; p= 0.003). TST (β = -0.994; p<0.001) and SOL (β =0.092; p<0.0001) were most associated with child’s age. Parental frustration was associated with child’s age (β=0.12; p= 0.04), comorbidity (β=0.30; p=0.05) and room sharing (β= -0.38; p=0.006), but not year quarter. Nap consistency was associated with increased child age category (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.13, 1.94) and lack of room sharing (OR=2.09; 1.10, 3.97), but not year quarter. CONCLUSION: Parent-estimated TST, nap consistency and sleep-related frustration did not differ significantly over the first 12 months of the pandemic. Yet, our results underscore that special attention should be given to the sleep of infants and toddlers with comorbidities, who share a room, and who have a lower household income.
