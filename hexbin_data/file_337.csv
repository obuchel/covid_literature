2085,Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR Assay for Detection of Senecavirus A in Swine Vesicular Diagnostic Specimens,2016-01-12,"Senecavirus A (SV-A), formerly, Seneca Valley virus (SVV), has been detected in swine with vesicular lesions and is thought to be associated with swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD), a vesicular disease syndrome that lacks a defined causative agent. The clinical presentation of SIVD resembles that of other more contagious and economically devastating vesicular diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS), that typically require immediate rule out diagnostics to lift restrictions on animal quarantine, movement, and trade. This study presents the development of a sensitive, SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay suitable for detection of SV-A in diagnostic swine specimens. After testing 50 pigs with clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease, 44 (88%) were found to be positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR as compared to none from a negative cohort of 35 animals without vesicular disease, indicating that the assay is able to successfully detect the virus in an endemic population. SV-A RNA was also detectable at a low level in sera from a subset of pigs that presented with (18%) or without (6%) vesicular signs. In 2015, there has been an increase in the occurrence of SV-A in the US, and over 200 specimens submitted to our laboratory for vesicular investigation have tested positive for the virus using this method. SV-A RNA was detectable in all common types of vesicular specimens including swabs and tissue from hoof lesions, oral and snout epithelium, oral swabs, scabs, and internal organ tissues such as liver and lymph node. Genome sequencing analysis from recent virus isolates was performed to confirm target amplicon specificity and was aligned to previous isolates.","Bracht, Alexa J.; O’Hearn, Emily S.; Fabian, Andrew W.; Barrette, Roger W.; Sayed, Abu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710529/,337
2297,Depletion of Alveolar Macrophages Does Not Prevent Hantavirus Disease Pathogenesis in Golden Syrian Hamsters,2016-06-24,"Andes virus (ANDV) is associated with a lethal vascular leak syndrome in humans termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The mechanism for the massive vascular leakage associated with HPS is poorly understood; however, dysregulation of components of the immune response is often suggested as a possible cause. Alveolar macrophages are found in the alveoli of the lung and represent the first line of defense to many airborne pathogens. To determine whether alveolar macrophages play a role in HPS pathogenesis, alveolar macrophages were depleted in an adult rodent model of HPS that closely resembles human HPS. Syrian hamsters were treated, intratracheally, with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes or control liposomes and were then challenged with ANDV. Treatment with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes resulted in significant reduction in alveolar macrophages, but depletion did not prevent pathogenesis or prolong disease. Depletion also did not significantly reduce the amount of virus in the lung of ANDV-infected hamsters but altered neutrophil recruitment, MIP-1α and MIP-2 chemokine expression, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in hamster bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid early after intranasal challenge. These data demonstrate that alveolar macrophages may play a limited protective role early after exposure to aerosolized ANDV but do not directly contribute to hantavirus disease pathogenesis in the hamster model of HPS. IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses continue to cause disease worldwide for which there are no FDA-licensed vaccines, effective postexposure prophylactics, or therapeutics. Much of this can be attributed to a poor understanding of the mechanism of hantavirus disease pathogenesis. Hantavirus disease has long been considered an immune-mediated disease; however, by directly manipulating the Syrian hamster model, we continue to eliminate individual immune cell types. As the most numerous immune cells present in the respiratory tract, alveolar macrophages are poised to defend against hantavirus infection, but those antiviral responses may also contribute to hantavirus disease. Here, we demonstrate that, like in our prior T and B cell studies, alveolar macrophages neither prevent hantavirus infection nor cause hantavirus disease. While these studies reflect pathogenesis in the hamster model, they should help us rule out specific cell types and prompt us to consider other potential mechanisms of disease in an effort to improve the outcome of human HPS.","Hammerbeck, Christopher D.; Brocato, Rebecca L.; Bell, Todd M.; Schellhase, Christopher W.; Mraz, Steven R.; Queen, Laurie A.; Hooper, Jay W.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936146/,337
3578,Identification of Diaryl-Quinoline Compounds as Entry Inhibitors of Ebola Virus,2018-11-30,"Ebola virus is the causative agent of Ebola virus disease in humans. The lethality of Ebola virus infection is about 50%, supporting the urgent need to develop anti-Ebola drugs. Glycoprotein (GP) is the only surface protein of the Ebola virus, which is functionally critical for the virus to attach and enter the host cells, and is a promising target for anti-Ebola virus drug development. In this study, using the recombinant HIV-1/Ebola pseudovirus platform we previously established, we evaluated a small molecule library containing various quinoline compounds for anti-Ebola virus entry inhibitors. Some of the quinoline compounds specifically inhibited the entry of the Ebola virus. Among them, compound SYL1712 was the most potent Ebola virus entry inhibitor with an IC(50) of ~1 μM. The binding of SYL1712 to the vial glycoprotein was computationally modeled and was predicted to interact with specific residues of GP. We used the time of the addition assay to show that compound SYL1712 blocks Ebola GP-mediated entry. Finally, consistent with being an Ebola virus entry inhibitor, compound SYL1712 inhibited infectious Ebola virus replication in tissue culture under biosafety level 4 containment, with an IC(50) of 2 μM. In conclusion, we identified several related molecules with a diaryl-quinoline scaffold as potential anti-EBOV entry inhibitors, which can be further optimized for anti-Ebola drug development.","Cui, Qinghua; Cheng, Han; Xiong, Rui; Zhang, Gang; Du, Ruikun; Anantpadma, Manu; Davey, Robert A.; Rong, Lijun",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315506/,337
5511,Comparison of JEV neutralization assay using pseudotyped JEV with the conventional plaque-reduction neutralization test,2014-03-07,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of acute hepatitis and jaundice. The number of human infections is approximated to be over 20 million cases per year. The transmission is mainly via the fecal-oral route and contaminated water and food are considered to be a major source of infection. As a mouse model is not available, a recent development of a cell culture-adapted HEV strain (47832c) is considered as a very important tools for molecular analysis of HEV pathogenesis in cells. Previously, we demonstrated that HEV-encoded methyltransferase (MeT) encoded by the 47832c strain inhibits MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated activation of interferon β (IFN-β) promoter. Here, we report that MeT impairs the phosphorylation and activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the MeT encoded by the 47832c, but not that of HEV clinical or field isolates (SAR-55, Mex-14, KC-1, and ZJ-1), displays the inhibitory effect. A deeper understanding of MeTmediated suppression of IFN-β expression would provide basis of the cell culture adaptation of HEV.","Myoung, Jinjong; Lee, Jeong Yoon; Min, Kang Sang",J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090864/,337
7237,Ultrasensitive Monitoring of HIV-1 Viral Load by a Low-Cost Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Assay with Internal Control for the 5′ Long Terminal Repeat Domain,2006-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-based studies identify parechovirus (PeV), primarily PeV-A3, as an important cause of severe infections in young children. However, few community-based studies have been published and the true PeV infection burden is unknown. We investigated PeV epidemiology in healthy children participating in a community-based, longitudinal birth cohort study. METHODS: Australian children (n = 158) enrolled in the Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study were followed from birth until their second birthday. Weekly stool and nasal swabs and daily symptom diaries were collected. Swabs were tested for PeV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and genotypes determined by subgenomic sequencing. Incidence rate, infection characteristics, clinical associations, and virus codetections were investigated. RESULTS: PeV was detected in 1423 of 11 124 (12.8%) and 17 of 8100 (0.2%) stool and nasal swabs, respectively. Major genotypes among the 306 infection episodes identified were PeV-A1 (47.9%), PeV-A6 (20.1%), and PeV-A3 (18.3%). The incidence rate was 144 episodes (95% confidence interval, 128–160) per 100 child-years. First infections appeared at a median age of 8 (interquartile range, 6.0–11.7) months. Annual seasonal peaks changing from PeV-A1 to PeV-A3 were observed. Infection was positively associated with age ≥6 months, summer season, nonexclusive breastfeeding at age <3 months, and formal childcare attendance before age 12 months. Sole PeV infections were either asymptomatic (38.4%) or mild (32.7%), while codetection with other viruses in stool swabs was common (64.4%). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with hospital-based studies, this study showed that diverse and dynamically changing PeV genotypes circulate in the community causing mild or subclinical infections in children. Parechovirus can cause severe illnesses in children. However, studies focus mainly on hospitalized populations. True disease burden in the community remains largely unknown. From our community-based cohort, we found diverse parechovirus genotypes in the community, causing mild or subclinical infections in children.","Wang, Claire Y T; Ware, Robert S; Lambert, Stephen B; Mhango, Lebogang P; Tozer, Sarah; Day, Rebecca; Grimwood, Keith; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108192/,337
21413,Enhanced Microfluidic Sample Homogeneity and Improved Antibody-Based Assay Kinetics Due to Magnetic Mixing,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a serious parasitic zoonosis caused by the larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The development of an effective vaccine is one of the most promising strategies for controlling CE. METHODS: The E. granulosus 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EgHCDH) gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The distribution of EgHCDH in protoscoleces (PSCs) and adult worms was analyzed using immunofluorescence. The transcript levels of EgHCDH in PSCs and adult worms were analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The immune protective effects of the rEgHCDH were evaluated. RESULTS: The 924-bp open reading frame sequence of EgHCDH, which encodes a protein of approximately 34 kDa, was obtained. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that EgHCDH was expressed in both the PSCs and adult worms of E. granulosus. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that EgHCDH was mainly localized in the tegument of PSCs and adult worms. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was recognized by E. granulosus-infected dog sera. Animal challenge experiments demonstrated that dogs immunized with recombinant (r)EgHCDH had significantly higher serum IgG, interferon gamma and interleukin-4 concentrations than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control group. The rEgHCDH vaccine was able to significantly reduce the number of E. granulosus and inhibit the segmental development of E. granulosus compared to the PBS control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rEgHCDH can induce partial immune protection against infection with E. granulosus and could be an effective candidate for the development of new vaccines.

22060,Publisher Correction: Agreement between commercially available ELISA and in-house Luminex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays,2021-10-05,"Several B-cell subsets with distinct functions and polarized cytokine profiles that extend beyond antibody production have been reported in different cancers. Here we have demonstrated that proliferating B cells were predominantly found in the peritumoral region of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). These B cells were enriched in tumor nests with high expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). High densities of peritumoral proliferating B cells and concomitantly high intratumoral HMGB1 expression showed improved prognostic significance, surpassing prognostic stratification of ESCC patients based on HMGB1 positivity alone. This striking association led us to set up models to test whether cancer-derived HMGB1 could shape tumor microenvironment via modulation on B cells. Overexpression of HMGB1 in ESCC cell lines (KYSE510 and EC18) enhanced proliferation and migration of B cells. Transcriptomic analysis showed that migratory B cells exhibited high enrichment of proangiogenic genes. VEGF expression in proliferating B cells was induced upon co-culture of HMGB1-overexpressing tumor cells and B cells. Secretome array profiling of conditioned media (CM) from the co-culture revealed rich expression of proangiogenic proteins. Consequently, incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with CM promoted angiogenesis in tube formation and migration assays. HMGB1 inhibitor, glycyrrhizin, abolishes all the observed proangiogenic phenotypes. Finally, co-injection of B cells and CM with HMGB1-overexpressing tumor cells, but not with glycyrrhizin, significantly enhanced tumor growth associated with increased microvascular density in ESCC xenograft mice model. Our results indicate that cancer-derived HMGB1 elevates angiogenesis in ESCC by shifting the balance toward proangiogenic signals in proliferating B cells.

32645,About clarity in diagrams: again!,2020-05-18,"We present a continuous formulation of epidemic spreading on multilayer networks using a tensorial representation, extending the models of monoplex networks to this context. We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics, as well as upper and lower bounds for the disease prevalence in the steady state for the SIS scenario. Using the quasistationary state method, we numerically show the existence of disease localization and the emergence of two or more susceptibility peaks, which are characterized analytically and numerically through the inverse participation ratio. At variance with what is observed in single-layer networks, we show that disease localization takes place on the layers and not on the nodes of a given layer. Furthermore, when mapping the critical dynamics to an eigenvalue problem, we observe a characteristic transition in the eigenvalue spectra of the supra-contact tensor as a function of the ratio of two spreading rates: If the rate at which the disease spreads within a layer is comparable to the spreading rate across layers, the individual spectra of each layer merge with the coupling between layers. Finally, we report on an interesting phenomenon, the barrier effect; i.e., for a three-layer configuration, when the layer with the lowest eigenvalue is located at the center of the line, it can effectively act as a barrier to the disease. The formalism introduced here provides a unifying mathematical approach to disease contagion in multiplex systems, opening new possibilities for the study of spreading processes.","de Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz; Cozzo, Emanuele; Peixoto, Tiago P.; Rodrigues, Francisco A.; Moreno, Yamir",Phys Rev X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219475/,337

40561,Proactive machine-learning-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy for a potential SARS-Cov-2 vaccine,2020-09-30,"ABSTRACT: The lockdowns instigated to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a unique opportunity to assess how restrictions on human activity affect street litter. We recorded daily litter arrival rates for 50 days in two South African cities from the time of strictest lockdown through two successive easings in regulations. The strict lockdown had no marked impact on litter composition, which was dominated by convenience foods and beverages (29% by number, 34% by mass) and tobacco products (33% by number, 3% by mass). The ban on the sale of tobacco products during the lockdown did not greatly reduce the number of cigarette butts and associated packaging. Vehicle parts accounted for <1% of litter items (2% by mass) whereas household waste spilled from bins prior to or during collection accounted for 3% of litter items (14% by mass). Street litter loads decreased roughly by a factor of three during the strict lockdown. The increase in litter was gradual, suggesting a reduction in compliance with regulations as the lockdown continued. Our results show a clear link between human activity levels and littering. HIGHLIGHTS: • Street litter loads increased three-fold in two cities as Covid lockdowns eased. • Cigarette butts made up 33% of litter by number despite a ban on tobacco sales. • There is a clear link between human activity levels and littering.

52391,Development of Diabetes Type 3 After SARS-COV-2 Pancreatic B Cell Injury,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: A priority action of the Healthy Ireland implementation plan is the Making Every Contact Count initiative (MECC) that aims to leverage the 30 million annual contacts with the healthcare system by asking every health worker to deliver brief interventions [1]. Benefits of brief interventions are well established, but GPs and pharmacists report challenges implementing them in practice including limited training, time, and poor fit with existing practices [2]. AIM: This government-funded Sláintecare project aimed to develop a novel method for brief interventions in pharmacy/GP settings using human-centred design. METHODS: User research was carried out with twelve users, including patients (3), GPs (4), and pharmacists (5) to identify their needs and priorities. Participants were recruited via email using a purposive sampling approach and completed semi-structured interviews with a design researcher. All participants invited agreed to participate. Next, a series of design sprints were completed with the research team. Design sprints allowed the team to integrate insights from user research with findings from a literature review/secondary research to understand pain points, identify stakeholder and user goals, and develop a list of initial design specifications. This list was used to develop and iterate a series of prototype solutions. Prototype service blueprints and wireframes (simple, two-dimensional schematic illustrations of the digital interface) were developed and tested with users before final versions were agreed. RESULTS: Findings from the interviews and literature review indicated (1) the main barrier to adoption was time, (2) patients and pharmacists were very positive about brief interventions with GPs more hesitant, (3) an approach blending technology with a consultation was preferred, and (4) having a specific list of local supports was important. Prototyping and evaluation processes identified that a simple interface with a clear indication of progress were preferred. A blended intervention combining a tablet-based digital tool and structured interaction was developed. The interface was designed to maximise use of patient and healthcare professional time, and mapped to the 5As approach (which is underpinned by principles of motivational interviewing, shared-decision making, and readiness to change frameworks). The HealthEir digital tool enables patients to self-complete the Ask, Advise, and Assess phases of a brief intervention using a tablet device while waiting to see their pharmacist/GP. The pharmacist or GP then review the patient’s responses, risk level, and importance confidence and readiness scores. They complete the Assist and Arrange elements during the consultation, supported by a directory of local/national patient support services before printing information tickets for the patient to keep. The HealthEir intervention has been successfully rolled out at eight pilot pharmacy sites nationally, with a mix of urban/rural sites, and independent/chain pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting an interdisciplinary approach based on human-centred design principles led to the development of a blended brief intervention that has been successfully introduced in pilot sites across Ireland. While the implementation has been smooth despite COVID-19 challenges, and initial feedback has been very positive, the impact cannot yet be fully evaluated as research is ongoing. Future work will involve extending the intervention to include other healthcare professionals. REFERENCES: 1.

52627,Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus X4-like accessory protein,2021-05-08,"OBJECTIVES: Using a prospective longitudinal design, this paper examines a serial mediation model of the associations between self-compassion, trait mindfulness, caregiver stress, and depressive symptoms among the family caregivers of patients with lung cancer. METHODS: A four-wave design was used, with initial assessment (T1) and three follow-ups, at the 2(nd) month (T2), the 5(th) month (T3), and the 8(th) month (T4). A total of 123 family caregivers completed the baseline measurements, including caregiver stress, self-compassion, trait mindfulness, and depressive symptoms. Data were analyzed by serial mediation models to determine the causal ordering of these variables. RESULTS: Nearly one-quarter of the family caregivers suffered from clinically significant depressive symptoms and the severity of their depression remained unchanged throughout the 8-month follow-up period. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal path analyses revealed that the relationship between self-compassion and depressive symptoms was mediated sequentially by trait mindfulness and caregiver stress. The subscale analysis indicated that the association of higher compassionate action with fewer depressive symptoms was through chain-mediating effects of higher mindful awareness and lower caregiver stress. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers who have higher levels of self-compassion tend to have more mindfulness; greater mindfulness leads to lower levels of perceived caregiving stress which, in turn, links to fewer symptoms of depression. Both self-compassion and mindfulness could be regarded as protective factors for caregivers to reduce caregiving stress and depression.","Hsieh, Chia-Chen; Lin, Zhong-Zhe; Ho, Chao-Chi; Yu, Chong-Jen; Chen, Hsiu-Jung; Chen, Yu-Wen; Hsiao, Fei-Hsiu",Mindfulness (N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8096886/,337

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 50 children aged 0–18 years. Monospecific direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and investigations for secondary causes were performed. Disease status was categorized based on Cerevance criteria. RESULTS: Median (range) age at diagnosis was 36 (1.5–204) months. AIHA was categorized as cold (IgM+,C3+/cold agglutinin+) (35%), warm (IgG+ with/without C3+) (28%), mixed (IgG+, IgM+, C3+) (15%) and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (4%). Primary AIHA accounted for 64% cases. Treatment modalities included steroid (66%), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (4%), steroid+IVIg (4%), and steroid+rituximab (4%). Treatment duration was longer for secondary AIHA than primary (11 vs 6.6 months, P<0.02) and in patients needing polytherapy than steroids only (13.3 vs 7.5 months, P<0.006).

Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. To address this emerging problem, we focused on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. We have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized a potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor (Ac-Abu-DTyr-Leu-Gln-VS, half-maximal effective concentration of 3.7 µM) and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We visualized active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents and/or diagnostic tests.","Rut, Wioletta; Groborz, Katarzyna; Zhang, Linlin; Sun, Xinyuanyuan; Zmudzinski, Mikolaj; Pawlik, Bartlomiej; Wang, Xinyu; Jochmans, Dirk; Neyts, Johan; Młynarski, Wojciech; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Drag, Marcin",Nature chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-020-00689-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093684/,337

We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the mortality benefit of non-specialist therapeutic interventions for ARDS available to general critical care units. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register for RCTs investigating therapeutic interventions in ARDS including corticosteroids, fluid management strategy, high PEEP, low tidal volume ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or recruitment maneuvers. Data was collected on demographic information, treatment strategy, duration and dose of treatment, and primary (28 or 30-day mortality) and secondary (PaO2:FiO2 ratio at 24-48 hours) outcomes. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS No improvement in 28-day mortality could be demonstrated in three RCTs investigating high PEEP (28.0% vs. 30.2% control; risk ratio [confidence interval] 0.93 [0.82-1.06]; eight assessing prone position ventilation (39.3% vs. 44.5%; RR 0.83 [0.68-1.01]; seven investigating neuromuscular blockade (37.8% vs. 42.0%; RR 0.91 [0.81-1.03]); ten investigating recruitment maneuvers (42.4% vs. 42.1%; RR 1.01 [0.91-1.12]); eight investigating steroids (34.8% vs. 41.1%; RR 0.81 [0.59-1.12]); and one investigating conservative fluid strategies (25.5% vs. 28.4%; RR 0.90 [0.73-1.10]). Three studies assessing low tidal volume ventilation (33.1% vs. 41.9 %; RR 0.79 (0.68-0.91); p=0.001), and subgroup analyses within studies investigating prone position ventilation greater than 12 hours (33.1% vs. 44.4%; RR 0.75 [0.59-0.95), p=0.02) did reveal outcome benefit. CONCLUSIONS Among non-specialist therapeutic strategies available to general critical care units, low tidal volumes and prone position ventilation for greater than 12 hours improve mortality in ARDS.","Longobardo, Alessia; Snow, Timothy A; Tam, Karen; Singer, Mervyn; Bellingan, Geoff; Arulkumaran, Nishkantha",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15254-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594874/,337

64098,Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater tracks community infection dynamics.,2020-09-18,"PURPOSE The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize the literature on nursing support during the latent phase of the first stage of labor. In 2014, the definition of the beginning of active labor changed from 4 centimeters (cm) to 6 cm cervical dilation. More women may have an induction of labor based on results of recent research showing no causal increase in risk of cesarean birth with elective induction of labor for low-risk nulliparous women. Therefore, in-hospital latent phase labor may be longer, increasing the need for nursing support. DESIGN Scoping review of the literature from 2009 to present. METHODS We conducted the review using key words in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. Search terms included different combinations of ""latent or early labor,"" ""birth,"" ""support,"" ""nursing support,"" ""obstetrics,"" and ""onset of labor."" Peer-reviewed research and quality improvement articles from 2009 to present were included if they had specific implications for nursing care during the latent phase of labor. Articles were excluded if they were not specific to nursing, focused exclusively on tool development, or were from the perspective of pregnant women or providers only. RESULTS Ten articles were included. Results were synthesized into six categories; support of physiologic labor and birth, the nurse's own personal view of labor, birth environment, techniques and tools, decision-making, and importance of latent labor discussion during the prenatal period. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Support for physiologic labor and birth is an important consideration for use of nonpharmacological methods during latent labor. The nurse's own personal view on labor support can influence the support that laboring women receive. Nurses may need additional education on labor support methods.","Breman, Rachel Blankstein; Neerland, Carrie",MCN.

AIM Effect of high dose, oral cholecalciferol supplementation on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. DESIGN Randomised, placebo-controlled. PARTICIPANTS Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D<20 ng/ml) individuals. INTERVENTION Participants were randomised to receive daily 60 000 IU of cholecalciferol (oral nano-liquid droplets) for 7 days with therapeutic target 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml (intervention group) or placebo (control group). Patients requiring invasive ventilation or with significant comorbidities were excluded. 25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7, and cholecalciferol supplementation was continued for those with 25(OH)D <50 ng/ml in the intervention arm. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inflammatory markers fibrinogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin and (CRP), ferritin were measured periodically. OUTCOME MEASURE Proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative before day-21 and change in inflammatory markers. RESULTS Forty SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals were randomised to intervention (n=16) or control (n=24) group. Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 8.6 (7.1 to 13.1) and 9.54 (8.1 to 12.5) ng/ml (p=0.730), in the intervention and control group, respectively. 10 out of 16 patients could achieve 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml by day-7 and another two by day-14 [day-14 25(OH)D levels 51.7 (48.9 to 59.5) ng/ml and 15.2 (12.7 to 19.5) ng/ml (p<0.001) in intervention and control group, respectively]. 10 (62.5%) participants in the intervention group and 5 (20.8%) participants in the control arm (p<0.018) became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased with cholecalciferol supplementation (intergroup difference 0.70 ng/ml; P=0.007) unlike other inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSION Greater proportion of vitamin D-deficient individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection turned SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative with a significant decrease in fibrinogen on high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation.

66011,Community-level evidence for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection of unvaccinated individuals.,2021-06-10,"Many infants born prematurely develop brain injury within the first few days after birth. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a safe technology that can continuously monitor the varying levels of oxygenation in the brain. Analysis of this signal has the potential to detect the onset of brain injury. We develop a method that extracts transient waveforms from the oxygenation signal. This method uses the cosine transform and singular-spectrum analysis to decompose the signal. We test different procedures to select a threshold for estimating the transient component. As part of the development of the method, we build a model of the cerebral oxygenation signals combining clusters of transient waveforms and nonstationary coloured noise. After development, we test on cerebral oxygenation recordings from 10 extremely preterm infants. We find that using the decomposition method to remove the transient components improves detection performance of brain injury, from an area-under the receiver operator characteristic of 0.91 to 1.00. These findings highlight the importance of specific signal processing methods for the cerebral oxygenation signal and the potential for NIRS as a neuromonitoring technology in neonatal intensive care.","Or Toole, John M; Dempsey, Eugene M; Boylan, Geraldine B",Conference proceedings : ...

The current project explored what caused U.S. adults' fear of COVID-19 and how they regulated fear using a longitudinal two-wave survey on a national-representative sample (N = 315). Results showed that participants' media exposure frequency and their perceived valence of interpersonal communication predicted their fear of COVID-19 at both waves, and fear at wave 1 further motivated higher frequency of media and interpersonal communication as well as strengthened perceptions that their interpersonal conversations emphasized the danger aspect of COVID-19 at wave 2. Counterarguing was effective in down-regulating individuals' fear, which in turn further encouraged more subsequent use of such strategy. Avoidance used in wave 1 predicted counterarguing at wave 2, while counterarguing employed in wave 1 predicted the subsequent use of reappraisal. Individuals may choose to use counterarguing as a maladaptive coping strategy to control their fear, and they tend to shift from one emotion regulation strategy to another as the pandemic progresses.","Li, Ruobing",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1901423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752522/,337

In this study, the α-MSH-derived peptide NAP-NS1 (Nle-Asp-His-d-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-NH2 ) with and without linkers was conjugated with 5-(bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino)pentanoic acid (DPA-COOH) and labeled with [99m Tc]Tc-tricarbonyl by two methods. With the one-pot method the labeling was faster than with the two-pot method, while obtaining similarly high yields. Negligible trans-chelation and high stability in physiological solutions was determined for the [99m Tc]Tc-tricarbonyl-peptide conjugates. Coupling an ethylene glycol (EG)-based linker increased the hydrophilicity. The peptide derivatives displayed high binding affinity in murine B16F10 melanoma cells as well as in human MeWo and TXM13 melanoma cell homogenates.

80997,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines.,2021-02-26,"The objective was to analyze trends and inequalities in the prevalence of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic according to sociodemographic factors and social distancing measures. We analyzed data from four serial epidemiological surveys on COVID-19 in May and June 2020, with adults and elderly living in Bagé, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Food insecurity was assessed with the short version of the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA), with the recall period adapted to the beginning of the social distancing period in the city. Sociodemographic characteristics and the adoption of social distancing measures were analyzed, and their associations with food insecurity were assessed with chi-square test. The temporal trend in food insecurity according to these characteristics was assessed via linear regression. Inequalities in food insecurity were assessed with the angular inequality index and concentration index. Of the 1,550 individuals studied, 29.4% (95%CI: 25.0; 34.4) presented food insecurity. Analysis of inequality showed higher concentration of food insecurity among the younger and less educated and those living with five or more residents in the same household. Over the course of the four surveys, prevalence of food insecurity decreased most sharply among the younger, those living in households with up to two residents, and those with two or more workers. There was a strong association between food insecurity and sociodemographic factors, which may indicate the pandemic´s potential economic impact on households' food situation.","Santos, Leonardo Pozza Dos; Schäfer, Antônio Augusto; Meller, Fernanda de Oliveira; Harter, Jenifer; Nunes, Bruno Pereira; Silva, Inácio Crochemore Mohnsam da; Pellegrini, Debora da Cruz Payão",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00268520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008789/,337

This is a challenging task, as there is no specific clinical sign or diagnostic test that accurately identifies and adequately defines this syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS This review will focus on published epidemiological studies reporting population-based incidence of ARDS, as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference criteria. In addition, the current outcome figures for ARDS patients reported in observational and randomized controlled trials will be reviewed. The focus will be on studies published since 2000, when the ARDSnet study on protective mechanical ventilation was published, although particular emphasis will be on those articles published in the last 24 months. SUMMARY On the basis of current evidence, and despite the order of magnitude of reported European and USA incidence figures, it seems that the incidence and overall mortality of ARDS has not changed substantially since the original ARDSnet study.

We aimed to compare functional outcomes, technical aspects, and complications of EVT between patients with acute ischemic stroke because of M2 and M1 occlusions in clinical practice. Furthermore, outcome and complications after EVT in dominant and nondominant caliber M2 division occlusions were studied. Methods- Data were obtained from the MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) which is an ongoing observational study in 16 Dutch centers performing EVT in the Netherlands. Functional outcome was measured with the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Neurological recovery (delta National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), successful reperfusion rates (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2B), and safety outcomes were also investigated. Associations between occlusion location and outcome were analyzed with ordinal logistic regression models, with adjustment for other prognostic factors. Results- In total, 244 (24%) patients with an M2 and 759 (76%) patients with an M1 occlusion who underwent EVT were analyzed. Functional outcomes were not significantly different between patients with M2 versus M1 occlusions (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.87-1.73). Occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was also similar for M2 and M1 occlusions (6.6% versus 5.9%; P=0.84). Further analysis about dominance of an M2 branch was performed in 175 (72%) patients. Neurological recovery was comparable (mean delta National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, -2±10 for dominant M2, -5±5 for nondominant M2, and -4±9 [ P=0.24] for M1 occlusions). Furthermore, the effect of reperfusion status on functional outcome was comparable between occlusion divisions (common odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53 for dominant M2; common odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.93-1.87 for nondominant M2; and common odds ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.24-1.46 for M1 occlusions). Conclusions- Outcomes and complication rates after EVT were similar in patients with M2 and M1 occlusions. Although based on observational data and a limited sample size, a similar association of reperfusion status with functional outcome for all subgroups provides no evidence that patients with either a dominant or a nondominant M2 occlusion should be routinely excluded from EVT.","Compagne, Kars C J; van der Sluijs, Pieter M; van den Wijngaard, Ido R; Roozenbeek, Bob; Mulder, Maxim J H L; van Zwam, Wim H; Emmer, Bart J; Majoie, Charles B L M; Yoo, Albert J; Lycklama À Nijeholt, Geert J; Lingsma, Hester F; Dippel, Diederik W J; van der Lugt, Aad; van Es, Adriaan C G M",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.023117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287757/,337

88669,An update on Sars-CoV-2: a review.,2020-01-01,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities of China is a growing global concern. Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model. Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection. More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.","Rong, Xin Miao; Yang, Liu; Chu, Hui di; Fan, Meng",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233563/,337

88767,Rat Model of the Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS) Procedure.,2017,"BACKGROUND Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs more often in younger, slim, and shallow-chested men. Although less common, differential diagnoses for secondary pneumothorax in children are asthma, emphysematous blebs, catamenial pneumothorax, and others. We report a patient who presented with pneumothorax and was found to have an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)-like lesion, and present a review of the related literature. CASE PRESENTATION A 14-year-old girl visited her physician for chest pain that developed while exercising. Although chest drainage was performed, the symptoms associated with a collapsed lung did not improve, and she was referred to our hospital. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a 19 × 17-mm cyst with a thick wall in the apex of the right lung. She was tested for infectious diseases, namely tuberculosis, but the results were not definitive. Catamenial pneumothorax was also suspected because she was menstruating when she presented to our hospital. As a therapeutic diagnosis, we performed a thoracoscopic partial resection of the right upper lobe of the lung. Three small openings were identified inside the cyst, suggesting connection with the bronchiole. The lesion was pathologically diagnosed as an IMT-like lesion. Considering the progress so far, we considered that the final diagnosis to be an IMT. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3, and we have followed her for the past 6 months with no local recurrence or metastasis. CONCLUSIONS IMT is not uncommon in children. Therefore, this lesion should be considered as a possible diagnosis if children and young adults develop spontaneous pneumothorax.","Miyagi, Hisayuki; Ishii, Daisuke; Hirasawa, Masatoshi; Yasuda, Shunsuke; Toriumi, Naohisa; Sarashina, Takeo; Tanino, Mishie; Tanaka, Mio; Tanaka, Yukichi; Miyamoto, Kazutoshi",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00873-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32448976/,337

Hence, here, we examined the factors affecting the recovery of hepatic reserve. METHODS We followed up 403 patients (male: 164, female: 239; genotype 1: 299, genotype 2: 104; median age: 69 years) for at least 3 years after they achieved SVR to DAA therapy. Of these patients, 75 (18.6%) had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Biochemical tests were periodically performed, and the hepatic reserve was evaluated based on the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade. We examined background factors such as age, biochemical test results, HCC occurrence and portosystemic shunt by computed tomography. RESULTS At the start of treatment, the ALBI grades were grades 1, 2, and 3 in 241, 157, and 5 patients, respectively, and 3 years later, 117 of 162 (72%) patients with grade 2 or 3 improved to grade 1. Multivariate analysis identified the HCC occurrence after achievement of SVR (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.08, P<0.0138), male sex (HR: 3.45, P=0.0143), hemoglobin level of <11.5 g/dL (HR: 4.19, P=0.0157), the presence of a portosystemic shunt (HR: 3.07, P=0.0349), and alanine aminotransferase levels <45 U/L (HR: 2.67, P=0.0425) as factors inhibiting improvement to grade 1. However, old age was not an inhibitory factor. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that hepatic reserve could be improved even in elderly patients over a long course of time.","Nakajima, Tomoaki; Karino, Yoshiyasu; Hige, Shuhei; Suii, Hirokazu; Tatsumi, Ryoji; Yamaguchi, Masakatsu; Arakawa, Tomohiro; Kuwata, Ysuaki; Hasegawa, Takashi; Toyota, Joji",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991760/,337

98572,A perspective on potential antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2.,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND Converse Ω anastomosis is a recently developed technique of delta-shaped anastomosis for intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy to simplify the anastomotic procedures and reduce their potential risks. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of converse Ω anastomosis, comparing it with conventional extracorporeal Billroth-I anastomosis after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) for gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Among 169 gastric cancer patients who underwent LDG with Billroth-I anastomosis anastomosis between April 2013 and March 2018, we selected 100 patients by propensity score matching (50 in the converse Ω anastomosis group and 50 in the extracorporeal anastomosis group). Patients' characteristics, intraoperative outcomes, postoperative complications, and survival time were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Median anastomosis time was significantly longer in the converse Ω group than in the extracorporeal group (40.0 vs. 30.5 min, P=0.005). However, the total procedure time did not differ significantly between the groups. Intraoperative blood loss volume was significantly lower in the converse Ω group than in the extracorporeal anastomosis group (40 vs. 120 mL, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in the number of dissected lymph nodes, postoperative morbidity, mortality, or length of hospital stay. The postoperative body mass index and the prognostic nutritional index did not differ between the groups 1 year after surgery. There were no significant differences in overall survival and relapse-free survival between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Converse Ω anastomosis is feasible and safe. This novel technique can be adopted as a treatment option for reconstruction after LDG in patients with early-stage gastric cancer. Therefore, the risks and benefits of converse Ω anastomosis after LDG should be confirmed in larger cohorts.","Tsuchiya, Nobuhiro; Kunisaki, Chikara; Kubo, Hirokazu; Sato, Sho; Tanaka, Yusaku; Sato, Kei; Miyamoto, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Jun; Takeda, Kazuhisa; Kosaka, Takashi; Akiyama, Hirotoshi; Endo, Itaru; Misumi, Toshihiro","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538547/,337

However, limited efforts have been made to comprehensively evaluate the extent to which migrants adopt unhealthy risk behaviours with longer duration of residence. This systematic review and meta-analysis will summarise evidence on international migrants' behavioural patterns by duration of residence in multiple country contexts. METHODS AND ANALYSIS PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and ProQuest databases will be searched for quantitative or mixed-method observational studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019. Studies comparing foreign-born individuals by duration of residence will be included. Information on study characteristics, descriptive statistics and measures of effect will be extracted. All included studies will be quality assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The review will include narrative synthesis and, if sufficient and comparable data are available, random effects meta-analyses. The review will be conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required since previously published information from peer-reviewed studies will be assessed. The results of this review will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences. Other forms of dissemination will include communication to broader audiences using well-established channels, including through university-based press releases.

An established treatment option is photodynamic therapy (PDT), based on light, oxygen and a photosensitizer. The most widely used is 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) which however, being a hydrophilic molecule, has difficultly penetrating the skin to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. To solve this limit, the present study provides for the development of three galenic gel formulations (Natrosol, Sepigel and Carbopol) containing 10% w/w of ALA for the treatment of AK with PDT and their comparison with a lipophilic cream used in the Hospital. The aim of this study is to offer an appealing topical treatment that improves patients' observance and compliance. Formulations were characterized in terms of chemical, physical and microbiological stability, viscosity and pH. An HPLC-DAD analytical method was also developed and validated.

One concern among transplant stakeholders was that public focus on OPO underperformance would harm deceased donation. Using CDC-WONDER data, we studied whether donation performance dropped during the era of public debate about OPO reform (December 2018 - February 2020). Overall OPO performance as measured relative to cause, age, and location-consistent deaths rose by 12.3% in 2019, compared to a median annual change of 2.5% 2009-2019. Organ recoveries exceeded seasonally-adjusted forecasts by 4.2% in the first half of 2019, by 8.1% following the Executive Order issuing a mandate for OPO metric reform, and by 14.1% between the Notice of Public Rule Making and the onset of COVID-19 related systemic disruptions. We describe changes in donor phenotype in the period of increased performance; improvement was greatest for older and donation after cardiac death donors, and among decedents who did not have a drug-related mechanism of death. In summary, performance during an era of intense public debate and proposed regulatory changes yielded 692 additional donors over expectations, and no detriment to organ donation was observed.","Doby, Brianna L; Ross-Driscoll, Katie; Shuck, Marion; Wadsworth, Matthew; Durand, Christine M; Lynch, Raymond J",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565252/,337

CLINICAL FINDINGS On arrival at the hospital, clinicopathologic assessments revealed rapidly decreasing PCV and worsening hypoproteinemia, compared with findings immediately prior to referral. The dog had severe hyperlactemia. Ultrasonography revealed the presence of free fluid in the abdomen; the fluid appeared to be blood (determined via abdominocentesis). TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Urgent surgical exploration was undertaken. Two small lacerations in the ventral aspect of the abdominal aorta just dorsal to the bladder were identified and repaired. Multiple transfusions of packed RBCs (5 units) and fresh frozen plasma (3 units) were administered, and autotransfusion of blood (1.2 L) from the abdomen was performed. The dog recovered well from surgery and anesthesia, but developed signs of severe pain and swelling of both hind limbs, which were attributed to reperfusion injury following aortic occlusion during surgery. Treatment included administration of S-adenosylmethionine (23 mg/kg [10.5 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h) and analgesia; 5 days after surgery, the hind limb problems had resolved and treatments were discontinued. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In the dog of this report, aortic laceration secondary to cystocentesis was successfully treated with a combination of surgery and massive transfusion; the development of reperfusion injury was an interesting and reversible complication of surgery. The possibility of damage to intra-abdominal structures should be investigated if a dog becomes acutely ill after cystocentesis.","Buckley, Gareth J; Aktay, Sevima A; Rozanski, Elizabeth A",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.235.3.288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19650700/,337

The performance and proper timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with bariatric surgery remain a clinical question. Objective Evaluation of the outcome of LC during bariatric surgery whether done concomitantly or delayed according to the level of intraoperative difficulty. Methods The prospective study included patients with morbid obesity between December 2018 and December 2019 with preoperatively detected gallbladder stones. According to the level of difficulty, patients were allocated into 2 groups: group 1 included patients who underwent concomitant LC during bariatric surgery, and group 2 included patients who underwent delayed LC after 2 months. In group 1, patients were further divided into subgroups: LC either at the beginning (subgroup A) or after bariatric surgery (subgroup B). Results Operative time in group 1 vs. 2 was 92.63 ± 28.25 vs. 68.33 ± 17.49 (p < 0.001), and in subgroup A vs. B, it was 84.19 ± 19.62 vs. 130.0 ± 31.62 (p < 0.001). One patient in each group (2.6% and 8.3%) had obstructive jaundice, p > 0.001. In group 2, 33% of asymptomatic patients became symptomatic for biliary colic p > 0.001. LC difficulty score was 2.11 ± 0.70 vs. 5.66 ± 0.98 in groups 1 and 2, respectively, p < 0.001.

ABSTRACT Objective: To describe the incidence of COVID-19 in STATE-XXX high school athletes, and to investigate the relationship of COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.Design: Retrospective survey.Setting: High schools across STATE-XXX during September, 2020.Participants: Athletic directors representing 30,074 high school athletes with and without SARS-CoV-2.Independent Variables: COVID-19 rates among athletes, counties, and STATE-XXX, school instruction type (virtual vs in-person), sport type, face mask use.Main Outcome Measurements: Reported athlete case rates compared to their county's general population. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type and face mask use, adjusting for each school's county incidence using multivariable negative binomial regression models.Results: COVID-19 incidence rates for 207 of 244 responding schools were 32.6 cases per 100,000 player-days. Reported case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated with the county's general population case rates (β=1.14±0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One case (0.5%) was attributed to sport contact by the reporting schools. No difference was identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14). Outdoor sports had a lower incidence rate than indoor sports, although this did not reach statistical significance (IRR=0.52 [0.26-1.1], p=0.07). There were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence and face mask use during play for those sports with greater than 50 schools reporting on face mask use (p>0.05 for all).Conclusions: Incidence of reported COVID-19 among high school athletes was related to county incidence and most cases were attributed to non-sport contact. A lower COVID-19 incidence in outdoor sports approached statistical significance. The lack of a significant benefit of face mask use may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-19 in STATE-XXX during September 2020. Further research is needed to better define COVID-19 transmission risk factors during adolescent sport participation.","Sasser, Phillip; McGuine, Timothy; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Biese, Kevin; Goodavish, Leslie; Stevens, Bethany; Watson, Andrew M",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0185.21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129671/,337

However, such studies will require development of tools to define treatment outcome. METHOD Natural language processing (NLP) was applied to classify notes from 127 504 patients with a billing diagnosis of major depressive disorder, drawn from out-patient psychiatry practices affiliated with multiple, large New England hospitals. Classifications were compared with results using billing data (ICD-9 codes) alone and to a clinical gold standard based on chart review by a panel of senior clinicians. These cross-sectional classifications were then used to define longitudinal treatment outcomes, which were compared with a clinician-rated gold standard. RESULTS Models incorporating NLP were superior to those relying on billing data alone for classifying current mood state (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85-0.88 v. 0.54-0.55). When these cross-sectional visits were integrated to define longitudinal outcomes and incorporate treatment data, 15% of the cohort remitted with a single antidepressant treatment, while 13% were identified as failing to remit despite at least two antidepressant trials. Non-remitting patients were more likely to be non-Caucasian (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The application of bioinformatics tools such as NLP should enable accurate and efficient determination of longitudinal outcomes, enabling existing EMR data to be applied to clinical research, including biomarker investigations.

134252,Molecular Diagnostic Tools for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2.,2021-01-13,"OBJECTIVES Postoperative pneumocephalus is a common occurrence after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS). The risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can be high and the presence of postoperative pneumocephalus associated with serosanguineous nasal drainage may raise suspicion for a CSF leak. The authors hypothesized that specific patterns of pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging could be predictive of CSF leaks. Identification of these patterns could guide the postoperative management of patients undergoing ESBS. METHODS The authors queried a prospectively acquired database of 526 consecutive ESBS cases at a single center between December 1, 2003, and May 31, 2012, and identified 258 patients with an intraoperative CSF leak documented using intrathecal fluorescein. Postoperative CT and MRI scans obtained within 1-10 days were examined and pneumocephalus was graded based on location and amount. A discrete 0-4 scale was used to classify pneumocephalus patterns based on size and morphology. Pneumocephalus was correlated with the surgical approach, histopathological diagnosis, and presence of a postoperative CSF leak. RESULTS The mean follow-up duration was 56.7 months. Of the 258 patients, 102 (39.5%) demonstrated pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging. The most frequent location of pneumocephalus was frontal (73 [71.5%] of 102), intraventricular (34 [33.3%]), and convexity (22 [21.6%]). Patients with craniopharyngioma (27 [87%] of 31) and meningioma (23 [68%] of 34) had the highest incidence of postoperative pneumocephalus compared with patients with pituitary adenomas (29 [20.6%] of 141) (p < 0.0001). The incidence of pneumocephalus was higher with transcribriform and transethmoidal approaches (8 of [73%] 11) than with a transsellar approach (9 of [7%] 131). There were 15 (5.8%) of 258 cases of postoperative CSF leak, of which 10 (66.7%) had pneumocephalus, compared with 92 (38%) of 243 patients without a postoperative CSF leak (OR 3.3, p = 0.027). Pneumocephalus located in the convexity, interhemispheric fissure, sellar region, parasellar region, and perimesencephalic region was significantly correlated with a postoperative CSF leak (OR 4.9, p = 0.006) and was therefore termed ""suspicious"" pneumocephalus. In contrast, frontal or intraventricular pneumocephalus was not correlated with postoperative CSF leak (not significant) and was defined as ""benign"" pneumocephalus. The amount of convexity pneumocephalus (p = 0.002), interhemispheric pneumocephalus (p = 0.005), and parasellar pneumocephalus (p = 0.007) (determined using a scale score of 0-4) was also significantly related to postoperative CSF leaks. Using a series of permutation-based multivariate analyses, the authors established that a model containing the learning curve, the transclival/transcavernous approach, and the presence of ""suspicious"" pneumocephalus provides the best overall prediction for postoperative CSF leaks. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative pneumocephalus is much more common following extended approaches than following transsellar surgery. Merely the presence of pneumocephalus, particularly in the frontal or intraventricular locations, is not necessarily associated with a postoperative CSF leak. A ""suspicious"" pattern of air, namely pneumocephalus in the convexity, interhemispheric fissure, sella, parasellar, or perimesencephalic locations, is significantly associated with a postoperative CSF leak. The presence and the score of ""suspicious"" pneumocephalus on postoperative imaging, in conjunction with the learning curve and the type of endoscopic approach, provide the best predictive model for postoperative CSF leaks.","Banu, Matei A; Szentirmai, Oszkar; Mascarenhas, Lino; Salek, Al Amin; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.5.jns132028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995788/,337

Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of CBD for treating patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Design: Randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted between July 7 and October 16, 2020, in two sites in Brazil. Setting: Patients were recruited in an emergency room. Participants: Block randomized patients (1:1 allocation ratio-by a researcher not directly involved in data collection) with mild and moderate COVID-19 living in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, seeking medical consultation, and those who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. Interventions: Patients received 300 mg of CBD or placebo added to standard symptomatic care during 14 days. Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was reduction or prevention of the deterioration in clinical status from mild/moderate to severe/critical measured with the COVID-19 Scale or the natural course of the resolution of typical clinical symptoms. Primary study outcome was assessed on days 14, 21, and 28 after enrollment. Results: A total of 321 patients were recruited and assessed for eligibility, and 105 were randomly allocated either in CBD (n=49) or in placebo (n=42) group. Ninety-one participants were included in the analysis of efficacy. There were no baseline between-group differences regarding disease severity (χ2=0.025, p=0.988) and median time to symptom resolution (12 days [95% confidence interval, CI, 6.5-17.5] in the CBD group, 9 days [95% CI, 4.8-13.2] in the placebo group [χ2=1.6, p=0.205 by log-rank test]). By day 28, 83.3% in the CBD group and 90.2% in the placebo group had resolved symptoms. There were no between-group differences on secondary measures. CBD was well tolerated, producing mostly mild and transient side effects (e.g., somnolence, fatigue, changes in appetite, lethargy, nausea, diarrhea, and fever), with no significant differences between CBD and placebo treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Daily administration of 300 mg CBD for 14 days failed to alter the clinical evolution of COVID-19. Further trials should explore the therapeutic effect of CBD in patients with severe COVID-19, possibly trying higher doses than the used in our study.

In addition to its everyday applications, ML holds the potential to improve medicine as well, especially with regard to diagnostics in clinics. In a world characterized by population growth, demographic change, and the global COVID-19 pandemic, ML systems offer the opportunity to make diagnostics more effective and efficient, leading to a high interest of clinics in such systems. However, despite the high potential of ML, only a few ML systems have been deployed in clinics yet, as their adoption process differs significantly from the integration of prior health information technologies given the specific characteristics of ML. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore the factors that influence the adoption process of ML systems for medical diagnostics in clinics to foster the adoption of these systems in clinics. Furthermore, this study provides insight into how these factors can be used to determine the ML maturity score of clinics, which can be applied by practitioners to measure the clinic status quo in the adoption process of ML systems. METHODS To gain more insight into the adoption process of ML systems for medical diagnostics in clinics, we conducted a qualitative study by interviewing 22 selected medical experts from clinics and their suppliers with profound knowledge in the field of ML. We used a semistructured interview guideline, asked open-ended questions, and transcribed the interviews verbatim. To analyze the transcripts, we first used a content analysis approach based on the health care-specific framework of nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability. Then, we drew on the results of the content analysis to create a maturity model for ML adoption in clinics according to an established development process. RESULTS With the help of the interviews, we were able to identify 13 ML-specific factors that influence the adoption process of ML systems in clinics. We categorized these factors according to 7 domains that form a holistic ML adoption framework for clinics. In addition, we created an applicable maturity model that could help practitioners assess their current state in the ML adoption process. CONCLUSIONS Many clinics still face major problems in adopting ML systems for medical diagnostics; thus, they do not benefit from the potential of these systems. Therefore, both the ML adoption framework and the maturity model for ML systems in clinics can not only guide future research that seeks to explore the promises and challenges associated with ML systems in a medical setting but also be a practical reference point for clinicians.","Pumplun, Luisa; Fecho, Mariska; Wahl, Nihal; Peters, Felix; Buxmann, Peter",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/29301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652275/,337

Setting Standards for health and social care is a mechanism by which quality improvements can be achieved. Limited evidence exists on appropriate implementation strategies to overcome challenges with implementing Standards. In order to inform the design of implementation strategies, there is a need to examine factors that influence their implementation. The aim of this protocol is to set out a comprehensive plan to undertake a systematic search, appraisal and mixed research synthesis of the international literature that examines implementation of health and social care Standards. A research question, ""What are the enablers and barriers to implementing health and social care Standards in health and social care services?"" was designed using the 'SPICE' (Setting, Perspectives, Interest phenomenon of, Comparison, Evaluation) framework. Electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists from included studies will be searched. Primary qualitative, quantitative descriptive and mixed methods studies reporting on enablers and barriers to implementing nationally endorsed Standards, will be included. The review will focus on experiences and perspectives from multi-level stakeholders including patient and public involvement. The quality of studies will be appraised using appropriate tools and findings used to weight interpretation of findings. Search outputs, data extraction and quality appraisal will be undertaken by two reviewers independently. Sandelowski meta-summary will be used to synthesise the data. Frequency and intensity effect sizes of enablers and barriers will be calculated to evaluate their prevalence across the studies. The Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) approach will be applied to assess confidence in the findings of the review. Findings from this examination will inform influencing factors to implementation. Subsequently, this will contribute to pairing Standards with appropriate implementation strategies that will optimise the enabling factors and overcome challenges to implementation.","Kelly, Yvonne; O'Rourke, Niamh; Flynn, Rachel; Hegarty, Josephine; O'Connor, Laura",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13212.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337321/,337

Evidence suggests that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience disparities in healthcare access and utilisation. This disparity was evident early in the pandemic when discussions arose regarding the potential exclusion of this population to critical care. Methods: An anonymous online survey will be conducted with caregivers, both family members and paid staff, to explore the impact of COVID-19 on this population in terms of demographics, living arrangements, access to services, the impact of social distancing, and also carer wellbeing. The survey will be developed by the research team, many of whom are experts in intellectual disability within their own jurisdictions. Using back-translation our team will translate the survey for distribution in 16 countries worldwide for international comparison. The survey team have extensive personal and professional networks in intellectual disability and will promote the survey widely on social media with the support of local disability and advocacy agencies. Statistical descriptive and comparative analyses will be conducted. Ethical approval has been obtained for this study from University College Dublin's Human Research Ethics Committee (HS-20-28-Linehan). Dissemination: Study findings will be prepared in a number of formats in order to meet the needs of different audiences.

There is an urgent need for important Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as N95 and surgical masks. This project examined the factors that were associated with nursing homes' N95 and surgical mask supply. We analyzed data from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File and conducted a multivariate logistic regression estimating the association between nursing home characteristics and county-level demographic parameters with mask supply. We found that a high number of resident COVID-19 cases contributed to the supply of N95, but not surgical masks, whereas a high number of staff cases did not lead to an adequate supply of either N95 or surgical masks. Compared with not-for-profit (NFP) facilities, for-profit (FP) nursing homes were less likely to get enough masks.

Thus, one mostly used cationic disinfectant, benzalkonium chlorides (BAC(C12)), was selected to assess its potential toxicity one common cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) in this study. The aims were to explore the toxic effect and mechanism of BAC (C12) on M. aeruginosa growth within 96 h via morphological, physiological, and the relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics variations. The results found that BAC(C12) significantly inhibited cell density of M. aeruginosa at concentrations from 1 mg/L to 10 mg/L, and the 96-h EC50 value was identified to be 3.61 mg/L. Under EC50 concentration, BAC(C12) depressed the photosynthesis activities of M. aeruginosa exhibited by 36% decline of the maximum quantum yield for primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm) value and denaturation of photosynthetic organelle, caused oxidative stress response displayed by the increase of three indexes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and destroyed the integrity of cell membranes demonstrated by TEM images and the increase of ex-cellular substances. Then, the iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis demonstrated that BAC(C12) depressed photosynthesis activities through inhibiting the expressions of photosynthetic protein and photosynthetic electron transport related proteins. The suppression of electron transport also led to the increase of superoxide radicals and then posed oxidative stress on cell. Meantime, the 63.63% ascent of extracellular microcystin production of M. aeruginosa was observed, attributing to the high expression of microcystin synthesis proteins and the damage of cell membrane. In sum, BAC(C12) exposure inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa mainly by depressing photosynthesis, inducing oxidative stress, and breaking the cell membrane. And, it enhanced the release of microcystin from the cyanobacterial cells via up-regulating the microcystin synthesis proteins and inducing the membrane damage, which could enlarge its toxicity to aquatic species.","Qian, Yao; He, Yixin; Li, Hong; Yi, Meiling; Zhang, Lilan; Zhang, Linjie; Liu, Li; Lu, Zhaohui",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626715/,337
141870,SARS-CoV-2 and self-medication in Cameroon: a mathematical model.,2021-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is currently one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive surgical procedures. In recent years, single-incision operations have been developed to further reduce the invasiveness of the surgery. Herein, we report our early experience with single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in Asia, with both the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approaches. METHODS This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on a cohort of consecutive patients with inguinal hernia who underwent single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in a minimal access surgical center in Hong Kong between January 2010 and January 2011. RESULTS Our cohort consists of 15 patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernia; 13 were unilateral and two were bilateral hernias. The mean age was 59.8 years old (range, 28-74 years). The overall mean operative time was 59.53 min (range, 25-120 min). For unilateral hernia repair, the mean operative time was 56 min (range, 25-75 min) and 48.5 min (range, 41-55 min) for TAPP and TEP, respectively. In all cases single-incision laparoscopic hernia repair was successfully performed, no additional trocars were required, and there were no conversions to conventional laparoscopic or open inguinal hernia repair. All patients were discharged on the same day as the procedure. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernia is feasible in both TEP and TAPP approaches. The procedure should be performed by laparoscopic surgeons with a high level of experience in single-incision surgery. Further randomized trials should be performed to evaluate the full potential and clinical application of single-incision TAPP and TEP.","Yang, G P C; Lai, E C H; Chan, O C Y; Tang, C N; Li, M K W",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2011.00098.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776301/,337

The aims of this study were to determine the accuracy of the latest generation ventilators to deliver chosen parameters in various typical conditions and to provide clinicians with a comprehensive report on their performance. METHODS Thirteen modern intensive care unit ventilators were evaluated on the ASL5000 test lung with and without leakage for: (i) accuracy to deliver exact tidal volume (VT) and PEEP in assist-control ventilation (ACV); (ii) performance of trigger and pressurization in pressure support ventilation (PSV); and (iii) quality of non-invasive ventilation algorithms. RESULTS In ACV, only six ventilators delivered an accurate VT and nine an accurate PEEP. Eleven devices failed to compensate VT and four the PEEP in leakage conditions. Inspiratory delays differed significantly among ventilators in invasive PSV (range 75-149 ms, P=0.03) and non-invasive PSV (range 78-165 ms, P<0.001). The percentage of the ideal curve (concomitantly evaluating the pressurization speed and the levels of pressure reached) also differed significantly (range 57-86% for invasive PSV, P=0.04; and 60-90% for non-invasive PSV, P<0.001). Non-invasive ventilation algorithms efficiently prevented the decrease in pressurization capacities and PEEP levels induced by leaks in, respectively, 10 and 12 out of the 13 ventilators. CONCLUSIONS We observed real heterogeneity of performance amongst the latest generation of intensive care unit ventilators. Although non-invasive ventilation algorithms appear to maintain adequate pressurization efficiently in the case of leakage, basic functions, such as delivered VT in ACV and pressurization in PSV, are often less reliable than the values displayed by the device suggest.","Garnier, M; Quesnel, C; Fulgencio, J-P; Degrain, M; Carteaux, G; Bonnet, F; Similowski, T; Demoule, A",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aev028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25735713/,337

158889,Are Flow Diverting Stents a Treatment Option in Acutely Ruptured Complex A1-A2 Junction Aneurysms?,2016,"BACKGROUND Measurable residual disease (MRD) is a strong independent poor prognostic factor for acute leukemia. Multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) is a commonly used MRD detection method. However, FCM MRD detection is not well standardized, and the interpretation is subjective. There are normal/reactive minor cell populations in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), which could be confused with MRD. METHODS The FCM data of 231 BM and 44 PB pediatric samples performed in a recent 15-month period were retrospectively reviewed. These samples were from 56 B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, 11 T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, 28 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 44 cytopenia/leukocytosis patients, and five patients with mycosis fungoides. RESULTS There were over 10 normal or reactive minor cell populations identified with certain phenotypes mimicking MRD of acute leukemia. These mimickers included CD19+ NK cells, CD22+ basophils, CD22+ dendritic cells (DCs), and plasma cells for B-ALL MRD; CD4/8 double-negative T cells, CD4/8 double-positive T cells, cytoplasmic CD3+ NK cells, CD2- T cells, CD7- T cells, CD5- gamma delta T cells, CD56+ NKT cells for T-ALL MRD; CD33+ NK cells, CD117+ NK cells, basophils, plasmacytoid DCs, non-classical monocytes, CD56+ and/or CD61+ monocytes for AML MRD. CONCLUSIONS These data confirm the presence of a variety of normal/reactive minor cell populations that could mimic MRD of acute leukemia by FCM. Recognizing these MRD mimickers is important for correct FCM MRD interpretation.","Li, Weijie; Morgan, Ruth; Nieder, Roxanne; Truong, Sa; Habeebu, Sahibu Sultan M; Ahmed, Atif A","Cytometry.

An ethical debate.,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC) is an attractive option to open cystectomy, but the benefit in terms of improved outcomes is not established. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the early postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing iRARC and conduct a critical analysis of complications using standardised reporting criteria as stratified according to urinary diversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 134 patients underwent iRARC for bladder cancer at a single centre between June 2011 and July 2015. INTERVENTION Radical cystectomy with iRARC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Patient demographics, pathologic data, and 90-d perioperative mortality and complications were recorded. Complications were reported according to the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification and stratified according to urinary diversion type and either surgical or medical complications. The chi-square test and t test were used for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on variables with significance in univariate analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The 90-d all complication rate following ileal conduit and continent diversion was 68% and 82.4%, and major complications were 21.0% and 20.6% respectively. The 90-d mortality was 3% and 2.9% for ileal conduit and continent diversion patients, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the blood transfusion requirement was independently associated with major complications (p=0.002) and all 30-d (p=0.002) and 90-d (p=0.012) major complications. Male patients were associated with 90-d major complications (p=0.015). Critical analysis identified that surgical complications were responsible for 39.4% of all 90-d major complications. The incidence of surgical complications did not decline with increasing number of iRARC cases performed (p=0.742, r=0.31). Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, limited sample size, and limited multivariate analysis due to the low number of major complications events. CONCLUSIONS Although complications following iRARC are common, most are low grade. A critical analysis identified surgical complications as a cause of major complications. Addressing this issue could have a significant impact on lowering the morbidity associated with iRARC. PATIENT SUMMARY We looked at the surgical outcomes in bladder cancer patients treated with minimally invasive robotic surgery. We found that surgical complications account for most major complications and previous surgical experience may be a confounding factor when interpreting results from a different centre even in a randomised trial setting.","Tan, Wei Shen; Lamb, Benjamin W; Tan, Mae-Yen; Ahmad, Imran; Sridhar, Ashwin; Nathan, Senthil; Hines, John; Shaw, Greg; Briggs, Timothy P; Kelly, John D",European urology focus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2016.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753745/,337

However, speaking of mesenterium division, no unique standard procedure is actually provided. Surgeons can perform it at the level of either the sigmoid vessels or the inferior mesenteric vessels. The objective of this study was to compare intra- and postoperative complications of both techniques. METHODS From a prospective collected database of patients that underwent elective laparoscopic sigmoid resection between January 2004 and December 2014, a retrospective analysis according to the selected operative technique was performed. RESULTS A total of 1016 patients were operated, and a pedicle division of the mesenteric vessels was performed in 280 patients (central group 27.6%) while a peripheral division was performed in 736 patients (peripheral group 72.4%). Comparison of these two groups demonstrated no statistically significant difference regarding age or stage of disease. Thirteen patients (1.3%) developed anastomotic leak; among them, nine belonged to the peripheral group (1.2 vs 1.4% p = 0.794). Twenty-four patients (2.4%) developed postoperative rectal bleeding but only in nine cases was a bleeding of the anastomosis confirmed using endoscopy (seven peripheral group vs two central group, 0.95 vs 0.7% p = 0.712). Moreover, postoperative morbidity did not significantly differ between the two groups. A very low mortality rate was observed, with 2 deaths (both in the peripheral group). CONCLUSIONS Ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels does not seem to affect anastomotic healing; both surgical techniques presented similar incidence of anastomotic bleeding. In this analysis, we could not identify any significant difference in overall morbidity and mortality.","Posabella, Alberto; Rotigliano, Niccolò; Tampakis, Athanasios; von Flüe, Markus; Füglistaler, Ida",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-018-3080-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29770846/,337

By 2021, this workforce has now grown to 35%, representing 57 Million workers with over 1 Trillion USD annual market size. Due to the economic challenges and unemployment brought on by the Covid-19 Pandemic, the concept of work is shifting at a much faster rate than was taking place beforehand. Additionally, Gen Z-ers and younger digital natives are finding themselves with fewer traditional vocational options (school to internship to career) and are getting into the Gig Economy from both a necessity perspective, as well as a lifestyle choice. The disruptive technology advances are fueling this growth. The technology platform needed to facilitate the full set of enterprise needs for a Gig Economy marketplace with component solutions is integrated with a mesh of technology components that cover the marketing, finance, logistics, and exchange features supporting this space. There are key business model advancements that can be fulfilled with a modern marketplace technology platform to enable a true disruption to the concept of work. These creative business models, along with appropriate government rules and regulations will dictate how the Gig Economy of the future will develop. Our paper leverages modern technology advancements to showcase a new disruptive entrepreneurial ecosystem which can change the concept of work in the home improvement sector.

The purpose of this study was to identify the self-reported experiences and healthcare needs of youth experiencing homelessness as services in the community began to shut down at the beginning of the pandemic. Method From May through November 2020, qualitative data were obtained by telephone or Facebook messenger from 20 youth (M = 22.4, SD = 2.64 years) who had been enrolled in a longitudinal intervention study. Results Content analysis of qualitative data yielded 5 categories and 1 overall theme. Categories were resource availability, financial instability, mental health, relationship conflict, and maladaptive coping. The overall theme was multiple losses. Youths lost jobs, means of financial support for self and family, access to social and healthcare services, meaningful and important relationships, and skills and controls over high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse.

For an individual, the task of sifting through the deluge for reliable, accurate facts is significant and potentially off-putting. This matters since fundamentally, containment of the pandemic relies on individuals' compliance with public health measures and their understanding of the need for them, and any barrier to this, including misinformation, can have profoundly negative effects. In this paper we present a conversational AI system which tackles misinformation using a two-pronged approach: firstly, by giving users easy, Natural Language access via speech or text to concise, reliable information synthesised from multiple authoritative sources;and secondly, by directly rebutting commonly circulated myths surrounding coronavirus. The initial system is targeted at staff and students of a University, but has the potential for wide applicability. In tests of the system's Natural Language Understanding (NLU) we achieve an F1-score of 0.906. We also discuss current research challenges in the area of conversational Natural Language interfaces for health information. © 2021 ACM.","Gunson, N.; Sieińska, W.; Yu, Y.; Garcia, D. H.; Part, J.

The impact of lockdown on physical and biochemical parameters along with contributing factors was assessed. Design: Cross-sectional analytical study. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with chronic illnesses attending medicine outpatient department during unlock down phase I were enrolled. A 5 point Likert scale was used to determine the effect on diet, exercise, pain, physical and psychological symptoms, and a personal interview to assess the contributing factors. Clinical examination and laboratory investigations were done to compare between pre and post lockdown status and appropriate statistical tests were used. Results: The mean age of the patients was 48.53 +/- 6.4 years with a female preponderance. Mean duration of illness was 8.93 +/- 2.4 years and majority had hypertension (21%), diabetes (19%) or both (12%), hypothyroidism (18%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (8%). While physical symptoms and pain did not show a significant change, 41.3% had worsening of psychological symptoms, 53.3% diet, and 70.6% exercise noncompliance. Weight, blood pressure, lipids, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone showed little change. Glycemic control was deranged in 72.5% with HbA1c increasing from 6.47 +/- 1.9 to 8.1 +/- 2.4 (P = 0.007). Contributing factors, 52.3% reported lack of exercise, 40% financial problems, 36% transport difficulties, and 30% unavailability of medicines. Conclusion: Lockdown negatively affected the management of chronic diseases with significant worsening of psychological symptoms, diet, and exercise adherence. Glycemic control worsened in diabetics.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies, to estimate the case-fatality rate (CFR) of patients with solid or hematological tumors and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed library up to 31 January, 2021, was performed in order to identify publications reporting the CFR among adult patients with solid or hematological tumors and SARS-CoV-2 infection. CFR was defined as the rate of deaths among SARS-CoV-2-positive cancer patients. Moreover, we separately assessed the CFR among patients with lung and breast cancer. Studies with at least 10 patients were included. The CFR was assessed through a random effect model, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The Higgins I2 index was computed to assess the heterogeneity between studies. Results: The systematic search of the literaturereturned 1,727studies. 1,551 were excluded on the basis of the title, 29 based on the abstract, and 3 were duplicates. A total of 144 studies were selected, including 35,725 patients with solid or hematological tumors and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 46 and 32 studies reported the CFR among COVID-19 patients with lung (total N = 1,555) and breast (total N = 1.398) cancer, respectively. Overall, the CFR was 25.5% (95% CI 23.1%-28.1%, Egger test p < 0.001). A sensitivity analysis, after excluding studies with less than 100 patients, showed a CFR of 22.1% (95% CI 19.4%-25.2%). The CFR among patients with lung cancer and SARSCoV2 infection was 33.4% (95% CI 28.1%-39.6%) when including all studies and 26.3% (95% CI 17.6%-39.2%) at the sensitivity analysis after excluding studies with less than 100 patients. The CFR among patients with breast cancer and SARS-CoV2 infection was 13.7% (95% CI 9.1%-20.7%) when including all studies and 13.0% (95% CI 7.6%-22.1%) at the sensitivity analysis after excluding studies with less than 100 patients. Conclusions: One year after the outbreak of the pandemic, this large metaanalysis reports the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer. This population experienced a high probability of mortality, with a comparatively higher CFR in patients with lung cancer, and a comparatively lower CFR in patients with breast cancer. Patients with an underlying diagnosis of cancer require special attention with aggressive preventive measures that also include early access to COVID-19 vaccination.","Tagliamento, M.; Agostinetto, E.; Bruzzone, M.; Ceppi, M.; Saini, K.

168607,Identifying The “Core” Transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cells,2021-09-23,"The COVID-19 pandemic raises significance for a potential influenza therapeutic compound, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which has been extensively used in personal care products as a positively-charged quaternary ammonium antibacterial agent. CPC is currently in clinical trials to assess its effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) morbidity. Two published studies have provided mouse and human data indicating that CPC may alleviate influenza infection, and here we show that CPC (0.1 μM, 1 hour) reduces zebrafish mortality and viral load following influenza infection. However, CPC mechanisms of action upon viral-host cell interaction are currently unknown. We have utilized super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy to probe the mode of CPC action. Reduction in density of influenza viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) clusters is known to reduce influenza infectivity: here, we show that CPC (at non-cytotoxic doses, 5-10 µM) reduces HA density and number of HA molecules per cluster within the plasma membrane of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. HA is known to colocalize with the negatively-charged mammalian lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2); here, we show that nanoscale co-localization of HA with the PIP2-binding Pleckstrin homology (PH) reporter in the plasma membrane is diminished by CPC. CPC also dramatically displaces the PIP2-binding protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) from the plasma membrane of rat RBL-2H3 mast cells; this disruption of PIP2 is correlated with inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Together, these findings offer a PIP2-focused mechanism underlying CPC disruption of influenza and suggest potential pharmacological use of this drug as an influenza therapeutic to reduce global deaths from viral disease.","Raut, Prakash; Weller, Sasha R.; Obeng, Bright; Soos, Brandy L.; West, Bailey E.; Potts, Christian M.; Sangroula, Suraj; Kinney, Marissa S.; Burnell, John E.; King, Benjamin L.; Gosse, Julie A.; Hess, Samuel T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.08.463687,337

Patients were also evaluated at baseline (T0). At each assessment, general and ED psychopathology (SCL-90-R and EDE-Q) were assessed. Childhood abuse experiences (CTQ) and adult attachment (ECR-R) were investigated at T1, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R) at T2.ResultsPatients reported a significant increase in compensatory exercise;in addition, patients with BN and those who achieved remission at T1 showed a significant exacerbation of binge-eating. The longitudinal trend (T1-T2) of psychopathology was not different between patients and controls, however the expected benefit from treatment on ED psychopathology was significant only for AN, while no changes were noted in BN. Patients with BN reported more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms than AN and controls, and these symptoms correlated positively with prior traumatic experiences and an insecure attachment style.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown had a significant impact on subjects with eating disorders, both by interfering with the treatment process and in terms of post-traumatic stress symptoms.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Rossi, E.; Cassioli, E.; Castellini, G.; Sanfilippo, G.; Felciai, F.; Monteleone, A.

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),2020,"Ebola virus (EBOV) is the most virulent pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates. The postexposure antibody therapies to prevent EBOV infection are considered efficient. However, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in the tropics has been limited. Here, we developed a thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25°C for one year, in contrast to conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We immunized laying hens with a variety of EBOV vaccine candidates and confirmed that VSV Δ G/EBOVGP encoding the EBOV glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralizing antibodies against EBOV. The therapeutic efficacy of immune IgY antibodies in vivo was evaluated in the newborn Balb/c mice model. Lethal dose of virus challenged mice were treated 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-EBOV IgY. The group receiving a high dose of 106 NAU/kg (neutralizing antibody units/kilogram) achieved complete protection with no signs of disease, while the low-dose group was only partially protected. In contrast, all mice receiving naïve IgY died within 10 days. In conclusion, the anti-EBOV IgY exhibits excellent thermostability and protective efficacy, and it is very promising to be developed as alternative therapeutic entities. Author Summary Although several Ebola virus therapeutic antibodies have been reported in recent years, however, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in tropical endemic areas has been limited. We developed a highly thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25°C for one year. The newborn mice receiving passive transfer of IgY achieved complete protection against a lethal dose of virus challenge indicating that the anti-EBOV IgY provides a promising countermeasure to solve the current clinical application problems of Ebola antibody-based treatments in Africa.","Zhang, Yuan; Wei, Yanqiu; Li, Yunlong; Wang, Xuan; Liu, Yang; Tian, Deyu; Jia, Xiaojuan; Gong, Rui; Liu, Wenjun; Yang, Limin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.108159,337

In a pre-clinical mouse model, we illustrated that [18F]PARPi crosses the blood-brain barrier and specifically binds to PARP1 overexpressed in cancer cell nuclei. In humans, we demonstrated high [18F]PARPi uptake on PET/MR in active brain cancers and low uptake in treatment related changes, independent of blood brain-barrier disruption. Immunohistochemistry results confirmed higher PARP1 expression in cancers than non-cancers. Specificity was also corroborated by blocking fluorescent tracer uptake with excess of unlabeled PARP inhibitor in fresh cancer tissue derived from a patient. Although larger studies are necessary to confirm and further explore this tracer, we describe an encouraging role for the use of [18F]PARPi as a diagnostic tool in evaluating patients with brain cancers and possible treatment related changes.","Young, R.

170597,Heparin protects human neural progenitor cells from Zika Virus-induced cell death and preserves their differentiation into mature neural-glia cells,2021-05-05,"We introduce evidence that for-profit long-term-care providers are associated with less successful outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak management. We introduce two sets of theoretical arguments that predict variation in service quality by provider type: those that deal with the institution of contracting (innovative competition vs. erosive competition) and those that address organizational features of for-profit, non-profit, and government actors (profit seeking, cross-subsidization, and future investment). We contextualize these arguments through a discussion of how contracting operates in Ontario long-term care. That discussion leads us to exclude the institutional arguments while retaining the arguments about organizational features as our three hypotheses. Using outbreak data as of February 2021, we find that government-run long-term-care homes surpassed for-profit and non-profit homes in outbreak management, consistent with an earlier finding from Stall et al. (2020). Non-profit homes outperform for-profit homes but are outperformed by government-run homes. These results are consistent with the expectations derived from two theoretical arguments—profit seeking and cross-subsidization—and inconsistent with a third—capacity for future investment. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Dans cet article, nous présentons quelques éléments de preuve que les fournisseurs de soins de longue durée à but lucratif ont eu de moins bons résultats dans la gestion de la pandémie de la COVID-19. Nous avançons deux séries d'arguments théoriques qui prédisent la variation dans la qualité du service selon le type de fournisseur : ceux qui ont trait à l'institution contractante (concurrence novatrice versus concurrence érosive) et ceux qui s'intéressent aux caractéristiques organisationnelles des acteurs à but lucratif, sans but lucratif et gouvernementaux (recherche de profit, interfinancement et investissement futur). Nous mettons ces arguments en contexte en discutant les façons dont les contrats sont attribués dans le cas des soins de longue durée en Ontario. Cette analyse nous pousse à exclure les arguments institutionnels et à conserver, comme nos trois hypothèses, les arguments sur les caractéristiques organisationnelles. En utilisant les données relatives à l'épidémie à partir de février 2021, nous constatons que les établissements de soins de longue durée gouvernementaux ont surpassé les établissements à but lucratif et sans but lucratif dans la gestion de l'épidémie, ce qui concorde avec une conclusion antérieure par Stall et ses collègues (2020). Ces résultats concordent avec les attentes dérivées de deux arguments théoriques – la recherche du profit et l'interfinancement – mais pas avec le troisième, celui de l'investissement futur.

Recent reports have shown that when participants watch muted videos of speakers, the phonological information about the acoustic speech envelope is tracked by the visual cortex. However, the speech signal also carries much richer acoustic details, e.g. about the fundamental frequency and the resonant frequencies, whose visuo-phonological transformation could aid speech processing. Here, we investigated the neural basis of the visuo-phonological transformation processes of these more fine-grained acoustic details and assessed how they change with ageing. We recorded whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) data while participants watched silent intelligible and unintelligible videos of a speaker. We found that the visual cortex is able to track the unheard intelligible modulations of resonant frequencies and the pitch linked to lip movements. Importantly, only the processing of intelligible unheard formants decreases significantly with age in the visual and also in the cingulate cortex. This is not the case for the processing of the unheard speech envelope, the fundamental frequency or the purely visual information carried by lip movements. These results show that unheard spectral fine-details (along with the unheard acoustic envelope) are transformed from a mere visual to a phonological representation. Aging affects especially the ability to derive spectral dynamics at formant frequencies. Since listening in noisy environments should capitalize on the ability to track spectral fine-details, our results provide a novel focus on compensatory processes in such challenging situations.","Suess, Nina; Hauswald, Anne; Reisinger, Patrick; Rösch, Sebastian; Keitel, Anne; Weisz, Nathan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.439628,337

Mean levels of pollutants in 2020 were compared with those measured in the six previous years (2014–2019). A significant improvement in air quality, namely regarding PM10 and NO2, was found and it can be attributable to the restrictions of anthropogenic activities (such as traffic) promoted during the March–May 2020 national lockdown that occurred due to the pandemic. Significant and expressive reductions of 44.0% and 40.3% were found in April 2020 for NO2 and PM10, respectively, showing the impact of local traffic in the study area. A similar trend of reduction for these pollutants was also found in the following months. However, ozone levels did not show the same trend, with significant increases in several months after the lockdown period, highlighting other contributions to this pollutant. This unique period can be considered as a living lab, where the implementation of strict measures due to COVID-19 confinement promoted the reduction of anthropogenic activities and allowed us to understand more comprehensively their impact on local air quality.","Gamelas, Carla Abecasis Leonor Canha Nuno Almeida Susana Marta",Atmosphere,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12091097,337

Therefore, there is an urgent need for investigating and predicting COVID-19 incidence to control its spread more effectively. This study aim to forecast the expected number of daily total confirmed cases, total confirmed new cases, total deaths and total new deaths of COVID-19 in Bangladesh for next 3 weeks. The number of daily total confirmed cases, total confirmed new cases, total deaths and total new deaths of COVID-19 from 8 March2020 to 4 February, 2021 was collected to fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh from 5th February 2021 to 25th February 2021. All statistical analyses were conducted using R-3.6.3 software with a significant level of p &lt; 0.05. The ARIMA (1,2,1), ARIMA (1,1,1), ARIMA (1,2,2) and ARIMA (1,1,2) model was adopted for forecasting the number of daily total confirmed cases, total confirmed new cases, total deaths and new deaths of COVID-19, respectively. The results showed that an upward trend for the total confirmed cases and total deaths, while total confirmed new cases and total new death, will become stable in the next 3 weeks if prevention measures are strictly followed to limit the spread of COVID-19. The forecasting results of COVID-19 will not be dreadful for upcoming days in Bangladesh.

Large-scale events, such as marine heatwaves, can impact the abundance of prey species, which consequently influences the behaviour of top-level predators such as seabirds. The short-tailed shearwater Ardenna tenuirostris is a trans-hemispheric migrant with typically a highly synchronous breeding phenology. Here, we document short-tailed shearwater colony occupancy for the period 2011-2020, with a focussed assessment of their breeding success in the 2019/20 season, which followed a marine heatwave that occurred predominantly in the nonbreeding areas in the North Pacific Ocean. The return of the birds to their breeding colonies in southeast Australia was delayed by approximately 2 wk in October 2019, and the subsequent breeding season ended with only 34% breeding success, with nest abandonment beginning in the incubation phase. A North Pacific marine heatwave in 2019, associated with a mass mortality event of over 9000 birds ('wreck' of beach-washed birds), led to reduced adult body condition and carry-over effects causing egg and chick failures during the subsequent breeding season. Localised weather events (i.e. flooding of burrows due to heavy rainfall) also influenced breeding outcomes of the 2019/20 season. The relationship between wreck events and seabird breeding ecology is an understudied area, partly due to the difficulties around quantifying the scale of wrecks. Our study is one of few that documents poor seabird breeding success following the extreme marine conditions which have persisted in the North Pacific Ocean since 2013.","Glencross, J. S.; Lavers, J.

175956,A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain replicating in standard laboratory mice,2021-07-10,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has been used to monitor trends in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the community. A major challenge in establishing wastewater surveillance programs, especially in remote areas, is the need for a well-equipped laboratory for sample analysis. Currently, no options exist for rapid, sensitive, mobile, and easy-to-use wastewater tests for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the GeneXpert System, which offers cartridge-based, rapid molecular clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a portable platform, was evaluated using wastewater as the input. The GeneXpert demonstrated a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection in wastewater below 32 copies/mL with a sample processing time of less than an hour. Using wastewater samples collected from multiple sites across Canada during February and March 2021, a high overall agreement (97.8%) was observed between the GeneXpert assay and laboratory-developed tests regarding the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, with the use of centrifugal filters the detection threshold of the GeneXpert system was improved to <10 copies/mL in wastewater. Finally, to support on-site wastewater surveillance, GeneXpert testing was implemented in Yellowknife, a remote community in Northern Canada where its use successfully alerted public health authorities to undetected transmission of COVID-19. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater triggered clinical testing of recent travelers and identification of new COVID-19 cases/clusters. Taken together, these results suggest the GeneXpert is a viable option for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in locations that do not have access to established testing laboratories.","Daigle, J.; Racher, K.; Hazenberg, J.; Yeoman, A.; Hannah, H.; Duong, D.; Mohammed, U.; Spreitzer, D.; Gregorchuk, B.

Likewise, the pace of global development, increased population size, nuanced encounters, and lack of medical security in developing countries all contribute to the complexities of COVID-19 prevention and regulation. The COVID-19 seems to have a greater impact on the global economy when compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurs in 2013. The bone of contention is how to fight the spread of these infectious diseases and how to contains it spread from human-to-human. Most countries depended on the observation of classic steps to monitor diseases and public health to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to those used with SARS in 2003. Data in the healthcare sector are usually huge and not easy to handle, this results from the enormous way by which data grows in the healthcare sector, the rate at which data are been produced, and the variety of various data in the healthcare system contributed to this growth. Also, the rate at which these data are been captured, stored, analyzed, and retrieved in healthcare has swiftly from the aged paper-based storage technique to the use of digital techniques and methods. Hence, the application of advanced technologies which includes virtualization and cloud computing allows for huge and effective data processing in the healthcare system. Thereby rapidly turning the healthcare system into a big data industry. Nevertheless, in these modern days, the improvement in the information and communication technologies (ICT) brings the advancement of varied data from new sources in the healthcare system. Therefore, this chapter discusses the possible application of big data and analytics to improve conventional public health approaches to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic to control, manage, identify and avoid COVID-19 and reduce the effect on health implicitly associated with COVID-19. The significant applications of big data and challenges are presented.

Mosquito-borne infection has also become a rising public health issue in Europe. This study aims to present the results of the first Hungarian systematic mosquito monitoring (SMM) operating in an urban environment in the city of Pécs. It also explains the implementation of a targeted mosquito control by the development of a mosquito map with the SMM approach, thus contributing to a reduction of the risks of mosquito-borne diseases. The mosquito trapping started in 2015, and the traps were Center for Disease Control (CDC) equipment. Based on the data of the SMM, an urban mosquito data set was developed. It consisted of the data of 441 trappings, and the data were statistically analyzed. The results show that three influencing factors impacted mosquito population: distance from running water, built-up density and average temperature had a causal impact on the average number of mosquitoes of an urban area. Each of these factors showed direct impact, and the impact intensified with the combination of the three factors. On that basis, it was made clear which areas of the city mosquito control activity should be focused. Areas of the city where interventions of lower intensity may be necessary compared to the intensity of the earlier mosquito control measures could also be determined. Compared to the previous practice, in which the entire city was involved in intensive mosquito control, now the intensive larviciding is advised to be applied in 42.1% of the total residential areas of the city. Thus, mosquito control of lower intensity could also be sufficient in the remaining 57.9% of the city area. This resource reallocation based on planning can boost the efficiency of the control and lead to a positive change towards sustainability regarding reduced pressure on the environment and reduced expenses of protection.","Kiss, Tibor Leitol Csaba Márovics Gergely Zentai Tímea Baczur Roland Girán János",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12125013,337

The Medical Council of India and the NITI Aayog, a policy think tank, formulated new guidelines to empower medical practitioners to practice telemedicine in India in March 2020. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the world and made digital consultations a necessity in specific cases, academic studies located within a health promotion framework in Western contexts indicated that patients have been very much interested in using social media tools to communicate with their physicians. Previous studies have also highlighted the advantages of information and communication technologies for patient?doctor interaction.Since changes introduced by digital health technologies have primarily been analysed from such health promotion perspectives that often adopt a ?techno-utopian? lens (Lupton, 2013), it becomes imperative to critically interrogate how such changes construct specific subjectivities and shape our understandings of health and normative healthcare practices. Specifically, scholars have highlighted how social media platforms and apps act as ?performative devices? (Johnson, 2014) that influence ?everyday management of illness and health? and help create the ideal of the ?digitally engaged patient? (Lupton, 2013).In the Indian context, media reports highlight a growing trend in the use of social media platforms and apps by physicians and patients. However, academic research on such emerging phenomena in this country is still scarce. This exploratory study examines why some Indians connect with physicians on a social media platform such as Facebook, the nature of communication between them and their understandings of health. It uses in-depth interviews and draws upon neoliberal governmentality as a theoretical anchor.The findings show how the internalization of neoliberal values and assumptions are associated with participants? search for lifestyle and medical advice in everyday digital spaces such as Facebook. This study strives to extend the concept of neoliberal governmentality to performances in everyday digital spaces such as Facebook. In terms of practical implications, the results of the study highlight the critical need for policies that regulate the medical content available in social media spaces. Most importantly, some of the issues highlighted by the participants in this study can help policymakers take adequate precautions while formulating guidelines on digital consultations, especially during pandemics and their aftermath when there is tremendous pressure to promote telemedicine.","Mishra, Smeeta",Vikalpa,https://doi.org/10.1177/02560909211023163,337

The simulations are performed using the commercial FE package Abaqus/Explicit and validated using experimental results. The FE generated data consists of cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and rake angle as the input parameters. The response variables are the cutting force and maximum tool temperature. The data is split into training and test sets using 80-20 split. The optimal SVR and GPR models are selected using grid search on the training data. The predictions on the test data sets show that both the models perform well with high accuracy in predicting cutting force and maximum tool temperature.

The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to rapidly detect physiological traits from wildlife scat and other body materials could play an important role in the conservation of species. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for NIRS to detect diseases such as the novel COVID-19 from saliva, parasites from feces, and numerous other traits from animal skin, hair, and scat, such as cortisol metabolites, diet quality, sex, and reproductive status, that may be useful for population monitoring. Models developed from NIRS data use light reflected from a sample to relate the variation in the sample’s spectra to variation in a trait, which can then be used to predict that trait in unknown samples based on their spectra. The modelling process involves calibration, validation, and evaluation. Data sampling, pre-treatments, and the selection of training and testing datasets can impact model performance. We review the use of NIRS for measuring physiological traits in animals that may be useful for wildlife management and conservation and suggest future research to advance the application of NIRS for this purpose.","Morgan, Laura R.; Marsh, Karen J.; Tolleson, Douglas R.; Youngentob, Kara N.",Remote Sensing,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13183699,337

Randomized trials are lacking on patient centered outcome. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients receiving ketamine as an adjunct analgosedative agent with those receiving standard of care (SOC) alone. We also described the feasibility during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this randomized, open-label trial either ketamine or SOC, in a 1:1 ratio, was administered to patients who were intubated within 24 h (medical, surgical, or transplant/oncology ICUs), expected to require mechanical ventilation (MV) for the next calendar day, and had the institutional pain and sedation protocol initiated. Ketamine infusion was 2 g/kg/min on day 1 and 1 g/kg/min on day 2. The primary outcome was the 28-day MV duration and ventilator-free days as co-primary outcome. Cox-proportional regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with probability for weaning off MV. Results: A total of 83 patients (43 in SOC and 40 in ketamine) were included. Demographics were balanced between the groups. The median duration of MV was not significantly different between the groups [median (interquartile range): 7 (3;9.25) for ketamine and 5 (2;8) for SOC, p= 0.15]. The median ventilation-free days was 19 days (IQR 0;24.75) in the ketamine and 19 days (IQR 0;24) in the SOC (p=0.70). Surgical and transplant/oncology ICU patients had a higher probability of weaning off MV than those in medical ICU [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) : 2.09 (1.06;4.14) for surgical ICU, 2.11 (1.02;4.35) for transplant/oncology ICU]. More patient was at goal RASS in ketamine compared to SOC. The sedatives and vasopressors cumulative doses were similar between the two arms at 48 h. We found no difference in 28-day mortality rate, ICU and hospital length of stay, and hemodynamic changes. The consent rate was adequate and the protocol adherence rate was 97.5%. Conclusions: Ketamine as an adjunct agent for sedation did not decrease the duration of MV and appeared to be safe, feasible, and effective in subgroups of ICU patients. No effect was noted in sedative and pressors requirements, or on hemodynamics.

184179,CROI 2021: Summary of Basic Science Research in HIV and SARS-CoV-2.,2021,"In this work, the classification of current diseases in population that can be detected from X-ray radiographs is proposed;the diseases are COVID-19 that threaten life and health, also tuberculosis, which continues to be a global health problem, and viral and bacterial cases of pneumonia that present initial symptoms similar to COVID-19 and Tuberculosis. For the classification, a convolutional neural network (CNN) of its own and the ResNet-50 were proposed, which has had good results in other investigations. The results obtained regarding the Accuracy metric for ResNet-50 is 0.72%, while for the proposed model, it is 0.87%. Therefore, this proposal has better correct predictions. However, it is noted that there is a lot of confusion between viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia, as they have very similar symptoms and characteristics. The radiographs without diseases are also not classified adequately since, although they do not present any disease of those classified, that does not guarantee that they do not have a problem of another type. These two problems were evident in both models. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Espinosa, A.

Studies on the factors associated with increased/decreased adherence to these measures have the potential to inform public policies directed at increasing adherence, and thus helping to control the spread of the current pandemic.ObjectivesThis study aimed at assessing the demographic and psychosocial predictors of the perceived risk of the COVID-19 and adherence to confinement guidelines during the first mandatory lockdown in Portugal.MethodsA convenience sample of 430 adults living in Portugal between March 19th and May 2nd, 2020 completed an online survey asking participants about the perceived risk of the COVID-19 and adherence to confinement guidelines. Participants also completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and measures of psychological function. Multiple regression analysis was performed.ResultsTeleworking and Risk and COVID-19 controllability were significant predictors of the perceived risk of COVID-19 as measured by the perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19. Teleworking participants and those perceiving COVID-19 as less controllable reported a higher perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 than those who were not in telework and perceived COVID-19 as a controllable condition. Adherence to confinement guidelines was predicted by the mental health status and perceived risk of COVID-19. Participants who reported worse mental health status, who perceived COVID-19 as a dangerous condition, and who trusted the public health system reported greater adherence to confinement guidelines.ConclusionsThe results of this study will be discussed considering their implications to public health policymaking to promote adherence to public health policies.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Jarego, M.; Rodríguez, E.; Ciaramella, A.; Miró, J.; Pais-Ribeiro, J.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1795,337

The dictum of public health practice especially for infectious disease is ""prevention better than cure"". It is especially true for SARS as the treatment strategies remain diverse and experimental. Maintaining a healthy and hygienic environment can be one of the effective public health measures to combat infectious disease. The major challenge is that some of the most important public health measures are to be taken outside the health sector. The community also needs to be strengthened and equipped with the health skills to promote better health and hygiene. There is also the need to create a supportive environment conducive to health for long term sustainability. The WHO approach of promoting health through setting approach would be one possible solution to face the challenge. This paper will describe some of the public health initiatives in Hong Kong through ""setting approach"" and ""community development model"" in helping the society fight against SARS.

OBJECTIVE Objective: To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the holistic care of people living with HIV in Liège (Belgium). METHODS Methods: In this retrospective observational study conducted in Liège University Hospital, we compared the out-patient follow-up of HIV-infected individuals as well as the number of new HIV diagnoses between 2019 and 2020 and between the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. RESULTS Results: In 2020, when compared to 2019, we observed a significant decrease in the number of new HIV diagnoses, especially during the first wave of the pandemic, and in the number of consultations undertaken by sexual health services, psychologists and specialists in infectious diseases at our HIV clinic. We also observed a decrease in the number of viral load assays and blood CD4 + T-cells count analyses performed, although we found less patients with HIV plasma viral load above 400 copies per mL in 2020. Finally, we noted a significant reduction in terms of screening of our HIV-infected patients for hepatitis C, syphilis, colorectal and anal cancers and hypercholesterolemia.

First, RNA viruses in particular must evade the mRNA decay machinery long enough to replicate and establish infection. Second, many viruses usurp or augment cellular mRNA decay pathways to regulate or selectively express their own genes, often inducing massive decay of the host transcripttome. Finally, temporal progression of a viral infection can depend on regulated decay of specific viral transcripts. Therefore, in order to fully understand viral biology, we must take into account the interactions between viruses and the mRNA decay machinery. This approach gives insights into regulatory mechanisms of cellular mRNA decay, as well as reveals novel ways to influence the outcome of viral infections.","Sokoloski, Kevin J; Wilusz, Carol J; Wilusz, Jeffrey",RNA biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17375004/,337

Research is critically needed to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's mental health including psychosocial factors that predict resilience, recovery, and persistent distress. The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to describe children's mental health during the initial phase of the pandemic, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial moderator of children's increased distress. Method Children and parents from 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported (i) retrospectively on children's well-being (e.g., worry, happiness) immediately prior to the pandemic and (ii) on children's current well-being; irritability; social support; and anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Child-perceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity and attenuated increase in psychological distress. Conclusions Study findings suggest possible broad psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic.

199749,Study on genome sequence of novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) strains in different countries,2020,"Networks are ubiquitous in natural, technological and social systems. They are of increasing relevance for improved understanding and control of infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans, given the interconnectedness of today's world. Recent modelling work on disease development in complex networks shows: the relative rapidity of pathogen spread in scale-free compared with random networks, unless there is high local clustering; the theoretical absence of an epidemic threshold in scale-free networks of infinite size, which implies that diseases with low infection rates can spread in them, but the emergence of a threshold when realistic features are added to networks (e.g. finite size, household structure or deactivation of links); and the influence on epidemic dynamics of asymmetrical interactions. Models suggest that control of pathogens spreading in scale-free networks should focus on highly connected individuals rather than on mass random immunization. A growing number of empirical applications of network theory in human medicine and animal disease ecology confirm the potential of the approach, and suggest that network thinking could also benefit plant epidemiology and forest pathology, particularly in human-modified pathosystems linked by commercial transport of plant and disease propagules. Potential consequences for the study and management of plant and tree diseases are discussed.","Jeger, Mike J; Pautasso, Marco; Holdenrieder, Ottmar; Shaw, Mike W",The New phytologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17388891/,337

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of multilayer compression and intermittent impulse compression therapy in reducing ankle and hindfoot edema compared with the standard treatment with elevation and ice. METHODS This was a randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial using a repeated-measures design. Fifty-eight patients with unilateral fractures of the ankle or hindfoot were randomized into the cold pack (control) group, the bandage group, or the impulse compression group and were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome was the reduction of edema as measured with the figure-of-eight-20 method. RESULTS Preoperatively and postoperatively, there were significant differences in edema reduction between the bandage group and the control group. After two days of intervention, the median preoperative edema reduction in the control group was -2.0 mm (-5%) compared with -11.0 mm (-23%) in the bandage group (p < 0.017), and -0.3 mm (0%) in the impulse compression group (p > 0.017). Postoperatively, after two days, the median edema changes were +3.5 mm (+7%) in the control group compared with -7.3 mm (-22%) in the bandage group (p < 0.017) and +5.0 mm (+46%) in the impulse compression group (p > 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Multilayer compression therapy results in a faster reduction of ankle and hindfoot edema, although with less ankle dorsiflexion on postoperative day three than the control group, and can be recommended as an alternative treatment. Intermittent impulse compression applied without any extra compression by stockinette or bandage and without elevation in off-session periods cannot be recommended as a superior alternative to the treatment with ice.

METHODS The surrounding cities of Hangzhou included Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Zhoushan, Taizhou and Lishui. Background information on infectious diseases in Zhejiang province was collected, and the brainstorming and expert consultation methods were used to identify the risks. The local risks and the impact of local risks on the G20 summit were assessed. RESULTS The criteria for public health risk was first established. Through the assessments,a total of 27 kinds of infectious diseases in 4 types of public health risks were identified. The impact of these risks on Hangzhou G20 summit was divided into 1 item of high-risk, 12 items of medium risk and 14 items of low risk.According to the results of risk assessment, the recommendations for risk management of respiratory infectious diseases, intestinal infectious diseases, imported infectious diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome and other infectious diseases were made. With risk management, Middle East respiratory syndrome was not occurred during the G20 summit, and the epidemic situation of other infectious diseases with middle or low risks was almost the same with that of past years. CONCLUSIONS sThe public health risks of Hangzhou G20 summit from sudden infectious diseases in outlying areas are mainly medium and low risks. The recommendations on risk management provide a basis for reducing the adverse consequences of public health risks in the event of an outbreak of infectious diseases, avoiding the impact of various risk factors in the outlying areas on G20 summit.","Qi, Xiaohua; Wang, Xinyi; He, Fan; Liu, Biyao; Zhang, Tao; Li, Fudong; Zhai, Yujia; Lin, Junfen",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

201550,The costs of secrecy,2020,"Although the initial isolates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) are sensitive to neutralization by antibodies through their spike (S) glycoprotein, variants of S have since been identified that are resistant to such inhibition. Optimal vaccine strategies would therefore make use of additional determinants of immune recognition, either through cellular or expanded, cross-reactive humoral immunity. Here, the cellular and humoral immune responses elicited by different combinations of gene-based and inactivated viral particles with various adjuvants have been assessed. The T-cell response was altered by different prime-boost immunizations, with the optimal CD8 immunity induced by DNA priming and replication-defective adenoviral vector boosting. The humoral immune response was enhanced most effectively through the use of inactivated virus with adjuvants, either MF59 or alum, and was associated with stimulation of the CD4 but not the CD8 response. The use of inactivated SARS virus with MF59 enhanced the CD4 and antibody response even after gene-based vaccination. Because both cellular and humoral immune responses are generated by gene-based vaccination and inactivated viral boosting, this strategy may prove useful in the generation of SARS-CoV vaccines.","Kong, Wing-pui; Xu, Ling; Stadler, Konrad; Ulmer, Jeffrey B; Abrignani, Sergio; Rappuoli, Rino; Nabel, Gary J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16254327/,337

Here we evaluated the performance of a ddPCR-based assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 titer in 55 suspected COVID-19 cases with negative rtPCR results thanks to in-house ddPCR assay (targeting RdRp and host RNaseP). Samples were collected at ASST-GOM Niguarda between February and May 2020 at hospital admission. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging and definition of disease severity. Patients were mainly female (45.5%) with a median age of 73 (57-84) years. ddPCR-based assay detected SARS-CoV-2 genome in nasopharyngeal samples of 19 (34.5%) patients (median viral-load: 128 copies/mL, IQR: 72-345). In 15 of them (78.9%), chest CT showed a classical COVID-19 bilateral interstitial pneumonia; 14 patients (73.7%) showed severe COVID-19 manifestations. ddPCR did not identify any trace of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the respiratory samples of the remaining 36 patients. The serological assay performed in a subgroup of 34 patients at the later stage of illness (from 3 days to 90 days after) confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in ddPCR (100%). Contrariwise, negative tests were observed in 95.0% ddPCR negative patients (P<0.001). Thanks to a ddPCR-based assay, we achieved a rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in rtPCR-negative respiratory samples of individuals with COVID-19 suspect, allowing the rapid taking care and correct management of these patients.","Alteri, Claudia; Cento, Valeria; Antonello, Maria; Colagrossi, Luna; Merli, Marco; Ughi, Nicola; Renica, Silvia; Matarazzo, Elisa; Di Ruscio, Federica; Tartaglione, Livia; Colombo, Jacopo; Grimaldi, Chiara; Carta, Stefania; Nava, Alice; Costabile, Valentino; Baiguera, Chiara; Campisi, Daniela; Fanti, Diana; Vismara, Chiara; Fumagalli, Roberto; Scaglione, Francesco; Epis, Oscar Massimiliano; Puoti, Massimo; Perno, Carlo Federico",PLoS One,,337

206752,Вопросы и ответы о безопасности продуктов на рынках,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents the pandemic of the century, with approximately 3.5 million cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 2020. Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory milieu and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications. COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively. Decreased use of health care services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection. Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and cardiovascular implications of COVID-19, its impact on existing pathways of care, the role of modern technologies to tackle the pandemic, and a proposal of novel management algorithms for the most common acute cardiac conditions.","Boukhris, Marouane; Hillani, Ali; Moroni, Francesco; Annabi, Mohamed Salah; Addad, Faouzi; Ribeiro, Marcelo Harada; Mansour, Samer; Zhao, Xiaohui; Ybarra, Luiz Fernando; Abbate, Antonio; Vilca, Luz Maria; Azzalini, Lorenzo",Can J Cardiol,,337

It is unknown whether clinical dental screening to diagnose and treat odontogenic disease in these patients can reduce the incidence of dental emergencies. METHODS: Between November 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, we screened 147 patients with newly diagnosed AML before their admission for induction chemotherapy (n1 = 147, ""screened"" group). The patients not screened acted as controls (n2 = 190, ""unscreened"" group), as did patients diagnosed with AML in the 26 months before the initiation of the screening program (n3 = 304, ""prescreening"" group). The number of patients in each group who presented for emergency dental assessment during admission for induction chemotherapy was determined by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Among the 147 patients in the screened group, only 1 patient presented with an infectious odontogenic emergency (0.68% [95% CI, -0.64% to 1.98%]). In the unscreened group, 8 developed an infectious odontogenic emergency during induction chemotherapy (4.21% [95% CI, 1.37% to 7.15%]), a statistically significant difference (P = .046, a = 0.05).

Thus, these scale-spaces rely on spatial sparsity. In the present paper, we show that sparsification of the co-domain, the set of admissible grey values, also constitutes scale-spaces with induced hierarchical quantisation techniques. These quantisation scale-spaces are closely tied to information theoretical measures for coding cost, and therefore particularly interesting for inpainting-based compression. Based on this observation, we propose a sparsification algorithm for the grey-value domain that outperforms uniform quantisation as well as classical clustering approaches.","Peter, Pascal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10491v1.pdf,337
208345,The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in dementia across Latin America: A call for an urgent regional plan and coordinated response,2020,"Natural populations often show enhanced genetic drift consistent with a strong skew in their offspring number distribution. The skew arises because the variability of family sizes is either inherently strong or amplified by population expansions, leading to so-called `jackpot' events. The resulting allele frequency fluctuations are large and, therefore, challenge standard models of population genetics, which assume sufficiently narrow offspring distributions. While the neutral dynamics backward in time can be readily analyzed using coalescent approaches, we still know little about the effect of broad offspring distributions on the dynamics forward in time, especially with selection. Here, we employ an exact asymptotic analysis combined with a scaling hypothesis to demonstrate that over-dispersed frequency trajectories emerge from the competition of conventional forces, such as selection or mutations, with an emerging time-dependent sampling bias against the minor allele. The sampling bias arises from the characteristic time-dependence of the largest sampled family size within each allelic type. Using this insight, we establish simple scaling relations for allele frequency fluctuations, fixation probabilities, extinction times, and the site frequency spectra that arise when offspring numbers are distributed according to a power law $~n^{-(1+\alpha)}$. To demonstrate that this coarse-grained model captures a wide variety of non-equilibrium dynamics, we validate our results in traveling waves, where the phenomenon of 'gene surfing' can produce any exponent $1<\alpha<2$. We argue that the concept of a dynamic sampling bias is useful generally to develop both intuition and statistical tests for the unusual dynamics of populations with skewed offspring distributions, which can confound commonly used tests for selection or demographic history.","Okada, Takashi; Hallatschek, Oskar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05852v2.pdf,337

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients receiving a laboratory test for COVID-19 were identified. The primary outcome was comparison of positive COVID-19 testing in those who received the influenza vaccine versus those who did not. Secondary end points in patients testing positive for COVID-19 included mortality, need for hospitalization, length of stay, need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 27,201 patients received laboratory testing for COVID-19. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 was reduced in patients who received an influenza vaccine compared to those who did not (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.86; P < .001). Vaccinated patients testing positive for COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73; P < .001), or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78; P = .004) and had a shorter hospital length of stay (risk ratio, 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.89; P < .001).

This study emphasized the challenges of increased waste disposal during the COVID-19 crisis and its response practices. Data obtained from the scientific research papers, publications from the governments and multilateral organizations, and media reports were used to quantify the effect of the pandemic towards waste generation. A huge increase in the amount of used personal protective equipments (facemasks, gloves, and other protective stuffs) and wide distribution of infectious wastes from hospitals, health care facilities, and quarantined households was found. The amount of food and plastic waste also increased during the pandemic. These factors caused waste treatment facilities to be overwhelmed, forcing emergency treatment and disposals (e.g., co-disposal in a municipal solid waste incinerator, cement kilns, industrial furnaces, and deep burial) to ramp up processing capacity. This paper discussed the ways the operation of those facilities must be improved to cope with the challenge of handling medical waste, as well as working around the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. The study also highlights the need for short, mid, and longer-term responses towards waste management during the pandemic. Furthermore, the practices discussed in this paper may provide an option for alternative approaches and development of sustainable strategies for mitigating similar pandemics in the future.","Hantoko, Dwi; Li, Xiaodong; Pariatamby, Agamuthu; Yoshikawa, Kunio; Horttanainen, Mika; Yan, Mi",J Environ Manage,,337

In this study, we examined the effect of CRF on mobility performance measured by a wearable pendant sensor. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial evaluating the benefit of exercise in cancer survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CRF status was classified based on a Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score &#8804; 33. Among 28 patients (age = 65.7±9.8 years old, BMI = 26.9±4.1kg/m2, sex = 32.9%female) with database variables of interest, twenty-one subjects (75.9%) were classified as non-CRF. Mobility performance, including behavior (sedentary, light, and moderate to vigorous activity (MtV)), postures (sitting, standing, lying, and walking), and locomotion (e.g., steps, postural transitions) were measured using a validated pendant-sensor over 24-hours. Baseline psychosocial, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and motor-capacity assessments including gait (habitual speed, fast speed, and dual-task speed) and static balance were also performed. RESULTS: Both groups had similar baseline clinical and psychosocial characteristics, except for body-mass index (BMI), FACT-G, FACIT-F, and FES-I (p<0.050). The groups did not differ on motor-capacity. However, the majority of mobility performance parameters were different between groups with large to very large effect size, Cohen's d ranging from 0.91 to 1.59. Among assessed mobility performance, the largest effect sizes were observed for sedentary-behavior (d = 1.59, p = 0.006), light-activity (d = 1.48, p = 0.009), and duration of sitting+lying (d = 1.46, p = 0.016). The largest correlations between mobility performance and FACIT-F were observed for sitting+lying (rho = -0.67, p<0.001) and the number of steps per day (rho = 0.60, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that sensor-based mobility performance monitoring could be considered as a potential digital biomarker for CRF assessment. Future studies warrant evaluating utilization of mobility performance to track changes in CRF over time, response to CRF-related interventions, and earlier detection of CRF.","Sada, Yvonne H; Poursina, Olia; Zhou, He; Workeneh, Biruh T; Maddali, Sandhya V; Najafi, Bijan",PLoS One,,337

Naturally, different possibilities (including herbal medicines having known therapeutic significance) have been explored by the scientists. The systematic scientific study (beginning with in silico study) of herbal medicines in particular and any drug in general is now possible as the structural components (proteins) of COVID-19 are already characterized. The main protease of COVID-19 virus is Mpro or 3CLpro which is a key CoV enzyme and an attractive drug target as it plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. In the present study, 3CLpro is used to study drug:3CLpro interactions and thus to investigate whether all or any of the main chemical constituents of Tinospora cordifolia (e.g. berberine (C20H18NO4), ß-sitosterol (C29H50O), coline (C5H14NO), tetrahydropalmatine (C21H25NO4) and octacosanol (C28H58O)) can be used as an anti-viral drug against SARS-CoV-2. The in silico study performed using tools of network pharmacology, molecular docking including molecular dynamics have revealed that among all considered phytochemicals in Tinospora cordifolia, berberine can regulate 3CLpro protein's function due to its easy inhibition and thus can control viral replication. The selection of Tinospora cordifolia was motivated by the fact that the main constituents of it are known to be responsible for various antiviral activities and the treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, diabetes, etc. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

According to the WHO reports, total 3 862 676 positive cases and 265 961 deaths have been recorded worldwide due to COVID-19 infection as of May 9, 2020. CoVs are a large family of viruses (enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses), which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). New SARS CoV2 is the members of Betacoronavirus genus. These viruses cause infections in bats, camels and humans, and a few other associated species. Despite many neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still unclear whether these symptoms results from direct neural injury or due to some other reason. Currently, it appears that most of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are nonspecific and secondary to the systemic illness. A single case of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy has been reported. SARS-CoV-2 associated Guillain-Barré syndrome is an atypical case. Till today, no convincing evidence is available to confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly affects nerves system in humans.

To know the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the city of Madrid and its 21 districts in the first 4 months of the epidemic and its relationship with some socioeconomic and demographic variables. METHODS: Cross-sectional ecological study (39,270 cases). The 39,270 cases diagnosed from the beginning of the pandemic until June 26, 2020, published by the Comunidad de Madrid in were studied. In the districts, the distribution of gross and fair incidence is related to the ones of the independent variables (Municipal Statistics and Estudio de Salud 2018, Madrid Salud). The Incidence and the r and r2 coefficients, obtained with the factors and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, are studied. RESULTS: The city of Madrid presents a cumulative incidence of COVID-19, which is double the national one (100), with a Standardized Cumulative Incidence Ratio (RIAE) of 204.59 per 100. The districts with the most RIAE were those in the southeast, all&gt;240 per 100. In the districts, the per capita household rate, the per capita income, and the mortality rate from infectious diseases in men reached high and inverse correlations with RIAE (all r&gt;-0.3). The RLM model with these 3 indicators predicts 30% of the RIAES. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between material wealth and the risk of COVID-19 infection is inverse. The knowledge in the districts of per capita income, household rate and mortality rate due to infectious diseases in men reduces the uncertainty about the accumulated incidence by 30%.","Diaz-Olalla, J.

218708,"Virology, epidemiology, immunology and vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2, update after nine months of pandemic",2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Toxicity testing is an important step for developing new drugs, and animals are widely used in this step by exposing them to the toxicants. Zebrafishes are widely used for measuring and detecting the toxicity. However, measuring and testing toxicity manually is not feasible due to the large number of embryos. This work presents an automated model to investigate the toxicity of two toxicants (3, 4-Dichloroaniline (34DCA) and p-Tert-Butylphenol (PTBP)). METHODS: The proposed model consists of two steps. In the first step, a set of features is extracted from microscopic images of zebrafish embryos using the Segmentation-Based Fractal Texture Analysis (SFTA) technique. Secondly, a novel rough set-based model using Social ski-driver (SSD) is used to find a global minimal subset of features that preserves important information of the original features. In the third step, the AdaBoost classifier is used to classify an unknown sample to alive or coagulant after exposing the embryo to a toxic compound. RESULTS: For detecting the toxicity, the proposed model is compared with (i) three deterministic rough set reduction algorithms and (ii) the PSO-based algorithm. The classification performance rate of our model was ranged from 97.1% to 99.5% and it outperformed the other algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our experiments proved that the proposed drug toxicity model is efficient for rough set-based feature selection and it obtains a high classification performance.","Tharwat, Alaa; Darwish, Ashraf; Hassanien, Aboul Ella",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,337

Surgical trainees were redeployed to Intensive Care and Emergency units supporting urgent and unplanned care on COVID-19 patients. Theater exposure, crucial part of surgical training, was reduced to minimal since elective cases were postponed, and emergency operating was carried out by consultants only. Surgical research has also been severely hit with most of the clinical trials been postponed. Teaching activities as well as national and international congresses and surgical courses important tools for continuous professional development were canceled. METHODS: The primary aim of our study was to summarize the changes in surgical training during the pandemic. This was followed by a review of the existing social media platforms, video-conferencing platforms along with the role of the social media in surgical training. The crucial role of simulation in surgical training was explored and alternative ways of training with engagement of the feedback mechanisms were proposed. The secondary aim was to highlight possible novel educational strategies for the forthcoming post-COVID-19 era. CONCLUSIONS: The ""new"" era forced the educational boards to reexamine training curriculums. Innovation strategies and cooperation on the part of surgical residency programs is crucial. Strong leadership is needed, on the part of the education bodies with restructuring of the surgical programmes to accommodate alternative ways of training is necessary to maintain rigorous standards of education and training.","Doulias, Triantafyllos; Gallo, Gaetano; Rubio-Perez, Ines; Breukink, Stephanie O; Hahnloser, Dieter",J Invest Surg,,337

To achieve control of COVID-19, we need accurate and rapid diagnostic tests. There are two kinds of diagnostic: molecular tests to detect viral RNA and serological tests to detect anti-SARSCoV-2 immunoglobulins. Serological tests become an alternative or a complement to RT-PCR as it might be cheaper and easier. Combining IgM and IgG detection resulted in higher sensitivity than detecting either isotype alone. However, the tests have some limitations to measure IgM or IgG antibodies. Therefore, using merely such tests to diagnose COVID-19 will miss any infections. Consequently, the diagnosis or screening for COVID-19 using antibody test needs to be evaluated. We aim to decrease the risk of false-negative or false-positive in the tests. © 2021 UPM Press. All rights reserved.","Fuana, Y.; Rakhman, R. P. A.; Soegiarto, G.; Budhy, T.

Focusing on social distancing of individuals susceptible to an infection we theoretically characterize the gap between private and social cost of contacts. Our main contribution is to quantify this gap by calibrating the model with unique survey data from Germany on social distancing and impure altruism from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal policy is to drastically reduce contacts at the beginning to almost eradicate the epidemic and keep them at levels that contain the pandemic at a low prevalence level. We find that also in laissez faire, private protection efforts by forward-looking, risk averse individuals would have stabilized the epidemic, but at a much higher prevalence of infection than optimal. Altruistic motives increase individual protection efforts, but a substantial gap to the social optimum remains.","Quaas, Martin F; Meya, Jasper N; Schenk, Hanna; Bos, Björn; Drupp, Moritz A; Requate, Till",PLoS One,,337
221918,A trimeric human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent,2021,"The ARTIC Network provides a common resource of PCR primer sequences and recommendations for amplifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses. ImportanceARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations. In this report, we compare the results of sequencing a matched set of samples with the V3 and V4 primer sets. We find that adoption of the ARTIC V4 primer set is critical for accurate sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The absence of metadata describing the primer scheme used will negatively impact the downstream use of publicly available SARS-Cov-2 sequencing reads and assembled genomes.","Davis, James; Long, Scott Wesley; Christensen, Paul; Olsen, Randall J; Olson, Robert; Shukla, Maulik; Subedi, Sishir; Stevens, Rick; Musser, James M.",,,337

Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from nondirected bronchial lavage (NBL). We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. FINDINGS: CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort. In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p = 0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p = 0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA. INTERPRETATION: CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 is independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A standardized screening and diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify affected patients at an early stage.","Lahmer, Tobias; Kriescher, Silja; Herner, Alexander; Rothe, Kathrin; Spinner, Christoph D; Schneider, Jochen; Mayer, Ulrich; Neuenhahn, Michael; Hoffmann, Dieter; Geisler, Fabian; Heim, Markus; Schneider, Gerhard; Schmid, Roland M; Huber, Wolfgang; Rasch, Sebastian",PLoS One,,337

In addition, it proposes that, to see the ways in which the United States is experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to place the United States alongside the experiences of other countries of the Americas rather than making comparisons to Europe.","Espinosa, Mariola",Bull Hist Med,,337

225090,SARS-CoV-2 may impair pancreatic function via basigin: A single-cell transcriptomic study of the pancreas,2021,"COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by various symptoms, ranging from mild fatigue to life-threatening pneumonia, ""cytokine storm,"" and multiorgan failure. The manifestation of COVID-19 may lead to a cytokine storm, i.e., it facilitates viral replication that triggers a strong release of cytokines, which then modulates the immune system and results in hyperinflammation. Today's diet is high in omega-6 fatty acids and deficient in omega-3 fatty acids; this, along with a high fructose intake, leads to obesity, which is a chronic state of low-grade inflammation. Omega-6 fatty acids are proinflammatory and prothrombotic whereas omega-3 fatty acids are less proinflammatory and thrombotic. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids make specialized lipid mediators, namely resolvins, protectins, and maresins, that are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Throughout evolution there was a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids with a ratio of 1-2/1 omega-6/omega-3, but today this ratio is 16-20/1 omega-6/omega-3, leading to a proinflammatory state. In addition, genetic variants in FADS1, FADS2, ELOV-2, and ELOV-5 lead to a more efficient biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), e.g., of linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (ARA), and (alpha-linolenic acid) (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), leading to higher ARA levels. Because the US diet is already high in omega-6 fatty acids, the increased biosynthesis of ARA in people with the derived FADS haplotype (haplotype D) leads to an increased production of leukotrienes, thromboxanes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and eventually elevated levels of cytokines, like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19. About 80% of African Americans, 50% of Hispanics, and 45% of European Americans have the FADS haplotype D and are thus efficient metabolizers, which could account for the higher vulnerability of these populations to COVID-19. Therefore, another reason that African Americans and Hispanics are more susceptible to COVID-19 is that they have a higher frequency of haplotype D, which is no longer beneficial in today's environment and diet. Genetic variation must be considered in all studies of disease development and therapy because it is important to the practice of precision nutrition by physicians and other health professionals. The objective of this commentary is to emphasize the importance of genetic variation within populations and its interaction with diet in the development of disease. Differences in the frequency of genes and their interactions with nutrients in various population groups must be considered among the factors contributing to health disparities in the development of COVID-19. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is essential to health. Physicians should measure their patients' fatty acids and recommend decreasing the intake of foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids and increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids along with fruits and vegetables.","Simopoulos, Artemis P",Lifestyle Genom,,337

The use of point of care (POC) platforms, providing highly specific results performed on saliva could simplify the diagnosis of COVID-19 and contribute to contain the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsWe assess the sensitivity and specificity of molecular testing performed on saliva in comparison to NPS using two different POC platforms (DiaSorin Simplexa and Cepheid Xpert(R)). NPS and saliva were collected prospectically from asymptomatic health care workers and mildly symptomatic patients. Moreover, the stability of saliva samples after storage at -80{degrees}C for up to 45 days was tested. ResultsThe obtained results in comparison to NPS demonstrated for both DiaSorin Simplexa and Xpert(R) Xpress a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 90.24%. The overall agreement between the tests performed on saliva was 98%. A positive correlation in Ct values detected on saliva and on NPS was identified for all the targets shared by the tests in analysis (Orf1ab, E and N2). Both S Ct values and Orf1ab Ct values were not significantly different before and after the freezing in the tested saliva samples. ConclusionThe obtained results demonstrated an overall performance of saliva comparable to NPS, confirming that RT-PCR performed using POCs on saliva could represent a valid public health solution for controlling SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Saluzzo, Francesca; Mantegani, Paola; Chaurand, Valeria Poletti de; Cugnata, Federica; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Cilla, Marta; Erba, Patrizia; Racca, Sara; Tresoldi, Cristina; Uberti-Foppa, Caterina; Serio, Clelia Di; Cirillo, Daniela Maria",,,337
225841,Investigation of SARS CoV-2 virus in environmental surface,2021,"The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100% sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.","Mangal, Arpan; Kalia, Surya; Rajgopal, Harish; Rangarajan, Krithika; Namboodiri, Vinay; Banerjee, Subhashis; Arora, Chetan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09803v1.pdf,337

227054,Community Mitigation During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Mission Impossible in Developing Countries,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shares approximately 80% whole genome sequence identity and 66% spike (S) protein identity with that of SARS-CoV. The cross-neutralization between these viruses is currently not well-defined. METHODS: Here, by using the live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection assay as well as HIV-1 based pseudotyped-virus carrying the spike (S) gene of the SARS-CoV-2 (ppSARS-2) and SARS-CoV (ppSARS), we examined whether infections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies. FINDINGS: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and we also found that the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV effectively inhibits ppSARS-2 entry in Huh7.5 cells. However, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients showed high neutralizing activity only against the homologous virus, with no or limited cross-neutralization activity against the other pseudotyped virus. Similar results were also observed in vaccination studies in mice. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a cellular receptor, the neutralization epitopes are not shared by these two closely-related viruses, highlighting challenges towards developing a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV related viruses. FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, and the One Belt and One Road Major Project for infectious diseases.","Yang, Ren; Lan, Jiaming; Huang, Baoying; A, Ruhan; Lu, Mingqing; Wang, Wen; Wang, Wenling; Li, Wenhui; Deng, Yao; Wong, Gary; Tan, Wenjie",EBioMedicine,,337

This study examined 2908 calls made to a national mental health helpline over a 10 month period, 2 months prior to (Pre-COVID) and 8 months during the pandemic phase, that incorporated the imposition of a partial lockdown, followed by the removal and reintroduction of restrictive measures locally. Data collected included reason/s for call assistance, gender, age and number of daily diagnosed cases and deaths due to COVID-19. In the Pre-COVID phase, calls for assistance were related to information needs and depression. With the imposition of a partial lockdown, coupled with the first local deaths and spikes in number of diagnosed cases, a significant increase in number of calls targeting mental health, medication management and physical and financial issues were identified. Following the removal of local restrictions, the number of calls decreased significantly; however, with the subsequent reintroduction of restrictions, coupled with the rise in cases and deaths, assistance requested significantly targeted informational needs. Hence, whilst calls in the initial phase of the pandemic mainly targeted mental health issues, over time this shifted towards information seeking requests, even within a context where the number of deaths and cases had significantly risen.","Scerri, Josianne; Sammut, Alexei; Cilia Vincenti, Sarah; Grech, Paulann; Galea, Michael; Scerri, Christian; Calleja Bitar, Daniela; Dimech Sant, Stephania",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,337

Data of 282 cows from 9 dairy herds in Québec, Canada, with bulk tank SCC < 250,000 cells/mL were used. Estimated median herd-prevalence of infections that should be treated was 16.2 % (95 % credibility interval (CI): 11.0-22.7). Se and Sp estimates for quarter-milk culture using Petrifilm® were 82.2 % (95 %CI: 74.0-89.5) and 62.0 % (95 %CI: 58.6-65.6), respectively. Se and Sp for quarter-milk standard bacteriology were 67.4 % (95 %CI: 55.8-81.2) and 79.6 % (95 %CI: 76.4-83.0), respectively. Se and Sp of different SCC scenarios and thresholds were estimated. For first parity cows, using only the last Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) test SCC with a threshold of 100,000 cells/mL appeared quite accurate, with Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and reduction of antimicrobial usage of 85.6 % (95 %CI: 69.6-95.6), 86.0 % (95 %CI: 80.0-91.7), 58.0 % (95 %CI: 42.3-74.2), 96.4 % (95 %CI: 91.3-99.0), and 75.3 % (95 %CI: 70.7-79.3), respectively. For cows of &#8805; 2nd parity, using only the last DHI test SCC with a threshold of 200,000 cells/mL resulted in Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and reduction of antimicrobial usage of 75.3 % (95 %CI: 55.8-87.3), 84.0 % (95 %CI: 78.8-89.3), 47.2 % (95 %CI: 32.0-63.7), 94.7 % (95 %CI: 89.0-97.6), and of 77.0 % (95 %CI: 73.3-80.3), respectively. Adding quarter-level milk culture using Petrifilm® to cows identified as unhealthy using cow-level SCC data improved the test accuracy (mainly the PPV) and further reduced the use of antimicrobials. For instance, in &#8805; 2nd parity cows, using only the last DHI SCC with a threshold of 200,000 cells/mL, adding a subsequent Petrifilm® test increased the reduction from 77.0 % (95 %CI: 73.3-80.3) to 89.5 % (95 %CI: 86.7-91.8). Considering the availability of SCC data, the easiness of using just the last DHI test, and the high NPV that could be achieved, producers may consider using just the last DHI test as a potential tool to identify cows that should be treated with antimicrobials at dry off. It may be used alone or in combination with quarter-level on-farm Petrifilm® milk culture on high SCC cows to further reduce the use of antimicrobials by identifying quarters that need to be treated.","Kabera, Fidèle; Roy, Jean-Philippe; Keefe, Greg; Dufour, Simon",Prev Vet Med,,337

We humans are mammals and our welfare depends on the health of the earth. We are not so different from other living creatures in this regard. It is in our interests to look after the earth, something that Indigenous Australians knew well. Mother Earth must be cared for if she is to care for us.

The confirmed cases in Indonesia and Philippines are the highest ranks among other ASEAN countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. To reduce the spread of the pandemic COVID-19, each country has implemented the lock-down policy differently, depending on its economic situation. Therefore, the study of the impact of lock-down across the world, particularly in ASEAN countries, is still relevant to do. In this study, we developed the lock-down model in ASEAN countries by using hybrid ARIMA-SVR and hybrid SEIR-ANN. The first hybrid is based on the time series model ARIMA, with the revision of the error is by using SVR. The second hybrid is based on the classical model of infectious diseases, SEIR, which we revise on the prediction part by using ANN. The hybrid is intended to revise the individual prediction model. The data collected per country was started from January 20, 2020 to August 5, 2020. The periods of lock-down in this study are divided into three, namely no lock-down, implemented lock-down, and the new normal periods. The strictness levels of lock-down were predicted for 60 days ahead. The results showed that the hybrid ARIMA-SVR had smaller RMSE compared with individual ARIMA, similarly, hybrid SEIR-ANN predicted S, E, I, and R more accurately compared with individual SEIR model. It has been also found that the lock down was most effectively implemented in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, whereas Indonesia and Philippines were inefficient countries to enforce the restriction. It is indicated by the number of cases increased significantly during the restriction periods in both countries. © 2021 The Author(s).

231112,Can Neurotropic Free-Living Amoeba Serve as a Model to Study SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Informal family caregivers constitute an important and increasingly demanding role in the cancer healthcare system. This is especially true for caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumors based on the rapid progression of disease, including physical and cognitive debilitation. Informal social network resources such as friends and family can provide social support to caregivers, which lowers caregiver burden and improves overall quality of life. However, barriers to obtaining needed social support exist for caregivers. To address this need, our team developed and is assessing a multi-component caregiver support intervention that uses a blend of technology and personal contact to improve caregiver social support. METHODS: We are currently conducting a prospective, longitudinal 2-group randomized controlled trial which compares caregivers who receive the intervention to a wait-list control group. Only caregivers directly receive the intervention, but the patient-caregiver dyads are enrolled so we can assess outcomes in both. The 8-week intervention consists of two components: (1) The electronic Social Network Assessment Program, a web-based tool to visualize existing social support resources and provide a tailored list of additional resources; and (2) Caregiver Navigation, including weekly phone sessions with a Caregiver Navigator to address caregiver social support needs. Outcomes are assessed by questionnaires completed by the caregiver (baseline, 4-week, 8-week) and the cancer patient (baseline, and 8-week). At 8 weeks, caregivers in the wait-list condition may opt into the intervention. Our primary outcome is caregiver well-being; we also explore patient well-being and caregiver and patient health care utilization. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes a study testing a novel social support intervention that pairs a web-based social network visualization tool and resource list (eSNAP) with personalized caregiver navigation. This intervention is responsive to a family-centered model of care and calls for clinical and research priorities focused on informal caregiving research.

Those of us in higher education will perhaps reflect on the Spring 2020 semester as a turning point in our approach to education. To prepare higher education for future crises and to create a more buoyant, elastic, and resilient educational paradigm, it is imperative that we learn, right now, from the COVID-19 crisis. This is of particular importance for engineering education, which relies on experiential pedagogical practices that are incongruent with online learning environments. Since 2014, a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team has been addressing improvements to engineering education through mixed reality gaming, an educational model that integrates traditional classroom experiences (e.g., lectures, laboratory work) with virtual activities (e.g., game-based learning). We posit that a mixed reality gaming educational model may help mitigate the impact COVID-19-like crises. Herein, we reflect on implementations of a mixed-reality gaming activity in an introductory geotechnical engineering course on five campuses during the pivot to remote learning, which will be remembered as the hallmark of the Spring 2020 semester. Ultimately, the data gathered from these implementations will be used to study the effectiveness of mixed reality gaming on student learning outcomes (specifically, the ways in which student and instructor motivation shape and are shaped by this educational model) to understand (1) the role of mixed reality gaming;and (2) instructors' and students' motivational shifts during such crises. © ASCE.","Bennett, V.

232156,Integration of RT-LAMP and Microfluidic Technology for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Wastewater as an Advanced Point-of-care Platform,2021,"The management of a controllable production in the manufacturing system is essential to achieve viable advantages, particularly during emergency conditions. Disasters, either man-made or natural, affect production and supply chains negatively with perilous effects. On the other hand, flexibility and resilience to manage the perpetuated risks in a manufacturing system are vital for achieving a controllable production rate. Still, these performances are strongly dependent on the multi-criteria decision making in the working environment with the policies launched during the crisis. Undoubtedly, health stability in a society generates ripple effects in the supply chain due to high demand fluctuation, likewise due to the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Incorporation of dependent demand factors to manage the risk from uncertainty during this pandemic has been a challenge to achieve a viable profit for the supply chain partners. A non-linear supply chain management model is developed with a controllable production rate to provide an economic benefit to the manufacturing firm in terms of the optimized total cost of production and to deal with the different situations under variable demand. The costs in the model are set as fuzzy to cope up with the uncertain conditions created by lasting pandemic. A numerical experiment is performed by utilizing the data set of the multi-stage manufacturing firm. The optimal results provide support for the industrial managers based on the proactive plan by the optimal utilization of the resources and controllable production rate to cope with the emergencies in a pandemic.","Alkahtani, Mohammed; Omair, Muhammad; Khalid, Qazi Salman; Hussain, Ghulam; Ahmad, Imran; Pruncu, Catalin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,337

Patients and Methods: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies comparing thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 among severe/non-survivors and non-severe/survivors from January 1, 2020 through July 11, 2020. Inclusion criteria: (1) hospitalized patients &#8805;18 years comparing severe/non-survivors vs. non-severe/survivors; (2) biomarkers of inflammation and/or thrombosis. A random-effects model was used to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the two groups of COVID-19 severity. Results: Seventy-five studies were included (17,052 patients). Patients with severe COVID-19/non-survivors were older, a greater proportion were men, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and COPD. The thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers were significantly higher in patients with severe disease including D-dimer (WMD 0.60, 0.49-0.71, I2=83.85%), fibrinogen (WMD 0.42, 0.18-0.67, I2=61.88%, p<0.001), CRP (WMD 35.74, 30.16-41.31, I2=85.27%), high sensitivity-CRP (WMD 62.68, 45.27-80.09, I2=0%), Interleukin-6 (WMD 22.81, 17.90-27.72, I2=90.42%) and, ferritin (WMD 506.15, 356.24-656.06, I2=52.02%). Moderate to significant heterogeneity was observed for all parameters. Sub-analysis based on disease severity, mortality, and geographic region of studies demonstrated similar inferences. Conclusions: Thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, Fibrinogen, CRP, hs-CRP, ferritin, and IL-6) and marker of end-organ damage (hs-Troponin I) are associated with increased severity and mortality in COVID-19 infection.","Chaudhary, Rahul; Garg, Jalaj; Houghton, Damon E; Murad, M Hassan; Kondur, Ashok; Chaudhary, Rohit; Wysokinski, Waldemar E; McBane, Robert D",,,337
232295,Mitigation effect of face shield to reduce SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission risk: Preliminary simulations based on computed tomography,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARÎ³ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.","Carboni, Elena; Carta, Anna R; Carboni, Ezio",Med Hypotheses,,337

We thus profiled the serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and specific memory B- and T-cell responses in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Altogether 119 samples from 88 convalescent donors who experienced mild to critical disease were tested for the presence of elevated anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibody levels over a period of eight months. In addition, level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, specific memory B- and T-cell responses were tested in a subset of samples. Findings: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in 85% of the samples collected within 4 weeks after onset of symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Levels of specific IgM/IgA antibodies declined after 1 month while levels of specific IgG antibodies and plasma neutralizing activities remained relatively stable up to 6 months after diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were still present, though at a significantly lower level, in 80% of the samples collected at 6-8 months after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B- and T-cell responses developed with time and were persistent in all patients followed up till 6-8 months. Conclusions: Our data suggest that protective adaptive immunity following natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 might persist for at least 6-8 months, regardless of disease severity. Development of medium or long-term protective immunity through vaccination might thus be possible.

This paper evaluates the design and progress of the report to mid 2020, but with some reflection on the new COVID 19 era, particularly as it relates to the expansion of entitlements to achieve UHC. The authors explore how close Sláintecare is to the UHC ideal. They also review the phased strategy of implementation in Sláintecare that utilises a systems-thinking approach with interlinkages between entitlements, funding, capacity and implementation. Finally the authors review the Sláintecare milestones against the reality of implementation since the publication of the report in 2017, cognisant of government policy and practice. Some of the initial assumptions around the context of Sláintecare were not realised and there has been limited progress made toward expanding entitlements, and certainly short of the original plan. Nevertheless there have been positive developments in that there is evidence that Government's Implementation Strategy and Action Plans are focussing on reforming a complex adaptive system rather than implementing a blueprint with such initiatives as integrated care pilots and citizen engagement. The authors find that this may help the system change but it risks losing some of the essential elements of entitlement expansion in favour of organisational change.","Thomas, Steve; Johnston, Bridget; Barry, Sarah; Siersbaek, Rikke; Burke, Sara",Health policy,,337

At the same time, the issues of the future world order and the restoration of the global economy are becoming more and more uncertain. The purpose of our study was to review the conceptual and practical approaches to substantiating the possibilities of postcrisis recovery of the global economy in the context of the continuing negative impact of the pandemic on international trade, capital flows and the development of the world financial system. The article reviews the materials of international economic organizations to assess the longterm economic consequences of the pandemic. The analysis shows that the main problem in assessing the possibilities for the recovery of the world economy is the existing heterogeneity in the degree of the pandemic's impact on individual sectors and economies of countries, as well as the differentiation and inconsistency of the applied economic policy instruments. In addition, it was found that the world retains a high potential for financial instability, and ""vaccine nationalism"" is getting worse. The main contradiction is the transboundary nature of the challenges to further economic development with a significant slowdown in globalization pro-cesses. The author considers the current pandemic to be one of the new global problems of the world economy, since its recovery in the current conditions is of an indefinite spasmodic nature, and there are also risks of a permanent slowdown in economic mobility. The solution to the key problem of economic growth - increasing productivity - is possible only with a clear understanding and planning of progress with inclusive vaccination, which is so far elusive. Although shortterm economic policy is a priority for governments, a wellcoordinated international agenda is needed at the global level to ensure the transition from income support to stimulating economic growth, as well as to overcome the existing structural imbalances and distortions in the system of economic relations between countries.","Smirnov, E.

Studies were selected from PubMed/MEDLINE and LILACS databases between December 2019 and May 17 2020, using the descriptors ""ECMO AND COVID-19"", ""Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation AND COVID-19"", ""ECLS AND COVID-19"", and ""Extracorporeal Life Support AND COVID-19"". Exclusion criteria were government epidemiological bulletins, comments, literature reviews, and articles without full access to content. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-three scientific productions were found, however only 18 did not met the exclusion criteria and could be included in this study, amouting to a total of 911 patients - 624 (68.5%) men, 261 (28.6%) women, and 26 (2.8%) without sex information. The mean age of the patients was 53.7 years. ECMO was necessary in 274 (30.1%) people (200 [73%] submitted to venovenous ECMO, nine [3.3%] to veno-arterial ECMO, and seven [2.5%] moved between these two types or needed a more specific ECMO according to the disease prognosis). Five studies did not specify the type of ECMO used, amounting 57 (20.8%) patients. Five patients (1.8%) were discharged, 77 (28.1%) died, 125 (45.6%) remained hospitalized until publication time of their respective studies, and 67 patients (24.4%) had no outcome information. CONCLUSION: It is evident that more research, covering larger populations, must be carried out in order to clearly elucidate the role of ECMO in the treatment of COVID-19.","Oliveira, Tatiana Farias de; Rocha, Carlos Alberto de Oliveira; Santos, Aisla Graciele Galdino Dos; Silva Junior, Luiz Carlos Francelino; Aquino, Saulo Henrique Salgueiro de; Cunha, Euclides José Oliveira da; Alcântara, Rafaela Campos; Mesquita, Rodrigo da Rosa; Arnozo, Gabriel Monteiro; Santana, Fernanda Mayara Santos; Silva Filho, Etvaldo Rodrigues da; Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire de",,,337

Therefore, preventative and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. Here, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from three convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using a SARS-CoV-2 stabilized prefusion spike protein. These antibodies had low levels of somatic hypermutation and showed a strong enrichment in VH1-69, VH3-30-3, and VH1-24 gene usage. A subset of the antibodies was able to potently inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at a concentration as low as 0.007 micrograms per milliliter. Competition and electron microscopy studies illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains multiple distinct antigenic sites, including several receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes as well as non-RBD epitopes. In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, the antibodies described here are promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.","Brouwer, Philip J M; Caniels, Tom G; van der Straten, Karlijn; Snitselaar, Jonne L; Aldon, Yoann; Bangaru, Sandhya; Torres, Jonathan L; Okba, Nisreen M A; Claireaux, Mathieu; Kerster, Gius; Bentlage, Arthur E H; van Haaren, Marlies M; Guerra, Denise; Burger, Judith A; Schermer, Edith E; Verheul, Kirsten D; van der Velde, Niels; van der Kooi, Alex; van Schooten, Jelle; van Breemen, Mariëlle J; Bijl, Tom P L; Sliepen, Kwinten; Aartse, Aafke; Derking, Ronald; Bontjer, Ilja; Kootstra, Neeltje A; Wiersinga, W Joost; Vidarsson, Gestur; Haagmans, Bart L; Ward, Andrew B; de Bree, Godelieve J; Sanders, Rogier W; van Gils, Marit J",Science,,337

We aim to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among healthcare workers and compare risk-factors between seropositive and seronegative HCWs. In this observational study, serum samples were collected from HCWs between July 13th to 26th, 2020 at Boston Medical Center (BMC). Samples were subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Participants also answered a questionnaire capturing data on demographics, history of COVID-19 symptoms, occupation, infection prevention and control measures. Overall, 95 of 1743 (5.5%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Of these, 1.8% of the participants had mild or no COVID-19 symptoms and did not require a diagnostic test. Seropositivity was not associated with gender, occupation, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) practices amongst HCWs. However, lack of physical distancing among health care workers in work areas and break room was associated with seropositivity (p = 0.05, p = 0.003, respectively). The majority of the HCWs are negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This data highlights the need to promote infection prevention measures, and the importance of distance amongst co-workers to help mitigate infection rates.","Kataria, Yachana; Cole, Manisha; Duffy, Elizabeth; de la Cena, Kyle; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M; Bouton, Tara C; Werler, Martha M; Pierre, Cassandra; Ragan, Elizabeth J; Weber, Sarah E; Jacobson, Karen R; Andry, Chris",Sci Rep,,337

METHODS: We conducted a prospective national-level data collection of patients treated with MT, ranging 45 days across epidemic containment measures instatement, and of patients treated during the same calendar period in 2019. The primary end point was the variation of patients receiving MT during the epidemic period. Secondary end points included care delays between onset, imaging, and groin puncture. To analyze the primary end point, we used a Poisson regression model. We then analyzed the correlation between the number of MTs and the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalizations, using the Pearson correlation coefficient (compared with the null value). RESULTS: A total of 1513 patients were included at 32 centers, in all French administrative regions. There was a 21% significant decrease (0.79; [95%CI, 0.76-0.82]; P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin puncture, overall (mean 144.9±SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.2±70.9; P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6±SD 82.0 minutes versus 153.25±67; P<0.001). After the instatement of strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the number of MT cases (R2 -0.51; P=0.04). Patients treated during the COVID outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to have unwitnessed strokes (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant decrease in patients treated with MTs during the first stages of the COVID epidemic in France and alarming indicators of lengthened care delays. These findings prompt immediate consideration of local and regional stroke networks preparedness in the varying contexts of COVID-19 pandemic evolution.","Kerleroux, Basile; Fabacher, Thibaut; Bricout, Nicolas; Moïse, Martin; Testud, Benoit; Vingadassalom, Sivadji; Ifergan, Héloïse; Janot, Kévin; Consoli, Arturo; Ben Hassen, Wagih; Shotar, Eimad; Ognard, Julien; Charbonnier, Guillaume; L039,; Allinec, Vincent; Guédon, Alexis; Bolognini, Federico; Marnat, Gaultier; Forestier, Géraud; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Pop, Raoul; Raynaud, Nicolas; Zhu, François; Cortese, Jonathan; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Berge, Jérome; Escalard, Simon; Boulouis, Grégoire",Stroke,,337

The risk factors associated with infection acquisition and mortality in transplant recipients using serological data has not been reported. METHODS: From 1725 maintenance transplant recipients, 855 consecutive patients were screened for SARS-CoV2 antibodies. Serological screening utilized assays to detect both the N protein and Receptor binding domain antibodies. 33/855 (3.9%) of the screened patients had prior infection confirmed with RT-PCR. 21 additional patients from our 1725 maintenance cohort with RT-PCR confirmed infection were included in our analysis. RESULTS: 89/855 (10.4%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 59/89 (66.3%) cases were patients newly identified as exposed, whilst 30/89 (33.7%) seropositive patients had previous infection confirmed by RT-PCR.A diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 (RT-PCR or Ab+) was associated with being from a noncaucasoid background, p=0.015; having a diagnosis of diabetes, p=0.028 and a history of allograft rejection, p<0.01. Compared with the RT-PCR+ cohort, patients with serological proven infection alone, were more likely to be receiving tacrolimus monotherapy, p<0.01 and less likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes, p=0.012.17/113 (15.0%) of all patients with infection (RT-PCR and/or Ab+) died. Risk factors associated with survival were older age, OR:1.07 (1.00-1.13), p=0.041; receiving prednisolone, OR:5.98 (1.65-21.60), p<0.01 and the absence of diabetes, OR:0.27 (0.07-0.99), p=0.047. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies risk factors and outcome for COVID-19 infection incorporating data on serologically defined infection, and highlights the important contribution of immunosuppression regimen on outcomes.","Willicombe, Michelle; Gleeson, Sarah; Clarke, Candice; Dor, Frank; Prendecki, Maria; Lightstone, Liz; Lucisano, Gaetano; McAdoo, Stephen; Thomas, David",Transplantation,,337

As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID­19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.","Jordan, Dominique; Guiu-Segura, Josep M; Sousa-Pinto, Gonçalo; Wang, Lin-Nam",Farm Hosp,,337

The presumed pathophysiological mechanism is air leak due to extensive diffuse alveolar damage followed by alveolar rupture. (2) Methods: We followed the occurrence of PM, PN, PP, and subcutaneous emphysema (SE) in 1648 patients hospitalized during the second outbreak of COVID-19 (October 2020-January 2021) in the main hospital of infectious diseases of our county and recorded their demographic data, laboratory investigations and clinical evolution. (3) Results: Eleven patients (0.66%) developed PM, with eight of them having associated PT, one PP, and seven SE, in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Eight patients (72.72%) died and only three (27.27%) survived. All subjects were nonsmokers, without known pulmonary pathology or risk factors for such complications. (4) Conclusions: pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and pneumopericardium are not so uncommon complications of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia, being observed mostly in male patients with severe forms and associated with prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis. In some cases, with mild forms and reduced pulmonary injury, the outcome is favorable, not requiring surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care stay.","Cut, Talida Georgiana; Tudoran, Cristina; Lazureanu, Voichita Elena; Marinescu, Adelina Raluca; Dumache, Raluca; Tudoran, Mariana",,,337

The state governments have chosen different measures to respond to the spread of the virus as there was no clear evidence on what the best way is to respond. In this paper, we gather the evidence of governments’ stringency measures and couple it with countries’ socio-economic data (including the amounting of tests that each country performed) to explore how they influenced the COVID-19 spread. We evaluated how well seven different regression models can predict the spread of the virus. The spread of the virus is expressed through the number of positively identified individuals as well as deaths reported due to the virus. For the prediction of the number of new cases, ElasticNet algorithm was the best performing, followed by Linear Regression and LASSO. LASSO algorithms predicted the best number of new deaths. The metrics used to evaluate were: R-squared score, Adjusted R-squared Score, mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The most effective measure was the stay-at-home measure followed by workplace and school closures.

This study investigates the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities in non-survivors of COVID-19 in a virtopsy framework. METHODS: In this prospective, monocentric, case series study, consecutive patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria benefited from an early postmortem structural brain MRI: death <24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest CT scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. RESULTS: Among the 62 patients who died of COVID-19 from March 31, 2020, to April 24, 2020, at our institution, 19 decedents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Parenchymal brain abnormalities were observed in 4 decedents: subcortical microbleeds and macrobleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES; 1 decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (1 decedent). Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Postmortem brain MRI demonstrates hemorrhagic and PRES-related brain lesions in non-survivors of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory impairment seems to be limited to olfactory bulbs. Brainstem MRI findings do not support a brain-related contribution to respiratory distress in COVID-19.","Coolen, Tim; Lolli, Valentina; Sadeghi, Niloufar; Rovai, Antonin; Trotta, Nicola; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Creteur, Jacques; Henrard, Sophie; Goffard, Jean-Christophe; Dewitte, Olivier; Naeije, Gilles; Goldman, Serge; De Tiège, Xavier",Neurology,,337

The aim of this study is the evaluation of temporal connection between SARS-CoV-2 positive tests (cases) and deaths in Italy in the first wave of the epidemic. METHODS: A temporal link between cases and deaths was determined by comparing their daily/weekly trends using surveillance data of the period March 2-June 2020. RESULTS: The monitoring of the cases/deaths evolution during the first wave of the outbreak highlights a striking correlation between infections of a certain week and deaths of the following one. We defined a weekly lethality rate that is virtually unchanged over the entire months of April and May until the first week of June (&#8776;13.6%). Due to the rather low number of cases/deaths, this parameter starts to fluctuate in the following three weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that the weekly lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the entire first wave of the epidemic, despite the progressive increase of the testing. As observed for the overall lethality, this parameter uniformly presents rather high values. The definition of a temporal link between cases and deaths will likely represent a useful tool for highlighting analogies and differences between the first and the second wave of the pandemic and for evaluating the effectiveness, even if partial, of the strategies applied during the ongoing outbreak.

We herein report specific considerations for cannulation configurations and ECMO management during the pandemic. High blood flow and anticoagulation at higher levels than usual practice for VV ECMO may be required because of thrombotic hematologic profile of COVID-19. Among our first 24 cases (48.8 ± 8.9 years), 17 patients were weaned from ECMO after a mean duration of 19.0 ± 10.1 days and 16 of them have been discharged from ICU.","Guihaire, Julien; Owyang, Clark G; Madhok, Jai; Laverdure, Florent; Gaillard, Maïra; Girault, Antoine; Lebreton, Guillaume; Mercier, Olaf",ASAIO J,,337
262894,The role of wastewater treatment plants as tools for SARS-CoV-2 early detection and removal,2020,"The world evolution of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2 or simply COVID-19) lead the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. The disease appeared in China in December 2019, and it spread fast around the world, specially in european countries like Italy and Spain. The first reported case in Brazil was recorded in February 26, and after that the number of cases growed fast. In order to slow down the initial grow of the disease through the country, confirmed positive cases were isolated to not transmit the disease. To better understand the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil, we apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health. Based on analyical and numerical results, as well on the data, the basic reproduction number is estimated to $R_{0}=5.25$. In addition, we estimate that the ratio unidentified infectious individuals and confirmed cases is about $10$, in agreement with previous studies. We also estimated the epidemic doubling time to be $2.72$ days.","Crokidakis, Nuno",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12150v1.pdf,337

Their job descriptions vary, which may lead to lack of clarity or preparedness regarding their roles and core tasks during a crisis such as COVID-19. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore hospital-employed healthcare researchers' experiences of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A qualitative design based on Graneheim and Lundman's latent content analysis of two focus groups with researchers in clinical practice was chosen to explore researchers' experiences of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Fifteen hospital researchers participated in two focus groups, divided into predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers. Focus groups were conducted in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the voice over IP service, Skype®, due to risk of contagion. FINDINGS: 'Searching for a new normal during the COVID-19 pandemic' was the main theme during the latent content interpretation, with subthemes of (i) balancing calm and insecurity, (ii) negotiating core tasks and (iii) considering the future. CONCLUSION: The 15 researchers tried to balance calm and insecurity within work and family, on standby for the hospital's contingency plan, and in their research tasks. This led them to negotiate their core tasks and to reflect on the changes and consequences for their positions as researchers in clinical practice in the future. SUMMARY STATEMENT: What is already known about this topic? During a major healthcare crisis, normal plans and procedures at hospitals are set aside. Working under unexpected and unsecure conditions may lead to postcrisis reactions. Researchers with nursing and allied health backgrounds, who are the first generation of these researchers at hospitals, do not have fully developed and recognized positions. What this paper adds?

The study is focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a trace gas which can be related to emissions from industrial activities, heating, and transportation. The investigation is based on in situ observations from local Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) and mobile remote sensing observations by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. We also show results of the NO2 vertical column measured by TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), a space instrument onboard of satellite mission Sentinel-5P, to complement local ground-based measurements. For in situ observations, the lockdown interval (23 March 2020-15 May 2020) was separated from normal periods. The decrease in local NO2 concentration during lockdown, measured in situ, is rather small, of about 10-40% at the most, is observed only at some stations, and is better seen during workdays than during weekends. We conclude that the decrease in NO2 content over Galati city during lockdown is relatively small and may be attributed to the reduction in local traffic, a consequence of special measures and restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 lockdown by the Romanian authorities.","RoÈu, Adrian; Constantin, Daniel-Eduard; Voiculescu, Mirela; Arseni, Maxim; RoÈu, Bogdan; Merlaud, Alexis; Van Roozendael, Michel; Georgescu, Puiu Lucian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,337
265148,SARS-CoV-2 strategically mimics proteolytic activation of human ENaC,2020,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical mediators of cell signaling. Although capable of activating G proteins in a monomeric form, numerous studies reveal a possible association of class A GPCRs into dimers/oligomers. The relative location of individual protomers within these GPCR complexes remains a topic of intense debate. We previously reported that class A serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and class C metabotropic glutamate 2 receptor (mGluR2) are able to form a GPCR heterocomplex. By introducing the photoactivatable unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (azF) at selected individual positions along the transmembrane (TM) segments of mGluR2, we delineate the residues that physically interact at the heteromeric interface of the 5-HT2AR-mGluR2 complex. We show that 5-HT2AR crosslinked with azF incorporated at the intracellular end of mGluR2's TM4, while no crosslinking was observed at other positions along TM1 and TM4. Together, these findings provide important insights into the structural arrangement of the 5-HT2AR-mGluR2 complex.","Shah, Urjita H; Toneatti, Rudy; Gaitonde, Supriya A; Shin, Jong M; González-Maeso, Javier",Cell Chem.

This study was carried out to ascertain Maltese healthcare workers' hesitancy to a novel COVID-19 vaccine and correlate this with influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS: A short, anonymous questionnaire was sent out to all of Malta's government sector healthcare workers via the service's standard email services (11-19/09/2020). A total of 9681 questionnaires were posted electronically, with 10.4% response. RESULTS: The proportion of Maltese healthcare workers who will take the influenza vaccine increased significantly. Doctors had the highest baseline uptake and highest likely influenza vaccine uptake next winter. The likely/undecided/unlikely to take a COVID-19 vaccine were 52/22/26% respectively. Males were likelier to take the vaccine. Doctors were the occupation with the highest projected vaccine uptake. Likelihood of taking COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to the likelihood of influenza vaccination. Concerns raised were related to insufficient knowledge about such a novel vaccine, especially unknown long term side effects. DISCUSSION: The increased uptake of influenza vaccine is probably due to increased awareness of respiratory viral illness. Doctors may have higher vaccine uptakes due to greater awareness and knowledge of vaccine safety. The proportions of who are likely/undecided/unlikely (half, quarter, quarter respectively) to take a COVID-19 are similar to rates reported in other countries. The higher male inclination to take the vaccine may be due the innate male propensity for perceived risk taking. Shared COVID-19 with influenza vaccine hesitancy implies an innate degree of vaccine reluctance/hesitancy and not merely reluctance based on novel vaccine knowledge gap.","Grech, Victor; Gauci, Charmaine; Agius, Steve",Early Hum Dev,,337

268266,SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Through Peripheral Nerves Explains Multiple Organ Injury,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented change in the apparent epidemiology of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, the interplay between this disease, changes in pollution, climate, and aversion to activation of emergency medical services represents a challenging conundrum. We aimed at appraising the impact of COVID-19, weather, and environment features on the occurrence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a large Italian region and metropolitan area. METHODS AND RESULTS: Italy was hit early on by COVID-19, such that state of emergency was declared on January 31, 2020, and national lockdown implemented on March 9, 2020, mainly because the accrual of cases in Northern Italy. In order to appraise the independent contribution on changes in STEMI and NSTEMI daily rates of COVID-19, climate and pollution, we collected data on these clinical events from tertiary care cardiovascular centers in the Lazio region and Rome metropolitan area. Multilevel Poisson modeling was used to appraise unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates for the daily incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI cases. The sample included 1448 STEMI and 2040 NSTEMI, with a total of 2882 PCI spanning 6 months. Significant reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI were evident already in early February 2020 (all p<0.05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures. Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (p<0.05). In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (p<0.05). Multi-stage and multiply adjusted models highlighted that reductions in STEMI were significantly associated with COVID-19 data (p<0.001), whereas changes in NSTEMI were significantly associated with both NO2 and COVID-19 data (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase.","Versaci, Francesco; Gaspardone, Achille; Danesi, Alessandro; Ferranti, Fabio; Mancone, Massimo; Mariano, Enrica; Rotolo, Francesco L; Musto, Carmine; Proietti, Igino; Berni, Andrea; Trani, Carlo; Sergi, Sonia Cristina; Speciale, Giulio; Tanzilli, Gaetano; Tomai, Fabrizio; Di Giosa, Alessandro; Marchegiani, Giada; Romagnoli, Enrico; Cavarretta, Elena; Carnevale, Roberto; Frati, Giacomo; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe",Int. j. cardiol,,337

One known platform that is relevant for the German hater community is Telegram, for which there have only been made limited research efforts so far. The goal of this study is to develop a broad framework that consists of (i) an abusive language classification model for German Telegram messages and (ii) a classification model for the hatefulness of Telegram channels. For the first part, we employ existing abusive language datasets containing posts from other platforms to build our classification models. For the channel classification model, we develop a method that combines channel specific content information coming from a topic model with a social graph to predict the hatefulness of channels. Furthermore, we complement these two approaches for hate speech detection with insightful results on the evolution of the hater community on Telegram in Germany. Moreover, we propose methods to the hate speech research community for scalable network analyses for social media platforms. As an additional output of the study, we release an annotated abusive language dataset containing 1,149 annotated Telegram messages.","Wich, Maximilian; Gorniak, Adrian; Eder, Tobias; Bartmann, Daniel; cCakici, Burak Enes; Groh, Georg",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07346v1.pdf,337

This work introduces an innovative and cost-effective approach to detect and quantify plastic substances in teabags by applying near infrared hyperspectral imaging (951-2496 nm) coupled with multivariate analysis. Teabags from 6 popular brands were investigated and categorized into three classes based on spectral unmixing and target detection results: 1) the plastic teabag primarily made of nylon 6/6; 2) those made of a composite with various polypropylene and cellulose ratios; 3) biodegradable teabags free from any plastic traces. Results demonstrated the presence of numerous plastic particles in the beverage obtained after steeping nylon teabags, but the release of particles was further amplified after microwave treatment. Nevertheless, target detection results obtained from Fourier transform infrared imaging (4000-675 cm-1) dataset evidenced that a considerable proportion of particle residues detected were the contaminants obtained from tea granules that adsorbed on the teabag.

Without effective treatments and with the increased risks of antiviral therapy for the elderly, this patient was given convalescent plasma. The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS: After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient. Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55 × 104 to 1.39 × 103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries. The successful treatment of this 100-year-old patient using convalescent plasma suggests that we should consider adding convalescent plasma in th management of the elderly.","Kong, Yujie; Cai, Chen; Ling, Li; Zeng, Li; Wu, Meihong; Wu, Yanyun; Zhang, Wei; Liu, Zhong",Transfus Apher Sci,,337

Increased knowledge is needed about the long-term consequences. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective follow-up study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU for respiratory organ support between March and July 2020. Patients with invasive ventilation were compared with those with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) regarding functional outcome and health-related qualify of life. The mean follow-up time was 5 months after ICU discharge and included clinical history, three well-validated questionnaires about health-related quality of life and psychological health, pulmonary function test, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and work ability. Data were analyzed with multivariable general linear and logistic regression models with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among 248 ICU patients, 200 patients survived. Of these, 113 patients came for follow-up. Seventy patients (62%) had received invasive ventilation. Most patients reported impaired health-related quality of life. Approximately one-third suffered from post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. Twenty-six percent had reduced total lung capacity, 34% had reduced 6MWT and 50% worked fulltime. The outcomes were similar regardless of ventilatory support, but invasive ventilation was associated with more bodily pain (MSD -19, 95% CI: -32 to -5) and <80% total lung capacity (OR 4.1, 95% CI: 1.3-16.5). CONCLUSION: Among survivors of COVID-19 who required respiratory organ support, outcomes 5 months after discharge from ICU were largely similar among those requiring invasive compared to non-invasive ventilation.","Schandl, Anna; Hedman, Anders; Lyngå, Patrik; Fathi Tachinabad, Sozan; Svefors, Jessica; Roël, Mari; Geborek, Anne; Andersson Franko, Mikael; Söderberg, Mårten; Joelsson-Alm, Eva; Darlington, Pernilla",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,337

281579,Virological and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2-infected children who develop neutralizing antibodies,2021,"Face masks have been widely used as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, pre-pandemic empirical studies have produced mixed statistical results on the effectiveness of masks against respiratory viruses. The implications of the studies' recognized limitations have not been quantitatively and statistically analyzed, leading to confusion regarding the effectiveness of masks. Such confusion may have contributed to organizations such as the WHO and CDC initially not recommending that the general public wear masks. Here we show that when the adherence to mask-usage guidelines is taken into account, the empirical evidence indicates that masks prevent disease transmission: all studies we analyzed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the studies in question would still have been unlikely to find a statistically significant effect. We also provide a framework for understanding the effect of masks on the probability of infection for single and repeated exposures. The framework demonstrates that more frequently wearing a mask provides super-linearly compounding protection, as does both the susceptible and infected individual wearing a mask. This work shows (1) that both theoretical and empirical evidence is consistent with masks protecting against respiratory infections and (2) that nonlinear effects and statistical considerations regarding the percentage of exposures for which masks are worn must be taken into account when designing empirical studies and interpreting their results.","Kollepara, Pratyush K.; Siegenfeld, Alexander F.; Taleb, Nassim Nicholas; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04882v2.pdf,337

The exact pathomechanism of stroke in COVID-19 remains ambiguous. The findings of previous studies indicate that the most likely underlying mechanisms are cerebrovascular pathological conditions following viral infection, inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability. Acute endothelial damage due to inflammation triggers a coagulation cascade, thrombosis propagation, and destabilization of atherosclerosis plaques, leading to large-vessel occlusion and plaque ulceration with concomitant thromboemboli, and manifests as ischemic stroke. Another possible mechanism is the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as the target action of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Acute stroke management protocols need to be modified during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to adequately manage stroke patients with COVID-19.","Rahmawati, Putu Lohita; Tini, Kumara; Susilawathi, Ni Made; Wijayanti, I A Sri; Samatra, Dpg Purwa",J Clin Neurol,,337

Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that vortical flow structures may enhance the settling distances of exhaled respiratory droplets beyond the two-meter distancing rule recommended by health authorities lately. We propose a mathematical framework to study the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the entrapment and subsequently delayed settling times of evaporating droplets and solid particles. A dipolar vortex is considered self-propelling through a cloud of micron-sized evaporating droplets. This configuration may represent a number of indoor and outdoor environments in which similar unsteady vortical flow structures may interact with exhaled respiratory droplets. % We demonstrate the vortex dipole effect on droplet and solid particles settling distances, depending on the evaporation rate, the vorticity of the dipole, and the droplet's initial diameter and location relative to the vortex core. % Our theoretical analysis reveals non-intuitive interactions between the vortex dipole, droplet relaxation time, gravity, and mass transfer. The existence of optimal conditions for maximum displacement is suggested, where the droplet entrainment reaches up to an order of magnitude larger than the vortex core length scale. % We present a basic model that may be applied for evaluating the spread of exhaled respiratory droplets in vortical environments. Our theoretical study suggests that exhaled respiratory droplets initially at rest can translate to significant distances, hence implying that vortical flow might enhance the transmission of airborne pathogens.","Avni, Or; Dagan, Yuval",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07068v1.pdf,337

This study analyzes the potential impact that seismic events may have on the infection rate within regions afflicted by both epidemics and earthquakes and explores open software packages that can be employed to simulate the impact of future destructive earthquakes on the spread of an emerging virus. Recent data on the number of confirmed cases at the national or subnational level were combined with a global seismic hazard and risk map to produce a combined index. This index highlights regions where preparedness and contingency plans should be developed to account for the possibility of COVID-19 outbreaks due to the earthquake impact.","Silva, Vitor; Paul, Nicole",Earthquake Spectra,,337

Here, using A549 human lung cells or BEAS-2B cells lunc cells, we show that the cell toxicity of BLM can be suppressed by addition of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a physiological polymer that accumulates and is released from platelets. BLM at a concentration of 20 µg ml-1 causes a decrease in cell viability (by ~70%), accompanied by an increased DNA damage and chromatin expansion (by amazingly 6-fold). Importantly, the BLM-caused effects on cell growth and DNA integrity are substantially suppressed by polyP. In parallel, the enlargement of the nuclei/chromatin in BLM-treated cells (diameter, 20-25 µm) is normalized to ~12 µm after co-incubation of the cells with BLM and polyP. A sequential application of the drugs (BLM for 3 days, followed by an exposure to polyP) does not cause this normalization. During co-incubation of BLM with polyP the gene for the BLM hydrolase is upregulated. It is concluded that by upregulating this enzyme polyP prevents the toxic side effects of BLM. These data might also contribute to an application of BLM in COVID-19 patients, since polyP inhibits binding of SARS-CoV-2 to cellular ACE2.","Müller, Werner E G; Neufurth, Meik; Wang, Shunfeng; Schröder, Heinz C; Wang, Xiaohong",,,337

We aim to describe the clinical characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 patients needing use assisted ventilation therapy. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 288 adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. We extracted and compared characteristics between patients using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or not. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with using CPAP therapy. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with CPAP therapy were older and had higher levels of white blood cells (WBC), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), D-dimer, but had lymphopenia. They were also more prone to appear bilateral pneumonia, develop into severe or critically severe cases, and receive ICU admission. Multivariate regression analysis showed that each 1-year increase in age (OR, 1.04; 95%CI, 1.01-1.08; P = 0.013), respiratory rate over 24 times per min (OR, 4.78; 95%CI, 1.08-13.17; P = 0.037), diarrhea (OR, 9.62; 95%CI, 1.57-18.31; P = 0.011), ALT greater than 50 U/L (OR, 6.59; 95%CI, 1.35-15.89; P = 0.003), WBC greater than 10×109/L (OR, 5.42; 95%CI, 2.04-14.75; P = 0.008), PCT greater than 0.05 ng/mL (OR, 7.22; 95%CI, 1.64-18.51; P = 0.018), and CRP greater than 10 mg/L (OR, 8.58; 95%CI, 2.28-20.36; P = 0.030) were risk factors for COVID-19 inpatients with assisted ventilation. CONCLUSION: The older age, tachypnea, and gastrointestinal infections showing as diarrhea, elevated ALT, and elevated white blood cells, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were risk factors for COVID-19 inpatients with assisted ventilation. Investigating and monitoring these factors could help clinicians identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage and take proactive assisted ventilation to benefit patients.","Lei, Ming; Qiu, Yue; Liu, Riguang; Fan, Lixin; Hu, KaiYuan; Lin, Liu; Cao, Jie; Qin, Shuguang; Lei, Chunliang; He, Feng",Liver transpl,,337

It is unknown whether this is due to a generalized humoral prothrombotic state or endothelial factors such as inflammation and dysfunction. The aim was to further characterize thrombin generation using a novel analyser (ST Genesia, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France) and a panel of haematological analytes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Platelet poor plasma of 34 patients with noncritical COVID-19 was compared with 75 patients with critical COVID-19 (as defined by WHO criteria) in a retrospective study by calibrated automated thrombography and ELISA. Patients were matched for baseline characteristics of age and gender. RESULTS: Critical patients had significantly increased fibrinogen, CRP, interleukin-6 and D-dimer compared to noncritical patients. Thrombin generation, in critical patients, was right shifted without significant differences in peak, velocity index or endogenous thrombin potential. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased in the critical versus noncritical patients. Critically ill patients were on haemodiafiltration (31%; heparin used in the circuit) or often received escalated prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin. CONCLUSION: These results confirm increased fibrinogen and D-dimer in critical COVID-19-infected patients. Importantly, disease severity did not increase thrombin generation (including thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2) when comparing both cohorts; counter-intuitively critical patients were hypocoaguable. tPA, TFPI and VEGF were increased in critical patients, which are hypothesized to reflect endothelial dysfunction and/or contribution of heparin (which may cause endothelial TFPI/tPA release).","White, Danielle; MacDonald, Stephen; Edwards, Tara; Bridgeman, Chris; Hayman, Megan; Sharp, Megan; Cox-Morton, Sally; Duff, Emily; Mahajan, Swati; Moore, Chloe; Kirk, Melissa; Williams, Richard; Besser, Martin; Thomas, Will",Int. j. lab. hematol,,337

Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid purification or reverse transcription, steps that have introduced supply bottlenecks into standard assay workflows. Our simplified protocol additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.","Credle, Joel J; Robinson, Matthew L; Gunn, Jonathan; Monaco, Daniel; Sie, Brandon; Tchir, Alexandra; Hardick, Justin; Zheng, Xuwen; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Rothman, Richard E; Eshleman, Susan H; Pekosz, Andrew; Hansen, Kasper; Mostafa, Heba; Steinegger, Martin; Larman, H Benjamin",Mod. pathol,,337

It is still unclear whether direct invasion of the nervous system by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 occurs;given the vast numbers of people infected at this point, this uncertainty suggests that nervous system infection is unlikely to represent a significant issue if it occurs at all.

HBV infection is another widely spread virus that chronically affects about 257 million people. The management of patients with HBV infection has gained attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 have varying levels of liver involvements, resulting from direct viral effects on the liver as well as hepatotoxic drugs. This was demonstrated by elevated levels of liver enzymes, particularly evident in those patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, scarce information is available on the management of COVID-19 patients having an underlying chronic liver disease, including HBV infection. Studies have shown reactivation of HBV infection following treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids, emphasizing the need for caution when using these agents to treat COVID-19 patients with HBV infection. HBV screening and prophylaxis should be considered in patients with elevated transaminase levels and also in high prevalence populations. In patients with advanced liver disease, attention must be given to minimize the risk of liver decompensation. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to enable an evidence-based approach for the care of these patients.","Alqahtani, S. A.; Buti, M.",Antiviral Therapy,,337
292042,Synergistic and Antagonistic Drug Combinations against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein D614G mutation became the predominant globally circulating variant after its emergence in the early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Studies showed that this mutation results in an open conformation of the S glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and increased angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and fusion, which result in an increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and infectivity. Dynamic tracking of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the D614G variant became predominant after emergence in Europe and North America, but not in China. The current absence of selective pressures from antiviral treatment suggests that the driving force for viral evolution could be variations in human population genetics. Results show that ACE2 expression is higher in Asian populations than that in European, North American, and African populations. This supports the idea that lower ACE2 expression is a driving force in the positive selection for the D614G mutation. This study suggests that the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation during the early-to-mid pandemic is associated with enhanced transmission efficiency in populations with lower ACE2 expression. Understanding the role that human genetic diversity plays in the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 may have an important impact on public health and measures to control the pandemic.","Huang, Szu-Wei; Miller, Sorin O; Yen, Chia-Hung; Wang, Sheng-Fan",,,337

A media coverage analysis compares the safety perceptions of visitors and non-visitors. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. Based on a content analysis of 204 news items related to safety incidents in Thailand, this paper divides the factors of safety perception into four dimensions. The quantitative data were gathered by self-administered questionnaires from 370 visitors who have previously visited Thailand and 407 potential visitors yet to visit Thailand. Findings: The results demonstrated significant differences in the safety perceptions of visitors and non-visitors, indicating non-visitors’ fear of uncertainty and intolerance of the exotic. The study also confirmed social-demographic characteristics influence destination safety perceptions. For non-visitors, safety issues tend to have a negative influence on future visit intention, but those with previous travel experience have less concerns. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide valuable insights to industry practice. More publicity campaigns within the Chinese media may reduce the spillover effects of crisis events and correct the potentially inaccurate images of disease and terrorism risk. Thai government is suggested to develop the Chinese inbound market, improve the quality of tourism infrastructure and standardisation and efficiency of tourism services. Originality/value: The media plays a significant role in destination image, tourist decision-making and safety measures imposed by governments. This study identified the factors influencing Chinese outbound tourists’ perceptions of safety in Thailand through an analysis of media coverage. The study provides a better understanding of the differences in safety perceptions between visitors and non-visitors to Thailand. The segmentation of visitors and non-visitors also may help destination managers to cater to differing expectations of safety. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Liu, X.; Li, Z.; Zhang, Q.; Zhang, Y.",Tourism Review,,337

Finding an antiviral drug or a vaccine is the only route for humans' survival against it. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has been confirmed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been widely regarded as a promising solution to combat harmful microorganisms. They are biologically active molecules produced by different organisms as an essential component of their innate immune response against invading pathogens. Lactoferrin (LF), one of the AMPs, is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is present in several mucosal secretions. The antiviral activity of LF exists against a wide range of human and animal viruses (DNA and RNA). LF was proven to increase the host immunity against viral infection. Since LF is one of the constituents of breast milk and significantly located at the mucosal layers of the human body, it is considered the first line of defense against microbial infection. LF was reported to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infection. The significant antiviral activity of LF makes it a potential option as an immunity enhancer, a drug or a drug conjugate with conventional antivirals. The affordability, environmental safety, and efficiency of LFs will make them superior to all other control strategies.","Elnagdy, Sherif; AlKhazindar, Maha",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,,337

Historically, programs were based on cervical cytology (i.e., ""Pap smear""), which had to be repeated often because of its limited sensitivity and reproducibility. In more recent years, the discovery of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the necessary cause of virtually all cervical cancers has led to the introduction of HPV testing into clinical practice, first as a triage test for minor cytologic abnormalities, then in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting), and most recently, as a standalone screening test. Multiple randomized trials have shown that HPV-based screening has higher sensitivity compared with cytology, providing great reassurance against cervical precancer and cancer for women testing HPV-negative for many years. Analyses have also been conducted in support of the recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines that show that primary HPV screening achieves the greatest balance of benefits and harms compared with other strategies. An added benefit of primary HPV testing is the ability to conduct it from self-collected samples, which is critical for extending coverage among hard-to-reach individuals and could provide a safe and effective alternative to in-person screening visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.See related article by Liang et al., p. 474.","Wentzensen, Nicolas; Clarke, Megan A",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,,337

Due to the difficulty of clinical decision-making during this period, our study group reviewed current literature focusing on the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. Despite the knowledge on this newly discovered virus which is constantly evolving, different pieces of evidence reported an association between COVID-19 and neurological symptoms like headache, dizziness, taste and smell disorders and complications involving the nervous system eventually triggered by the pathologic processes elicited by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that younger patients are less prone to develop severe forms of COVID-19. However, neurological signs have been reported in paediatric patients as well, and in some cases, the infection presented neurological sequelae. Furthermore, children with particular neurological diseases or treated with specific drugs (e.g. immune-suppressant therapies) must be carefully monitored during this pandemic. Neurologists should be aware of the main drug-drug interactions and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 treatments. Notably, adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which could be related either to the social strain or to the eventual neurotropic effects of the virus, which in other infections have been proven to promote the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Further, psychiatric population may be more vulnerable to the infection and at higher risk for adverse outcomes.","Orsini, Alessandro; Corsi, Martina; Santangelo, Andrea; Riva, Antonella; Peroni, Diego; Foiadelli, Thomas; Savasta, Salvatore; Striano, Pasquale",Neurol Sci,,337

This retrospective, multi-centre, noninterventional, case-control study identified patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection initiating (control) or not initiating (case) treatment at 43 sites in Germany from September 2017 to June 2018. It aimed to compare characteristics of the two patient populations and to identify factors involved in patient/physician decision to initiate/not initiate chronic hepatitis C virus treatment, with a particular focus on historical barriers. Overall, 793 patients were identified: 573 (72%) who received treatment and 220 (28%) who did not. In 42% of patients, the reason for not initiating treatment was patient wish, particularly due to fear of treatment (17%) or adverse events (13%). Other frequently observed reasons for not initiating treatment were in accordance with known historical barriers for physicians to initiate therapy, including perceived or expected lack of compliance (14.5%), high patient age (10.9%), comorbidities (15.0%), alcohol abuse (9.1%), hard drug use (7.7%), and opioid substitution therapy (4.5%). Patient wish against therapy was also a frequently reported reason for not initiating treatment in the postponed (35.2%) and not planned (47.0%) subgroups; of note, known historical factors were also common reasons for postponing treatment. Real-world and clinical trial evidence is accumulating, which suggests that such historical barriers do not negatively impact treatment effectiveness.

Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1-6). Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26-October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015-2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25-44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.","Rossen, Lauren M; Branum, Amy M; Ahmad, Farida B; Sutton, Paul; Anderson, Robert N",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,337

We aimed to describe the characteristics of children admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) presenting with MIS-C in comparison with those admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection with other features such as COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A multicentric prospective national registry including 47 PICUs was carried out. Data from children admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or fulfilling MIS-C criteria (with or without SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation) were collected. Clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features between MIS-C and non-MIS-C patients were compared. RESULTS: Seventy-four children were recruited. Sixty-one percent met MIS-C definition. MIS-C patients were older than non-MIS-C patients (p = 0.002): 9.4 years (IQR 5.5-11.8) vs 3.4 years (IQR 0.4-9.4). A higher proportion of them had no previous medical history of interest (88.2% vs 51.7%, p = 0.005). Non-MIS-C patients presented more frequently with respiratory distress (60.7% vs 13.3%, p < 0.001). MIS-C patients showed higher prevalence of fever (95.6% vs 64.3%, p < 0.001), diarrhea (66.7% vs 11.5%, p < 0.001), vomits (71.1% vs 23.1%, p = 0.001), fatigue (65.9% vs 36%, p = 0.016), shock (84.4% vs 13.8%, p < 0.001) and cardiac dysfunction (53.3% vs 10.3%, p = 0.001). MIS-C group had a lower lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and LDH (p = 0.001) but higher neutrophil count (p = 0.045), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and procalcitonin (p < 0.001). Patients in the MIS-C group were less likely to receive invasive ventilation (13.3% vs 41.4%, p = 0.005) but were more often treated with vasoactive drugs (66.7% vs 24.1%, p < 0.001), corticosteroids (80% vs 44.8%, p = 0.003) and immunoglobulins (51.1% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001). Most patients were discharged from PICU by the end of data collection with a median length of stay of 5 days (IQR 2.5-8 days) in the MIS-C group. Three patients died, none of them belonged to the MIS-C group. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C seems to be the most frequent presentation among critically ill children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C patients are older and usually healthy. They show a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and shock and are more likely to receive vasoactive drugs and immunomodulators and less likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-MIS-C patients.","García-Salido, Alberto; de Carlos Vicente, Juan Carlos; Belda Hofheinz, Sylvia; Balcells Ramírez, Joan; Slöcker Barrio, María; Leóz Gordillo, Inés; Hernández Yuste, Alexandra; Guitart Pardellans, Carmina; Cuervas-Mons Tejedor, Maite; Huidobro Labarga, Beatriz; Vázquez Martínez, José Luís; Gutiérrez Jimeno, Míriam; Oulego-Erróz, Ignacio; Trastoy Quintela, Javier; Medina Monzón, Carmen; Medina Ramos, Laura; Holanda Peña, María Soledad; Gil-Antón, Javier; Sorribes Ortí, Clara; Flores González, José Carlos; Hernández Palomo, Rosa María; Sánchez Ganfornina, Inma; Fernández Romero, Emilia; García-Besteiro, María; López-Herce Cid, Jesús; González Cortés, Rafael",Crit Care,,337

CASE PRESENTATION: A total of 11 COVID-19 patients were recruited in April, 2020, about one month on average after they were discharged from the hospital. All subjects received FMT for 4 consecutive days by oral capsule administrations with 10 capsules for each day. In total, 5 out of 11 patients reported to be suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, which were improved after FMT. After FMT, alterations of B cells were observed, which was characterized as decreased naive B cell (P = 0.012) and increased memory B cells (P = 0.001) and non-switched B cells (P = 0.012).The microbial community richness indicated by operational taxonomic units number, observed species and Chao1 estimator was marginally increased after FMT. Gut microbiome composition of discharged COVID-19 patients differed from that of the general population at both phylum and genera level, which was characterized with a lower proportion of Firmicutes (41.0%) and Actinobacteria (4.0%), higher proportion of Bacteroidetes (42.9%) and Proteobacteria (9.2%). FMT can partially restore the gut dysbiosis by increasing the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (15.0%) and reducing Proteobacteria (2.8%) at the phylum level. At the genera level, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium had significantly increased after FMT. CONCLUSIONS: After FMT, altered peripheral lymphocyte subset, restored gut microbiota and alleviated gastrointestinal disorders were observe, suggesting that FMT may serve as a potential therapeutic and rehabilitative intervention for the COVID-19.","Liu, Fengqiong; Ye, Shanliang; Zhu, Xin; He, Xuesong; Wang, Shengzhou; Li, Yinbao; Lin, Jiang; Wang, Jingsu; Lin, Yonggan; Ren, Xin; Li, Yong; Deng, Zhaoqun",J Med Case Rep,,337

302427,Trace Elements as Immunoregulators in SARS-CoV-2 and Other Viral Infections,2021,"Background: An outbreak of an unknown respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and was referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Soon after, it was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the respiratory tract with different outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe critical illness leading to death. Different SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging of which three have raised concerns worldwide due to their high transmissibility among populations. Objective: To study the prevalence of COVID-19 in the region of Nabatieh-South Lebanon during the past year and assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their effect on the spread of infection during times of lockdown. Methods: In our study, 37,474 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in suspected patients attending a tertiary health care center in South Lebanon during the period between 16 March 2020 and 21 February 2021. Results: The results demonstrated a variation in the prevalence rates ranging from less than 1% during full lockdown of the country to 8.4% upon easing lockdown restrictions and reaching 27.5% after the holidays and 2021 New Year celebrations. Interestingly, a new variant(s) appeared starting January 2021 with a significant positive association between the prevalence of positive tests and the percentage of the variant(s). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the lockdown implemented by the Lebanese officials was an effective intervention to contain COVID-19 spread. Our study also showed that lifting lockdown measures during the holidays, which allowed indoor crowded gatherings to occur, caused a surge in COVID-19 cases and rise in the mortality rates nationwide. More importantly, we confirmed the presence of a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) circulating in the Lebanese community from at least January 2021 onwards.","Noureddine, Fatima Y.; Chakkour, Mohamed El Roz Ali Reda Jana Al Sahily Reem Assi Ali Joma Mohamed Salami Hassan Hashem Sadek J.; Harb, Batoul Salami Ali Ghssein Ghassan",Medical Sciences,,337

Since viruses are highly dependent on the host small RNAs (microRNAs) for their replication and propagation, in this study, top miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome and top miRNAs targeting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, were predicted. Methods: All human mature miRNA sequences were acquired from miRBase database. MiRanda tool was used to predict the potential human miRNA binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. EdgeR identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from GEO147507 data. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and DEGs annotation analysis were performed using ToppGene and Metascape tools. Results: 160 miRNAs with a perfect matching in the seed region were identified. Among them, there was 15 miRNAs with more than three binding sites and 12 miRNAs with a free energy binding of -29 kCal/Mol. MiR-29 family had the most binding sites (11 sites) on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. MiR-21 occupied four binding sites and was among the top miRNAs that targeted up-regulated DEGs. In addition to miR-21, miR-16, let-7b, let-7e, and miR-146a were the top miRNAs targeting DEGs. Conclusion: Collectively, more experimental studies especially miRNA-based studies are needed to explore detailed molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the role of DEGs including STAT1, CCND1, CXCL-10, and MAPKAPK2 in SARS-CoV-2 should be investigated to identify the similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.","Jafarinejad-Farsangi, Saeideh; Jazi, Maryam Moazzam; Rostamzadeh, Farzaneh; Hadizadeh, Morteza",Noncoding RNA Res,,337

Previous studies indicated that microbiota could modulate immune response against pathogen infection. In the present study, we performed metagenomic sequencing of pharyngeal swabs from eleven patients with COVID-19 and eleven Non-COVID-19 patients who had similar symptoms such as fever and cough. Through metagenomic analysis of the above two groups and a healthy group from the public data, there are 6502 species identified in the samples. Specifically, the Pielou index indicated a lower evenness of the microbiota in the COVID-19 group than that in the Non-COVID-19 group. Combined with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the generalized linear model, eighty-one bacterial species were found with increased abundance in the COVID-19 group, where 51 species were enriched more than 8 folds. The top three enriched genera were Streptococcus, Prevotella and Campylobacter containing some opportunistic pathogens. More interestingly, through experiments, we found that two Streptococcus strains, S. suis and S. agalactiae, could stimulate the expression of ACE2 of Vero cells in vitro, which may promote SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, these enriched pathogens in the pharynxes of COVID-19 patients may involve in the virus-host interactions to affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and cause potential secondary bacterial infections through changing the expression of the viral receptor ACE2 and/or modulate the host's immune system.","Xiong, Dongyan; Muema, Caroline; Zhang, Xiaoxu; Pan, Xinming; Xiong, Jin; Yang, Hang; Yu, Junping; Wei, Hongping",Virol. sin.

304680,SARS-CoV-2 immunity: review and applications to phase 3 vaccine candidates,2020,"IMPORTANCE: The novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has been well described in adults. Further, the impact on older children and during the perinatal time is becoming better studied. As community spread increases, it is important to recognize that neonates are vulnerable to community spread as well. The impact that community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 has in the neonatal time period is unclear, as this population has unique immunity considerations. OBJECTIVE: To report on a case series of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates through community acquisition in the USA. DESIGN: This is an early retrospective study of patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) identified as having SAR-CoV-2 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. FINDINGS: Three patients who required admission to the NICU between the ages of 17 and 33 days old were identified. All 3 had ill contacts in the home or had been to the pediatrician and presented with mild to moderate symptoms including fever, rhinorrhea, and hypoxia, requiring supplemental oxygen during their hospital stay. One patient was admitted with neutropenia, and the other 2 patients became neutropenic during hospitalization. None of the patients had meningitis or multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infants with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 may require hospitalization due to rule-out sepsis guidelines if found to have fever and/or hypoxia. Caregivers of neonates should exercise recommended guidelines before contact with neonates to limit community spread of SARS-CoV-2 to this potentially vulnerable population, including isolation, particularly as asymptomatic cases become prevalent.","White, Alicia; Mukherjee, Priya; Stremming, Jane; Sherlock, Laura G; Reynolds, Regina M; Smith, Danielle; Asturias, Edwin J; Grover, Theresa R; Dietz, Robert M",Neonatology,,337

The Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix (VHM), developed by a WHO strategic advisory group of experts, can serve as an important tool to categorize vaccine hesitancy reasons reported in the JRF. We aimed to describe the reasons for vaccine hesitancy reported globally from 2014 to 2017 to ascertain trends over time and understand the comparability of using the VHM to classify hesitancy reasons from 2014 to 2016 based on previously published literature. We conducted a quantitative content analysis to code and categorize vaccine hesitancy reasons reported in the JRF from 2014 to 2017. Vaccine hesitancy trends were consistent from 2014 to 2017, where vaccine hesitancy reasons were mainly related to ""individual and group level influences"" (59%) followed by ""contextual influences"" (25%), and ""vaccine- or vaccination-specific issues"" (16%). Comparability of our approach to categorize vaccine hesitancy to the previously published JRF data showed that results were mostly but not entirely consistent. Major differences in categorizing vaccine hesitancy were noted between two specific reasons - ""experience with past vaccination"" (under ""individual and group influences"") and ""risk/benefit- scientific evidence"" (under ""vaccine and vaccination-specific issues""); this was usually due to lack of clear definitions in some sub-categories and generic responses reported in the JRF. The JRF hesitancy module may benefit from modifications to improve the data quality. Understanding global vaccine hesitancy is crucial and JRF can serve as an important tool, especially with the potential introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Kulkarni, Shibani; Harvey, Bonnie; Prybylski, Dimitri; Jalloh, Mohamed F",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,337

307627,Possible protective role of contact Lens against SARS COV 2,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Interest in digital mental health, especially smartphone apps, has expanded in light of limited access to mental health services and the need for remote care during COVID-19. Digital clinics, in which apps are blended into routine care, offer a potential solution to common implementation challenges including low user engagement and lack of clinical integration of apps. RECENT FINDINGS: While the number of mental health apps available in commercial marketplaces continues to rise, there are few examples of successful implementation of these apps into care settings. We review one example of a digital clinic created within an academic medical center and another within the Department of Veterans Affairs. We then discuss how implementation science can inform new efforts to effectively integrate mental health technologies across diverse use cases. Integrating mental health apps into care settings is feasible but requires careful attention to multiple domains that will influence implementation success, including characteristics of the innovation (e.g., utility and complexity of the app), the recipients of the technology (e.g., patients and clinicians), and context (e.g., healthcare system buy-in, reimbursement, and regulatory policies). Examples of effective facilitation strategies that can be utilized to improve implementation efforts include co-production of technology involving all end users, specialized trainings for staff and patients, creation of new team members to aid in app usage (e.g., digital navigators), and re-design of clinical workflows.","Connolly, Samantha L; Kuhn, Eric; Possemato, Kyle; Torous, John",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,337

Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can also be involved. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old man was hospitalised for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A rapid recovery of respiratory and general symptoms was observed after 1 week of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam plus teicoplanin). No GI symptoms were reported during hospitalisation, but a lung contrast-enhancement CT (CE-CT) excluding thromboembolism showed, as collateral finding, intraperitoneal free bubbles not present on a previous CT examination; the subsequent abdominal CE-CT described pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) involving the caecum and the right colon. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was started, and the 2-week follow-up CT showed the complete resolution of PI. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood. PI involving the caecum and right colon has been described for HIV and Cytomegalovirus infections, but, to our best knowledge, never before in COVID-19. We hypothesise a multifactorial aetiopathogenesis for PI, with a possible role of the bowel wall damage and microbiota impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we suggest a conservative management in the absence of symptoms.","Meini, Simone; Zini, Chiara; Passaleva, Maria Teresa; Frullini, Anna; Fusco, Francesca; Carpi, Roberto; Piani, Fiorella",,,337

Much attention has focused on how to resolve pressing issues surrounding resource allocation and competing public health ethics. While these are important discussions, the legal and ethical dilemmas of treatment decisions remain highly critical. The urgency to ensure that life and death affairs are in order is magnified due to the possibility of becoming infected with Covid-19. However, many people continue to face challenges in organising their future medical care and treatment. This article explores how the pandemic affects advance care planning through the lenses of law and ethics. The range of Covid-19 implications on advance care planning demonstrates a paradigm shift from a primarily elective function to an essential role in healthcare delivery. This renewed appreciation to advance care planning offers the opportunity to support and sustain the important role that it could play during ordinary and extraordinary times.","Chan, Hui Yun",Eur J Health Law,,337

312176,Single-shot Ad26 vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques,2020,"Federated learning (FL) involves multiple distributed devices jointly training a shared model without any of the participants having to reveal their local data to a centralized server. Most of previous FL approaches assume that data on devices are fixed and stationary during the training process. However, this assumption is unrealistic because these devices usually have varying sampling rates and different system configurations. In addition, the underlying distribution of the device data can change dynamically over time, which is known as concept drift. Concept drift makes the learning process complicated because of the inconsistency between existing and upcoming data. Traditional concept drift handling techniques such as chunk based and ensemble learning-based methods are not suitable in the federated learning frameworks due to the heterogeneity of local devices. We propose a novel approach, FedConD, to detect and deal with the concept drift on local devices and minimize the effect on the performance of models in asynchronous FL. The drift detection strategy is based on an adaptive mechanism which uses the historical performance of the local models. The drift adaptation is realized by adjusting the regularization parameter of objective function on each local device. Additionally, we design a communication strategy on the server side to select local updates in a prudent fashion and speed up model convergence. Experimental evaluations on three evolving data streams and two image datasets show that \model~detects and handles concept drift, and also reduces the overall communication cost compared to other baseline methods.","Chen, Yujing; Chai, Zheng; Cheng, Yue; Rangwala, Huzefa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00151v1.pdf,337

313024,Evidence and implications of pre-existing humoral cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Concussion is a global health concern. Despite its high prevalence, a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of diffuse brain injury remains elusive. It is, however, well established that concussions cause significant functional deficits; that children and youths are disproportionately affected and have longer recovery time than adults; and that individuals suffering from a concussion are more prone to experience additional concussions, with each successive injury increasing the risk of long term neurological and mental health complications. Currently, the most significant challenge in concussion management is the lack of objective, clinically- accepted, brain-based approaches for determining whether an athlete has suffered a concussion. Here, we report on our efforts to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network that is able to distinguish between non-concussed and acute post-concussed adolescent athletes using only short (i.e. 90 s long) samples of resting state EEG data as input. The athletes were neither required to perform a specific task nor expected to respond to a stimulus during data collection. The acquired EEG data were neither filtered, cleaned of artefacts, nor subjected to explicit feature extraction. The LSTM network was trained and validated using data from 27 male, adolescent athletes with sports related concussion, benchmarked against 35 non-concussed adolescent athletes. During rigorous testing, the classifier consistently identified concussions with an accuracy of > 90% and achieved an ensemble median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC/AUC) equal to 0.971. This is the first instance of a high-performing classifier that relies only on easy-to-acquire resting state, raw EEG data. Our concussion classifier represents a promising first step towards the development of an easy-to-use, objective, brain-based, automatic classification of concussion at an individual level.","Thanjavur, Karun; Babul, Arif; Foran, Brandon; Bielecki, Maya; Gilchrist, Adam; Hristopulos, Dionissios T; Brucar, Leyla R; Virji-Babul, Naznin",Sci Rep,,337
313281,"SUMO pathway, blood coagulation and oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 infection",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 462,417 deaths worldwide. A large number of patients with severe COVID-19 face death in hospital. Hospice care is truly a philosophy of care that delivers patient-centred care to the terminally ill and their families. Hospice care could provide many benefits for patients, families, and for hospice caregivers. The aim of this study is to investigate hospice care self-efficacy and identify its predictors among Chinese clinical medical staff in COVID-19 isolation wards of designated hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. The Hospice Care Self-Efficacy, Self-Competence in Death Work Scale, Positive Aspects of Caregiving, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaires were administered between February and April 2020. A total of 281 eligible medical staff responded to the questionnaires, with a response rate of &#8805;78.9%. RESULTS: The mean score of hospice care self-efficacy was 47.04 (SD = 7.72). Self-efficacy was predicted by self-competence in death work (B = 0.433, P < 0.001), positive aspects of caregiving (B = 0.149, P = 0.027), positive coping (B = 0.219, P < 0.001), giving hospice care to dying or dead patients before fighting against COVID-19 (B = -1.487, P = 0.023), occupational exposure while fighting against COVID-19 (B = -5.244, P = 0.004), holding respect for life and professional sentiment as motivation in fighting against COVID-19 (B = 2.372, P = 0.031), and grade of hospital employment (B = -1.426, P = 0.024). The variables co-explained 58.7% variation of hospice care self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Clinical nurses and physicians fighting COVID-19 reported a moderate level of hospice care self-efficacy during this pandemic. Exploring the traditional Chinese philosophy of life to learn from its strengths and make up for its weaknesses and applying it to hospice care may provide a new framework for facing death and dying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuous hospice care education to improve self-competence in death work, taking effective measures to mobilize positive psychological resources, and providing safer practice environments to avoid occupational exposure are also essential for the improvement of the hospice care self-efficacy of clinical nurses and physicians. These measures help caregivers deal effectively with death and dying while fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Ze-Hong; Luo, Zhong-Chen; Zhang, You; Chan, Wallace Chi Ho; Li, Jian-Qiong; Pang, Jin; Jia, Yu-Ling; Tang, Jiao",BMC Palliat Care,,337

313843,How will the SARS CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic affect the Boreal summer?,2020,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, including children. In recent years, it has become clear that hospitalization and critical illness bestow an increased VTE risk in pediatrics and relate to mortality and life-limiting comorbidities. For critically ill children, reported rates of VTE vary by study sampling techniques, presence of inherited or acquired thrombophilia, acute and chronic immobility, underlying illness prompting hospitalization, and clinical factors related to illness severity such as central venous catheterization, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and patient age. Accordingly, critically ill children with new signs of venous congestion, acute inflammation, or unexplained acute organ dysfunction should be routinely evaluated for VTE. This narrative review summarizes recent and historical literature regarding risk factors, prevention, presentation, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in critically ill children. In addition, we identify knowledge gaps and priorities for future collaborative research on this vital condition. Special attention is given to the clinical trial opportunities, challenges, and ongoing efforts in thromboprophylaxis in critically ill children, including those hospitalized for disease related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and multisystem inflammatory disease in children.","Sochet, Anthony A; Kiskaddon, Amy; Betensky, Marisol; Goldenberg, Neil",Semin. thromb. hemost,,337

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.

Among nurses in Turkey, we want to explore how anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation affect nurses' quality of life. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (COVID-19 EQLS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-1 and STAI-2), psychological health, and social isolation among nurses. It also aimed to identify whether the influence of trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation are stronger than the direct influence of state anxiety on nurses' quality of life during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design and STROBE guidelines were implemented. In this study, 638 nurses in Turkey were included using simple random sampling. The participants completed the STAI-1 and STAI-2 and COVID-19 EQLS online-form. The parallel-serial mediation model was used to examine the relationships between the determined variables. RESULTS: Psychological health, psychological effects of social isolation, and trait anxiety fully mediated the relationship between state anxiety and quality of life of nurses. The total indirect effect of the confidence interval of bootstrapping was statistically different from zero.

We tested this research question with publicly available data on COVID-19 deaths in the United States as of May 5, 2020 and found that states with women governors had fewer COVID-19 deaths compared to states with men governors. Governor sex also interacted with early stay-at-home orders; states with women governors who issued these orders early had fewer deaths compared to states with men governors who did the same. To provide insight into psychological mechanisms of this relationship, we conducted a qualitative analysis of governor briefings that took place between April 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020 (251 briefings, 38 governors, 1.2 million words). Compared to men, women governors expressed more empathy and confidence in their briefings. Practical implications are discussed.

315579,COMMENTARY ON VIEWPOINT: THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SARS-CoV-2 AND ACE2MAY HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR SKELETAL MUSCLE VIRAL SUSCEPTIBILITY AND MYOPATHIES,2020,"During this period of COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of medical equipment (like ventilators) leads to complications arising in the medical field. A low-cost ventilator seems to be an alternative substitute to fill the lacking. This paper presents a numerical analysis for predicting the delivered parameters of a low-cost mechanical ventilator. Based on several manufactured mechanical ventilators, two proposed designs are investigated in this study. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is used for solving any problems with the first design, and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis with moving boundary is used for solving any issues with the second design. For this purpose, ANSYS Workbench platform is used to solve the set of equations. The results showed that the Ambu-bag-based mechanical ventilator exhibited difficulties in controlling ventilation variables, which certainly will cause serious health problems such as barotrauma. The mechanical ventilator based on piston-cylinder is more satisfactory with regards to delivered parameters to the patient. The ways to obtain pressure control mode (PCM) and volume control mode (VCM) are identified. Finally, the ventilator output is highly affected by inlet flow, length of the cylinder, and piston diameter.","El-Hadj, Abdellah Kezrane Mohamed Ahmad Hijaz Ameur Houari Bin Abd Rahim S.

PURPOSE: Study 1: Determine the time point where total blood volume and serum sodium were elevated following saline consumption. Study 2: Examine the BP response to isometric handgrip (HG) and the cold pressor test (CPT) following saline consumption. METHODS: Study 1: Eight participants drank 423 mL of normal saline (sodium 154 mmol/L) and had blood draws every 30 min for 3 h. Study 2: Sixteen participants underwent two randomized data collection visits; a control and experimental visit 90 min following saline consumption. Participants underwent 2 min of isometric HG, post exercise ischemia (PEI), and CPT. RESULTS: Study 1: Total blood volume (3.8 ± 3.0 &#916;%) and serum sodium (3.5 ± 3.6 &#916;%) were elevated (P < 0.05) by the 90 min time point. Study 2: There were no differences in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during HG (EXP: 17.4 ± 8.2 &#916;mmHg; CON: 19.1 ± 6.0 &#916;mmHg), PEI (EXP: 16.9 ± 11.7 &#916;mmHg; CON: 16.9 ± 7.8 &#916;mmHg), or the CPT (EXP: 20.3 ± 10.8 &#916;mmHg; CON: 20.9 ± 11.7 &#916;mmHg) between conditions (P > 0.05).

317084,Assessing the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021,"We introduce Bi-GNN for modeling biological link prediction tasks such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) and protein-protein interaction (PPI). Taking drug-drug interaction as an example, existing methods using machine learning either only utilize the link structure between drugs without using the graph representation of each drug molecule, or only leverage the individual drug compound structures without using graph structure for the higher-level DDI graph. The key idea of our method is to fundamentally view the data as a bi-level graph, where the highest level graph represents the interaction between biological entities (interaction graph), and each biological entity itself is further expanded to its intrinsic graph representation (representation graphs), where the graph is either flat like a drug compound or hierarchical like a protein with amino acid level graph, secondary structure, tertiary structure, etc. Our model not only allows the usage of information from both the high-level interaction graph and the low-level representation graphs, but also offers a baseline for future research opportunities to address the bi-level nature of the data.","Bai, Yunsheng; Gu, Ken; Sun, Yizhou; Wang, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14002v1.pdf,337

Yet, presently air pollution levels have dropped primarily attributable across the nation lockdown forced in the wake of the novel Coronavirus outbreak. In this study, we have attempted to establish a conceivable relationship between Covid 19 and PM10-2.5, obtained from eleven airquality monitoring stations in Chennai city, India for both Pre and during Covid situations and its influence over Covid positive cases. The observations of the materials (+ve cases, PM 10, PM 2.5) collected proved that during precovid regime less polluted areas are indicated with less than 5 infection cases reflecting the healthy people and they are less vulnerable to covid except the few occurrence of foreign source indicating no community spread whereus most polluted spots of precovid regimes are indicated with more than 90 % cases and indicated that people in pollution zones are succumbed to get infected quickly. However, during Covid the lockdown has considerably reduced the particulate suspension and the results revealed that the +ve cases are of the nature of community spreading through primary and secondary contacts as reported from the media. If Covid is a visible, brutally virulent, incredibly contagious pandemic that kills rapidly and mercilessly, air pollution is its unseen evil twin.

PURPOSE: The study aims to examine the ethical sensitivity levels of physicians and nurses working in surgical units during the Covid-19 pandemic and the associating factors. METHOD: The sample of this cross-sectional online questionnaire-based study consists of 161 healthcare workers working at the surgical units in Turkish hospitals. The data were collected using the ""Nurse Descriptive Information Form"" developed by the researchers and the ""Ethical Sensitivity Questionnaire."" ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Approval was granted by the ethics committee. Verbal and written consent was received from the healthcare workers. RESULTS: Ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict was found to be higher in healthcare workers who had ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, who were married, who were nurses, who worked more than 45 h, and who had a work experience of 7-10 years (p < 0.05). Healthcare workers with a family member diagnosed with Covid-19 had high ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict (p = 0.008), while those who reported being fully competent and ready (p = 0.038) about Covid-19 were found to have low ethical sensitivity. Besides, those who experienced inadequate supplies (p = 0.045), long working hours (p = 0.038), and problems in asepsis-sterilization (p = 0.046) during the Covid-19 pandemic were found to have low sensitivity in the holistic approach dimension. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge-skills about Covid-19, and the problems encountered in the work environment during the pandemic affect the ethical sensitivity of healthcare workers in the dimensions of conflict and holistic approach. Therefore, it is recommended that governments and all healthcare workers, and stakeholders in the health system in our country and other countries take action to promote ethical sensitivity in response to the rapidly increasing epidemic by considering the factors that adversely affect ethical sensitivity.","Mert, Selda; Sayilan, Aylin Aydin; Karatoprak, Ayfer Peker; Baydemir, Canan",Nurs Ethics,,337
320132,Cold atmospheric plasma inactivation of aerosolized microdroplets containing bacteria and purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA to contrast airborne indoor transmission,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The outbreak of COVID-19 has vastly increased the operational burden on healthcare systems worldwide. For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multicenter study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the quadripartite equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium-sized liver transplant centers from 12 countries across 4 continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a ""sickest-first"" approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - recipient outcome, donor/graft safety, waiting list mortality and healthcare resources - for 7 countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems. LAY SUMMARY: There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise that models these ethical tensions and can guide the regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems.","Chew, Claire Alexandra; Iyer, Shridhar Ganpathi; Kow, Alfred Wei Chieh; Madhavan, Krishnakumar; Wong, Andrea Sze Teng; Halazun, Karim J; Battula, Narendra; Scalera, Irene; Angelico, Roberta; Farid, Shahid; Buchholz, Bettina M; Rotellar, Fernando; Chan, Albert Chi-Yan; Kim, Jong Man; Wang, Chih-Chi; Pitchaimuthu, Maheswaran; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Soin, Arvinder Singh; Derosas, Carlos; Imventarza, Oscar; Isaac, John; Muiesan, Paolo; Mirza, Darius F; Bonney, Glenn Kunnath",J Hepatol,,337

Nevertheless, the assessment of clinical performances of available tests is urgently required as their use has just been initiated for diagnose. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of three immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Two automated immunoassays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG/IgA assays) and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19) were tested. 293 specimens were analyzed from patients with a positive RT-PCR response, from patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but exhibiting a negative response to the RT-PCR detection test, and from control group specimens. Days since symptoms onset were collected from clinical information sheet associated with respiratory tract samples. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for IgG was equivalent (around 80 %) for CLIA, ELISA and LFIA. Sensitivity for IgG detection, >14 days after onset of symptoms, was 100.0 % for all assays. Overall specificity for IgG was greater for CLIA and LFIA (more than 98 %) compared to ELISA (95.8 %). Specificity was significantly different between IgA ELISA (78.9 %) and IgM LFIA (95.8 %) (pâ¯<â¯0.05). The best agreement was observed between CLIA and LFIA assays (97 %; kâ¯=â¯0.936). CONCLUSION: Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained >14 days after onset of symptoms for all immunoassays. Specificity was also excellent for IgG CLIA and IgG LFIA.

AIM OF THE STUDY: This work assessed the prevalence of self-medication with medicinal plants and the prevalence of the concomitant use of prescribed psychiatric drugs and medicinal plants for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression during the Covid-19 lockdown in Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The suspected adverse reactions associated with drug-herb interactions were assessed. The factors associated with self-medication, the concomitant use of herb-drug combinations, and the presence of adverse reactions due their combined use is also reported. The study was descriptive and cross-sectional using an online questionnaire conducted among population with symptoms associated with anxiety and depression (n = 2100) from seven states of central-western Mexico. RESULTS: The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655-2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609-531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (n = 104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [p = 0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404-6.486)]. CONCLUSION: Health professionals should be aware if their patients concomitantly use medicinal plants and psychiatric drugs. Public health campaigns should promote the possible adverse reactions that might produce the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations for mental illnesses.","Alonso-Castro, Angel Josabad; Ruiz-Padilla, Alan Joel; Ortiz-Cortes, Miriam; Carranza, Eleazar; Ramírez-Morales, Marco Antonio; Escutia-Gutiérrez, Raymundo; Ruiz-Noa, Yeniley; Zapata-Morales, Juan Ramon",J Ethnopharmacol,,337

The papain-like protease domain (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) is indispensable for viral replication and represents a putative target for pharmacological intervention. In this work, we describe the development of a potent and selective SCoV2 PLpro inhibitor, 19. The inhibitor not only effectively blocks substrate cleavage and immunosuppressive function imparted by PLpro, but also markedly mitigates SCoV2 replication in human cells, with a submicromolar IC50. We further present a convenient and sensitive activity probe, 7, and complementary assays to readily evaluate SCoV2 PLpro inhibitors in vitro or in cells. In addition, we disclose the co-crystal structure of SCoV2 PLpro in complex with a prototype inhibitor, which illuminates their detailed binding mode. Overall, these findings provide promising leads and important tools for drug discovery aiming to target SCoV2 PLpro.","Shan, Hengyue; Liu, Jianping; Shen, Jiali; Dai, Jialin; Xu, Gang; Lu, Kuankuan; Han, Chao; Wang, Yaru; Xu, Xiaolong; Tong, Yilun; Xiang, Huaijiang; Ai, Zhiyuan; Zhuang, Guanglei; Hu, Junhao; Zhang, Zheng; Li, Ying; Pan, Lifeng; Tan, Li",Cell Chem.

325236,Receptor utilization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) indicates a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2 than that of SARS-CoV,2020,"Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the powerful metabolic and functional supporting abilities for inflammatory diseases, may be an effective therapeutic strategy for acute liver failure (ALF). However, the efficacy of MSCs can still be promoted if pretreatment is applied to enhance their poor migration towards the damaged liver. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of IL-1ß pretreatment on the efficacy and homing ability of MSCs in ALF. Methods: MSCs were isolated by the whole bone marrow adherence method and characterized. The efficacy and homing ability of IL-1ß-pretreated MSCs (Pre-MSCs) were examined in a rat ALF model and compared with that of MSCs and normal saline. Then, Western blot was performed to detect the c-Met and CXCR4 expression of MSCs and Pre-MSCs and followed by flow cytometry to detect the meaningful indicators. Finally, the migration abilities of different cells and different conditions were tested by the Transwell migration assay. Results: MSCs of ideal purity were successfully isolated and cultured. Comparing with MSCs, Pre-MSCs had significantly better efficacy on improving the survival rate and liver function of ALF rats. Further analyses of damaged liver tissues showed that IL-1ß pretreatment significantly enhanced the efficacy of MSCs on suppressing liver necrosis. Besides, Pre-MSCs exhibited better effects in inhibiting apoptosis and activating proliferation. The results of tracing experiments with CM-Dil-labeled cells confirmed that more cells migrated to the damaged liver in the Pre-MSC group. In terms of mechanism, the CXCR4 expression was significantly enhanced by IL-1ß pretreatment, and an increased migration ability towards SDF-1 that could be reversed by AMD3100 was found in Pre-MSCs. Conclusion: IL-1ß pretreatment could enhance the homing ability of MSCs at least partially by increasing the expression of CXCR4 and further improve the efficacy of MSCs on ALF.","Nie, He; An, Fangmei; Mei, Jie; Yang, Cheng; Zhan, Qiang; Zhang, Qinglin",Stem Cells Int,,337
325369,The Secretive Liaison of Particulate Matter and SARS-CoV-2. A Hypothesis and Theory Investigation,2020,"The coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense ssRNA genome, possess helical symmetry, and belongs to the family Coronaviridae. They cause mild to lethal respiratory tract infections in both mammals and birds. The more pathogenic coronaviruses cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The recent coronavirus outbreak was first discovered in December 2019. Subsequently, the disease has been declared as a pandemic by The World Health Organization (WHO). The virus is named Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease is now called COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease 2019]. The primary route of the virus spread between people is through close contact where a healthy person inhales the respiratory droplets from an infected person either by cough or sneezing. More than 2 million confirmed cases are reported globally. The US has the world's largest number of COVID-19 cases followed by European countries. As of April 18, 2020, 2 074 529 confirmed, and 139 378 deaths were reported. Presently, there is no specific drug or vaccine that is approved to treat SARS-CoV-2. The practice of hygienic measures such as frequent hand wash, use of masks, and social distancing would prevent the spread of the disease. This review focuses on a brief description of the viral structure and its multiplication, epidemiology and therapeutics with a special mention on the nanotechnology approach to combat covid-19. This review describes briefly the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure and its multiplication, epidemiology and therapeutics.","Ajmera, S.; Bommanna, R.

325951,Assessment of automated high-throughput serological assays for prediction of high-titer SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody,2021,"In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, society can benefit from various natural language processing applications, such as dialog medical diagnosis systems and information retrieval engines calibrated specifically for COVID-19. These applications rely on the ability to measure semantic textual similarity (STS), making STS a fundamental task that can benefit several downstream applications. However, existing STS datasets and models fail to translate their performance to a domain-specific environment such as COVID-19. To overcome this gap, we introduce CORD19STS dataset which includes 13,710 annotated sentence pairs collected from COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) challenge. To be specific, we generated one million sentence pairs using different sampling strategies. We then used a finetuned BERT-like language model, which we call Sen-SCI-CORD19-BERT, to calculate the similarity scores between sentence pairs to provide a balanced dataset with respect to the different semantic similarity levels, which gives us a total of 32K sentence pairs. Each sentence pair was annotated by five Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) crowd workers, where the labels represent different semantic similarity levels between the sentence pairs (i.e. related, somewhat-related, and not-related). After employing a rigorous qualification tasks to verify collected annotations, our final CORD19STS dataset includes 13,710 sentence pairs.","Guo, Xiao; Mirzaalian, Hengameh; Sabir, Ekraam; Jaiswal, Aysush; Abd-Almageed, Wael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02461v1.pdf,337

We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. The majority of patients with COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), or a body mass index >30 with normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared with non-diabetics. Severe COVID-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, preDM, and obesity. COVID-19 is associated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.","Smith, Stephen M; Boppana, Avinash; Traupman, Julie A; Unson, Enrique; Maddock, Daniel A; Chao, Kathy; Dobesh, David P; Brufsky, Adam; Connor, Ruth I",J Med Virol,,337

METHODS: Participants were 670 young adult cohort members (ages 21-29) of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018 who participated in the C-EAT study (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time). RESULTS: Among the sample, 84% (n = 561) reported pandemic-related changes to their mood or stress and 33% (n = 221) reported changes to their substance use. Linear regression analyses identified several meaningful risk factors for higher psychological distress during the pandemic, including female gender, White race, higher pre-pandemic depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and lower pre-pandemic stress management ability. A thematic analysis further identified five major themes related to changes in stress and mood following the COVID-19 outbreak describing specific emotional reactions, stress related to the direct impact of the pandemic as well as interpersonal connectedness and economic factors, and strategies for managing stress. In addition, two major themes were identified related to substance use during the pandemic detailing specific changes in and motivations for substance use. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to develop effective, scalable, and rapidly deployable public health resources that target the stressors commonly experienced among young adults to improve their psychological wellbeing during this pandemic.","Emery, Rebecca L; Johnson, Sydney T; Simone, Melissa; Loth, Katie A; Berge, Jerica M; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Soc Sci Med,,337

We observed that the virus maintains a low preference for 'GGG' codon for glycine (3%) in its genome. We also observed multiple putative introns of 26-44 nucleotide (nt) length in the genomic region between the coding regions of Nsp10 and RPol in the viral ORF1ab, like several other beta-coronaviruses of similar infectivity levels. It appears that the virus employs a dual strategy to ensure unhindered replication within the host. One of the strategies employ a (- )1 frameshift translation event through programmed ribosomal slippage at the ribosomal slippage site in the ORF1ab. The alternate strategy relies on intron excision to generate a read through frame. The presence of 'GGG' in this conserved ribosomal slippage site ensures adequate tRNA in cytoplasm to match the codon, implying no additional frameshift translation due to ribosomal stalling. With fewer replication events, viral load remains low and resulting in asymptomatic cases. We suggest that this strategy is the primary reason for the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in the disease, enabling the virus to spread rapidly.","Priyadarshi, Himanshu; Das, Rekha",Theory biosci.

Undoubtedly, reports of the skyrocketing global spread of COVID-19 has shocked people globally, from Japan to the United States. Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that the fatality rate due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units. Because COVID-19 is completely new to the human immune system, many throughout the world are likely vulnerable to becoming sick after their initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus. While our knowledge about carriers and their virus shedding is deficient, some studies modelling the viral transmission have considered the potential contribution of the asymptomatic carriers. Protocols for managing asymptomatic cases, for example for controlling them to restrict their contact with healthy people at public places or private residences, have not been established. In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed. Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention, or being diagnosed as carriers. Thus, managing the asymptomatic subjects, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while the pandemic is looming.","Rahimi, Farid; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",Travel Med Infect Dis,,337

This descriptive-correlational study investigated the factors influencing the readiness in online teaching and learning as an alternative delivery mode to continue the teaching-learning process, even the absence of face-to-face interactions between teachers and students. The content-validated and researchers-made online survey instrument, which reported an excellent reliability index of Cronbach α = 0.95, was administered via a google form. Responses from 348 faculty and 7,205 students at the university were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency count, percent, mean, and standard deviation. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to determine the significant predictors of respondent readiness. The results revealed that respondent familiarity and capability, preparation, device and access connectivity, self-efficacy, and experience with technology significantly influence their readiness on the conduct of online teaching and learning modality. It is concluded that faculty and student readiness on online teaching and learning is determined by their competence, accessibility of ICT tool, preparedness, confidence in their ability to use technology, and exposure to e-learning materials. Hence, the university and in the broader scope, the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd), may conduct series of training for teachers as a capacity building to equip them with knowledge and competencies on the use of flexible or blended learning. Further, a university-wide learning system may be designed, adopted, and implemented in case the Enhanced Community Quarantine will not be lifted for a longer period.","Callo, Eden C.; Yazon, Alberto D.",Yakugaku Zasshi,,337

338499,Digital CRISPR/Cas‐Assisted Assay for Rapid and Sensitive Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2,2020,"Following the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak, number of studies have been conducted to curtail the global spread of the virus by identifying epidemiological changes of the disease through developing statistical models, estimation of the basic reproduction number, displaying the daily reports of confirmed and deaths cases, which are closely related to the present study. Reliable and comprehensive estimation method of the epidemiological data is required to understand the actual situation of fatalities caused by the epidemic. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is one of the cardinal epidemiological parameters that adequately explains epidemiology of the outbreak of a disease. In the present study, we employed two statistical regression models such as the linear and polynomial models in order to estimate the CFR, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria (44â¯days since first reported COVID-19 death). The estimate of the CFR was determined based on cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths reported from 23 March to 30 April 2020. The results from the linear model estimated that the CFR was 3.11% (95% CI: 2.59-3.80%) with R 2 value of 90% and p-value of <0.0001. The findings from the polynomial model suggest that the CFR associated with the Nigerian outbreak is 3.0% and may range from 2.23 to 3.42% with R 2 value of 93% and p-value of <0.0001. Therefore, the polynomial regression model with the higher R 2 value fits the dataset well and provides better estimate of CFR for the reported COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.","Suleiman, Ahmad Abubakar; Suleiman, Aminu; Abdullahi, Usman Aliyu; Suleiman, Suleiman Abubakar",,,337

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to develop clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures and accompanying photoguides to aid in the assessment of AA-related eyebrow, eyelash and nail signs/symptoms. METHODS: Iterative rounds of qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with US expert dermatologists and North American patients with AA. Patients with eyebrow, eyelash and nail involvement were purposefully sampled. Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Dermatologists (n = 10) described eyebrow and eyelash loss as concerning for affected patients and, along with nail appearance, as deserving assessment. Dermatologist data informed the development of single item, 4-point Likert-type ClinRO and PRO measures of current eyebrow loss, eyelash loss and nail appearance and a PRO measure of eye irritation. Patients (n = 45, age 15-72 years) confirmed the importance and relevance of these signs/symptoms. Interim revision resulted in measures that were understood by and relevant to patients. Dermatologists (n = 5) and patients (n = 10, age 21-54 years) participated in the development of the eyebrow, eyelash and nail photoguides and confirmed that they included photos that appropriately represented different severity levels and were helpful to derive and standardize ratings across raters. CONCLUSIONS: The ClinRO and PRO measures for eyebrow, eyelash and nail appearance, with their accompanying photoguides and the PRO Measure for Eye Irritation provide clear and meaningful assessments of outcomes important to patients with AA.","Wyrwich, Kathleen W; Kitchen, Helen; Knight, Sarah; Aldhouse, Natalie V J; Macey, Jake; Nunes, Fabio P; Dutronc, Yves; Mesinkovska, Natasha; Ko, Justin M; King, Brett A",Am. j. clin. dermatol,,337

Multiple modalities are often involved when we express emotions, whether we do so explicitly (e.g., facial expression, speech) or implicitly (e.g., text, image). Enabling machines to have emotional intelligence, i.e., recognizing, interpreting, processing, and simulating emotions, is becoming increasingly important. In this tutorial, we discuss several key aspects of multi-modal emotion recognition (MER). We begin with a brief introduction on widely used emotion representation models and affective modalities. We then summarize existing emotion annotation strategies and corresponding computational tasks, followed by the description of main challenges in MER. Furthermore, we present some representative approaches on representation learning of each affective modality, feature fusion of different affective modalities, classifier optimization for MER, and domain adaptation for MER. Finally, we outline several real-world applications and discuss some future directions.","Zhao, Sicheng; Jia, Guoli; Yang, Jufeng; Ding, Guiguang; Keutzer, Kurt",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10152v1.pdf,337

All patients need to be examined for COVID-19, including in digestive surgery emergency cases. In this paper, we report four digestive surgery emergency cases with clinical and radiological findings similar to COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: We report four digestive surgery emergency cases admitted with fever and cough symptoms. Case 1 is a 75-year-old male with gastric perforation and pneumonia, case 2 is a 32-year-old female with intestinal and pulmonal tuberculosis, case 3 is a 30-year-old female with acute pancreatitis with pleuritis and pleural effusion, and the last case is a 56-year-old female with rectosigmoid cancer with pulmonal metastases. All the patients underwent emergency laparotomy, were hospitalized for therapy, and discharged from the hospital. After 1-month follow-up after surgery, 1 patient had no complaints, 2 patients had surgical site infection, and 1 patient died because of ARDS due to lung metastases. DISCUSSION: For all four cases, the surgeries were done with strict COVID-19 protocol which included patient screening, examination, laboratory assessment, rapid test screening, and RT-PCR testing. There were no intrahospital mortalities and all the patients were discharged from the hospital. Three patients were followed-up and recovered well with 2 patients having surgical site infection which recovered within a week. However, 1 patient did not show up for the scheduled follow-up and was reported dead 2 weeks after surgery because of ARDS due to lung metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency surgery, especially digestive surgery cases, can be done in the COVID-19 pandemic era with strict prior screening and examination, and safety protocol.","Handaya, Adeodatus Yuda; Andrew, Joshua; Hanif, Ahmad Shafa; Fauzi, Aditya Rifqi",Int J Surg Case Rep,,337

Multiscale protocols have been developed to simulate flavivirus envelopes in close accordance with biophysical data, in particular derived from cryo-electron microscopy, enabling high-resolution refinement of their structures and elucidation of the conformational changes associated with adaptation both to host environments and to immunological factors such as antibodies. Likewise, integrative modelling efforts combining data from biophysical experiments and from genome sequencing with chemical modification are providing unparalleled insights into the architecture of the previously unresolved nucleocapsid complex.

The capacity of the virus to destroy the host cell by liberating its own DNA or RNA and replicating inside the host cell poses challenges in the development of antiviral therapeutics. In recent years, many new technologies have been explored for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections. Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising technologies on account of its ability to deal with viral diseases in an effective manner, addressing the limitations of traditional antiviral medicines. It has not only helped us to overcome problems related to solubility and toxicity of drugs, but also imparted unique properties to drugs, which in turn has increased their potency and selectivity toward viral cells against the host cells. The initial part of the paper focuses on some important proteins of influenza, Ebola, HIV, herpes, Zika, dengue, and corona virus and those of the host cells important for their entry and replication into the host cells. This is followed by different types of nanomaterials which have served as delivery vehicles for the antiviral drugs. It includes various lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid-polymer hybrid-based, carbon-based, inorganic metal-based, surface-modified, and stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials and their application in antiviral therapeutics. The authors also highlight newer promising treatment approaches like nanotraps, nanorobots, nanobubbles, nanofibers, nanodiamonds, nanovaccines, and mathematical modeling for the future.

355156,Welchen Effekt hat SARS-CoV-2 auf die Darmmikrobiota?,2021,"A little over a year after the official announcement from the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic consequences globally. Today, millions of doses of vaccines have already been administered in several countries. However, the positive effect of these vaccines will probably be seen later than expected. In these circumstances, the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 still remains the only way to slow the spread of this virus. However, it is difficult to predict whether a person is infected or not by COVID-19 while relying only on apparent symptoms. In this context, we propose to use machine learning (ML) algorithms in order to diagnose COVID-19 infected patients more effectively. The proposed diagnosis method takes into consideration several symptoms, such as flu symptoms, throat pain, immunity status, diarrhea, voice type, body temperature, joint pain, dry cough, vomiting, breathing problems, headache, and chest pain. Based on these symptoms that are modelled as ML features, our proposed method is able to predict the probability of contamination with the COVID-19 virus. This method is evaluated using different experimental analysis metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The obtained experimental results have shown that the proposed method can predict the presence of COVID-19 with over 97% accuracy.","Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Shafique, Arslan; Khalid, Sohail; Driss, Maha; Rubaiee, Saeed",Sensors (Basel),,337

In addition to our social, occupational, and personal lives, the new coronavirus also poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact with personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of preexisting skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of the COVID-19 infection so that dermatologists are aware of the skin complications and preventive measures can be taken in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Darlenski, Razvigor; Tsankov, Nikolai",Clin.

These extracellular vesicles also have a cell-free innate antiviral action through attacking and degrading viruses. We further generated the induced versions of Ex/Mv through prior viral exposure to NSCs and found that these induced Ex/Mv were stronger than basal Ex/Mv in reducing the infection of these viruses, suggesting the involvement of an adaptive immunity-like antiviral function. These NSC Ex/Mv were found to be characterized by producing large libraries of piRNAs against genomes of various viruses, and some of these piRNAs were enriched during the adaptive immunity-like reaction, possibly contributing to the antiviral effects of these Ex/Mv. In conclusion, NSC Ex/Mv have antiviral immunity and could potentially be developed to combat against various viruses.","Yu, Bin; Ikhlas, Shoeb; Ruan, Chunsheng; Zhong, Xingxing; Cai, Dongsheng",iScience,,337
357506,Linear epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicit neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients,2020,"We propose Narrowest Significance Pursuit (NSP), a general and flexible methodology for automatically detecting localised regions in data sequences which each must contain a change-point, at a prescribed global significance level. Here, change-points are understood as abrupt changes in the parameters of an underlying linear model. NSP works by fitting the postulated linear model over many regions of the data, using a certain multiresolution sup-norm loss, and identifying the shortest interval on which the linearity is significantly violated. The procedure then continues recursively to the left and to the right until no further intervals of significance can be found. The use of the multiresolution sup-norm loss is a key feature of NSP, as it enables the transfer of significance considerations to the domain of the unobserved true residuals, a substantial simplification. It also guarantees important stochastic bounds which directly yield exact desired coverage probabilities, regardless of the form or number of the regressors. NSP works with a wide range of distributional assumptions on the errors, including Gaussian with known or unknown variance, some light-tailed distributions, and some heavy-tailed, possibly heterogeneous distributions via self-normalisation. It also works in the presence of autoregression. The mathematics of NSP is, by construction, uncomplicated, and its key computational component uses simple linear programming. In contrast to the widely studied""post-selection inference""approach, NSP enables the opposite viewpoint and paves the way for the concept of""post-inference selection"".

357925,Effective Immune Functions of Micronutrients against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BackgroundThe humoral immune response after primary immunisation with a SARS-CoV-2 vector vaccine (AstraZeneca AZD1222, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Vaxzevria) followed by an mRNA vaccine boost (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2; Moderna, m-1273) was examined and compared with the antibody response after homologous vaccination schemes (AZD1222/AZD1222 or BNT162b2/BNT162b2). MethodsSera from 59 vaccinees were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and virus-neutralising antibodies (VNA) with four IgG assays, a surrogate neutralisation test (sVNT), and a Vero cell-based neutralisation test (cVNT) using the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC; alpha) as antigen. Investigation was done before and after heterologous (n=31 and 42) or homologous booster vaccination (AZD1222/AZD1222, n=8/9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n=8/8). After the second immunisation, 26 age and gender matched sera (AZD1222/mRNA, n=9; AZD1222/AZD1222, n=9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n=8) were also tested for VNA against VOC B.1.617.2 (delta) in the cVNT. The strength of IgG binding to separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by avidity. ResultsAfter the first vaccination, prevalence of IgG directed against (trimeric) SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) varied from 55-95 % (AZD1222) to 100% (BNT162b2), depending on the vaccine used and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used. The booster vaccination resulted in 100 percent seroconversion and appearance of highly avid IgG as well as VNA against VOC B.1.1.7. The results of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests showed an excellent correlation to the VNA titres against this VOC. The agreement of cVNT and sVNT results was good. However, the sVNT seems to overestimate non and weak B.1.1.7-neutralising titres. The mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and B.1.1.7-neutralising titres were significantly higher after heterologous vaccination compared to the homologous AZD1222 scheme. If VOC B.1.617.2 was used as antigen, significantly lower mean VNAs were measured in the cVNT, and three (33.3%) vector vaccine recipients had a VNA titre <1:10. ConclusionsThe heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to a strong antibody response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and VNA titres at a level comparable to that of a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination scheme. Irrespectively of the chosen immunisation regime, highly avid IgG antibodies can be detected just two weeks after the second vaccine dose indicating the development of a robust humoral immunity. The observed reduction in the VNA titre against VOC B.1.617.2 is remarkable and may be attributed to a partial immune escape of the delta variant.","Rose, Ruben; Neumann, Franziska; Grobe, Olaf; Lorentz, Thomas; Fickenscher, Helmut; Krumbholz, Andi",,,337
357926,Effective Immune Functions of Micronutrients against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress, uncertainty, and adversity that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress and adversity related to COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents' mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress and COVID-19 family adversity. Approximately 4 years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19, family adversity related to COVID-19, and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or HRV augmentation, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Conversely, lower resting HRV indicated vulnerability to the effect of COVID-19 family adversity on emotional problems. Different patterns of parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress versus vulnerability to the effects of COVID-19 family adversity on mental health during the pandemic.","Miller, Jonas G; Chahal, Rajpreet; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S; Ho, Tiffany C; Gifuni, Anthony J; Gotlib, Ian H",Dev Psychopathol,,337

In addition, we report about COVID-19 in health workers in Malaysia. Claims for occupational diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are recorded separately in a database of the Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in the Health and Welfare Services (BGW). This database is analyzed according to its content as of May 22, 2020. In addition, the notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections from personnel in medical institutions (e.g., clinics and doctor's office) and social welfare institutions (e.g., nursing homes, shelters and refugee camps) following the German Infection Protection Act are analyzed. The report from Malaysia is based on personal experience and publications of the government. In Germany at present, 4398 suspected case reports for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections among health and social workers have been filed. This figure is four times the number of all reported infections normally received per year. The majority of claims, regardless of being a confirmed infection, concerned nurses (n = 6927, 63.9%). The mortality rate for workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 0.2% to 0.5%. Doctors are affected by severe illness more frequently than other occupational groups (8.1% vs. 4.1%). In Malaysia, work-related infection of health workers (HW) occurred mainly when COVID-19 was not suspected in patients and no adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn. Although knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among workers remains limited, the impact appears to be substantial. This is supported by the mortality rate among infected workers. Occupational health check-ups carried out at the present time should be systematically analyzed in order to gain more information on the epidemiology of COVID-19 among HW. Since the supply and use of PPE improved, the infection risk of HW in Malaysia seems to have decreased.","Nienhaus, Albert; Hod, Rozita",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,337

The pandemic forces us to ask questions about political leadership–about how successful political programmes appear to be, as well as the rationalities underpinning them. I will focus upon the latter and find the Norwegian government to have initially articulated a liberal rationality that was later replaced by a biopolitical one. The former entails perceiving the pandemic as a phenomenon to be handled through a laissez-faire approach, by leaving things free to run their natural course. The latter revolves around discarding this liberalism in favour of an interventionist approach that restricts freedoms and economic progress in favour of safeguarding the health of the population. I investigate the links between the laissez-faire discourse and the government’s initial hesitation, as well as the biopolitical discourse and the draconian measures and contradictions between these two approaches.","Gjerde, Lars Erik Løvaas",Eur.

If efficacy is demonstrated, the treatment of placebo volunteers becomes an issue. For COVID-19 vaccine trials, there is broad consensus that placebo volunteers should be offered a vaccine once efficacy has been established. This will likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine arm, thus complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the VE profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy profile. We only require that the VE profile applies to the newly vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards regression model and explore via simulation the implications of placebo crossover for estimation of VE under different efficacy dynamics and study designs. We apply our methods to simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials with durable and waning VE and a total follow-up of 2 years.","Fintzi, J.; Follmann, D.",Statistics in Medicine,,337

363853,Occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intraocular milieu,2020,"A critical situation pushes human behaviour towards different directions with some aspects of behaviour being irrevocable. COVID-19 pandemic is not a normal crisis, and to control the spread of disease various measures were taken including complete and then partial lockdown. Since all elements of the economy are intricately interrelated with public health measures and lockdown, this resulted in economic instabilities of the nations hinting towards change in market dynamics. In every market, consumers are the drivers of the market competitiveness, growth and economic integration. With economic instability, consumers are also experiencing a transformation in behaviour, though how much of transformation experienced during the crisis will sustain is a question. This article looks at the consumer behaviour during COVID-19 crisis and in the subsequent lockdown period when the world stood still for more than a quarter of a year. Further, the article attempts to weave through the maze of literature available about consumer behaviour in normal times and in crisis times, strengthens it with the rapid assessment reports culled out by the different consulting organisations during lockdown phase, substantiates the same with first-hand telling and retelling of experiences by consumers and professionals with marketing background to bring up a hypothesis of the pandemic affecting a paradigm shift from consumer materialism to consumer spiritualism. The proposition offers further testable hypotheses for future research to understand consumer sentiments or requirement in buying ‘what is enough’ within the marketing context and how it can be reinforced post-COVID crisis for ensuring sustainability of business models. It would also be interesting to explore the correlates of this forced consumer behaviour with other variables such as learning from crisis, changing needs, personality, nationality, culture, new market segment and age to develop new models of consumer behaviour.","Mehta, Seema; Saxena, Tanjul; Purohit, Neetu",J.

Methods: A prospective cohort study enrolled 30 lactating women who received an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine between January and April 2021. Women provided serial milk samples, which included milk expressed before vaccination, milk expressed across 2-3 weeks after the first dose, and milk expressed across 3 weeks after the second dose. Women also were asked to provide their blood, spotted on cards (dried blood spots; DBS) 19 days after the first dose and 21 days after the second dose. Stool samples from the breastfed infants were collected 21 days after mothers received their second dose. Pre-pandemic samples of milk, DBS cards, and infant stool from prior studies were also utilized. Milk and infant stool samples were tested by ELISA for receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA and IgG. Milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the spike and four variants of concern (VOCs): D614G, B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P.1 (gamma). Milk samples were also tested by electrochemiluminescence assay for levels of 10 cytokines. Results: Milk from COVID-19-immunized women neutralized the spike and four VOCs and this response is primarily IgG-driven. The immune response in milk also included significantly elevated levels of interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}). The immune response to maternal vaccination was reflected in breastfed babies; anti-RBD IgG and anti-RBD IgA was detected in 33% and 30% of infant stool samples, respectively. Levels of anti-RBD antibodies in infant stool correlated with maternal vaccine side-effects. Conclusion: Humoral and cellular immune responses to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination are present in the breastmilk of most women. The milk anti-RBD antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike and VOCs. Importantly, we describe for the first time the transfer of anti-RBD antibodies to breastfed infants, with the potential to confer passive immunity against SARS-CoV-2","Narayanaswamy, Vignesh; Pentecost, Brian; Schoen, Corina N; Alfandari, Dominique; Schneider, Sallie S; Baker, Ryan; Arcaro, Kathleen F",,,337

METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on face-to-face and telemedicine interactions was conducted at a multisite health care system from January to August 2020 in vascular surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end point is direct patient satisfaction comparison between face-to-face and telemedicine encounters/interactions prior and during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 6262 patient encounters from January 1, 2020, to August 6, 2020. Of the total encounters, 790 (12.6%) were via telemedicine, which were initiated on March 11, 2020, after the World Health Organization's declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. These telemedicine encounters were readily adopted and embraced by both the providers and patients and remain popular as an option to patients for all types of visits. Of these patients, 78.7% rated their overall health care experience during face-to-face encounters as very good and 80.6% of patients rated their health care experience during telemedicine encounters as very good (P = .78). CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented consequences to the practice of medicine and specifically of vascular surgery, our multisite health care system has been able to swiftly adapt and adopt telemedicine technologies for the care of our complex patients.

METHODS: A putative ARDS-suppressing drug Keguan-1 was first developed and then evaluated by a randomized, controlled two-arm trial. The two arms of the trial consist of a control therapy (alpha interferon inhalation, 50 µg twice daily; and lopinavir/ritonavir, 400 and 100 mg twice daily, respectively) and a testing therapy (control therapy plus Keguan-1 19.4 g twice daily) by random number table at 1:1 ratio with 24 cases each group. After 2-week treatment, adverse events, time to fever resolution, ARDS development, and lung injury on newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients were assessed. RESULTS: An analysis of the data from the first 30 participants showed that the control arm and the testing arm did not exhibit any significant differences in terms of adverse events. Based on this result, the study was expanded to include a total of 48 participants (24 cases each arm).

370889,SARS-CoV-2 Targeting the Retina: Host-virus Interaction and Possible Mechanisms of Viral Tropism,2020,"KEY MESSAGE: Enhanced bioactive JA (JA-Ile) accumulation in OsJAZ9 overexpressing rice helps plants tolerate K deficiency. Potassium (K) represents up to 10% of the plant's total dry biomass, and its deficiency makes plants highly susceptible to both abiotic and biotic stresses. K shortage results in the inhibition of root and shoots growth, but the underlying mechanism of this response is unclear. Our RNA-Seq and qPCR analysis suggested leading roles for JA pathway genes under K deficiency in rice. Notably, K deficiency and JA application produced similar phenotypic and transcriptional responses. Here, we integrated molecular, physiological and morphological studies to analyze the role of OsJAZ9 in JA homeostasis and K deficiency responses. We raised OsJAZ9 over-expression, knockdown, transcriptional reporter, translational reporter and C-terminal deleted translational reporter lines in rice to establish the role of JA signaling in K ion homeostasis. JA profiling revealed significantly increased JA-Ile levels in OsJAZ9 OE lines under K deficiency. Furthermore, we established that OsJAZ9 overexpression and knockdown result in K deficiency tolerance and sensitivity, respectively, by modulating various K transporters and root system architecture. Our data provide evidence on the crucial roles of OsJAZ9 for improving K deficiency tolerance in rice by altering JA levels and JA responses.","Singh, Ajit Pal; Pandey, Bipin K; Mehra, Poonam; Heitz, Thierry; Giri, Jitender",Plant mol. biol,,337

Many older drugs are being investigated for repurposing against COVID-19. We comment on various drugs currently undergoing such trials to optimize their safe use. COMMENT: We describe medications used during early COVID-19 outbreaks in South Korea, focusing on practice aspects including the method of drug administration, drug formulation, patient-monitoring for adverse reactions and drug interactions informed by our experience during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We comment on hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir with zinc supplement, remdesivir, tocilizumab, ciclesonide, niclosamide and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Effective therapies are urgently needed to manage COVID-19, and existing drugs such as antivirals and antimalarials are under investigation for repurposing to meet this need. This process requires up-to-date drug information to ensure optimum use, particularly safety and efficacy profiles of the medications, until convincing evidence is reported.","Kang, Ji Eun; Rhie, Sandy Jeong",J. clin. pharm. ther,,337
374250,An Urgent Need for Studies of the Late Effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the Cardiovascular System,2020,"BACKGROUND: Drug costs are increasing in Europe, and there is a heightened need to reduce pressure on healthcare systems. In 2017, oncology, autoimmune disease, and diabetes featured as the three highest therapy areas for drug spend in the EU-28. However, the absolute 1-year drug spend growth for diabetes did not feature within the ten fastest growing therapy areas. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the association between drug spend and disease burden in oncology, autoimmune disease, and diabetes in the EU-28. METHODS: Oncology, autoimmune disease and diabetes therapeutic areas were investigated using four methodologies. Historical and forecasted drug spend was analysed using the IQVIA MIDAS® drug sales database. Clinical and economic burden was estimated from targeted literature reviews. Trend analyses compared changes in drug spend with clinical burden using the Global Burden of Disease tool as the epidemiological reference. Cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from UK health technology assessments were compared to interpret the health economic value. RESULTS: Oncology had the highest historical drug spend and growth compared with autoimmune disease and diabetes. Total drug spend and growth in oncology is forecasted to exceed diabetes by twofold. Increasing oncology drug spend historically did not correspond with reductions in mortality and morbidity. Diabetes had the lowest drug spend and greatest QALY/1000 spent benefit. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that drug spend may not correlate to clinical burden across diseases. Future research could stimulate debate on whether more equitable drug funding may improve disease management.","Greiner, Wolfgang; Patel, Keyur; Crossman-Barnes, Christina-Jane; Rye-Andersen, Troels Vingtoft; Hvid, Christian; Vandebrouck, Tom",,,337

374893,Immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infections,2021,"Purpose: During the first weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in France, it was necessary to clearly define organizational priorities in the radiation therapy (RT) departments. In this report, we focus on the urgent measures taken to reduce risk for both our staff and patients by reducing the number of patients receiving treatment. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the fractionation schemes for all patients in our department, including those receiving treatment and those soon to start treatment. Our goals were to (1) decrease the number of patients coming daily to the hospital for RT, (2) adapt our human resources to continue patients’ care in the department, and (3) help to cover understaffed COVID-19 sectors of the hospital. Results: We identified 50 patients who were receiving treatment (n = 6), were going to start radiation after CT scan simulation (n = 41), or for whom the CT scan was pending (n = 3). The majority were women (64%) treated for breast cancer (54%). RT was delayed for 22 (44%) patients. The majority were offered hormone therapy as “waiting therapy.” Hypofractionation was considered in 21 (42%) patients mainly with breast cancer (18 of 21, 86%). The number of courses initially planned and replanned as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak during the period of March 15 to May 31, 2020, were 1383 and 683, respectively, which represented a reduction of 50% (including delayed sessions) that allowed our reorganization process. Conclusions: To conserve resources during the pandemic, we successfully reduced the number of patients receiving treatment in a proactive fashion and adapted our organization to minimize the risk of COVID-19 contamination. Departments across the world may benefit from this same approach.","Belkacemi, Yazid; Loaganadane, Gokoulakrichenane; Grellier, Noémie; Fonteneau, Gloria; Zaoui, Gaël; Coraggio, Gabriele; Hadhri, Asma; Adou, Marie; Bendavid, Jerôme; Boros, Angela; Ghith, Sahar; Debbi, Kamel; Cadot, Pauline; Bak, Adeline; Le Bret, Cindy; Hassani, Wissal; Mahé, Mathilde; Hervé, Marie-Laure; Colson-Durand, Laurianne; Hanh TO, Nhu; Luo, Deng Feng; Cherif, Aziz",Adv.

376722,Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR Improved by Deep Learning Analysis,2021,"Within the environmental risk assessment conducted for pesticide registration in the EU, avian reproductive toxicity is characterized after exposing adults. However, eggs of ground-nesting species can be exposed when pesticide applications occur during laying or incubation. We simulated environmentally realistic exposures of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) eggs to an herbicide (2,4-D) and a fungicide (tebuconazole) applied to winter cereal crops during the breeding season of most farmland birds. We analyzed effects on hatching success, offspring survival and physiology. Exposure by overspray led to greater pesticide accumulation in the eggshell or content than exposure through contact with treated soil (3.1 to 13.7 times higher, depending on the pesticide and target sample). Egg overspray with tebuconazole significantly increased chick mortality, which was 26% higher than that of controls. 2,4-D caused a similar but close to significant increase (chick mortality 24% higher than controls). Exposure to either pesticide through contact with treated soils did not affect chick survival but altered some biochemical parameters post-hatching. Our experiment shows that egg spraying with pesticides should be considered as a relevant exposure scenario in risk assessment procedures, given its potential to affect the reproductive success of ground-nesting farmland birds.","Ortiz-Santaliestra, Manuel E; Alcaide, Vicente; Camarero, Pablo R; Mateo, Rafael; Mougeot, Francois",Environ. sci. technol,,337

DATA SOURCES: We conducted highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Embase. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 28, 2020. No study design, publication status or language restriction were applied. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included studies that assessed patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease and examined one or more prognostic factors for mortality or disease severity. Reviewers working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome. RESULTS: We included 207 studies and found high or moderate certainty that the following 49 variables provide valuable prognostic information on mortality and/or severe disease in patients with COVID-19 infectious disease: Demographic factors (age, male sex, smoking), patient history factors (comorbidities, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer and dyslipidemia), physical examination factors (respiratory failure, low blood pressure, hypoxemia, tachycardia, dyspnea, anorexia, tachypnea, haemoptysis, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever and myalgia or arthralgia), laboratory factors (high blood procalcitonin, myocardial injury markers, high blood White Blood Cell count (WBC), high blood lactate, low blood platelet count, plasma creatinine increase, high blood D-dimer, high blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high blood C-reactive protein (CRP), decrease in lymphocyte count, high blood aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decrease in blood albumin, high blood interleukin-6 (IL-6), high blood neutrophil count, high blood B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), high blood creatine kinase (CK), high blood bilirubin and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), radiological factors (consolidative infiltrate and pleural effusion) and high SOFA score (sequential organ failure assessment score). CONCLUSION: Identified prognostic factors can help clinicians and policy makers in tailoring management strategies for patients with COVID-19 infectious disease while researchers can utilise our findings to develop multivariable prognostic models that could eventually facilitate decision-making and improve patient important outcomes.

By considering two different periods with distinct anxiety levels, namely the pre- and the post- COVID-19, we first explore the volatility spillovers between the spot price of crude oil and the stock markets. Second, we use a GARCH with jump intensity model to test whether the arrival of new information leads to unusual and rapid changes (or jumps) in crude oil prices. After investigating the potential presence of jumps in the spot price of crude oil, we perform a dynamic copula-based approach to assess the impacts on G20 stock prices under different volatility regimes. Our results show that the volatility transmission from oil to the G20 stock markets is significant for all countries, though with varying extents. The volatility transmission became more pronounced with the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic. These findings provide relevant information to agents with respect to the stock market in which they need to invest at the current situation of acute distress caused by the pandemic in an effort to mitigate risks.","Alqahtani, Abdullah Selmi Refk Hongbing Ouyang",Resources Policy,,337

382150,Insights into the SARS-CoV-2 Diagnosis in India: Present Status and Future Prospects,2020,"Many experimental and clinical studies have proven that the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tropism to the nervous system. The infection of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 can occur via the nasal route through trans-synaptic pathways. Coronaviruses can infect neurons and glial cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors or by endocytosis. The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the systemic inflammation associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to the impairment of the blood-brain barrier and triggers a neuroinflammatory response with reactive astrogliosis, and microglial activation. In addition, brain stem cells are damaged, which results in respiratory distress. Apart from typical symptoms of COVID-19 related to the involvement of the respiratory system, neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the study, attention was paid to the currently known neurological manifestations of COVID-19 so that they could be considered mainly in COVID-19 asymptomatic patients, which may limit the transmission of coronavirus infection.","Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Niedziela, Natalia; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Wierzbicki, Krzysztof; Jaroszewicz, Jerzy; Sowa, Pawel",Pol.

Although recent semi-supervised learning algorithms may alleviate the problem of annotation scarcity, limited real-world CT images still cause those algorithms producing inaccurate detection results, especially in real-world COVID-19 cases. Existing models often cannot detect the small infected regions in COVID-19 CT images, such a challenge implicitly causes that many patients with minor symptoms are misdiagnosed and develop more severe symptoms, causing a higher mortality. In this paper, we propose a new method to address this challenge. Not only can we detect severe cases, but also detect minor symptoms using real-world COVID-19 CT images in which the source domain only includes limited labeled CT images but the target domain has a lot of unlabeled CT images. Specifically, we adopt Network-in-Network and Instance Normalization to build a new module (we term it NI module) and extract discriminative representations from CT images from both source and target domains. A domain classifier is utilized to implement infected region adaptation from source domain to target domain in an Adversarial Learning manner, and learns domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model. We call our model NIA-Network (Network-in-Network, Instance Normalization and Adversarial Learning), and conduct extensive experiments on two COVID-19 datasets to validate our approach. The experimental results show that our model can effectively detect infected regions with different sizes and achieve the highest diagnostic accuracy compared with existing SOTA methods.","Li, Wei; Chen, Jinlin; Chen, Ping; Yu, Lequan; Cui, Xiaohui; Li, Yiwei; Cheng, Fang; Ouyang, Wen",Artif Intell Med,,337
385116,SARS-CoV-2 May Hijack GPCR Signaling Pathways to Compromise Lung Ion and Fluid Transport,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28 days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","Del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah D",J Subst Abuse Treat,,337

This paper will consider the evidence base which attests to the importance of considering the accumulation of adversity when seeking to understand risk and impact of child maltreatment and disadvantage. Given these unique and unprecedented circumstances which have accompanied the COVID-19 outbreak, and the dearth of research pertaining to the impact of pandemics on child welfare, the paper draws on an emerging body of literature on the effect of natural disasters, conflict and significant global events on child maltreatment. The paper synthesises the research to date in order to call attention to the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children already experiencing abuse and neglect. The paper concludes with an outline of the implications for practice in the helping professions.","Bryce, India",Child. Aust.,,337
386319,Viruses That Can and Cannot Coexist With Humans and the Future of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The massive assessment of immune evasion due to viral mutations that potentially increase COVID-19 susceptibility can be computationally facilitated. The adaptive cytotoxic T response is critical during primary infection and the generation of long-term protection. Potential epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 HLA class I families. Allele families showed extreme differences in number of recognized epitopes, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Among them, the B27 supertype showed the lowest number of epitopes. Epitope escape mutations identified in ~118,000 NCBI isolates mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27, which reached up to 33%. In contrast to most supertypes, eight particular allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles. Collectively, these data indicate that independent escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. This study highlights the automated integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially affecting the population as a whole, as well as minority subpopulations. AUTHOR SUMMARYThe cytotoxic T response, a type of immune response dependent upon an individual's genetics that does not require antibodies, is critical for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential bypass of the cytotoxic T response by mutations acquired by the virus after one year of the pandemic is therefore of maximal concern. We have approached the complexity of human variability and more than 100.000 viral genomes in this respect using a computational strategy. We have detected numerous mutations in these genomes that mask some viral regions involved in the cytotoxic response. However, the accumulation of these changes in independent isolates is still too low to threaten the global human population. In contrast, our protocol has identified mutations that may be relevant for specific populations and minorities with cytotoxic genetic backgrounds susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some viral variants co-existed in the same country with these human communities which warrants deeper surveillance in these cases to prevent local outbreaks. Our study support the integration of massive data of different natures in the surveillance of viral pandemics.","Foix, Anna; Lopez, Daniel; McConnell, Michael J.; Martin-Galiano, Antonio J.",,,337
386468,Distinct infection process of SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial cells line,2020,"Purpose: This paper aims to report process findings of two online inclusive research projects with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). It includes a discussion of the potential benefits and barriers of online inclusive research and its impact on the future of inclusive research. Design/methodology/approach: Two researchers describe the transition of their inclusive research projects from in-person to online formats and highlight how they operationalized the principles of inclusive research throughout these transitions. Findings: Potential benefits of inclusive research include enabling participation of research participants with IDD when in-person methods are not safe or feasible, increasing participant control of the research environment, stimulating participants’ online skill development and reducing geographic and support barriers to participation in research. A barrier to participation in online inclusive research includes people with IDD’s lack of access to online spaces and Web-enabled devices. Additionally, people with IDD have support and communication needs that are not always accommodated by online skills training and access to the internet. To conclude, inclusive researchers need to develop skills and reflexivity specific to online research environments. Originality/value: Inclusive online research with people with IDD brings unique ethical and methodological challenges that have not been well explored in the literature. Engaging people with IDD in research using online tools expands the terrain of inclusive research, opening possibilities for even greater inclusion and participation. Inclusive abstract Two researchers could not do their research studies because of the pandemic. They did them online. The studies were with people with disabilities. Being online can make it easier for people with disabilities to be a part of a study. They can choose how to be a part of the study. They can also learn more skills. Being online can be hard for people with disabilities. Some do not have a computer or smartphone. Some do not know how to use them. Researchers may not know how to help people with disabilities to be a part of an online study. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Miller, S.

386469,Distinct infection process of SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial cells line,2020,"BACKGROUND: High-throughput assays for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are critical to increasing test capacity and slowing the spread of COVID-19. Abbott Molecular developed and received emergency use authorization (EUA) to deploy the new RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay, run on the automated m2000sp/rt system. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate analytical and clinical performance of the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay compared to the SARS-CoV-2 CDC-based laboratory developed test (LDT) in clinical use by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory (UW Virology). METHODS: RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay limit of detection (LOD) was evaluated by testing two dilution panels of 60 replicates each. Cross-reactivity was evaluated by testing 24 clinical samples positive for various nonâSARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. Clinical performance was evaluated using 30 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples previously tested using the UW Virology SARS-CoV-2 LDT. RESULTS: Exceeding the 100 copies/mL LOD reported in the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay EUA product insert, 19 of 20 replicates were detected at 50 copies/mL and 16 of 20 replicates were detected at 25 copies/mL. All clinical samples positive for 24 nonâSARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses were SARS-CoV-2 negative on the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay. The assay had high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (100%) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. Two positive samples that tested negative with the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay had cycle numbers of 35.94 or greater and required dilution prior to testing. One of these samples was also inconclusive on the SARS-CoV-2 LDT. CONCLUSION: The RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay is acceptable for clinical use. With the high-throughput, fully automated m2000 system, this assay will accelerate the pace of SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Degli-Angeli, Emily; Dragavon, Joan; Huang, Meei-Li; Lucic, Danijela; Cloherty, Gavin; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L; Coombs, Robert W",J Clin Virol,,337

METHODS: The body weight, height, body mass index, upper arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness of 49 patients aged 1 month to 18 years and diagnosed with Covid-19 and then hospitalized at the Ankara City Hospital, Pediatric Health and Diseases Hospital, Pediatric Infection ward between 15 May and 15 June 2020 were measured. Total protein, albumin, prealbumin, selenium, zinc, ferritin, folate, and selenium, C, D, E, and B12 levels were studied from blood drawn simultaneously from the patients. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients aged 8-18 years were evaluated. The median age was 13 years (age range 8-18). The females made up 53% and the males 47% of the group. No patient needed intensive care admission. Only 3 patients received antibiotic treatment and the others were followed up without treatment. The weight was normal in 75% and the height was normal in 90%. Mid-arm circumference and triceps thickness were normal in 72% of the patients. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 82%, vitamin B12 deficiency in 18%, vitamin C deficiency in 17%, ferritin deficiency in 16%, folate deficiency in 15%, vitamin A deficiency in 13%, and vitamin E deficiency in 7%. CONCLUSION: No patient required intensive care admission. Only 3 patients received antibiotic treatment and the others were followed up without treatment. Malnourishment was present in 3% of the patients while 9% were obese. Vitamin D deficiency was the most common vitamin deficiency while vitamin B12, vitamin C, Ferritin, vitamin A, vitamin E, and Folate deficiency were less common. Selenium and zinc levels were normal in all patients. There was no correlation between anthropometric values and susceptibility to childhood COVID-19 infection or the clinical course. It is possible that vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to the infection.","Karakaya Molla, Gülhan; Ünal Uzun, Özlem; Koç, Nevra; Özen Yesil, Burcu; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,337

388628,"Potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: Concept, progress, and challenges",2021,"Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. To date the novel COVID-19 coronavirus is rapidly spreading worldwide and subsequently threatening health of billions of humans. Clinical studies have shown that most COVID-19 patients suffer from the lung infection. Although chest CT has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest Xray is more widely available due to its faster imaging time and considerably lower cost than CT. Deep learning, one of the most successful AI techniques, is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast amount of chest X-ray images, which can be critical for efficient and reliable COVID-19 screening. In this work, we aim to develop a new deep anomaly detection model for fast, reliable screening. To evaluate the model performance, we have collected 100 chest X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed with COVID-19 from the Github repository. To facilitate deep learning, more data are needed. Thus, we have also collected 1431 additional chest X-ray images confirmed as other pneumonia of 1008 patients from the public ChestX-ray14 dataset. Our initial experimental results show that the model developed here can reliably detect 96.00% COVID-19 cases (sensitivity being 96.00%) and 70.65% non-COVID-19 cases (specificity being 70.65%) when evaluated on 1531 Xray images with two splits of the dataset.","Zhang, Jianpeng; Xie, Yutong; Li, Yi; Shen, Chunhua; Xia, Yong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12338v1.pdf,337
389435,The Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic on World Indices: The Entropy Approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pertrochanteric fractures of the femur in the elderly are very common. As the average age of the population increases, the incidence of such fractures also raises, resulting in high healthcare costs. The type of surgical devices employed for their surgical management influences these costs. METHODS: A comparative clinical study was conducted on patients operated by one single surgeon between December 2018 and November 2020 in a high-volume regional referral centre. All patients who received a Zimmer Natural Nail (ZNN) or ELOS devices were included. RESULTS: In 119 (66.48%) of the 179 fractures, a ZNN nail was used. Post-operatively, the TAD (tip-to-apex distance) was measured at an average value of 17.05 (4.42-41.85) mm and the CalTAD (calcar-referenced TAD) at an average of 20.76 (10.82-43.63) mm. The mean hospitalization time was 10.19 (4-22) days. In the other 60 trochanteric fractures, an ELOS nail was used. Post-operative imaging indicated a TAD of 19.65 (5.08-31.4) mm and a CalTAD of 22.86 mm (12.66-33.77). The average time of the operation was 45.82 (20-110) min. The average period of hospitalization was 10.45 (5-24) days. CONCLUSION: Both devices give similar results in terms of short-term post-operative outcome and hospitalization. The price difference between the devices does not translate in different short-term results on the operated patients.","Gargano, Giuseppe; Poeta, Nicola; Oliva, Francesco; Migliorini, Filippo; Maffulli, Nicola",J Orthop Surg Res,,337

DESIGN: A stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in England, incorporating the following key factors which affect the ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). SETTING: Clinical academics in primary and secondary care in England. PARTICIPANTS: Equivalent of 3200 full-time clinical academics in England. INTERVENTIONS: Four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: ""Italy model"" (6%), ""mitigation"" (10%), ""relaxed mitigation"" (40%) and ""do-nothing"" (80%) scenarios. Low and high strain on the health system (no clinical academics able to do research at 10% and 5% infection rate, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of full-time clinical academics available to conduct clinical research during the pandemic in England. RESULTS: In the ""Italy model"", ""mitigation"", ""relaxed mitigation"" and ""do-nothing"" scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, <400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively-with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the ""do-nothing"" scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11, 12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.","Banerjee, Amitava; Katsoulis, Michail; Lai, Alvina G; Pasea, Laura; Treibel, Thomas A; Manisty, Charlotte; Denaxas, Spiros; Quarta, Giovanni; Hemingway, Harry; Cavalcante, João L; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Moon, James C",PLoS One,,337

The precise pathophysiological mechanism causing this symptom is unknown. This report describes a case of sudden hearing loss in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, was examined. She experienced sudden hearing loss in her right ear and disabling tinnitus. She underwent combined corticosteroid therapy (oral and intratympanic), resulting in an isolated improvement of 250 kHz in the right ear (from 60 dB, the threshold became 15 dB) and of 4, 6, and 8 kHz in the left ear (from 35 dB, 20 dB, and 35 dB, the thresholds became 15 dB, 5 dB and 20 dB, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Although rare, hearing loss appears to be a possible sequela to SARS-CoV-2 infection and deserves attention because it is a medical emergency requiring immediate clinical treatment. Additional studies are needed to assess the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in and the long-term characteristics of this type of hearing loss.","Lamounier, Pauliana; Franco Gonçalves, Victória; Ramos, Hugo Valter Lisboa; Gobbo, Débora Aparecida; Teixeira, Racine Procópio; Dos Reis, Paulo César; Bahmad, Fayez; Cândido Costa, Claudiney",Am J Case Rep,,337

PARTICIPANTS: All the employees of the hospital on a voluntary base, for a total of 4055 participants among 4572 HCWs (88.7%). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology according to working area. Association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology to selected variables (age, gender, country of origin, body mass index, smoking, symptoms and contact with confirmed cases). RESULTS: From 27 April 2020 to 12 June 2020, 4055 HCWs were tested and 309 (7.6%) had a serological positive test. No relevant difference was found between men and women (8.3% vs 7.3%, p=0.3), whereas a higher prevalence was observed among foreign-born workers (27/186, 14.5%, p<0.001), employees younger than 30 (64/668, 9.6%, p=0.02) or older than 60 years (38/383, 9.9%, p=0.02) and among healthcare assistants (40/320, 12.5%, p=0.06). Working as frontline HCWs was not associated with an increased frequency of positive serology (p=0.42). A positive association was found with presence and number of symptoms (p<0.001). The symptoms most frequently associated with a positive serology were taste and smell alterations (OR 4.62, 95% CI: 2.99 to 7.15) and fever (OR 4.37, 95% CI: 3.11 to 6.13). No symptoms were reported in 84/309 (27.2%) HCWs with positive IgG levels. Declared exposure to a suspected/confirmed case was more frequently associated (p<0.001) with positive serology when the contact was a family member (19/94, 20.2%) than a patient or colleague (78/888, 8.8%).

The objectives of the screening program were to reduce the importation of COVID-19 cases into the United States and slow subsequent spread within states. Screening aimed to identify travelers with COVID-19-like illness or who had a known exposure to a person with COVID-19 and separate them from others. Screening also aimed to inform all screened travelers about self-monitoring and other recommendations to prevent disease spread and obtain their contact information to share with public health authorities in destination states. CDC delegated postarrival management of crew members to airline occupational health programs by issuing joint guidance with the Federal Aviation Administration.* During January 17-September 13, 2020, a total of 766,044 travelers were screened, 298 (0.04%) of whom met criteria for public health assessment; 35 (0.005%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and nine (0.001%) had a positive test result. CDC shared contact information with states for approximately 68% of screened travelers because of data collection challenges and some states' opting out of receiving data. The low case detection rate of this resource-intensive program highlighted the need for fundamental change in the U.S. border health strategy. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission can occur in the absence of symptoms and because the symptoms of COVID-19 are nonspecific, symptom-based screening programs are ineffective for case detection. Since the screening program ended on September 14, 2020, efforts to reduce COVID-19 importation have focused on enhancing communications with travelers to promote recommended preventive measures, reinforcing mechanisms to refer overtly ill travelers to CDC, and enhancing public health response capacity at ports of entry. More efficient collection of contact information for international air passengers before arrival and real-time transfer of data to U.S. health departments would facilitate timely postarrival public health management, including contact tracing, when indicated. Incorporating health attestations, predeparture and postarrival testing, and a period of limited movement after higher-risk travel, might reduce risk for transmission during travel and translocation of SARS-CoV-2 between geographic areas and help guide more individualized postarrival recommendations.","Dollard, Philip; Griffin, Isabel; Berro, Andre; Cohen, Nicole J; Singler, Kimberly; Haber, Yoni; de la Motte Hurst, Chris; Stolp, Amber; Atti, Sukhshant; Hausman, Leslie; Shockey, Caitlin E; Roohi, Shahrokh; Brown, Clive M; Rotz, Lisa D; Cetron, Martin S; Alvarado-Ramy, Francisco",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,337
394208,Graphic Simulation of SARS-CoV-2 Droplets: Why Respirators should be used in Dental Healthcare Settings?,2020,"This work presents a mobility indicator derived from fully anonymised and aggregated mobile positioning data. Even though the indicator does not provide information about the behaviour of individuals, it captures valuable insights into the mobility patterns of the population in the EU and it is expected to inform responses against the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatio-temporal harmonisation is carried out so that the indicator can provide mobility estimates comparable across European countries. The indicators are provided at a high spatial granularity (up to NUTS3). As an application, the indicator is used to study the impact of COVID-19 confinement measure on mobility in Europe. It is found that a large proportion of the change in mobility patterns can be explained by these measures. The paper also presents a comparative analysis between mobility and the infection reproduction number R tover time. These findings will support policymakers in formulating the best data-driven approaches for coming out of confinement, mapping the socio-economic effects of the lockdown measures and building future scenarios in case of new outbreaks.","Santamaria, Carlos; Sermi, Francesco; Spyratos, Spyridon; Iacus, Stefano Maria; Annunziato, Alessandro; Tarchi, Dario; Vespe, Michele",Saf.

394275,SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant infection elicits potent lineage-specific and cross-reactive antibodies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Disease severity and mortality rates due to COVID-19 infection are greater in the elderly and chronically ill patients, populations at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D plays an important role in immune function and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the impact of vitamin D status and supplementation on COVID-19 related mortality and health outcomes. METHODS: We searched four databases until December 18th 2020, and trial registries until January 20th 2021. Two reviewers screened the studies, collected data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the evidence for each outcome across studies, independently and in duplicate. Pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality, ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, hospitalization, time of hospital stay, disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We only included data from peer-reviewed articles in our primary analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 peer-reviewed observational studies. In our primary analysis, there was a positive trend between serum 25(OH)D level <20â¯ng/ml and an increased risk of mortality, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. However, these associations were not statistically significant. Mean 25(OH)D levels was 5.9â¯ng/ml (95% CI [-9.5, -2.3]) significantly lower in COVID-19 positive, compared to negative patients. The certainty of the evidence was very low. We identified 32 clinical trial protocols, but only three have published results to-date. The trials administer vitamin D doses of 357 to 60,000â¯IU/day, from one week to 12â¯months. Eight megatrials investigate the efficacy of vitamin D in outpatient populations. A pilot trial revealed a significant decrease in ICU admission with calcifediol, compared to placebo (ORâ¯=â¯0.003), but the certainty of the evidence was unclear. Another small trial showed that supplementation with cholecalciferol, 60,000â¯IU/day, decreased fibrinogen levels, but did not have an effect on D-dimer, procalcitonin and CRP levels, compared to placebo. The third trial did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related health outcomes. CONCLUSION: While the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.","Bassatne, Aya; Basbous, Maya; Chakhtoura, Marlene; El Zein, Ola; Rahme, Maya; El-Hajj Fuleihan, Ghada",Metabolism,,337
395990,A Case for Targeting Th17 Cells and IL-17A in SARS-CoV-2 Infections,2020,"Coronavirus has confined human activities, which caused significant reductions in coal, oil, and natural gas consumptions in China since January of 2020. We compile industrial, transport, and construction data to estimate the reductions in energy-related CO2 emissions during the first quarter of 2020 in China. Our results show that the fossil fuel related CO2 emissions decreased by 18.7% (182 MtCO2) in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year, including reductions of 12.2% (92 MtCO2) in industry sectors, 61.9% (62 MtCO2) in transport, and 23.9% (28 MtCO2) in construction. The figure in annual CO2 emission reductions is expected to limit with an estimate of 1.6%. However, to achieve the economic target for the 13th Five-Year-Plan, stimulus packages including investments in ""shovel-ready"" infrastructure projects issued by China's central and local governments to response the COVID-19 may increase CO2 emissions with a higher speed in the coming years. Thus, sustainable stimulus packages are needed for accelerating China's climate goals.","Wang, Qingqing; Lu, Mei; Bai, Zimeng; Wang, Ke",Appl Energy,,337
396161,The role of passive immunization in the age of SARS-CoV-2: an update,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies demonstrated that elevated troponin in patients with COVID-19 was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, the association of cardiac injury and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cardiac injury with ECG abnormality and with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 between 13 March and 31 March 2020. Those patients with troponin I measurement were included in the study and divided into those who had elevated troponin I (cardiac injury group) and those who did not (no cardiac injury group). Statistical analyses were performed to compare differences between the groups, and a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the effect of cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: One hundred and eight-one (181) patients were included, 54 of whom were in the cardiac injury group and 127 in the no cardiac injury group. The mean age was 64.0±16.6 years and 55.8% were male. The cardiac injury group was more likely to be older, have a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure compared to the no cardiac injury group (all p<0.05); there was no difference in presence of chest pain (cardiac injury group versus no cardiac injury group: 17.0% versus 22.5%, p=0.92); the cardiac injury group had a significantly higher value of brain natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 and D-dimer (all p<0.05); they had numerically more frequent ECG abnormalities such as T wave inversion (13.2% versus 7.5%, p=0.23) and ST depression (1.9% versus 0.0%, p=0.13) although statistically not significant; they had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (42.3% versus 12.6%, p<0.001). With a multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.033 [1.002-1.065], p=0.034) and cardiac injury (3.25 [1.40-7.54], p=0.006) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 with elevated troponin I had a relatively low proportion of chest pain and ECG abnormality. Cardiac injury was independently associated with in-hospital mortality.","Maeda, Tetsuro; Obata, Reiichiro; Rizk, Dahlia; Kuno, Toshiki",Heart lung circ,,337

In 2004, a taskforce of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) launched the 'Guide for development of palliative nurse education in Europe' (hereinafter, the EAPC 2004 Guide). No systematic evaluation of its impact in the development of palliative care education was undertaken. AIMS: To describe current undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education across Europe; to identify the roles that nurses with different palliative care educational levels have in palliative care; and to assess the uptake of the EAPC 2004 Guide in the development of palliative care nursing in Europe. DESIGN: Descriptive research involving an online survey among nursing experts, and the consultation of national representatives. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 135 nurses (52% response rate) from 25 countries completed the online survey; representatives from 16 countries were consulted. RESULTS: In 14 (56%) countries, palliative care was not identified as a mandatory subject within undergraduate nursing education. The EAPC 2004 Guide is widely known and was/is being used in many countries to promote palliative care nursing education. Large variations were found across and within country responses. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care nursing education varies largely in Europe. The wide awareness and use of the EAPC 2004 Guide show how policy measures can influence the development of palliative care education. Recommendations are built and focus on both fostering the use of this guide and implementing policy measures to ensure that palliative care nursing is recognised and certified as a specialty in all European countries.","Martins Pereira, Sandra; Hernández-Marrero, Pablo; Pasman, H Roeline; Capelas, Manuel Luís; Larkin, Philip; Francke, Anneke L",Palliat Med,,337

We performed a scoping review to synthesize clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, we identified high-quality clinical studies describing critically ill patients with a sample size of greater than 20 patients by performing daily searches of the World Health Organization and LitCovid databases on COVID-19. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts (2785 unique articles), full text (218 articles), and abstracted data (92 studies). The 92 studies included 61 from Asia, 16 from Europe, 10 from North and South America, and 5 multinational studies. Notable similarities among critically ill populations across all regions included a higher proportion of older males infected and with severe illness, high frequency of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), abnormal chest imaging findings, and death secondary to respiratory failure. Differences in regions included newly identified complications (eg, pulmonary embolism) and epidemiological risk factors (eg, obesity), less chest computed tomography performed, and increased use of invasive mechanical ventilation (70% to 100% vs 15% to 47% of intensive care unit patients) in Europe and the United States compared with Asia. Future research directions should include proof-of-mechanism studies to better understand organ injuries and large-scale collaborative clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antivirals, antibiotics, interleukin 6 receptor blockers, and interferon. The current established predictive models require further verification in other regions outside China.","Huang, Chanyan; Soleimani, Jalal; Herasevich, Svetlana; Pinevich, Yuliya; Pennington, Kelly M; Dong, Yue; Pickering, Brian W; Barwise, Amelia K",Mayo Clin Proc,,337

398420,Urological tumors treatment in Brazil during the SARS-Cov-2 outbrake,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients with cancer show worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer. The humoral immune response (HIR) of patients with cancer against SARS-CoV-2 is not well characterized. To better understand it, we conducted a serological study of hospitalized patients with cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a unicentric, retrospective study enrolling adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a central hospital from March 15 to June 17, 2020, whose serum samples were quantified for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain or spike protein IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies. The aims of the study were to assess the HIR to SARS-CoV-2; correlate it with different cancer types, stages, and treatments; clarify the interplay between the HIR and clinical outcomes of patients with cancer; and compare the HIR of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with and without cancer. RESULTS: We included 72 SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects (19 with cancer, 53 controls). About 90% of controls revealed a robust serological response. Among patients with cancer, a strong response was verified in 57.9%, with 42.1% showing a persistently weak response. Treatment with chemotherapy within 14 days before positivity was the only factor statistically shown to be associated with persistently weak serological responses among patients with cancer. No significant differences in outcomes were observed between patients with strong and weak responses. All IgG, IgM, IgA, and total Ig antibody titers were significantly lower in patients with cancer compared with those without. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of patients with cancer develop a proper HIR. Recent chemotherapy treatment may be associated with weak serological responses among patients with cancer. Patients with cancer have a weaker SARS-CoV-2 antibody response compared with those without cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These results place the spotlight on patients with cancer, particularly those actively treated with chemotherapy. These patients may potentially be more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, so it is important to provide oncologists further theoretical support (with concrete examples and respective mechanistic correlations) for the decision of starting, maintaining, or stopping antineoplastic treatments (particularly chemotherapy) not only on noninfected but also on infected patients with cancer in accordance with cancer type, stage and prognosis, treatment agents, treatment setting, and SARS-CoV-2 infection risks.","Esperança-Martins, Miguel; Gonçalves, Lisa; Soares-Pinho, Inês; Gomes, Andreia; Serrano, Marta; Blankenhaus, Birte; Figueiredo-Campos, Patrícia; Catarina-Marques, Ana; Castro-Barbosa, Ana; Cardoso, Ana; Antunes-Meireles, Pedro; Atalaia-Barbacena, Henrique; Gaspar, Pedro; Howell-Monteiro, Patrícia; Pais-de-Lacerda, António; Mota, Catarina; Veldhoen, Marc",Oncologist,,337

398527,"Implications of the Novel Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome for Transmission, Disease Severity, and the Vaccine Development",2021,"The role of skeletal muscle mass in modulating immune response and supporting metabolic stress has been increasingly confirmed. Patients with sarcopenia, characterized by reduced muscle mass and muscle strength, were reported to have poor immune response and metabolic stress when facing acute infection, major surgeries, and other attacks. Based on empirical data, patients with sarcopenia are speculated to have increased infection rates and dismal prognoses amid the current 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. COVID-19 infection also aggravates sarcopenia because of the increased muscle wasting caused by systematic inflammation and the reduced physical activity and inadequate nutrient intake caused by social isolation. Notably, the interventions targeting skeletal muscle are anticipated to break the vicious circle and benefit the treatment of both conditions. We recommend sarcopenia assessment for populations with advanced age, inactivity, chronic disease, cancers, and nutritional deficiency. Patients with sarcopenia and COVID-19 infection need intensive care and aggressive treatments. The provision of at-home physical activities together with protein supplementation is anticipated to reverse sarcopenia and promote the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The recommended protocols on nutritional support and physical activities are provided in detail.","Wang, Pei-Yu; Li, Yin; Wang, Qin",Nutrition,,337

We hypothesised that the quantity of ARGs in effluents may be related to the size of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sampling season. To date, only several attempts have been made to investigate the impact of the above factors at the catchment scale. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to explore possible differences in the quantity of ARGs in treated wastewater from small, medium-sized and large WWTPs in the catchment of the Pilica River (9258 km2). The impact of treated wastewater on the concentration of ARGs was also determined along the river continuum from upland to lowland segments to the point of confluence with the Vistula (342 km). Treated effluent was sampled in 17 WWTPs, and river water was sampled in 7 sampling sites in four seasons. The concentrations of blaTEM, tet(A), ermF, sul1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes, the integrase gene intI1 and the 16S rRNA gene were analysed by quantitative PCR. The physical and chemical parameters and nutrient concentrations (23 various parameters) in the analysed samples were determined. The highest absolute concentrations of the studied genes were noted in effluent samples from small WWTPs (p < 0.01). The concentration of ARGs (gene copies/mL) peaked in winter and spring samples (p < 0.04). The results of statistical analyses indicate that in small WWTPs, the absolute concentration of ARGs can be predicted based on the biochemical oxygen demand, in routine water analyses. However, none of the studied parameters supported predictions of ARG abundance in medium-sized and large WWTPs or in river water.","Harnisz, Monika; Kiedrzynska, Edyta; Kiedrzynski, Marcin; Korzeniewska, Ewa; Czatzkowska, Malgorzata; Koniuszewska, Izabela; Józwik, Adam; Szklarek, Sebastian; Niestepski, Sebastian; Zalewski, Maciej",Sci Total Environ,,337

400448,Preexisting and de novo humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in humans,2020,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic shows a marked geographical variation in its prevalence and mortality. The question arises if the host genetic variation may (partly) affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. We postulated that the geographical variation of human polymorphisms might partly explain the variable prevalence of the infection. We investigated some candidate genes that have the potential to play a role in the immune defense against COVID-19: complement component 3 (C3), galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), haptoglobin (Hp), vitamin D binding protein (DBP), human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). In a univariate approach, ACE1 D/I, C3, CFTR, and HFE polymorphisms correlated significantly with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality, whereas Hp and FUT2 polymorphism did not show any significant correlations. In a multivariate analysis, only ACE1 D/I and C3 polymorphisms were determinants for COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. The other polymorphisms (CFTR, DBP, FUT2, HFE, and Hp) did not correlate with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. Whereas ACE1 D/I polymorphism shows functional links with ACE2 (which is the receptor for the virus) in COVID-19, C3 can act as a critical step in the virus-induced inflammation. Our findings plead against a bystander role of the polymorphisms as a marker for historical migrations, which comigrate with causal genes involved in COVID-19 infection. Further studies are required to assess the clinical outcome of COVID-19 in C3S and ACE1 D allele carriers and to study the role of C3 and ACE1 D/I polymorphisms in COVID-19 and their potential effects on treatment response.","Delanghe, Joris R; De Buyzere, Marc L; Speeckaert, Marijn M",Adv Exp Med Biol,,337

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mandatory quarantine increased the risk of mental symptoms and, inferentially, emotional eating (EE). We investigated the EE prevalence and predictors during this pandemic. Overall, 638 women, ages 18-39, completed an online survey incorporating the Emotional Eating Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. We asked about nutrition and collected data on weight, height, and pandemic responses. Most respondents (47.2%) reported low EE; 40.4% were ""moderate"" and 12.4% ""high"" emotional eaters; 42.8% reported depression, 27% anxiety, 71% moderate stress, and 12.5% severe stress. The main EE indicators/predictors were fat intake (ß = 0.192, p = 0.004), number of meals (ß = 0.187, p < 0.001), sugar consumption (ß = 0.150, p < 0.001), body mass index (ß = 0.149, p < 0.001), stress (ß = 0.143, p = 0.004), energy intake (ß = 0.134, p = 0.04), and fast food intake frequency (ß = 0.111, p < 0.01). EE score correlated negatively with increased family income (ß = -0.081, p = 0.049). Higher stress correlated with worse sleep, less sleep, and less physical activity.

405288,Letter to the editor: Plenty of coronaviruses but no SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Background: Information regarding the incidence and characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia amongst pregnant women is scarce. Methods: Single-centre experience with 32 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 5 to April 5, 2020 at Madrid, Spain. Findings: COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 61·5% (32/52) women. Only 18·7% (6/32) had some underlying condition (mostly asthma). Supplemental oxygen therapy was required in 18 patients (56·3%), with high-flow requirements in six (18·7%). Eight patients (25·0%) fulfilled the criteria for acute distress respiratory syndrome. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in two patients (6·2%). Tocilizumab was administered in five patients (15·6%). Delivery was precipitated due to COVID-19 in three women (9·4%). All the newborns had a favourable outcome, with no cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Severe cases of pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen were more likely to exhibit bilateral alveolar or interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray (55·6% vs. 0·0%; P-value = 0·003) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &gt;10 mg/dL (33·0% vs. 0·0%; P-value = 0·05) at admission than those with no oxygen requirements. Interpretation: Pregnant women with COVID-19 have a high risk of developing pneumonia, with a severe course in more than half of cases.

406369,Large scale production and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 whole antigen for serological test development,2021,"Sustainable development requires integrated systems thinking about environmental, economic, and social drivers to achieve long term solutions. Systems Thinking and Modelling (STM) is now taught widely in disciplines such as management, business, biology, and sustainability education. Recent Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) such as COVID-19 in ‘hotspot’ rural locations highlight systemic socio-economic and health interactions in social-ecological systems (SES). While popular susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models of EID focus on transmission factors, such as contact rates, SES drivers focus on the broader economic, ecological, and social factors that can enable EID. While STM has been applied to disease propagation aspects of EID, no current models attempt to model the multi-scalar interactions between health systems, economics, and the environment in rural settings where virus hosts and humans come into contact. Systems Dynamics Modelling (SDM) tools, such as causal loop diagrams (CLD) and Archetype diagrams can visualise the complex and multi-scalar ‘panarchic’ interactions influencing outbreaks of EID. In this chapter, we show that such multi-scalar CLD models can articulate the economic, environmental, social and health interactions that perpetuate unsustainable development and contribute to potential EID. Such models help visualise the complex dynamics of sustainable development in resource-constrained rural settings in ways that textbook descriptions do not always capture. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Melles, G.; Lodewyckx, S.; Sukumar, H.

406906,Applying principles of behaviour change to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission,2020,"Background People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia often also have physical health illnesses and interventions are needed to address the resultant multimorbidity and reduced life expectancy. Research has shown that volunteers can support people with SMI. This protocol describes a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a novel intervention involving volunteer ‘Health Champions’ supporting people with SMI to manage and improve their physical health. Methods This is a feasibility hybrid II randomised effectiveness-implementation controlled trial. The intervention involves training volunteers to be ‘Health Champions’ to support individual people with SMI using mental health services. This face-to-face or remote support will take place weekly and last for up to 9 months following initial introduction. This study will recruit 120 participants to compare Health Champions to treatment as usual for people with SMI using secondary community mental health services in South London, UK. We will measure the clinical and cost effectiveness including quality of life. We will measure the implementation outcomes of acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, barriers and enablers, unintended consequences, adoption and sustainability. Discussion There is a need for interventions to support people with SMI with their physical health. If this feasibility trial is successful, a definitive trial will follow to fully evaluate the clinical, cost and implementation effectiveness of Health Champions supporting people with SMI.

409784,Optical nanoscopy reveals SARS-CoV-2-induced remodeling of human airway cells,2021,"PURPOSE: Approximately two thirds of the tonnage of antibiotics sold in the United States are intended for use in food production, and global use is projected to increase. This review summarizes the rationale for antibiotic use in animal agriculture, therapeutic classes used, risks from antibiotic-resistant organisms, and limits of existing regulation. In addition, opportunities for improved surveillance, stewardship, and advocacy will be highlighted. METHODS: A transdisciplinary narrative review of drivers of antibiotics in food production was conducted, including concepts from population health, infectious diseases, veterinary medicine, and consumer advocacy. FINDINGS: Globally, antibiotics of many important classes in human medicine are given to animals for the treatment of a diagnosed illness, disease control and prevention, and growth promotion. Extensive antibiotic use on farms drives the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in food-producing animals, which can be transmitted to people and the environment. Antibiotic stewardship in food production has been associated with decreased rates of resistance in both animals and humans, without reducing farm productivity. Multiple European nations have successfully implemented stewardship strategies, including banning uses for disease prevention, benchmarking antibiotic utilization, and setting national reduction targets. In the United States, medically important antibiotics are no longer permitted for growth promotion; however, antibiotics may be prescribed for other indications with limited veterinary oversight and requirements for reporting. Marked reductions in use have been achieved in the poultry industry, although use in the pork and beef industries remain high. IMPLICATIONS: Despite some progress, significant challenges in surveillance and regulatory oversight remain to prevent the overuse of antibiotics in food production. Consumers remain a potent force via market pressure on grocery stores, restaurants, suppliers, and farmers. Improved, verified labelling is important for informing consumer choices. Numerous public health agencies, consumer groups, and professional societies have called for judicious antibiotic use, but increased direct advocacy from health care professionals is needed.","Patel, Sameer J; Wellington, Matthew; Shah, Rohan M; Ferreira, Matthew J",Clin. ther,,337
409848,Antiviral activities of mycophenolic acid and IMD-0354 against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 can cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We performed a rapid systematic review focusing on the use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, the Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Ovid (updated 30 April 2020) were systematically searched. Case reports/Case series from COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO were included in the study. Three reviewers assessed, selected, and abstracted data from studies. All disparate opinions were resolved through discussion. RESULTS: We included 13 articles for systematic evaluation, including 10 case reports and 3 case series studies, with a total of 72 patients. We search for the following information: First author of articles; Patient's location; age; gender; body mass index (BMI); Comorbidities; Time on ECMO; Mode of ECMO; treatments and clinical outcomes. As of all reporting times, our data show that 38 patients (52.8%) have died definitively, 13 patients (18.0%) were still receiving ECMO treatment, 12 patients (16.7%) were alive, 7 patients (9.7%) were recovery and 2 cases (2.8%) remained hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO plays an important role in the stabilization and survival critically ill patients with COVID-19, but the usefulness of ECMO in reducing the mortality of severe ARDS caused by COVID-19 was limited. Therefore, a larger sample size study and a comprehensive analysis of evaluating the medical value of using ECMO on COVID-19 patients are urgently required.","Hu, B-S; -Z Hu, M; Jiang, L-X; Yu, J; Chang, Y; Cao, Y; Dai, Z-P",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,337

Social media has become a primary source of news for many, but it can also be a hindrance in managing crisis situations due to the prevalence of fake news. This paper reports on a survey administered to social media users during the first wave of the pandemic to identify perceptions and areas of conflict that influenced society's ability to understand and contain the pandemic. Applying conflict resolution theory to the survey results enabled us to identify major issues related to the management of COVID-19, from which we made recommendations for the roles that information systems research can play in handling future pandemics or other crises. The recommendations are divided into the two general categories of media trust and crisis containment.","French, A. M.; Storey, V.

Infection with M. bovis and M. tuberculosis have significant implications for wildlife species management, public health, veterinary disease control, and conservation endeavours. RESULTS: Here we describe the first use of the VetMAX&#8482; Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection kit for African wildlife samples. DNA was extracted from tissues harvested from 48 African buffaloes and MTBC DNA was detected (test-positive) in all 26 M. bovis culture-confirmed animals with an additional 12 PCR-positive results in culture-negative buffaloes (originating from an exposed population). Of six MTBC-infected African rhinoceros tested, MTBC DNA was detected in antemortem and postmortem samples from five animals. The PCR was also able to detect MTBC DNA in samples from two African elephants confirmed to have M. bovis and M. tuberculosis infections (one each). Culture-confirmed uninfected rhinoceros and elephants' samples tested negative in the PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest this new detection kit is a sensitive screening test for the detection of MTBC-infected African buffaloes, African elephants and white rhinoceros.","Goosen, Wynand J; Kerr, Tanya J; Kleynhans, Léanie; Buss, Peter; Cooper, David; Warren, Robin M; van Helden, Paul D; Schröder, Björn; Parsons, Sven D C; Miller, Michele A",BMC Vet Res,,337

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has directly or indirectly involved in the loss of lives of more than 3.24 million as of 6th May, 2021. The increasing threats posed by this pandemic were subsided by the swift and drastic measures put in place by different countries. As other causes of death before the emergence of COVID-19 still exist, the pandemic has further worsened their impact. The increased risks of COVID-19 deaths are not only due to the health burden it possesses, but also due to some other factors. These factors include domestic violence that becomes rampant, especially during lockdowns;hunger due to low economic development, unemployment, and loss of jobs;suicide due to depression;exhausted health system due to high level of COVID-19 cases and inability to contain it. As we move from the response phase into recovery, the pandemic's direct and broader impacts on individuals, households, and communities will influence the capacity to recover. An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery. This paper identifies other causes of death amidst the pandemic, such as domestic violence, hunger, suicide, and exhausted health system, and how to minimize their effects.","David, K.

METHODS: Twenty college athletes (10 men and 10 women) performed a half-squat exercise consisting of five incremental intensities: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of the one-repetition maximum. Blood samples were collected at rest, 15 min and 24 h post-test. The concentration of lipid peroxidation markers and the activities of a skeletal muscle damage marker and a cardiac muscle damage marker were determined in serum. Serum &#945;-actin was measured as a marker of sarcomere damage. Serum levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined to assess the inflammatory response. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 levels were higher at 24 h post-test than at rest and 15 min post-test in men (p < 0.05). Moreover, men showed significantly higher hydroperoxide levels in response to resistance exercise at 24 h post-test than at 15 min post-test (p < 0.05). No differences were found in muscle damage parameters regardless of sex or the time point of the test. No differences regarding the studied variables were found when comparing among different time points in women. CONCLUSION: Our results show a larger influence of half-squat exercises on the release of IL6 and on lipid peroxidation in men than in women at equivalent workloads.","Aragón-Vela, Jerónimo; Fontana, Luis; Casuso, Rafael A; Plaza-Díaz, Julio; R Huertas, Jesús",Biomed. j.

As a result, to reduce the virus spreading accordingly, 1.83 m of social distancing has been advised to be followed among the humans. Also, it is not well studied that whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause COVID-19 laden cough droplets to transport farther in the air, and make the current social distancing practice ineffective. In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out to analyze the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of COVID laden droplets emitted by coughs, with the different environmental conditions, cough velocities and Relative Humidity using the developed bus model of size 12 m x 3.5 m x 3.2 m. Different conditions of sneezing and coughing from the human’s i.e., the laminar and the turbulent flows of the laden droplets in the air inside the bus were also examined. The distance between the two virtual humans is set as 6 m for a 12 m bus length in order to track the distance covered by cough particles. The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. It is found that due to the ambient air and humidity, the generation of secondary laden droplets occur which travels far and accumulates on the ground or any other third human being around and causes a strong potential risk to their health. The secondary droplets are transforming into large droplets due to high humidity and the hygroscopic effect is evaluated. The 6 feet social distancing is found to be ineffective for halting the spread of viruses among human beings because the micro-laden droplets caused during the sneezing and coughing are influenced by the convection effects and transport from one body to another within 5 s. It is thus recommended to wear masks for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplets.","Pavansai, A.; Deepak, P.; Hari, S. Ragul Harish R.; Kumar, M. B.

We used the Gold Standard Diagnostics ELISA to evaluate the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in sera of 82 hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Serum samples were collected 1-59 days post-onset of symptoms (PoS) and we examined the association of age, sex, disease severity, and symptoms' duration with antibody levels. We also tested sera of 100 ambulatory hospital employees with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and samples collected during convalescence, 35-57 days PoS. All but four of the admitted patients (95.1%) developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies were detected within 7 days PoS; IgA in 60.0%, IgM in 53.3%, and IgG in 46.7% of samples. IgG positivity increased to 100% on Day 21. We did not observe significant differences in the rate of antibody development in regard to age and sex. IgA levels were highest in patients with a severe and critical illness. In multiple regression analyses, only IgA levels were statistically significantly correlated with critical disease (p = .05) regardless of age, sex, and duration of symptoms. Among 100 ambulatory hospital employees who had antibody testing after 4 weeks PoS only 10% had positive IgA antibodies. The most frequently isolated isotype in sera of employees after 30 days PoS was IgG (88%). IgA was the predominant immunoglobulin in early disease and correlated independently with a critical illness. IgG antibodies remained detectable in almost 90% of samples collected up to two months after infection.","Zervou, Fainareti N; Louie, Ping; Stachel, Anna; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Ortiz-Mendez, Yadira; Thomas, Kristen; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria E",J. med. virol,,337

421974,A Single Immunization with Spike-Functionalized Ferritin Vaccines Elicits Neutralizing Antibody Responses against SARS-CoV-2 in Mice,2021,"Viruses such as the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that is wreaking havoc on the world, depend on interactions of its own proteins with those of the human host cells. Relatively small changes in sequence such as between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can dramatically change clinical phenotypes of the virus, including transmission rates and severity of the disease. On the other hand, highly dissimilar virus families such as Coronaviridae, Ebola, and HIV have overlap in functions. In this work we aim to analyze the role of protein sequence in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins towards human proteins and compare it to that of the above other viruses. We build supervised machine learning models, using Generalized Additive Models to predict interactions based on sequence features and find that our models perform well with an AUC-PR of 0.65 in a class-skew of 1:10. Analysis of the novel predictions using an independent dataset showed statistically significant enrichment. We further map the importance of specific amino-acid sequence features in predicting binding and summarize what combinations of sequences from the virus and the host is correlated with an interaction. By analyzing the sequence-based embeddings of the interactomes from different viruses and clustering them together we find some functionally similar proteins from different viruses. For example, vif protein from HIV-1, vp24 from Ebola and orf3b from SARS-CoV all function as interferon antagonists. Furthermore, we can differentiate the functions of similar viruses, for example orf3a's interactions are more diverged than orf7b interactions when comparing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","Kshirsagar, Meghana; Tasnina, Nure; Ward, Michael D; Law, Jeffrey N; Murali, T M; Lavista Ferres, Juan M; Bowman, Gregory R; Klein-Seetharaman, Judith",Pac Symp Biocomput,,337

It can cause several effects on thyroid functions as well. We aimed to assess the lasting sequelae of COVID-19 on thyroid hormone and the clinical course of the disease as a result. METHODS: Out of 76 patients, 48 patients of COVID-19 positive and 28 patients of COVID-19 negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were assessed for thyroid functions, IL-6, and Procalcitonin between moderate, severe, and critical pneumonia on HRCT. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 had thyroid abnormalities and higher IL-6 levels (76.10 ± 82.35 vs. 6.99 ± 3.99, 95% CI 52.18-100.01, P-value <0.01). Logistic regression analysis suggested TT3 (P-value 0.01), IL-6 (P-value <0.01), and Procalcitonin (P-value 0.03) as independent risk factors for COVID-19. ROC curve demonstrated IL-6 as the most sensitive marker (P-value <0.01), and TT3, and Procalcitonin as the predictor for COVID-19 disease.

423506,From the Role of Microbiota in Gut-Lung Axis to SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,2021,"Many individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop no or only mild symptoms, but some can go on onto develop a spectrum of pathologies including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure. Many pathogens, viral and non-viral, can elicit these pathologies, which justifies reconsidering whether the target of therapeutic approaches to fight pathogen infections should be (a) the pathogen itself, (b) the pathologies elicited by the pathogen interaction with the human host, or (c) a combination of both. While little is known about the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, it is well-established that the above-mentioned pathologies are associated with hyper-inflammation, tissue damage, and the perturbation of target organ metabolism. Mounting evidence has shown that these processes are regulated by endoproteinases (particularly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)). Here, we review what is known about the roles played by MMPs in the development of COVID-19 and postulate a mechanism by which MMPs could influence energy metabolism in target organs, such as the lung. Finally, we discuss the suitability of MMPs as therapeutic targets to increase the metabolic tolerance of the host to damage inflicted by the pathogen infection, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.","Hardy, Eugenio; Fernandez-Patron, Carlos",Biomolecules,,337

This study evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patients, patient response time (pain-to-door), and intervention time (door-to-balloon) for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). MethodsPatients with STEMI or NSTEMI visiting a hospital in South Korea who underwent primary coronary intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 29, 2020, to December 31, 2020) were compared with those in the equivalent period in 2018 to 2019. Patient response and intervention times were compared for the COVID-19 pandemic window (2020) and the equivalent period in 2018 to 2019. ResultsWe observed no decrease in the number of patients with STEMI (P=0.50) and NSTEMI (P=0.94) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to that in the previous years. Patient response times (STEMI: P=0.34; NSTEMI: P=0.89) during the overall COVID-19 pandemic period did not differ significantly. However, we identified a significant decrease in time to intervention among patients with STEMI (14%; p<0.01) during the early COVID-19 pandemic. ConclusionsWe found that the number of patient with STEMI and NSTEMI was consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic and that no time delays in patient response and intervention occurred. However, the door-to-balloon time among patients with STEMI significantly reduced during the early COVID-19 pandemic, which could be attributed to reduced emergency care utilization during the early pandemic.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Kim, Dasom; Jung, Lae Young; Kim, Baekjin; Lee, Chang-Seop",,,337

This likely reflects patients' limited ability to physically distance as well as community exposures, including residence in areas with high rates of infection. Patients on dialysis are at extremely high risk should they develop COVID-19, with short-term mortality of 20% or higher. Accordingly, it is imperative that the kidney community intervenes to reduce the threat of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population by focusing on modifiable factors, including universal masking of patients and staff and enhanced screening, including testing for COVID-19 in the patients who are asymptomatic during times of high local prevalence.","Hsu, Caroline M; Weiner, Daniel E",Kidney Int,,337

The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS: A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS: Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels. It is likely that medicine in general, and pain medicine in particular, will change after COVID-19, with greater emphasis on telemedicine, virtual education, and greater national and international cooperation. Physicians should be prepared for these changes.","Kohan, Lynn; Durbhakula, Shravani; Zaidi, Munfarid; Phillips, Cdr Christopher R; Rowan, Cody C; Brenner, Gary J; Cohen, Steven P",,,337

It was noticed that Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus fumigatus induced variable toxic potential that was cell type, secondary metabolite type, and concentration dependent. Human colonic adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) showed less sensitivity than hepatocyte-derived cellular carcinoma cells (HuH-7), and in turn, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was variable. Also, the apoptotic potential of Aspergillus species-derived fungal secondary metabolites was proven via detection of up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. The expression level was cell type dependent. Concurrently, apoptotic profile was accompanied with cellular DNA accumulation at the G2/M phase, as well as an elevation in Pre-G1 phase but not during G0/G1 and S phases. Also, there were characteristic apoptotic features of treated cells presented as abnormal intra-nuclear eosinophilic structures, dead cells with mixed euchromatin and heterochromatin, ruptured cell membranes, apoptotic cells with irregular cellular and nuclear membranes, as well as peripheral chromatin condensation.

During the fast-paced course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Twitter polling system has provided a viable method for gaining rapid, large-scale, international public health insights on highly relevant and timely SARS-CoV-2-related topics. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the public's perception on the safety and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in real time by using Twitter polls. METHODS: We developed 2 Twitter polls to explore the public's views on available COVID-19 vaccines. The surveys were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-February 2021, and Twitter users and influencers were asked to participate in and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience. RESULTS: The adequacy of COVID-19 vaccine safety (ie, the safety of currently available vaccines; poll 1) was agreed upon by 1579 out of 3439 (45.9%) Twitter users. In contrast, almost as many Twitter users (1434/3439, 41.7%) were unsure about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Only 5.2% (179/3439) of Twitter users rated the available COVID-19 vaccines as generally unsafe. Poll 2, which addressed the question of whether users would undergo vaccination, was answered affirmatively by 82.8% (2862/3457) of Twitter users, and only 8% (277/3457) categorically rejected vaccination at the time of polling. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the perceived high level of uncertainty about the safety of the available COVID-19 vaccines, we observed an elevated willingness to undergo vaccination among our study sample. Since people's perceptions and views are strongly influenced by social media, the snapshots provided by these media platforms represent a static image of a moving target. Thus, the results of this study need to be followed up by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. This is especially relevant due to the circumstances of the fast-paced pandemic and the need to not miss sudden rises in the incidence of vaccine hesitancy, which may have detrimental effects on the pandemic's course.","Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Nawaz, Faisal A; Fazel, Sajjad S; Tsagkaris, Christos; Kulnik, Stefan Tino; Crutzen, Rik; Klager, Elisabeth; Völkl-Kernstock, Sabine; Schaden, Eva; Kletecka-Pulker, Maria; Willschke, Harald; Atanasov, Atanas G",J Med Internet Res,,337

Pre-analytical determinants, such as sampling procedures, time and temperature storage conditions, might impact on the end result. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of sampling procedures, time and temperature of the primary nasopharyngeal swabs storage on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results. Methods: Each nasopharyngeal swab obtained from 10 hospitalized patients for COVID-19 was subdivided in 15 aliquots: five were kept at room temperature; five were refrigerated (+4 °C); five were immediately mixed with the extraction buffer and refrigerated at +4 °C. Every day and for 5 days, one aliquot per condition was analyzed (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 gene E and RNaseP and threshold cycles (Ct) compared. To evaluate manual sampling, 70 nasopharyngeal swabs were sampled twice by two different operators and analyzed separately one from the other. Results: A total of 6/10 swabs were SARS-CoV-2 positive. No significant time or storage-dependent variations were observed in SARS-CoV-2 Ct. Re-sampling of swabs with SARS-CoV-2 Ct lower than 33 resulted in highly reproducible results (CV=2.9%), while a high variability was observed when Ct values were higher than 33 (CV=10.3%). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that time and temperature of nasopharyngeal swabs storage do not significantly impact on results reproducibility. However, swabs sampling is a critical step, and especially in case of low viral load, might be a potential source of diagnostic errors.","Basso, Daniela; Aita, Ada; Navaglia, Filippo; Franchin, Elisa; Fioretto, Paola; Moz, Stefania; Bozzato, Dania; Zambon, Carlo-Federico; Martin, Barbara; Dal Prà, Chiara; Crisanti, Andrea; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chem Lab Med,,337

Their fabrication method is based on template stripping of a segmented gold pyramid with a size-adjustable nanopyramid end, which is capable of supporting monopole localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes leading to high spectral enhancement when its resonance energy is matched with the excitation laser energy. Here, we describe in detail the PTTP fabrication method and report a statistical analysis based on 530 PTTPs' and 185 ordinary gold micropyramids' templates. Our results indicate that the PTTP method generates probes with an apex diameter smaller than 30 nm on 92.4% of the batch, which is a parameter directly related to the achievable TERS spatial resolution. Moreover, the PTTPs' nanopyramid edge size L, a critical parameter for LSPR spectral tuning, shows variability typically smaller than 12.5%. The PTTP's performance was tested in TERS experiments performed on graphene, and the results show a spectral enhancement of up to 72-fold, which is at least one order of magnitude higher than that typically achieved with gold micropyramids. Imaging resolution is in the order of 20 nm.","Oliveira, Bruno S; Archanjo, Bráulio S; Valaski, Rogério; Achete, Carlos A; Cançado, Luiz Gustavo; Jorio, Ado; Vasconcelos, Thiago L",J Chem Phys,,337
433903,A special issue on SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Since the identification in late 2019 of a new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (now widely known as Covid-19) the World Health Organization (WHO) has unsurprisingly been a focus of critical international attention Established in 1948 as a technical agency under the United Nations system, the WHO is ‘the directing and coordinating authority on international health work’ (WHO, 1948), with the power through the International Health Regulations (IHR) to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and mandated to lead the global response to such an event Having declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 30 January 2020, its role has included gathering and analysing data from around the world, supporting clinical trials on drugs and vaccines, and providing technical guidance to countries In this context, and to the astonishment of many long-term observers, the inevitable focus on the work of the WHO turned quickly to open criticism of the agency This has come in particular from the Trump Administration initially in relation to WHO’s handling of China While not the first time the WHO has been caught in the crossfire between discordant member states, it is unprecedented that an influential member state should leave the organization in the midst of a global health crisis or disease outbreak The resulting scrutiny and fierce debate extends beyond the role or mandate of WHO, its response to COVID-19 or its capabilities for fulfilling its functions: it is more fundamentally about the role of politics in global health crises, against a background of geopolitical shifts, the changing nature of multilateralism and the rise of nationalist or populist politics within countries This Forum brings together an outstanding group of scholars, practitioners and advocates to reflect on WHO’s response to this complex global crisis within the context of broader conversations on global health, security and development, and contemporary threats to multilateralism and global solidarity In this introduction, we highlight the key themes of the Forum articles, including the challenges to the mandate of WHO and the politicization of its role in the crisis, while also considering what a distinctive global social policy (GSP) perspective offers to this debate","Agartan, Tuba I.; Cook, Sarah Lin Vivian",Global Social Policy,,337

This qualitative study identified multi-level drivers of shifts in inhaled tobacco product use and access patterns during the initial COVID-19 ""lockdown"" period in the United States. METHODS: Between April and May 2020, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 44) with adults who use cigarettes and/or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transcripts were thematically analyzed using a socioecological framework. RESULTS: Nearly all participants reported changes in their product use during lockdown, though patterns varied. Increased use was most common and was predominantly driven by individual-level factors: pandemic-related anxiety, boredom, and irregular routines. Decreased use was common among social users who cited fewer interpersonal interactions and fear of sharing products. At the community level, retail access impacted cigarette and ENDS use differently. While cigarettes were universally accessible, ENDS access was more limited, driving some to purchase products online. Delayed deliveries led some ENDS users to compensate with readily-available cigarettes. CONCLUSION: To mitigate ways that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate an existing public health crisis, multi-level policy strategies, such as expanded virtual cessation services and implementation and enforcement of smoke-free home rules, can better support population health during this critical period. Policies that facilitate access to lower risk products can help minimize harm among those who cannot or do not want to quit smoking.","Giovenco, Daniel P; Spillane, Torra E; Maggi, Rachel M; Lee, Esther Y; Philbin, Morgan M",Int J Drug Policy,,337
435551,An enzyme-based immunodetection assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"BackgroundIndividuals with immune dysfunction, including people with HIV (PWH) or solid organ transplant recipients (SOT), might have worse outcomes from COVID-19. We compared odds of COVID-19 outcomes between patients with and without immune dysfunction. MethodsWe evaluated data from the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a multicenter retrospective cohort of electronic medical record (EMR) data from across the United States, on. 1,446,913 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. HIV, SOT, comorbidity, and HIV markers were identified from EMR data prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 disease severity within 45 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection was classified into 5 categories: asymptomatic/mild disease with outpatient care; mild disease with emergency department (ED) visit; moderate disease requiring hospitalization; severe disease requiring ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and death. We used multivariable, multinomial logistic regression models to compare odds of COVID-19 outcomes between patients with and without immune dysfunction. FindingsCompared to patients without immune dysfunction, PWH and SOT had a greater likelihood of having ED visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.29; aOR: 2.61, CI: 2.58-2.65, respectively), requiring ventilation or ECMO (aOR: 1.43, CI: 1.43-1.43; aOR: 4.82, CI: 4.78-4.86, respectively), and death (aOR: 1.20, CI: 1.19-1.20; aOR: 3.38, CI: 3.35-3.41, respectively). Associations were independent of sociodemographic and comorbidity burden. Compared to PWH with CD4>500 cells/mm3, PWH with CD4<350 cells/mm3 were independently at 4.4-, 5.4-, and 7.6-times higher odds for hospitalization, requiring ventilation, and death, respectively. Increased COVID-19 severity was associated with higher levels of HIV viremia. InterpretationIndividuals with immune dysfunction have greater risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. More advanced HIV disease (greater immunosuppression and HIV viremia) was associated with higher odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Appropriate prevention and treatment strategies should be investigated to reduce the higher morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 among PWH and SOT.","Sun, Jing; Patel, Rena C.; Zheng, Qulu; Madhira, Vithal; Olex, Amy L.; Islam, Jessica Y.; French, Evan; Chiang, Teresa Po-Yu; Akselrod, Hana; Moffitt, Richard; Alexander, G.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics over 10 months in 963 individuals who predominantly experienced mild COVID-19. Investigating 2,146 samples, we initially detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of individuals demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, with these ""elite neutralizers"" also possessing SARS-CoV-1 cross-neutralizing IgG. Multivariate statistical modeling revealed age, symptomatic infection, disease severity, and gender as key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity. A loss of reactivity to the virus spike protein was observed in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Neutralizing activity had half-lives of 14.7 weeks in serum versus 31.4 weeks in purified IgG, indicating a rather long-term IgG antibody response. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum in the initial SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody response, with sustained antibodies in most individuals for 10 months after mild COVID-19.","Vanshylla, Kanika; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Kleipass, Franziska; Dewald, Felix; Schommers, Philipp; Gieselmann, Lutz; Gruell, Henning; Schlotz, Maike; Ercanoglu, Meryem S; Stumpf, Ricarda; Mayer, Petra; Zehner, Matthias; Heger, Eva; Johannis, Wibke; Horn, Carola; Suárez, Isabelle; Jung, Norma; Salomon, Susanne; Eberhardt, Kirsten Alexandra; Gathof, Birgit; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Pfeifer, Nico; Eggeling, Ralf; Augustin, Max; Lehmann, Clara; Klein, Florian",Cell host microbe,,337

This study aimed to systematically review the factors associated with COVID-19 in people with PD. METHODS: The search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until November 2020 (updated until April 1, 2021). Observational studies that analyzed factors associated with COVID-19 in people with PD were selected and revised. RESULTS: The authors included six studies (4 case-controlled studies and 2 cross-sectional studies) in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses. Authors found that the following factors were associated with COVID-19 in people with PD: obesity (OR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.99, I2 : 0%), any pulmonary disease (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3.15, I2 : 0%), COVID-19 contact (OR: 41.77, 95% CI: 4.77 - 365.56, I2 : 0%), vitamin D supplementation (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.83, I2 : 0%), hospitalization (OR: 11.78, 95% CI: 6.27 to 22.12, I2 : 0%), and death (OR: 11.23, 95% CI: 3.92 to 32.18, I2 : 0%). Authors did not find significant association between COVID-19 and hypertension, diabetes, cardiopathy, cancer, any cognitive problem, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal or hepatic disease, smoking, and tremor.

436888,"After a Year, SARS-COV-2 is Not Well Known",2021,"OBJECTIVES: As China is facing a potential second wave of the epidemic, we reviewed and evaluated the intervention measures implemented in a major metropolitan city, Shenzhen, during the early phase of Wuhan lockdown. STUDY DESIGN: Based on the classic SEITR model and combined with population mobility, a compartmental model was constructed to simulate the transmission of COVID-19 and disease progression in the Shenzhen population. METHODS: Based on published epidemiological data on COVID-19 and population mobility data from Baidu Qianxi, we constructed a compartmental model to evaluate the impact of work and traffic resumption on the epidemic in Shenzhen in various scenarios. RESULTS: Imported cases account for most (58.6%) of the early reported cases in Shenzhen. We demonstrated that with strict inflow population control and a high level of mask usage after work resumption, various resumptions resulted in only an insignificant difference in the number of cumulative infections. Shenzhen may experience this second wave of infections approximately two weeks after the traffic resumption if the incidence risk in Hubei is high at the moment of resumption. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the work resumption strategy adopted in Shenzhen, the risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 after its reopening was limited. The strict control of imported cases and extensive use of facial masks play a key role in COVID-19 prevention.","Bai, Lu; Lu, Haonan; Hu, Hailin; Smith, M Kumi; Harripersaud, Katherine; Lipkova, Veronika; Wen, Yujin; Guo, Xiuyan; Peng, Wei; Liu, Chenwei; Shen, Mingwang; Shen, Alfred Chixiong; Zhang, Lei",Public Health,,337

Using the Branded Product Database, ingredient lists were searched for ""potassium"" to identify products containing additives. For products listing potassium content, accuracy of potassium content reporting and how potassium content differed with additive use was also assessed. A total of 239,089 products were included, 35,102 (14.7%) contained potassium additives, and 13,685 (5.7%) provided potassium content. Potassium additives were most commonly found in dairy products, supplements, and mixed foods (at 37%, 34%, and 28%, respectively).

Neutrophils, usually regarded as first responders in inflammation, are a key presence in the gut mucosal inflammatory milieu in IBD. Here, we review the role of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as a potential effector disease mechanism. NETs are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins and oxidative enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain pathogens. NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; and recently, as a major tissue damaging process involved in the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. NETs are pertinent as a defence mechanism at the gut mucosal interphase exposed to high levels of bacteria, viruses and fungi. On the other hand, NETs can also potentiate and perpetuate gut inflammation. In this review, we discuss the broad protective vs. pathogenic roles of NETs, explanatory factors that could lead to an increase in NET formation in IBD and how NETs may contribute to gut inflammation and IBD-related complications. Finally, we summarise therapeutic opportunities to target NETs in IBD.","Drury, Broc; Hardisty, Gareth; Gray, Robert D; Ho, Gwo-Tzer",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,,337

Here, we present in vitro evidence for significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by oleandrin and a defined extract of N. oleander (designated as PBI-06150). Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic (pre-infection) oleandrin (as either the pure compound or as the active principal ingredient in PBI-06150) administration at concentrations as low as 0.05 µg/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 µg/ml concentration resulted in a greater than 3000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values were 11.98 ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 h post-infection, and 7.07 ng/ml measured at 48 h post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with 0.1 µg/ml and 0.05 µg/ml concentrations causing greater than 100-fold reduction as measured at 48 h, and the 0.05 µg/ml concentration resulting in a 78-fold reduction. Concentrations of oleandrin up to 10 µg/ml were well tolerated in Vero cells. We also present in vivo evidence of the safety and efficacy of defined N. oleander extract (PBI-06150), which was administered to golden Syrian hamsters in a preparation containing as high as 130 µg/ml of oleandrin. In comparison to administration of control vehicle, PBI-06150 provided a statistically significant reduction of the viral titer in the nasal turbinates (nasal conchae). The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here, together with initial evidence of its safety and efficacy in a relevant hamster model of COVID-19, support the further development of oleandrin and/or defined extracts containing this molecule for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and associated COVID-19 disease and potentially also for reduction of virus spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.","Plante, Kenneth S; Dwivedi, Varun; Plante, Jessica A; Fernandez, Diana; Mirchandani, Divya; Bopp, Nathen; Aguilar, Patricia V; Park, Jun-Gyu; Tamayo, Paula Pino; Delgado, Jennifer; Shivanna, Vinay; Torrelles, Jordi B; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Matos, Rick; Weaver, Scott C; Sastry, K Jagannadha; Newman, Robert A",Biomed Pharmacother,,337

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe social disruption both from health and economic standpoints. Law enforcement personnel have been significantly involved in helping to face the many difficulties due to the pandemic. Police officers have been subjected to further stress from managing social restrictions imposed by governments to contain the pandemic. The Italian State Police steadily approximate 100,000 people aged 25-65 years: 14 subjects (mean age 43.64 years) died by suicide in 2015, 7 (mean age 47.5 years) in 2016, 13 (mean age 45.62 years) in 2017, 10 (mean age 48.1 years) in 2018, 18 (mean age 46.78 years) in 2019, and 12 (mean age 52 years) in 2020. Our records excluded significant changes in suicide incidence rate within 2015-2020 (till December 2020).

In the second part of our review we provide an overview about frequently reported symptoms, such as myalgia as well as defined disorders, such as rhabdomyolysis, myositis, myasthenia and intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness, which have been described during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections or COVID-19.Furthermore, the criteria for a causality, such as association strength, plausibility, time course, and experimental evidence for a causal association that should be applied for the COVID-19-asssociated neuromuscular conditions described in the two parts of the review are discussed. At present, in addition to anosmia, which is also known in the lay press, myalgia in particular as a nonspecific symptom are frequent sequelae of a symptomatic SARS-CoV­2 infection. Other neuromuscular complications seem to be principally plausible (considering the pathogenesis) but apparently rare consequences of a SARS-CoV­2 infection. Prospective or cohort studies are necessary to confirm a causality and assess the risk.","Lehmann, Helmar C; Schoser, Benedikt; Wunderlich, Gilbert; Berlit, Peter; Fink, Gereon R",Nervenarzt,,337

443752,The investigation of mRNA vaccines formulated in liposomes administrated in multiple routes against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: The social identity model of risk taking proposes that people take more risks with ingroup members because they trust them more. While this can be beneficial in some circumstances, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it has the potential to undermine an effective public health response if people underestimate the risk of contagion posed by ingroup members, or overestimate the risk of vaccines or treatments developed by outgroup members. METHODS: Three studies (two prospective surveys, one experiment) with community-based adults tested the potential for the social identity model of risk taking to explain risk perception and risk taking in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Study 1 was a two-wave study with a pre-COVID baseline, and found that people who identified more strongly as a member of their neighborhood pre-COVID tended to trust their neighbors more, and perceive interacting with them during COVID-19 lockdown to be less risky. Study 2 (N = 2033) replicated these findings in a two-wave nationally representative Australian sample. Study 3 (N = 216) was a pre-registered experiment which found that people indicated greater willingness to take a vaccine, and perceived it to be less risky, when it was developed by an ingroup compared to an outgroup source. We interpret this as evidence that the tendency to trust ingroup members more could be harnessed to enhance the COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Across all three studies, ingroup members were trusted more and were perceived to pose less health risk. These findings are discussed with a focus on how group processes can be more effectively incorporated into public health policy, both for the current pandemic and for future contagious disease threats.","Cruwys, Tegan; Stevens, Mark; Donaldson, Jessica L; Cárdenas, Diana; Platow, Michael J; Reynolds, Katherine J; Fong, Polly",BMC Public Health,,337

445621,IgV somatic mutation of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies governs neutralization and breadth of reactivity,2021,"If maternal milk is unavailable, the World Health Organization recommends that the first alternative should be pasteurised donor human milk (DHM). Human milk banks (HMBs) screen and recruit milk donors, and DHM principally feeds very low birth weight babies, reducing the risk of complications and supporting maternal breastfeeding where used alongside optimal lactation support. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a range of challenges to HMBs worldwide. This study aimed to understand the impacts of the pandemic on HMB services and develop initial guidance regarding risk limitation. A Virtual Collaborative Network (VCN) comprising over 80 HMB leaders from 36 countries was formed in March 2020 and included academics and nongovernmental organisations. Individual milk banks, national networks and regional associations submitted data regarding the number of HMBs, volume of DHM produced and number of recipients in each global region. Estimates were calculated in the context of missing or incomplete data. Through open-ended questioning, the experiences of milk banks from each country in the first 2 months of the pandemic were collected and major themes identified. According to data collected from 446 individual HMBs, more than 800,000 infants receive DHM worldwide each year. Seven pandemic-related specific vulnerabilities to service provision were identified, including sufficient donors, prescreening disruption, DHM availability, logistics, communication, safe handling and contingency planning, which were highly context-dependent. The VCN now plans a formal consensus approach to the optimal response of HMBs to new pathogens using crowdsourced data, enabling the benchmarking of future strategies to support DHM access and neonatal health in future emergencies.","Shenker, Natalie; Staff, Marta; Vickers, Amy; Aprigio, Joao; Tiwari, Satish; Nangia, Sushma; Sachdeva, Ruchika Chugh; Clifford, Vanessa; Coutsoudis, Anna; Reimers, Penny; Israel-Ballard, Kiersten; Mansen, Kimberly; Mileusnic-Milenovic, Radmila; Wesolowska, Aleksandra; Goudoever, Johannes B van; Hosseini, Mohammadbagher; Klotz, Daniel; Grøvslien, Anne Hagen; Weaver, Gillian",Matern Child Nutr,,337

446890,The first 2 months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Yemen: Analysis of the surveillance data,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","Liu, Qian; Zheng, Zequan; Zheng, Jiabin; Chen, Qiuyi; Liu, Guan; Chen, Sihan; Chu, Bojia; Zhu, Hongyu; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit",J Med Internet Res,,337

Both the microbial turnover time (MTT) and metabolic efficiency are closely related to RPE. However, changes in MTT, metabolic efficiency and RPE in response to nitrogen (N) fertilization at different levels and the associations between these factors during plant growth are unknown. The effects of N fertilization at different levels (0, 150 and 300 kg N ha-1) on RPE and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in maize (Zea mays L.) grown in paddy soil using a 13Carbon (C) natural abundance method. The RPE varied from -1.49 to 15.93 mg C kg-1 soil day-1, with significant effects at different levels of N fertilization, growth stages and interactions between these factors. Nitrogen fertilization reduced microbial C:N imbalance and soil pH. During the plant growth periods, the RPE was initially low because the microbes preferentially utilized plant-derived C, but later increased due to trade-offs between microbial N acquisition and acidity stress alleviation under N fertilization. The soil microbes altered their MTT and metabolic efficiency with changes in the microbial community structure to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis and adapt to acidity stress. RPE was lowest whereas MTT and metabolic efficiency were highest with N fertilization at 150 kg N ha-1. Changes in MTT and metabolic efficiency explained 84.5% of the variations in the RPE, and the latter had greater impact (55.8%) than the former (28.7%). Changes in MTT and metabolic efficiency to cope with microbial resource acquisition and acidity stress under N fertilization represent an important pathway for RPE regulation in paddy soil. These findings highlight the significance of MTT and metabolic efficiency in RPE regulation for optimization of the N fertilization level to mitigate soil C losses.","Chen, Pengfei; Mo, Chaoyang; He, Chao; Cui, Hao; Lin, Jingdong; Yang, Jingping",Sci Total Environ,,337
450782,Dried SARS-CoV-2 virus maintains infectivity to Vero E6 cells for up to 48 h,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a very high number of casualties in the general population. Assessing the exact magnitude of this number is a non-trivial problem, as relying only on officially reported COVID-19 associated fatalities runs the risk of incurring in several kinds of biases. One of the ways to approach the issue is to compare overall mortality during the pandemic with expected mortality computed using the observed mortality figures of previous years. In this paper, we build on existing methodology and propose two ways to compute expected as well as excess mortality, namely at the weekly and at the yearly level. Particular focus is put on the role of age, which plays a central part in both COVID-19-associated and overall mortality. We illustrate our methods by making use of age-stratified mortality data from the years 2016 to 2020 in Germany to compute age group-specific excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.","Nicola, Giacomo De; Kauermann, Goran; Hohle, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13827v1.pdf,337

One major challenge in tackling RNA viruses is the fact they are extremely genetically diverse. Nevertheless, they share common features that include their dependence on host cells for replication, and high mutation rates. We set out to search for shared evolutionary characteristics that may aid in gaining a broader understanding of RNA virus evolution, and constructed a phylogeny-based dataset spanning thousands of sequences from diverse single-stranded RNA viruses of animals. Strikingly, we found that the vast majority of these viruses have a skewed nucleotide composition, manifested as adenine rich (A-rich) coding sequences. In order to test whether A-richness is driven by selection or by biased mutation processes, we harnessed the effects of incomplete purifying selection at the tips of virus phylogenies. Our results revealed consistent mutational biases towards U rather than A in genomes of all viruses. In +ssRNA viruses we found that this bias is compensated by selection against U and selection for A, which leads to A-rich genomes. In -ssRNA viruses the genomic mutational bias towards U on the negative strand manifests as A-rich coding sequences, on the positive strand. We investigated possible reasons for the advantage of A-rich sequences including weakened RNA secondary structures, codon usage bias, and selection for a particular amino-acid composition, and conclude that host immune pressures may have led to similar biases in coding sequence composition across very divergent RNA viruses.","Kustin, Talia; Stern, Adi",Mol. biol. evol,,337

Preventive policies differ all over the world as well as over different periods of time, and depend mostly on current infection rates. In Germany, there were two periods of restraint of varying severity, during which the government used different combinations of containment and mitigation measures to protect risk groups and to lower the number of hospitalizations. METHODS: In two online studies, we aimed to determine differences and similarities in COVID-19-related fear, generalized anxiety, depression and distress levels, as well as in the adherence to safety behaviour between the first lockdown in March and April and the second lockdown in November. RESULTS: This study showed continued high psychological burden and even increased levels of depression symptoms, as well as less safety behaviour in the second phase of restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The results hint at a prolonged negative impact on people's mental health and their safety behaviour despite lesser restrictions in the second lockdown, which may be interpreted as pandemic fatigue and hence strengthens the argument for a low-threshold access to psychological care.","Moradian, Sheila; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Musche, Venja; Kohler, Hannah; Fink, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Benecke, Anke-Verena; Dörrie, Nora; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin",J. public health (Oxf),,337

454303,Digging metagenomic data of pangolins revealed SARS-CoV-2 related viruses and other significant viruses,2020,"Background: Meeting the needs of people bereaved by COVID-19 poses a substantial challenge to palliative care. The Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) is a 5-item mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief during the pandemic. Objective: The PGS has strong psychometric and diagnostic features. The objective was to examine the incremental validity of the PGS in identifying mourners at risk of harmful outcomes. Design: A cross-sectional survey design involving sociodemographic questions and self-report measures of pandemic grief, generalized anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, separation distress, functional impairment, meaning-making difficulties, and substance use coping. Setting/Subjects: A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 1065) in the United States. Results: Fully 56.6% of participants scored above the cut score of &gt;=7 on the PGS for clinically dysfunctional pandemic grief and 69.7% coped with their loss using drugs or alcohol for at least several days in past two weeks. PGS scores were not associated with time since loss. Hierarchical multiple regression models demonstrated that the PGS uniquely explained variance in functional impairment, meaning-making difficulties, and substance use coping, over relevant background factors, bereavement-related psychopathology, and separation distress. In the final model, the standardized regression coefficients for the PGS were 2-15 times larger than for the other competing measures in explaining each of the three outcomes. Conclusions: The findings underscore the clinical utility of this short and easy-to-use measure in identifying risk of deleterious outcomes across a range of functional and behavioral domains.","Lee, S.

455208,Foundation and Clinical Evaluation of a New Method for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 Antigen by Fluorescent Microsphere Immunochromatography,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented demand for ICUs, with the need to triage admissions along with the development of ICU triage criteria. However, how these criteria relate to outcomes in patients already admitted to the ICU is unknown, as is the incremental ICU capacity that triage of these patients might create given existing admission practices. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the short- and long-term survival of low- vs high-priority patients for ICU admission according to current pandemic triage criteria? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study analyzed prospectively collected registry data (2007-2018) in 23 ICUs in Victoria, Australia, with probabilistic linkage with death registries. After excluding elective surgery, admissions were stratified according to existing ICU triage protocol prioritization as low (age > 85 years, or severe chronic illness, or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score = 0 or &#8805; 12), medium (SOFA score = 8-11) or high (SOFA score = 1-7) priority. The primary outcome was long-term survival. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS) and bed-day usage. RESULTS: This study examined 126,687 ICU admissions. After 5 years of follow-up, 1,093 of 3,296 (33%; 95% CI, 32-34) of ""low-priority"" patients aged > 85 years or with severe chronic illness and 86 of 332 (26%; 95% CI, 24-28) with a SOFA score &#8805; 12 were still alive. Sixty-three of 290 (22%; 95% CI, 17-27) of patients in these groups followed up for 10 years were still alive. Together, low-priority patients accounted for 27% of all ICU bed-days and had lower in-hospital mortality (22%) than the high-priority patients (28%). Among nonsurvivors, low-priority admissions had shorter ICU LOS than medium- or high-priority admissions. INTERPRETATION: Current SOFA score or age or severe comorbidity-based ICU pandemic triage protocols exclude patients with a close to 80% hospital survival, a > 30% five-year survival, and 27% of ICU bed-day use. These findings imply the need for stronger evidence-based ICU triage protocols.","Darvall, Jai N; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Bailey, Michael; Anstey, James; Pilcher, David",Chest,,337

456334,SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Pandemic: Now Is the Right Time to Stop Smoking,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hit the European region disproportionately. Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries. METHODS: The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group was established in February 2016 to review standards of care for HIV in the region. The group consists of professionals actively involved in HIV care. On March 19, 2020 we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. For this purpose, we constructed an online survey consisting of 23 questions. Respondents were recruited from ECEE members in 22 countries, based on their involvement in HIV care, and contacted via email. RESULTS: In total, 19 countries responded: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Most of the respondents were infectious disease physicians directly involved in HIV care (17/19). No country reported HIV clinic closures. HIV clinics were operating normally in only six countries (31.6%). In 11 countries (57.9%) physicians were sharing HIV and COVID-19 care duties. None of the countries expected shortage of ART in the following 2 weeks; however, five physicians expressed uncertainty about the following 2 months. At the time of providing responses, ten countries (52.6%) had HIV-positive persons under quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of resources is evident, with an impact on HIV care inevitable. We need to prepare to operate with minimal medical resources, with the aim of securing constant supplies of ART. Non-governmental organizations should re-evaluate their earlier objectives and support efforts to ensure continuity of ART delivery.","Kowalska, J D; Skrzat-Klapaczynska, A; Bursa, D; Balayan, T; Begovac, J; Chkhartishvili, N; Gokengin, D; Harxhi, A; Jilich, D; Jevtovic, D; Kase, K; Lakatos, B; Matulionyte, R; Mulabdic, V; Nagit, A; Papadopoulos, A; Stefanovic, M; Vassilenko, A; Vasylyev, M; Yancheva, N; Yurin, O; Horban, A",Int J Infect Dis,,337
456335,SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Pandemic: Now Is the Right Time to Stop Smoking,2020,"Weeds have been a major threat in agriculture for several generations as they lead to decreases in productivity and cause significant economic losses. Parasitic plants are a specific type of weed causing losses in crops of great relevance. A new strategy has emerged in the fight against parasitic plants, which is called 'suicidal germination' or the 'honey-pot strategy'. Regarding the problem of weed control from an ecological point of view, it is interesting to investigate new natural compounds with allelopathic activity with the aim of developing new natural herbicides that can inhibit the growth of weeds without damaging the environment. Safflower crops have been affected by parasitic plants and weeds and, as a consequence, the secondary metabolites exuded by safflower roots have been studied. The sesquiterpene lactone dehydrocostuslactone was isolated and characterised, and the structurally related costunolide was identified by UHPLC-MS/MS in safflower root exudates. These sesquiterpene lactones have been shown to stimulate germination of Phelipanche ramosa and Orobanche cumana seeds. In addition, these compounds were phytotoxic on three important weeds in agriculture, namely Lolium perenne, Lolium rigidum and Echinochloa crus-galli. The exudation of the strigolactones solanacol and fabacyl acetate have also been confirmed by UHPLC-MS/MS. The study reported here contributes to our knowledge of the ecological role played by some secondary metabolites. Moreover, this knowledge could help identify new models for the development of future agrochemicals based on natural products.","Rial, Carlos; Tomé, Sonia; Varela, Rosa M; Molinillo, José M G; Macías, Francisco A",J. chem. ecol,,337

Despite all the containment measures in place, experts opine that this novel coronavirus is here to stay as a pandemic or an endemic. Hence, it is apt to be prepared for the confrontation and its aftermath. From protecting the vulnerable individuals to providing quality care for all health conditions and maintaining essential drug supplies, it is going to be a grueling voyage. Preparedness to sustain optimal care for each health condition is a must. With a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease in infants, need of high-dose hormonal therapy with a concern of consequent severe disease, presence of comorbidities, and a need for frequent investigations and follow-up; children with West syndrome constitute a distinctive group with special concerns. In this viewpoint, we discuss the important issues and concerns related to the management of West syndrome during COVID-19 pandemic in the South Asian context and provide potential solutions to these concerns based on the current evidence, adeptness, and consensus. Some plausible solutions include the continuation of containment and mitigation measures for COVID-19, therapeutic decision- making for West syndrome based on risk stratification, and tele-epileptology.","Sahu, Jitendra Kumar; Madaan, Priyanka; Chand, Prem; Kumar, Amit; Linn, Kyaw; Mynak, Mimi Lhamu; Poudel, Prakash; Wanigasinghe, Jithangi",Epilepsy Res,,337
457774,TLR4 as a therapeutic target for respiratory and neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"A new infectious disease, COVID-19, has spread around the world. The most common symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are cough and fever, but severe cases can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human tissue is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and the lungs, heart, and kidneys are the most affected organs. Besides the inflammatory process and tissue damage, the presence of a cytokine ""storm"" has been related to a higher mortality rate. Other infectious viral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and influenza, were associated with complications in pregnant women, such as growth restriction, malformation, preterm birth, low birth weight, miscarriage, and death, although they can also cause developmental disorders in infants and adolescents. Evidence points out that stressors during pregnancy and infancy may lead to the development of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we hypothesize that COVID-19 infection during the critical phases of development can program the individual to chronic diseases in adulthood. It is important that COVID-19 patients receive proper monitoring as a way to avoid expensive costs to public health in the future.","Saavedra, L. P. J.; Prates, K. V.; Gonçalves, G.

461523,Young infants exhibit robust functional antibody responses and restrained IFN-Î³ production to SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Zika virus has emerged as a potential threat to human health globally. A previous drug repurposing screen identified the approved anthelminthic drug niclosamide as a small molecule inhibitor of Zika virus infection. However, as antihelminthic drugs are generally designed to have low absorption when dosed orally, the very limited bioavailability of niclosamide will likely hinder its potential direct repurposing as an antiviral medication. Here, we conducted SAR studies focusing on the anilide and salicylic acid regions of niclosamide to improve physicochemical properties such as microsomal metabolic stability, permeability and solubility. We found that the 5-bromo substitution in the salicylic acid region retains potency while providing better drug-like properties. Other modifications in the anilide region with 2'-OMe and 2'-H substitutions were also advantageous. We found that the 4'-NO2 substituent can be replaced with a 4'-CN or 4'-CF3 substituents. Together, these modifications provide a basis for optimizing the structure of niclosamide to improve systemic exposure for application of niclosamide analogs as drug lead candidates for treating Zika and other viral infections. Indeed, key analogs were also able to rescue cells from the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shamim, Khalida; Xu, Miao; Hu, Xin; Lee, Emily M; Lu, Xiao; Huang, Ruili; Shah, Pranav; Xu, Xin; Chen, Catherine Z; Shen, Min; Guo, Hui; Chen, Lu; Itkin, Zina; Eastman, Richard T; Shinn, Paul; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Michael, Sam; Simeonov, Anton; Lo, Donald C; Ming, Guo-Li; Song, Hongjun; Tang, Hengli; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Wenwei",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,,337

We present our February 2021 results here.We aimed to improve trainee confidence in conducting remote psychiatric assessments by at least 40%, to ensure effective and safe patient care during their 6 months placement.MethodOur discovery process included surveying trainees in April 2020 to explore experiences with remote psychiatric consultations, a literature search of current UK guidance and a local audit. The audit reviewed documentation of consent to remote consultations, with reference to standards as per NHS England remote consultation guidance. Key change ideas included publication of an article, ‘Remote consultations – top tips for clinical practitioners’, video-simulated remote consultations and a session on remote consultations in the trainee induction.In the first ‘plan-do-study-act’ (PDSA) cycle, we presented key findings from the article in a video presentation, which was sent trust-wide. We measured confidence in conducting remote assessments pre- and post-presentation via a feedback survey. Unfortunately, response rates were low and in the second PDSA cycle we targeted a smaller cohort of trainees at the August 2020 induction, although encountered similar difficulties. In the third PDSA cycle, we collected real-time data using an interactive app at the February 2021 trainee induction, and measured pre- and post- confidence following a presentation and a video-simulated remote consultation.Result2/34 respondents had accessed previous remote psychiatric consultation training and12/35 had some telepsychiatry experience. Pre-induction trainee confidence results revealed: extremely uncomfortable (16%), not confident (31%), neutral (47%), confident (6%) and very confident (0%) and post-induction confidence was 0%, 22%, 52%, 26% and 0%, respectively.ConclusionOur project started during the first peak of the pandemic, which may be a reason for initial limited response rates. Our results suggest that the remote psychiatric consultation trainee induction session has shown some improvement in trainee confidence;the ‘confident’ cohort improved from 6% to 26%.Our next steps include collecting similar real-time data, mid-rotation and uploading video-simulated remote consultations to the Trust Intranet. We plan to complete the local audit cycle. We also plan to incorporate patient experience (from an ongoing systematic review) to inform a potential triage process post-pandemic, choosing between face-to-face versus remote consultations.","Moir, Rachel Ramkisson Roshelle Seri Abraham Matheiken Shevonne",BJPsych Open,,337

At present, diagnosis COVID-19 were based on real-time RT-PCR, which have to be performed in biosafe laboratory and is unsatisfactory for suspect case screening. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body detection in suspected COVID-19 cases. METHODS: In the prospective cohort, 150 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang province, China, between January 20 to February 2, 2020. All patients were tested by the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for COVID-19. At least two samples of each patient were collected for RT-PCR assay analysis, and the PCR results were performed as the reference standard of diagnosis. Meanwhile 26 heathy blood donor were recruited. The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated. Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity. RESULTS: The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993]. In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result. In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970]. CONCLUSIONS: The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19.

For instance, in Italy, in weeks before the national lockdown started, a state of emergency was declared but everyday life was going on as always, the sentiment toward the Chinese community changed: their restaurants were left empty, more and more parents did not want their children to go to school if they had a Chinese classmate, and a high-profile politician said on TV that 'we have all seen them eat live mice'.","Chopra, K K; Arora, V K",Indian J Tuberc,,337

Myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) exist in two different forms, granulocyte (G-MDSCs) and monocytic (M-MDSCs) that both suppress T-cell function. Serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels seem to correlate with the number of blood MDSCs. ObjectiveTo determine the frequency of MDSCs in severe COVID-19 patients from Iran and their correlations with serum IL-8 levels. Methods37 severe (8 on ventilation, 29 without ventilation) and 13 moderate COVID-19 patients together with 8 healthy subjects were enrolled at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran-Iran between 10th April 2020-9th March 2021. Clinical and biochemical features, serum and whole blood were obtained. CD14, CD15, CD11b and HLA-DR expression on MDSCs was measured by flow cytometry. ResultsM-MDSCs (P[≤]0.0001) and G-MDSCs (P[≤]0.0001) frequency were higher in Iranian COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects. M-MDSC frequency was higher in non-ventilated compared to moderate COVID-19 subjects (P=0.004). Serum IL-8 levels were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in normal healthy subjects (P=0.03). IL8 level was significant difference in ventilated, non-ventilated and moderate patients (P=0.005). The frequency of G-MDSCs correlated negatively with INR (r=-0.39, P=0.02). ConclusionSerum IL-8 levels did not correlate with the number of systemic MDSCs in COVID-19 patients. The highest levels of M-MDSCs were seen in the blood of severe non-ventilated patients. MDSC frequency in blood in the current study did not predict the survival and severity of COVID-19 patients.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; movassaghi, mehrnaz; Bassir, Ali; Dezfuli, Neda K; Roofchayee, Neda D; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Garssen, Johan; Adcock, Ian M.

470800,SARS-CoV-2 in soils,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 required rapid innovation in health systems, in the context of an infection which placed healthcare professionals at high risk; general practice has been a key component of that innovative response. In Ireland, GPs were asked to work in a network of community assessment hubs. A focused training programme in infection control procedures/clinical use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was rapidly developed in advance. University departments of general practice were asked to develop and deliver that training. AIM: The aim of this article is to describe infection control procedure training in Ireland, the uptake by GPs and the initial experience of GPs working in this unusual environment. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two anonymous cross-sectional online surveys are sent to participants in training courses. METHOD: Survey 1 followed completion of training; survey 2 followed establishment of the hubs. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-five participants (including 439 GPs, 156 GP registrars) took part in the training. Two hundred thirty-nine (50.3%) out of four hundred seventy-five responded to Survey 1-over 95% reported an increase in confidence in the use of PPE. Two hundred ten (44.2%) out of four hundred seventy-five participants responded to Survey 2; 195 had completed hub shifts. Younger, female GPs predominated. Very high levels of infection control procedures were reported. Participants commented positively on teamworking, environment and systems. However, 'real-time' ambulance service data suggest the peak of the surge may have passed by the time the hubs were established. CONCLUSION: Academic departments, GPs and the Irish health system collaborated effectively to respond to the need for community assessment of COVID-19 patients.","Bury, Gerard; Smith, Susan; Kelly, Maureen; Bradley, Colin; Howard, William; Egan, Mairead",Ir. j. med. sci,,337

In addition to damaging the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 may also damage the heart and this is corroborated by the evidence that cardiovascular comorbidities are associated with a higher mortality and poor clinical outcomes in patient infected by the virus. During the infection myocardial injury, myocarditis and arrhythmias have also been reported, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of these complications are yet to be understood. Great attention is also being posed on the potential beneficial/harmful role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as far as the virus binds to ACE2 to infect cells, but evidences lack. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can also affect the aspect of acute coronary syndromes, not only because these two distinct pathological entities share pathogenic aspects (such as the systemic inflammatory state and cytokine release), but also and above all for the consequences that the need to contain the infection has on the management of cardiological urgencies. The aim of this review was therefore to summarize the relationship between the virus and the cardiovascular system.","Cappannoli, Luigi; Scacciavillani, Roberto; Iannaccone, Giulia; Anastasia, Gianluca; Di Giusto, Federico; Loria, Valentina; Aspromonte, Nadia",,,337

As RNA viruses have a high mutation rate therefore we wanted to identify whether this virus is also prone to mutations. For this reason we selected four major structural (Spike protein (S), Envelope protein (E), Membrane glycoprotein (M), Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N)) and ORF8 protein of 100 different SARS-CoV-2 isolates of fifteen countries from NCBI database and compared these to the reference sequence, Wuhan NC_045512.2, which was the first isolate of SARS-CoV-2 that was sequenced. By multiple sequence alignment of amino acids, we observed substitutions and deletion in S protein at 13 different sites in the isolates of five countries (China, USA, Finland, India and Australia) as compared to the reference sequence. Similarly, alignment of N protein revealed substitutions at three different sites in isolates of China, Spain and Japan. M protein exhibits substitution only in one isolates from USA, however, no mutation was observed in E protein of any isolate. Interestingly, in ORF8 substitution of Leucine, a nonpolar to Serine a polar amino acid at same position (aa84 L to S) in 23 isolates of five countries i.e. China, USA, Spain, Taiwan and India were observed, which may affect the conformation of peptides. Thus, we observed several mutations in the isolates thereafter the first sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolate, NC_045512.2, which suggested that this virus might be a threat to the whole world and therefore further studies are needed to characterize how these mutations in different proteins affect the functionality and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Shah, Abdullah; Rashid, Farooq; Aziz, Abdul; Jan, Amin Ullah; Suleman, Muhammad",Gene Rep,,337

Affected patients test strongly positive in PF4/polyanion enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and serum-induced platelet activation is maximal in the presence of PF4. We determined the frequency of anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies in healthy vaccinees and assessed whether PF4/polyanion EIA-positive sera exhibit platelet-activating properties after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=138) or BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer; n=143). In total, 19 of 281 participants tested positive for anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies post-vaccination (All: 6.8% [95%CI, 4.4-10.3]; BNT162b2: 5.6% [95%CI, 2.9-10.7]; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 8.0% [95%CI, 4.5-13.7%]). Optical densities were mostly low (between 0.5-1.0 units; reference range, <0.50) and none of the PF4/polyanion EIA-positive samples induced platelet activation in the presence of PF4. We conclude that positive PF4/polyanion EIAs can occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with both mRNA- and adenoviral vector-based vaccines, but the majority of these antibodies likely have minor (if any) clinical relevance. Accordingly, low-titer positive PF4/polyanion EIA results should be interpreted with caution when screening asymptomatic individuals after vaccination against Covid-19.

475416,SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development,2020,"RNA genomes from coronavirus have a length as long as 32 kilobases, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has long sequences which made the analysis difficult. Over 20,000 sequences have been submitted to GISAID, and the number is growing fast each day which increased the difficulties in data analysis; however, genome sequence analysis is critical in understanding the COVID-19 and preventing the spread of the disease. In this study, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the aligned large size genome sequences and the numerical numbers were converted from the letters using a published method designed for protein sequence cluster analysis. The study initialized with a shortlist sequence testing, and the PCA score plot showed high tolerance with low-quality data, and the major virus sequences from humans were separated from the pangolin and bat samples. Our study also successfully built a model for a large number of sequences with more than 20,000 sequences which indicate the potential mutation directions for the COVID-19 which can be served as a pretreatment method for detailed studies such as decision tree-based methods. In summary, our study provided a fast tool to analyze the high-volume genome sequences such as the COVID-19 and successfully applied to more than 20,000 sequences which may provide mutation direction information for COVID-19 studies.","Wang, Bo; Jiang, Lin",Cognit Comput,,337

Case Presentation: We describe the first case, to the authors' knowledge, of the novel SARS CoV-2 infection and combined AIN and ITP in a healthy 27-year-old male. Conclusion: Viruses have been known to trigger autoimmune diseases in people with genetic predisposition. We speculate that the patient's selective IgM deficiency predisposed him to have autoimmune cytopenia, and SARS-COV-2 triggered him to acquire combined AIN and ITP. Our hypothesis is supported by a lack of evidence of malignancy, a normal morphology on the smear, and an immediate response to IVIG infusion with significant improvement in platelet and neutrophilic count.","Rizvi, Munaza Batool Medar Shivanand S.",European Journal of Medical Case Reports,,337

Guidance, information and best practices have been characterized by territorial thinking with concentration on national health system and social contexts. Information was to a large extent provided from global entities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others. This bipolar response mechanism came to the detriment of regional and sub-regional levels. The development of the global pandemic was evaluated in terms of the performance of single countries without trying to reflect on possible regional or sub-regional results of similar characteristics in health system and social contexts. To have a clearer view of the issue of sub-regional similarities, we examined the WHO, Eastern Mediterranean Region. When examining the development of confirmed cases for countries in the region, we identified four different sub-groups similar in the development of the pandemic and the social distancing measure implemented. Despite the complicated situation, these groups gave space for thinking outside the box of traditional outbreaks or pandemic response. We think that this sub-regional approach could be very effective in addressing more characteristics and not geographically based analysis. Furthermore, this can be an area of additional conceptual approaches, modelling and concrete platforms for information and lessons learned exchange.","Ali Maher, Osama; Elamein Boshara, Mohamed Abdalla; Pichierri, Giuseppe; Cegolon, Luca; Panu Napodano, Catello Mario; Murgia, Paola; Bellizzi, Saverio",J Infect Dev Ctries,,337

The results are analysed under the theoretical framework of the Stockholm Paradigm using IBM simulations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen population and the possible role of Ecological Fitting. The simulations suggest that all three parameters positively influence the success of colonization of new hosts by a novel parasite population, but contrary to the prevailing belief, the rate of novelty emergence (e.g. mutations) is the least important factor. Maximization of all parameters results in a synergetic facilitation of the colonization and emulates the expected scenario for pathogenic microorganisms. The simulations also provide theoretical support for the retention of the capacity of fast-evolving lineages to retro-colonize their previous host species/lineage by ecological fitting. Capacity is, thus, much larger than we can anticipate. Hence, the results support the empirical observations that opportunity of encounter (i.e. the breakdown in mechanisms for ecological isolation) is a fundamental determinant to the emergence of new associations-especially Emergent Infectious Diseases-and the dynamics of host exploration, as observed in SARS-CoV-2. Insights on the dynamics of Emergent Infectious Diseases derived from the simulations and from the Stockholm Paradigm are discussed.","Feronato, Sofia G; Araujo, Sabrina; Boeger, Walter A",Transbound. emerg. dis.

This study investigated the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID-19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance. Medical history, demographic and patient characteristics of a retrospective cohort (1158 patients) hospitalized with COVID-19 were analysed at a single centre in Kuwait. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance. Of 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 had diabetes, 236 had hypertension and 104 required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 had body mass index (BMI) &#8805;25 kg/m2 . Univariate analysis showed that overweight, obesity class I and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Two models for multivariate regression analysis assessed either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I and morbid obesities were associated with ICU admittance. In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with increased ICU admittance, whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance. In our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were associated with ICU admittance, increasing the risk of poor outcomes.","Al-Sabah, Salman; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Al-Youha, Sarah; Jamal, Mohammad; Almazeedi, Sulaiman",Clin Obes,,337

Early disease is characterized by neutrophilic, exudative capillaritis with microthrombosis and high levels of IL-1beta and IL-6. Later stages are associated with diffuse alveolar damage and ongoing intravascular thrombosis in small to medium-sized pulmonary vessels, occasionally with areas of infarction equivalents, accompanied by laboratory features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In late stages, organizing pneumonia with extensive intra-alveolar proliferation of fibroblasts and marked metaplasia of alveolar epithelium can be observed. Viral RNA is encountered in the lung, with virus particles in endothelial cells and pneumocytes. In many patients, multi-organ failure with severe liver damage sets in finally, possibly as consequence of an early-onset pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and/or thrombotic microangiopathy.","Bösmüller, Hans; Traxler, Selina; Bitzer, Michael; Häberle, Helene; Raiser, Wolfgang; Nann, Dominik; Frauenfeld, Leonie; Vogelsberg, Antonio; Klingel, Karin; Fend, Falko",Virchows Arch,,337

Understanding the impact of events of this magnitude on nurses provides a framework of knowledge on which educational training could be based to face similar situations in the future to prevent further breakdown. METHODS: The hermeneutic approach by Cohen was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a voice-over Internet protocol. Interviews were transcribed, read in depth and analysed. RESULTS: Twenty nurses were interviewed. Four themes were extracted: uncertainty and fear, alteration of perceptions of time and space, change in the meaning of 'to care' and changes in roles and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological support in association with emergency training prevents stress and helps tackle compassion fatigue. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Policies to improve nursing science should be developed to ensure better quality of care, a higher number of professionals and, consequently, an increase in the safety of patients.","Arcadi, Paola; Simonetti, Valentina; Ambrosca, Rossella; Cicolini, Giancarlo; Simeone, Silvio; Pucciarelli, Gianluca; Alvaro, Rosaria; Vellone, Ercole; Durante, Angela",J. nurs. manag,,337

Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions.

A major advantage of laser processing relies on the ability to directly structure matter at different scales and to prepare novel materials with unique physical and chemical properties. It is also a contact-free approach that makes it possible to work in inert or reactive liquid or gaseous environment. This leads today to a unique opportunity for designing, fabricating and even analyzing novel complex bio-systems. To illustrate this potential, in this paper, we gather our recent research on four types of laser-based methods relevant for nano-/micro-scale applications. First, we present and discuss pulsed laser ablation in liquid, exploited today for synthetizing ultraclean ""bare"" nanoparticles attractive for medicine and tissue engineering applications. Second, we discuss robust methods for rapid surface and bulk machining (subtractive manufacturing) at different scales by laser ablation. Among them, the microsphere-assisted laser surface engineering is detailed for its appropriateness to design structured substrates with hierarchically periodic patterns at nano-/micro-scale without chemical treatments. Third, we address the laser-induced forward transfer, a technology based on direct laser printing, to transfer and assemble a multitude of materials (additive structuring), including biological moiety without alteration of functionality. Finally, the fourth method is about chemical analysis: we present the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, providing a unique tool for contact-free and space-resolved elemental analysis of organic materials.

The ease with which a problem can be implemented and solved using these codes reduce the barrier to entry for users. We demonstrate how one of these codes,FiPy, can be introduced to students through a short course using progression as the guiding philosophy. Four exercises of increasing complexity were developed. Basic concepts from more advanced numerical methods courses are also introduced at appropriate points. To further engage students, we demonstrate how an open research problem can be readily implemented and also incorporate the use of ParaView to post-process their results. Student engagement and learning outcomes were evaluated through a pre and post-course survey and a focus group discussion. Students broadly found the course to be engaging and useful with the ability to easily visualise the solution to PDEs being greatly valued. Due to the introductory nature of the course, due care in terms of set-up and the design of learning activities during the course is essential. This course, if integrated with appropriate level of support, can encourage students to use the provided codes and improve their understanding of concepts used in numerical analysis and PDEs.","Inguva, Pavan; Bhute, Vijesh J.; Cheng, Thomas N.H.; Walker, Pierre J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10931v2.pdf,337

E-cigarette and conventional cigarette use were ascertained using a novel electronic health record tool, and COVID-19 diagnosis was ascertained by a validated institutional registry. Logistic regression models were fit to assess whether current e-cigarette use was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. A total of 69,264 patients who were over the age of 12 years, smoked cigarettes or vaped, and were sought medical care at Mayo Clinic between September 15, 2019 and November 30, 2020 were included. The average age was 51.5 years, 62.1% were females and 86.3% were white; 11.1% were currently smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes and 5.1% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who used only e-cigarettes were not more likely to have a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.93 [0.69-1.25], P = .628), whereas those who used only cigarettes had a decreased risk (OR 0.43 [0.35-0.53], P < .001). The OR for dual users fell between these 2 values (OR 0.67 [0.49-0.92], P = .013). Although e-cigarettes have the well-documented potential for harm, they do not appear to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This result suggests the hypothesis that any beneficial effects of conventional cigarette smoking on susceptibility are not mediated by nicotine.","Jose, Thulasee; Croghan, Ivana T; Hays, J Taylor; Schroeder, Darrell R; Warner, David O",J Prim Care Community Health,,337

Current research efforts are focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to propose drug-based therapeutic options. Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell responses to viral infection and have been studied in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; however, such changes are not fully described for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed multiple transcriptomes obtained from cell lines infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and from COVID-19 patient-derived samples. Using integrative analyses of gene co-expression networks and de-novo pathway enrichment, we characterize different gene modules and protein pathways enriched with Transcription Factors or Epifactors relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified EP300, MOV10, RELA, and TRIM25 as top candidates, and more than 60 additional proteins involved in the epigenetic response during viral infection that has therapeutic potential. Our results show that targeting the epigenetic machinery could be a feasible alternative to treat COVID-19.","Salgado-Albarrán, Marisol; Navarro-Delgado, Erick I; Del Moral-Morales, Aylin; Alcaraz, Nicolas; Baumbach, Jan; González-Barrios, Rodrigo; Soto-Reyes, Ernesto",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,,337

The anticipated use of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with chronic liver disease and liver transplant recipients is reviewed and practical guidance is provided for health care providers involved in the care of patients with liver disease and liver transplantation about vaccine prioritization and administration. MAIN RESULTS: The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a 94%-95% vaccine efficacy compared to placebo against COVID-19. Local site reactions of pain and tenderness were reported in 70%-90% of clinical trial participants, and systemic reactions of fever and fatigue were reported in 40%-70% of participants, but these reactions were generally mild and self-limited and occurred more frequently in younger individuals. Severe hypersensitivity reactions related to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are rare and more commonly seen in women and individuals with a history of prior drug reactions for unclear reasons. Because patients with advanced liver disease and immunosuppressed patients were excluded from the vaccine licensing trials, additional data regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are eagerly awaited in these and other subgroups CONCLUSIONS: Remarkably safe and highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are now available for widespread use and should be given to all adult patients with chronic liver disease and liver transplant recipients.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the level of anxiety created by immensely spreading COVID-19-related information and age, gender and the presence of risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained by collecting a 25-question questionnaire created through Google forms with various communication tools. RESULTS: The data of 929 people who answered the questionnaire were used. The level of anxiety increased with age significantly, upon hearing that a person from their age group was harmed by the virus (P < .001). The feelings of being depressed and hopeless significantly increased as the age increased (P < .001). There was no significant difference between the genders in terms of feeling depressed and feeling of lack of joy in life (P = .066, P = .308, respectively). Participants with chronic diseases stated that they felt more depressed and hopeless and a lack of joy in life more frequently (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that individuals with older age and having risk factors were more vulnerable to the stress caused by the pandemic.

494353,Role of the early secretory pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"The analysis of large scale medical claims data has the potential to improve quality of care by generating insights which can be used to create tailored medical programs. In particular, the multivariate probit model can be used to investigate the correlation between multiple binary responses of interest in such data, e.g. the presence of multiple chronic conditions. Bayesian modeling is well suited to such analyses because of the automatic uncertainty quantification provided by the posterior distribution. A complicating factor is that large medical claims datasets often do not fit in memory, which renders the estimation of the posterior using traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods computationally infeasible. To address this challenge, we extend existing divide-and-conquer MCMC algorithms to the multivariate probit model, demonstrating, via simulation, that they should be preferred over mean-field variational inference when the estimation of the latent correlation structure between binary responses is of primary interest. We apply this algorithm to a large database of de-identified Medicare Advantage claims from a single large US health insurance provider, where we find medically meaningful groupings of common chronic conditions and asses the impact of the urban-rural health gap by identifying underutilized provider specialties in rural areas.","Mehrotra, Suchit; Brantley, Halley; Onglao, Peter; Bata, Patricia; Romero, Roland; Westman, Jacob; Bangerter, Lauren; Maity, Arnab",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09008v3.pdf,337
494354,Role of the early secretory pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 µM at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.","Klimke, A; Hefner, G; Will, B; Voss, U",Med Hypotheses,,337

Patients and Methods: A total of 25 MM patient samples and 15 healthy volunteer samples were collected, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to detect the expressions of LINC00665. PSMD10 and ASF1B expressions were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. U266 cell and H929 cell were used in functional experiments. Besides, CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis were utilized to determine cell proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to predict and verify the targeting relationships between LINC00665 and miR-214-3p, PSMD10 and miR-214-3p, as well as ASF1B and miR-214-3p. Moreover, the regulatory function of LINC00665 on the expression of PSMD10 and ASF1B was detected by Western blot. Results: The expression of LINC00665 was up-regulated in MM samples and cell lines. In vitro functional assays indicated that LINC00665 enhanced MM cell proliferation and inhibited its apoptosis. PSMD10 and ASF1B were identified as target genes of miR-214-3p. Additionally, LINC00665 negatively regulated miR-214-3p expression through sponging miR-214-3p and positively regulated PSMD10 and ASF1B. Conclusion: LINC00665 can promote the expression of PSMD10 and ASF1B by inhibiting the expression of miR-214-3p, thus facilitating the proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of MM cells.","Wang, Chong; Li, Mengya; Wang, Shujuan; Jiang, Zhongxing; Liu, Yanfang",Onco Targets Ther,,337

These synthesized sources of image deterioration represent sources of deterioration that must be dealt with in practical confocal imaging, namely dark current, non-specific binding and cross-reactivity of fluorescent probes, optical cross-talk and photon noise. The degraded images were restored by filtering and cross-talk correction. The co-localization coefficients of the restored images were not significantly different from those of the original undegraded images. Finally, we tested the procedure on images of real biological specimens. The results of these tests correspond with data found in the literature. We conclude that the co-localization coefficients can provide relevant quantitative information about the positional relation between biological objects or processes.","Manders, E M M; Verbeek, F J; Aten, J A",J Microsc,,337
500036,Proteomic analysis identifies the RNA helicase DDX3X as a host target against SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Members of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases show antiviral activities in mammalian cells through lethal editing in the genomes of small DNA viruses, herpesviruses and retroviruses, and potentially those of RNA viruses such as coronaviruses. Consistent with the latter, APOBEC-like directional CâU transitions of genomic plus-strand RNA are greatly overrepresented in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of variants emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic. A CâU mutational process may leave evolutionary imprints on coronavirus genomes, including extensive homoplasy from editing and reversion at targeted sites and the occurrence of driven amino acid sequence changes in viral proteins. If sustained over longer periods, this process may account for the previously reported marked global depletion of C and excess of U bases in human seasonal coronavirus genomes. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on APOBEC evolution and function and the evidence of their role in APOBEC-mediated genome editing of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","Ratcliff, Jeremy; Simmonds, Peter",Virology,,337
500332,Toward superhuman SARS-CoV-2 immunity?,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across the world. The vast majority of patients with COVID-19 manifest mild to moderate symptoms but may progress to severe cases or even mortalities. Young adults of reproductive age are the most affected population by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is no consensus yet if pregnancy contributes to the severity of COVID-19. Initial studies of pregnant women have found that COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and low birth weight, which have been associated with non-communicable diseases in offspring. Besides, maternal viral infections with or without vertical transmission have been allied with neurological and behavioral disorders of the offspring. In this review, obstetrical outcomes of women with COVID-19 and possible risks for their offspring are discussed by reviewing maternal immune responses to COVID-19 based on the current evidence. Structural and systemic follow-up of offspring who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in-utero is suggested.","Cavalcante, Marcelo Borges; Cavalcante, Candice Torres de Melo Bezerra; Sarno, Manoel; Barini, Ricardo; Kwak-Kim, Joanne",J Reprod Immunol,,337

A total of 310 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were studied. A comparison was made between two groups of patients, those with hypertension and those without hypertension. Their demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory indicators, and treatment methods were collected and analyzed. A total of 310 patients, including 113 patients with hypertension and 197 patients without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Compared with patients without hypertension, patients with hypertension were older, were more likely to have diabetes and cerebrovascular disease, and were more likely to be transferred to the intensive care unit. The neutrophil count and lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels in hypertensive patients were significantly higher than those in nonhypertensive patients (P < 0.05). However, multivariate analysis (adjusted for age and sex) failed to show that hypertension was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 mortality or severity. COVID-19 patients with hypertension were more likely than patients without hypertension to have severe pneumonia, excessive inflammatory reactions, organ and tissue damage, and deterioration of the disease. Patients with hypertension should be given additional attention to prevent worsening of their condition.","Huang, Songjiang; Wang, Jianwen; Liu, Fen; Liu, Jiacheng; Cao, Guijuan; Yang, Chongtu; Liu, Wei; Tu, Chao; Zhu, Muxin; Xiong, Bin",Hypertens Res,,337

505920,SARS-CoV-2 Bound Human Serum Albumin and Systemic Septic Shock,2020,"Background: Since its introduction in modern medicine, naturalistic observations emerged about possible uses of lithium treatment for conditions different from recurring affective disorders, for which it is still a first-line treatment option. Some evidence about the antiviral properties of lithium began in the early 1970s, when some reports found a reduction of labial-herpetic recurrences. The present review aims to present most of the pre-clinical and clinical evidence about lithium’s ability to inhibit DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae, as well as the possible pathways and mechanisms involved in such antiviral activity. Main body: Despite a broad number of in vitro studies, the rationale for the antiviral activity of lithium failed to translate into methodologically sound clinical studies demonstrating its antiviral efficacy. In addition, the tolerability of lithium as an antiviral agent should be addressed. In fact, treatment with lithium requires continuous monitoring of its serum levels in order to prevent acute toxicity and long-term side effects, most notably affecting the kidney and thyroid. Yet lithium reaches heterogeneous but bioequivalent concentrations in different tissues, and the anatomical compartment of the viral infection might underpin a different, lower need for tolerability concerns which need to be addressed. Conclusions: Lithium presents a clear antiviral activity demonstrated at preclinical level, but that remains to be confirmed in clinical settings. In addition, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of lithium may provide an insight for its possible use as antiviral agent targeting specific pathways.","Murru, Andrea; Manchia, Mirko; Hajek, Tomas; Nielsen, René E.; Rybakowski, Janusz K.; Sani, Gabriele; Schulze, Thomas G.; Tondo, Leonardo; Bauer, Michael",Int.

Using a cross-sectional, anonymous survey, we examined patterns of naturalistic CBD use among individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) and other chronic pain conditions. Our objective was to better understand rates of CBD use, reasons for use and discontinuation, communication with healthcare professionals about CBD, and perceptions of CBD effectiveness and safety among people with FM. After excluding incomplete surveys, our study population consisted of Nâ¯=â¯2,701 participants with fibromyalgia, primarily in the United States. Overall, 38.1% reported never using CBD, 29.4% reported past CBD use, and 32.4% reported current CBD use. Past-year cannabis use was strongly associated with past or current CBD use. Those using CBD typically did so due to inadequate symptom relief, while those not using CBD typically cited safety concerns as their reason for not using CBD. Two-thirds of participants disclosed CBD use to their physician, although only 33% asked for physician advice on using CBD. Participants used CBD for numerous FM-related symptoms (most commonly pain), and generally reported slight to much improvement across symptom domains. Around half of participants reported side effects, which were typically minor. Our findings are limited by selection bias and our cross-sectional design, which prevents causal associations. In conclusion, CBD use is common among individuals with FM and many individuals using CBD report improvements across numerous FM-related symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for additional rigorous studies to better understand CBD's potential for FM management. PERSPECTIVE: This article indicates that CBD use is common among people with fibromyalgia, and the results suggest that many derive benefit from using CBD across multiple symptoms domains. Clinicians should discuss CBD use with fibromyalgia patients, and future studies are needed to rigorously assess CBD's therapeutic value for fibromyalgia symptoms.","Boehnke, Kevin F; Gagnier, Joel J; Matallana, Lynne; Williams, David A",J. pain,,337

In China, interventional therapies with traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 have achieved significant clinical efficacies, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. This article reviewed the etiology of COVID-19 and clinical efficacy. Both network pharmacological study and literature search were used to demonstrate the possible action mechanisms of Chinese medicines in treating COVID-19. We found that Chinese medicines played the role of antivirus, anti-inflammation and immunoregulation, and target organs protection in the management of COVID-19 by multiple components acting on multiple targets at multiple pathways. AEC2 and 3CL protein could be the direct targets for inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The purpose of our article is to demonstrate how the interRAI LTC facility (LTCF) assessment can inform clinical care and evaluate the effect of strategies to mitigate worsening mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a supporting analysis of the effects of lockdown in homes without COVID-19 outbreaks on depression, delirium, and behavior problems in a network of 7 LTC homes in New Brunswick, Canada, where mitigative strategies were deployed to minimize poor mental health outcomes (eg, virtual visits and increased student volunteers). This network meets regularly to review performance on risk-adjusted quality of care indicators from the interRAI LTCF and share learning through a community of practice model. We included 4209 assessments from 765 LTC residents between January 2017 to June 2020 and modeled the change within and between residents for depression, delirium, and behavioral problems over time with longitudinal generalized estimating equations. Though the number of residents who had in-person visits with family decreased from 73.2% before to 17.9% during lockdown (chi square, P < .001), the number of residents experiencing delirium (4.5%-3.5%, P = .51) and behavioral problems (35.5%-30.2%, P = .19) did not change. The proportion of residents with indications of depression decreased from 19.9% before to 11.5% during lockdown (P < .002). The final multivariate models indicate that the effect of lockdown was not statistically significant on depression, delirium, or behavioral problems. Our analyses demonstrate that poor mental health outcomes associated with lockdown can be mitigated with thoughtful intervention and ongoing evaluation with clinical information systems. Policy makers can use outputs to guide resource deployment, and researchers can examine the data to identify better management strategies for when pandemic strikes again.","McArthur, Caitlin; Saari, Margaret; Heckman, George A; Wellens, Nathalie; Weir, Julie; Hebert, Paul; Turcotte, Luke; Jbilou, Jalila; Hirdes, John P",J.

We merged data on COVID-19 cumulative prevalence and fatality rates as of May 31, 2020 with 2014-2019 pollution data from the US Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Justice Screen (EJSCREEN), with control for state testing rates, population density, and population covariate data from the County Health Rankings. Pollution data included three types of air emission concentrations (particulate matter<2.5 µm (PM2.5), ozone and diesel particulate matter (DPM)), and four pollution source variables (proximity to traffic, National Priority List sites, Risk Management Plan (RMP) sites, and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs)). Results of mixed model linear multiple regression analyses indicated that, controlling for covariates, COVID-19 prevalence and fatality rates were significantly associated with greater DPM. Proximity to TSDFs was associated to greater fatality rates, and proximity to RMPs was associated with greater prevalence rates. Results are consistent with previous research indicating that air pollution increases susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the ecological design, the time lag between exposure and outcome, and the uncertainties in measuring COVID-19 prevalence. Areas with worse prior air quality, especially higher concentrations of diesel exhaust, may be at greater COVID-19 risk, although further studies are needed to confirm these relationships.","Hendryx, Michael; Luo, Juhua",Environ Pollut,,337

Studies have shown that cyberhate, online harassment and other misuses of technology are on the rise, particularly during the global Coronavirus pandemic in 2020. According to the latest report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 35% of online users reported online harassment related to their identity-based characteristics, which is a 3% increase over 2019. Applying advanced techniques from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field to support the development of an online hate-free community is a critical task for social justice. Transfer learning enhances the performance of the classifier by allowing the transfer of knowledge from one domain or one dataset to others that have not been seen before, thus, supporting the classifier to be more generalizable. In our study, we apply the principles of transfer learning cross multiple Arabic offensive language datasets to compare the effects on system performance. This study aims at investigating the effects of fine-tuning and training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model on multiple Arabic offensive language datasets individually and testing it using other datasets individually.

By deriving a mapping between the metamodels in linguistics and graph theory it will be shown that currently, no constructs exist in canonical graphs for the representation of semantic and pragmatic information. It is found that further work needs to be done to understand how graphs can be enriched to allow for isomorphisms to capture semantic and pragmatic information. This capturing of additional information could lead to understandings of the source structure and enhanced manipulations and interrogations of the contained relationships.

Recently, we described a high incidence of inter-individual regional heterogeneity in terms of asymmetry of plaque burden and microglial activation in ß-amyloid mouse models of AD as assessed by positron-emission-tomography (PET). We now investigate the regional associations between amyloid plaque burden, microglial activation, and impaired spatial learning performance in transgenic mice in vivo. METHODS: In 30 AppNL-G-F mice (15 female, 15 male) we acquired cross-sectional 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO-PET, 18F-GE-180) and ß-amyloid-PET (18F-florbetaben) scans at ten months of age. Control data were obtained from age- and sex-matched C57BI/6 wild-type mice. We assessed spatial learning (i.e. Morris water maze) within two weeks of PET scanning and correlated the principal component of spatial learning performance scores with voxel-wise ß-amyloid and TSPO tracer uptake maps in AppNL-G-F mice, controlled for age and sex. In order to assess the effects of hemispheric asymmetry, we also analyzed correlations of spatial learning performance with tracer uptake in bilateral regions of interest for frontal cortex, entorhinal/piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, using a regression model. We tested the correlation between regional asymmetry of PET biomarkers with individual spatial learning performance. RESULTS: Voxel-wise analyses in AppNL-G-F mice revealed that higher TSPO-PET signal in the amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortices, the hippocampus and the hypothalamus correlated with spatial learning performance. Region-based analysis showed significant correlations between TSPO expression in the right entorhinal/piriform cortex and the right amygdala and spatial learning performance, whereas there were no such correlations in the left hemisphere. Right lateralized TSPO expression in the amygdala predicted better performance in the Morris water maze (ßâ¯=â¯-0.470, pâ¯=â¯0.013), irrespective of the global microglial activation and amyloid level. Region-based results for amyloid-PET showed no significant associations with spatial learning. CONCLUSION: Elevated microglial activation in the right amygdala-entorhinal-hippocampal complex of AppNL-G-F mice is associated with better spatial learning. Our findings support a protective role of microglia on cognitive function when they highly express TSPO in specific brain regions involved in spatial memory.","Biechele, Gloria; Wind, Karin; Blume, Tanja; Sacher, Christian; Beyer, Leonie; Eckenweber, Florian; Franzmeier, Nicolai; Ewers, Michael; Zott, Benedikt; Lindner, Simon; Gildehaus, Franz-Josef; von Ungern-Sternberg, Barbara; Tahirovic, Sabina; Willem, Michael; Bartenstein, Peter; Cumming, Paul; Rominger, Axel; Herms, Jochen; Brendel, Matthias",Neuroimage,,337

A prospective ES scale has the purpose to estimate at which level of supervision a student will be ready to perform an activity in subsequent encounters. METHODS: We studied the transition to prospective assessment of medical students in clerkships via semi-structured interviews with twelve purposefully sampled clinical teachers, shortly after the introduction of a new undergraduate EPA-based curriculum and EPA-based assessment employing a prospective ES scale. RESULTS: While some clinical teachers showed a correct interpretation, rating strategies also appeared to be affected by the target supervision level for completion of the clerkship. Instructions to estimate readiness for a supervision level in the future were not always understood. Further, teachers' interpretation of the scale anchors relied heavily on the phrasing. DISCUSSION: Prospective assessment asks clinical teachers to make an extra inference step in their judgement process from reporting observed performance to estimating future level of supervision. This requires a change in mindset when coming from a retrospective, performance-oriented assessment method, i.e., reporting what was observed. Our findings suggest optimizing the ES-scale wordings and improving faculty development.","Postmes, Lieselotte; Tammer, Femke; Posthumus, Indra; Wijnen-Meijer, Marjo; van der Schaaf, Marieke; Ten Cate, Olle",Med Teach,,337

516392,Potential Treatment Approaches to SARS-CoV-2 and Evaluation of Drug Carrier Systems in Treatment,2020,"PURPOSE: The present study hypothesised that whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT might provide insight into the pathophysiology of long COVID. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 13 adult long COVID patients who complained for at least one persistent symptom for >30 days after infection recovery. A group of 26 melanoma patients with negative PET/CT matched for sex/age was used as controls (2:1 control to case ratio). Qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of whole-body images was performed. Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests were applied to test differences between the two groups. Voxel-based analysis was performed to compare brain metabolism in cases and controls. Cases were further grouped according to prevalent symptoms and analysed accordingly. RESULTS: In 4/13 long COVID patients, CT images showed lung abnormalities presenting mild [18F]FDG uptake. Many healthy organs/parenchyma SUVs and SUV ratios significantly differed between the two groups (p &#8804; 0.05). Long COVID patients exhibited brain hypometabolism in the right parahippocampal gyrus and thalamus (uncorrected p < 0.001 at voxel level). Specific area(s) of hypometabolism characterised patients with persistent anosmia/ageusia, fatigue, and vascular uptake (uncorrected p < 0.005 at voxel level). CONCLUSION: [18F]FDG PET/CT acknowledged the multi-organ nature of long COVID, supporting the hypothesis of underlying systemic inflammation. Whole-body images showed increased [18F]FDG uptake in several ""target"" and ""non-target"" tissues. We found a typical pattern of brain hypometabolism associated with persistent complaints at the PET time, suggesting a different temporal sequence for brain and whole-body inflammatory changes. This evidence underlined the potential value of whole-body [18F]FDG PET in disclosing the pathophysiology of long COVID.","Sollini, Martina; Morbelli, Silvia; Ciccarelli, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio; Aghemo, Alessio; Morelli, Paola; Chiola, Silvia; Gelardi, Fabrizia; Chiti, Arturo",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,337

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures to quantify the mobility level needed to control SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., mobility threshold), and the difference relative to the observed mobility level (i.e., mobility gap). METHODS: We conducted a time-series study of the weekly incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada from Mar. 15, 2020, to Mar. 6, 2021. The outcome was weekly growth rate, defined as the ratio of cases in a given week versus the previous week. We evaluated the effects of average time spent outside the home in the previous 3 weeks using a log-normal regression model, accounting for province, week and mean temperature. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 mobility threshold and gap. RESULTS: Across the 51-week study period, a total of 888 751 people were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Each 10% increase in the mobility gap was associated with a 25% increase in the SARS-CoV-2 weekly case growth rate (ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.29). Compared to the prepandemic baseline mobility of 100%, the mobility threshold was highest in the summer (69%; interquartile range [IQR] 67%-70%), and dropped to 54% in winter 2021 (IQR 52%-55%); a mobility gap was present in Canada from July 2020 until the last week of December 2020. INTERPRETATION: Mobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control SARS-CoV-2 through spring 2021.

This pandemic has caused prosthodontics units to suspend their clinical and educational operations in academia. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to review the experiences from the Department of Prosthodontics, Wuhan University School and Hospital of Stomatology (DP-WHUSHS), during the COVID-19 outbreak and the protocols DP-WHUSHS used to resume clinical activities after the outbreak. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The descriptive approach was used in this article to provide a chronological narrative of the experiences and protocols from the DP-WHUSHS during the COVID-19 outbreak and after the outbreak. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak period, clinical care was provided for patients with dental emergencies by using enhanced grade 2 or grade 3 personal protective equipment (PPE). Teledentistry was used to provide care for patients with nonemergency needs. Online webinars and lectures were conducted for the predoctoral students, residents, and dentists to minimize the interruption in their education and engage the dental community amid the pandemic. Various factors were considered before clinical activities resumed after the outbreak subsided. Additional resources were allocated for facility preparation and management and employee training. New infection control and clinical operation protocols were developed to minimize the health-care-associated infection of airborne transmission diseases. The psychological health and mental wellness of the employees were emphasized. Distance or online education is still under rapid development to provide students and dentists opportunities to advance their knowledge amid the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitation of this descriptive review, the following conclusions were drawn. Patient welfare and emergency needs should be considered amid the pandemic. Enhanced grade 2 or grade 3 PPE should be used during the outbreak. Multifactorial considerations for work resumption after the outbreak included facility preparation and management, training for employees, and clinical operation management. In-person psychological consultation and online mental wellness programs were available to employees to improve their mental wellness. Distance or online education was under rapid development to minimize the interruption in education for the students and to engage the dental community amid a pandemic.","Sa, Yue; Lin, Wei-Shao; Morton, Dean; Huang, Cui",J. prosthet. dent,,337

COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread worldwide. The coronavirus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses based on phylogenetic analysis. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a spillover of an animal coronavirus and later adapted the ability of human-to-human transmission. Because the virus is highly contagious, it rapidly spreads and continuously evolves in the human population. In this review article, we discuss the basic properties, potential origin, and evolution of the novel human coronavirus. These factors may be critical for studies of pathogenicity, antiviral designs, and vaccine development against the virus.","Liu, Yen-Chin; Kuo, Rei-Lin; Shih, Shin-Ru",Biomed J,,337

519109,SARS-CoV-2: a new aetiology for atypical lymphocytes,2020,"Nowadays, long distance optical fibre transmission systems use polarization diversity multiplexed signals to enhance transmission performance. Distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) use the same propagation medium, i.e., single mode optical fibre, and aim at comparable targets such as covering the highest distance with the best signal quality. In the case of sensors, a noiseless transmission enables us to monitor a large quantity of mechanical events along the fibre. This paper aims at extending the perspectives of DAS systems with regard to technology breakthroughs introduced in long haul transmission systems over the past decade. We recently developed a sensor interrogation method based on coherent phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (Ï-OTDR), with dual polarization multiplexing at the transmitter and polarization diversity at the receiver. We name this technique coherent-MIMO sensing. A study is performed from a dual-polarization numerical model to compare several sensor interrogation techniques, including coherent-MIMO. We demonstrate that dual-polarization probing of a fibre sensor makes it insensitive to polarization effects, decreases the risks of false alarms and thus strongly enhances its sensitivity. The simulations results are validated with an experiment, and finally quantitative data are given on the performance increase enabled by coherent-MIMO sensing.","Guerrier, Sterenn; Dorize, Christian; Awwad, Elie; Renaudier, Jérémie",Opt Express,,337

519162,Diverse immunoglobulin gene usage and convergent epitope targeting in neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The intestinal microbiome changes dynamically in early infancy. Colonisation by Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and development of intestinal immunity is interconnected. We performed a prospective observational cohort study to determine the influence of antibiotics taken by the mother immediately before delivery on the intestinal microbiome of 130 healthy Japanese infants. Faecal samples (383) were collected at 1, 3, and 6 months and analysed using next-generation sequencing. Cefazolin was administered before caesarean sections, whereas ampicillin was administered in cases with premature rupture of the membranes and in Group B Streptococcus-positive cases. Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides were dominant (60-70% mean combined occupancy) at all ages. A low abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed in infants exposed to antibiotics at delivery and at 1 and 3 months, with no difference between delivery methods. A lower abundance of Bacteroides was observed after caesarean section than vaginal delivery, irrespective of antibiotic exposure. Additionally, occupancy by Bifidobacterium at 1 and 3 months and by Bacteroides at 3 months differed between infants with and without siblings. All these differences disappeared at 6 months. Infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics displayed altered Bifidobacterium abundance, whereas abundance of Bacteroides was largely associated with the delivery method. Existence of siblings also significantly influenced the microbiota composition of infants.","Imoto, Naruaki; Kano, Chie; Aoyagi, Yumi; Morita, Hiroto; Amanuma, Fumitaka; Maruyama, Hidekazu; Nojiri, Shuko; Hashiguchi, Naoyuki; Watanabe, Shin",Sci Rep,,337

Sponsors or delegated organisations responsible for monitoring trials have needed to consider and implement alternative ways of working due to the national infection risk necessitating restricted movement of staff and public, reduced clinical staff resource as research staff moved to clinical areas, and amended working arrangements for sponsor and sponsor delegates as staff moved to working from home.Organisations have often worked in isolation to fast track mitigations required for the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic; this paper describes many of the learnings from a group of monitoring leads based in United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Clinical Trials Unit (CTUs) within the UK.The UKCRC Monitoring Task and Finish Group, comprising monitoring leads from 9 CTUs, met repeatedly to identify how COVID-19 had affected clinical trial monitoring. Informed consent is included as a specific issue within this paper, as review of completed consent documentation is often required within trial monitoring plans (TMPs). Monitoring is defined as involving on-site monitoring, central monitoring or/and remote monitoring.Monitoring, required to protect the safety of the patients and the integrity of the trial and ensure the protocol is followed, is often best done by a combination of central, remote and on-site monitoring. However, if on-site monitoring is not possible, workable solutions can be found using only central or central and remote monitoring. eConsent, consent by a third person, or via remote means is plausible. Minimising datasets to the critical data reduces workload for sites and CTU staff. Home working caused by COVID-19 has made electronic trial master files (TMFs) more inviting. Allowing sites to book and attend protocol training at a time convenient to them has been successful and worth pursuing for trials with many sites in the future.The arrival of COVID-19 in the UK has forced consideration of and changes to how clinical trials are conducted in relation to monitoring. Some developed practices will be useful in other pandemics and others should be incorporated into regular use.","Love, Sharon B; Armstrong, Emma; Bayliss, Carrie; Boulter, Melanie; Fox, Lisa; Grumett, Joanne; Rafferty, Patricia; Temesi, Barbara; Wills, Krista; Corkhill, Andrea",Trials,,337

METHODS: National survey of all A&I services registered with the Royal College of Physicians and/or British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The survey covered staffing, facilities, personal protective equipment, appointments & patient review, investigations, treatments and research activity. Weeks commencing 03 Feb'20 (pre-COVID), 06 April'20 and 08'May'20 were used as reference points for the dataset. RESULTS: 99 services participated. There was a reduction in nursing, medical, administrative and allied health professional staff during pandemic; 86% and 92% of A&I services continued to accept non-urgent and urgent referrals respectively during the pandemic. There were changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) dose and infusion regimen in 67% and 14% of adult and pediatric services respectively; 30% discontinued immunoglobulin replacement in some patients. There was a significant (all variables, p&#8804;0.0001) reduction in the following: face-to-face consultations (increase in telephone consultations), initiation of venom immunotherapy, sublingual and subcutaneous injection immunotherapy, anesthetic allergy testing and hospital procedures (food challenges, immunoglobulin and omalizumab, administration); and a significant increase (p&#8804;0.0001) in home therapy for immunoglobulin and omalizumab.

523515,Interpretative immune targets and contemporary position for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2: A systematic review,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated mitigation efforts around the world. We use only reported deaths in the two weeks after the first death to determine infection parameters, in order to make predictions of hidden variables such as the time dependence of the number of infections. Early deaths are sporadic and discrete so the use of network models of epidemic spread is imperative, with the network itself a crucial random variable. Location-specific population age distributions and population densities must be taken into account when attempting to fit these events with parametrized models. These characteristics render naive Bayesian model comparison impractical as the networks have to be large enough to avoid finite-size effects. We reformulated this problem as the statistical physics of independent location-specific `balls' attached to every model in a six-dimensional lattice of 56448 parametrized models by elastic springs, with model-specific `spring constants' determined by the stochasticity of network epidemic simulations for that model. The distribution of balls then determines all Bayes posterior expectations. Important characteristics of the contagion are determinable: the fraction of infected patients that die ($0.017\pm 0.009$), the expected period an infected person is contagious ($22 \pm 6$ days) and the expected time between the first infection and the first death ($25 \pm 8$ days) in the US. The rate of exponential increase in the number of infected individuals is $0.18\pm 0.03$ per day, corresponding to 65 million infected individuals in one hundred days from a single initial infection, which fell to 166000 with even imperfect social distancing effectuated two weeks after the first recorded death. The fraction of compliant socially-distancing individuals matters less than their fraction of social contact reduction for altering the cumulative number of infections.","Han, Jungmin; Cresswell-Clay, Evan C; Periwal, Vipul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03101v1.pdf,337

It reveals that population outflow from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei Province (the province where Wuhan is located) and metropolises and provincial capitals outside of Hubei province exceeded those to other cities. This is broadly consistent with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Additionally, model analysis revealed that population outflow from Wuhan was the key factor that determined the COVID-19 situations. The spread of COVID-19 was positively correlated with GDP per capita and resident population and negatively correlated with the distance from Wuhan and the number of hospital beds, while population density was not a strong influential factor. Additionally, the demographic characteristics of population migration from Wuhan also affected the virus transmission. Particularly, businesspeople (who tend to have a high frequency of social activities) were more likely to spread COVID-19. This study indicated that specific measures to control population outflow from the epicenter at the early stage of the epidemic were of great significance.","Zheng, Yanting; Huang, Jinyuan; Yin, Qiuyue",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,337
524100,ACE2 Expression on the Keratinocytes and SARS-CoV-2 Percutaneous Transmission: Are they Related?,2021,"Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may have lower serum selenium levels than healthy controls, which may be associated with preterm birth. We explored the association of serum selenium levels in early pregnancy with the risk of GDM and preterm birth among Chinese women. We included 398 women with a singleton pregnancy, who were followed up prospectively from the first prenatal visit until delivery. Serum selenium levels were measured in the first trimester. After delivery, data concerning mothers and their children were sourced from medical records by researchers who were blind to the participants' selenium status. Of the 398 women, 71 (17.8%) had GDM, 21(5.3%) had preterm birth, and 266 (66.8%) had selenium deficiency (serum selenium < 70 µg/L). Women in the upper three quartiles of serum selenium level did not have a significantly lower risk of GDM or preterm birth than those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05). When serum selenium levels were classified as normal or deficient, the risk of GDM or preterm birth among women with normal serum selenium levels was still not lower than that of women with deficient serum selenium levels after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05). Although selenium deficiency was common in the Chinese women in our cohort, our results indicate that low serum selenium level during early pregnancy may not be a strong predictor of the risk of GDM and preterm birth. However, our sample size was small, and future studies with larger populations are warranted.","Liu, Peng Ju; Yao, Aimin; Ma, Liangkun; Chen, Xiao Yan; Yu, Song Lin; Liu, Yanping; Hou, Yi Xuan",Biol. trace elem. res,,337
590358,SARS-CoV-2 Tests: Bridging the Gap between Laboratory Sensors and Clinical Applications,2021-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Hyposmia is frequently reported as an initial symptom in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: As hyposmia accompanies cognitive impairment in several neurological disorders, we aimed to study whether hyposmia represents a clinical biomarker for both neurological involvement and cognitive impairment in mild CO­VID-19. We aimed to study whether olfactory dysfunction (OD) represents a clinical biomarker for both neurological involvement and cognitive impairment in mild COVID-19. METHODS: Formal olfactory testing using the Sniffin'Sticks® Screening test, neuropsychological assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and detailed neurological examination were performed in 7 COVID-19 patients with mild disease course and no history of olfactory or cognitive impairment, and 7 controls matched for age, sex, and education. Controls were initially admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 screening ward but tested negative by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The number of correctly identified odors was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in controls (6 ± 3, vs. 10 ± 1 p = 0.028, r = 0.58). Total MoCA score was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in controls (20 ± 5 vs. 26 ± 3, p = 0.042, r = 0.54). Cognitive performance indicated by MoCA was associated with number of correctly identified odors in COVID-19 patients and controls (COVID-19: p = 0.018, 95% CI = 9–19; controls: p = 0.18, r = 0.63, 95% CI = 13–18.5 r = 0.64). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: OD is associated with cognitive impairment in controls and mild COVID-19. OD may represent a potentially useful clinical biomarker for subtle and even subclinical neurological involvement in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.","Pirker-Kees, Agnes; Platho-Elwischger, Kirsten; Hafner, Sebastian; Redlich, Kurt; Baumgartner, Christoph",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853062/,337

By mediating an active and steady-state cell-to-cell communication, EVs contribute to regulating and preserving cellular homeostasis. On the other hand, EVs can also spread pathogen-derived molecules during infections, subverting the host immune responses during infections and thus worsening pathophysiological processes. In recent years, the biological functioning of EVs has become a widespread research field in basic and clinical branches of medical sciences due to their potential role in therapeutic applications for several diseases. This review aims to summarize the main recent findings regarding the implication of EVs shed by human macrophages (MΦ-EVs) and how they can modulate the host immune response to control or increase the damage caused by infectious agents. We will also present the methods used to describe MΦ-EVs, as well as the potential of these EVs as disease diagnostic tools for some human pathogens. We believe that an in-depth understanding of the host–pathogen interactions mediated by MΦ-EVs may trigger the development of innovative therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases.","Arteaga-Blanco, Luis A.; Bou-Habib, Dumith Chequer",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638604/,337
590885,Human post‐infection serological response to the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-08-25,"The evolutionarily conserved human polymerase delta (POLD1) gene encodes the large p125 subunit which provides the essential catalytic activities of polymerase δ (Polδ), mediated by 5’–3’ DNA polymerase and 3’–5’ exonuclease moieties. POLD1 associates with three smaller subunits (POLD2, POLD3, POLD4), which together with Replication Factor C and Proliferating Nuclear Cell Antigen constitute the polymerase holoenzyme. Polδ function is essential for replication, with a primary role as the replicase for the lagging strand. Polδ also has an important proofreading ability conferred by the exonuclease activity, which is critical for ensuring replicative fidelity, but also serves to repair DNA lesions arising as a result of exposure to mutagens. Polδ has been shown to be important for multiple forms of DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. A growing number of studies in the past decade have linked germline and sporadic mutations in POLD1 and the other subunits of Polδ with human pathologies. Mutations in Polδ in mice and humans lead to genomic instability, mutator phenotype and tumorigenesis. The advent of genome sequencing techniques has identified damaging mutations in the proofreading domain of POLD1 as the underlying cause of some inherited cancers, and suggested that mutations in POLD1 may influence therapeutic management. In addition, mutations in POLD1 have been identified in the developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy and atypical Werner syndrome, while changes in expression or activity of POLD1 have been linked to senescence and aging. Intriguingly, some recent evidence suggests POLD1 function may also be altered in diabetes. We provide an overview of critical Polδ activities in the context of these pathologic conditions.","Nicolas, Emmanuelle; Golemis, Erica A.; Arora, Sanjeevani",Gene,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4969162?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111916304942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27320729/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111916304942,337

This study reports characteristics of coronavirus disease 19 CP (CCP) donors and their donations to the New York Blood Center (NYBC). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All CCP data from our first day of collection on March 26th through July 7th, 2020 are included in this retrospective analysis. Donor and donation data were extracted from NYBC electronic databases. SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody testing was initially performed by the NY State Department of Health, and later by NYBC using Ortho and Abbott platforms. RESULTS: CCP donor age and ABO distributions were consistent with reported lower COVID‐19 susceptibility in O blood types. CCP versus whole blood donors had similar on‐site deferrals, but higher post‐donation deferral rates. CCP versus routine plasmapheresis donations had higher vasovagal reactions but similar product rejection rates. Changes in antibody (Ab) test platforms resulted in significant changes in the percent of donors regarded as antibody positive. Donor correlates with higher anti‐spike total Ig S/CO ratios were Hispanic ethnicity, overweight body mass index, and longer symptom duration; and with higher anti‐nucleocapsid IgG S/CO ratios were male gender, older age, Hispanic ethnicity, and fewer days between symptom onset and first donation. DISCUSSION: We identify donor characteristics not previously reported to correlate with Ab titer. Our analysis should assist with donor outreach strategies, blood center operating logistics, and recruitment of high titer donors.","Jain, Saagar; Garg, Keshav; Tran, Sabrina M.; Rask, Isabel L.; Tarczon, Michael; Nandi, Vijay; Kessler, Debra A.; Strauss, Donna; Sachais, Bruce S.; Yazdanbakhsh, Karina; Rehmani, Shiraz; Luchsinger, Larry; Shi, Patricia A.",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904609/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16421,337
591135,A Summary of the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and Technologies Available or under Development,2021-06-22,"INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) provides an adhesion site for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Patients with COPD could have severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this study was to investigate ACE2 regulation by air pollution during the development of COPD. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to unconcentrated traffic-related air pollution for 3 and 6 months. We examined lung injury markers, oxidative stress, inflammation, emphysema, ACE2 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) in the lungs after exposure. RESULTS: Lung injury occurred due to an increase in permeability and lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity was observed after 6 months of exposure to fine particulate matter of <1 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(1)). An α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency and neutrophil elastase production with emphysema development were observed after 6 months of PM(1) exposure. 8-isoprostane and interleukin-6 were increased after 3 and 6 months of PM(1) exposure. Caspase-3 was increased after exposure to PM(1) for 6 months. Upregulation of ACE2 was found after 3 months of PM(1) exposure; however, ACE2 had decreased by 6 months of PM(1) exposure. AT1 and AT2 had significantly decreased after exposure to PM(1) for 6 months. Furthermore, smooth muscle hypertrophy had occurred after 6 months of PM(1) exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, short-term exposure to PM(1) increased the ACE2 overexpression in lungs. Long-term exposure to PM(1) decreased the ACE2 overexpression in emphysema. Air pollution may be a risk for SARS-CoV-2 adhesion during the development of COPD.","Chuang, Hsiao-Chi; Chen, Yi-Ying; Hsiao, Ta-Chih; Chou, Hsiu-Chu; Kuo, Han-Pin; Feng, Po-Hao; Ho, Shu-Chuan; Chen, Jen-Kun; Chuang, Kai-Jen; Lee, Kang-Yun",ERJ Open Res,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00174-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043050/,337
591241,Master Regulator Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2/Human Interactome,2020-04-01,"Abstract The large number of phenotypically distinct strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) provide a broad genetic background for examining naturally occurring coronavirus variation. Comparisons of the published nucleotide sequence of S1 genes of strains isolated in Europe, Japan and the USA and four additional American strains described in this report identified 4 genetically distinct groups. The Dutch group was the most divergent sharing only about 60% identity with the American, Mass and European groups which were about 80% homologous with each other. Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The hypervariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the S1 gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3' end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for recombination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.","Li, Wang; Junker, Dave; Hock, Lisa; Ebiary, Elham; Collisson, Ellen W.",Virus Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7856318/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170294901325; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170294901325,337
592338,Functional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited antibodies in immunologically naïve and pre-immune humans,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 illness which can progress to severe pneumonia. Empiric antibacterials are often employed though frequency of bacterial coinfection superinfection is debated and concerns raised about selection of bacterial antimicrobial resistance. We evaluated sputum bacterial and fungal growth from 165 intubated COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Objectives were to determine frequency of culture positivity, risk factors for and outcomes of positive cultures, and timing of antimicrobial resistance development. METHODS: Retrospective reviews were conducted of COVID-19 pneumonia patients requiring intubation admitted to a 1058-bed four community hospital system on the east coast United States, March 1 to May 1, 2020. Length of stay (LOS) was expressed as mean (standard deviation); 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was computed for overall mortality rate using the exact binomial method, and overall mortality was compared across each level of a potential risk factor using a Chi-Square Test of Independence. All tests were two-sided, and significance level was set to 0.05. RESULTS: Average patient age was 68.7 years and LOS 19.9 days. Eighty-three patients (50.3% of total) originated from home, 10 from group homes (6.1% of total), and 72 from nursing facilities (43.6% of total). Mortality was 62.4%, highest for nursing home residents (80.6%). Findings from 253 sputum cultures overall did not suggest acute bacterial or fungal infection in 73 (45%) of 165 individuals sampled within 24 h of intubation. Cultures ≥ 1 week following intubation did grow potential pathogens in 72 (64.9%) of 111 cases with 70.8% consistent with late pneumonia and 29.2% suggesting colonization. Twelve (10.8% of total) of these late post-intubation cultures revealed worsened antimicrobial resistance predominantly in Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, or Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: In severe COVID-19 pneumonia, a radiographic ground glass interstitial pattern and lack of purulent sputum prior to/around the time of intubation correlated with no culture growth or recovery of normal oral flora ± yeast. Discontinuation of empiric antibacterials should be considered in these patients aided by other clinical findings, history of prior antimicrobials, laboratory testing, and overall clinical course. Continuing longterm hospitalisation and antibiotics are associated with sputum cultures reflective of hospital-acquired microbes and increasing antimicrobial resistance. Trial registration: Not applicable as this was a retrospective chart review study without interventional arm.","Liu, Hans H.; Yaron, David; Piraino, Amanda Stahl; Kapelusznik, Luciano",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12941-021-00472-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563202/,337

Using a laboratory scale drier, inoculated plasma was spray dried at 200 °C inlet temperature and either 70 or 80 °C throughout substance. Both liquid and dried samples were subjected to three passages on VERO cell monolayers to determine PEDV infectivity. Results indicated liquid samples contained infective virus, but none of the spray dried samples were infectious. Also, survivability of PEDV inoculated on spray dried bovine plasma (SDBP) and stored at 4, 12 or 22 °C was determined for 7, 14 and 21 days. Commercial SDBP powder was inoculated with PEDV to an average final titer of 2.8 log10 TCID(50)/g. Five samples per time and temperature conditions were subjected to three passages on VERO cell monolayers to determine PEDV infectivity. The virus was non-infectious for all samples stored at 22 °C at 7, 14 and 21 days. PEDV was infective in 1 out of 5 samples stored at 12 °C at 7 days, but none of the samples stored for 14 and 21 days were infectious in cell culture. For samples stored at 4 °C, 4 out of 5 samples were infectious at 7 days, 1 out of 5 samples were infectious at 14 days, but none were infectious at 21 days. In summary, PEDV was not infectious on cell culture within 7 days when stored at room temperature and within 21 days when stored at refrigerated temperature.","Pujols, Joan; Segalés, Joaquim",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514004994; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514004994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465663/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.021,337

Most of the previous convergence studies have taken a retrospective view in measuring the degree of convergence and monitoring the converging trends. This paper proposes a quantitative future-oriented approach to technological opportunity discovery for convergence using patent information. In a future-oriented approach, technological opportunities for convergence are suggested by predicting potential technological knowledge flows (TKFs) between heterogeneous fields. The potential TKFs are predicted by a link prediction method in a directed network, which is suggested in this paper to represent the direction of the predicted TKFs by adapting the concept of bibliographic coupling and edge-betweenness centrality. Converging technological opportunities are proposed as incremental and radical technological opportunities by extracting the potential increased knowledge flow links and emerging knowledge flow links. Moreover, the direction and themes of the predicted potential TKFs are provided as technological opportunities for convergence. As an illustration of the proposed method, the technological opportunities between biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT) are explored. Firms and researchers can use the proposed method to seek out new technological opportunities from various technologies so that R&D policymakers can plan new R&D projects on technological convergence.","Park, Inchae; Yoon, Byungun",J Informetr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157718300907; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2018.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336982/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1751157718300907,337

CS may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this study, we present our analysis of certain pathological processes that induce a CS in pregnant and postpartum women. We draw our attention to the similarities between the severe course of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). It is noteworthy that many of the criteria used to diagnose HLH are described as COVID-19 mortality predictors. Cytokine storms are considered to be an important cause of death in patients with the severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the fact that pregnant women are in an immunosuppressive state, viral pulmonary infections are more perilous for them—possible risks include miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction or birth before the term; sometimes ventilation support is needed. HLH should be considered in pregnant and puerperal women suffering from moderately severe to severe COVID-19 and presenting with: fever unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, cytopenia, hepatitis and hyperferritinaemia. The HLH disorder is rare and difficult to diagnose; however, its early detection could reduce patient mortality.","Obuchowska, Aleksandra; Standyło, Arkadiusz; Obuchowska, Karolina; Kimber-Trojnar, Żaneta; Leszczyńska-Gorzelak, Bożena",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439868/,337

The study assessed the status of HPSR domestic funding and advocacy strategies for improving HPSR funding in Nigeria. It equally explored the knowledge and perception of the domestic funding status of HPSR and the effect of capacity building on the knowledge of domestic funding for HPSR in Nigeria. METHODS: This was a sub-national study involving policymakers and researchers from Enugu and Ebonyi States in Southeast Nigeria who participated in the sub-national Health Systems Global convening for the African region. A before-after study design (workshop) was utilized. Data collection employed semi-structured questionnaires, group and panel discussions. The workshop facilitated knowledge of HPSR, funding processes, and advocacy strategies for increased domestic funding for HPSR. Pre and immediate post-workshop knowledge assessments were done. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants were involved in the study. Half were females (50.0%) and 46.2% were aged 35–44 years. Policymakers constituted 23.1% of the participants. Domestic funding for HPSR in Nigeria was adjudged to be grossly inadequate. Identified barriers to domestic funding of HPSR included bureaucratic bottlenecks, political and policy transitions, and corruption. Potential opportunities centered on existing policy documents and emerging private sector willingness to fund health research. Multi-stakeholder advocacy coalitions, continuous advocacy and researcher skill-building on advocacy with active private sector involvement were the strategies proffered by the participants. Pre-workshop, understanding of the meaning of HPSR had the highest mean ratings while knowledge of budgeting processes and use of legal action to enable opportunities for budget advocacy for HPSR funding had the lowest mean ratings. Following the capacity-building workshop, all knowledge and understanding parameters markedly improved (percentage increase of 12.5%–71.0%). CONCLUSION: This study found that there was paucity of domestic funding for HPSR in Nigeria alongside poor knowledge of budgeting and advocacy strategies among both policymakers and researchers. We recommend the deployment of these identified strategies and wider national and regional stakeholder engagement towards prioritizing and improving domestic funding for HPSR.","Okedo-Alex, Ijeoma Nkem; Akamike, Ifeyinwa Chizoba; Olisaekee, Gladys Onyinye; Okeke, Chinyere Cecilia; Uneke, Chigozie Jesse",Health Res Policy Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752682/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00701-5,337

METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment alternative, a separated adaptive dual response. We chose this approach to reduce extreme response behavior, considering the emotionally-charged topic of health data sales, and to measure willingness to accept. Previous experiments in lab settings led to demands for high monetary compensation. After a first online survey and two pre-studies, we validated four attributes for the final online study: monthly bonus payment, stakeholder handling the data (e.g., health insurer, pharmaceutical or medical device companies, universities), type of data, and data sales to third parties. We used a random utility framework to evaluate individual choice preferences. To test the expected prices of the main study for robustness, we assigned respondents randomly to one of two identical questionnaires with varying price ranges. RESULTS: Over a period of three weeks, 842 respondents participated in the main survey, and 272 respondents participated in the second survey. The participants considered transparency about data processing and no further data sales to third parties as very important to the decision to share data with different stakeholders, as well as adequate monetary compensation. Price expectations resulting from the experiment were high; pharmaceutical and medical device companies would have to pay an average digital dividend of 237.30€/month for patient generated health data of all types. We also observed an anchor effect, which means that people formed price expectations during the process and not ex ante. We found a bimodal distribution between relatively low price expectations and relatively high price expectations, which shows that personal data selling is a divisive societal issue. However, the results indicate that a digital dividend could be an accepted economic incentive system to gather large-scale, self-tracked data for research and development purposes. After the COVID-19 crisis, price expectations might change due to public sensitization to the need for big data research on patient generated health data. CONCLUSION: A continuing success of existing data donation models is highly unlikely. The health care sector needs to develop transparency and trust in data processing. An adequate digital dividend could be an effective long-term measure to convince a diverse and large group of people to share high-quality, continuous data for research purposes.","Heidel, Alexandra; Hagist, Christian; Schlereth, Christian",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310618/,337
597694,Potent mouse monoclonal antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-10-02,"Genome-wide analysis of the mode of action of GSK983, a potent antiviral agent, led to the identification of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as its target along with the discovery that genetic knockdown of pyrimidine salvage sensitized cells to GSK983. Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was converted into its triphosphate in cells. When combined with GSK983, CPU resulted in large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral infection. Our findings highlight a new host-targeting strategy for potentiating the antiviral activity of RdRp inhibitors.","Liu, Qi; Gupta, Amita; Okesli-Armlovich, Ayse; Qiao, Wenjie; Fischer, Curt R.; Smith, Mark; Carette, Jan E.; Bassik, Michael C.; Khosla, Chaitan",Cell Chem Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451945620301483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442424/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451945620301483,337

Methods : We emailed an anonymous, de-identified 22-question, multiple choice survey to all applicants to our institution for the 2021 Urology Residency Match. We asked participants about use of SM and which aspects they found useful in the application process. Univariate descriptive analyses were conducted based on survey responses. Chi-square analyses were performed to define significant differences in use of social media and resultant match outcomes. Results : Of the 528 students who registered for the 2021 AUA Match, 398 received our survey (75%), and 144 responded (27% of applicants nationwide). Of survey participants, 49% made a new account on Twitter while 30% had a preexisting account. Most participants (71%) had a preexisting Instagram account, while only 3% made a new account. Most participants agreed Twitter was used as a source to gather information about programs (84%) and learn about events (89%). Participants found SM most helpful for announcing event dates (71%) and highlighting resident social life (59%). Applicants did not match more highly on their rank lists if they used Twitter (p=0.427) or Instagram (p=0.166) and were not more likely to get more interviews if they used Twitter (p=0.246) or Instagram (p=0.114) Conclusions : Applicants found Twitter to be an important source of information through the virtual interview process. Despite the use of SM by most applicants, published content did not impact rank list decisions nor did SM engagement predict match outcomes.","Carpinito, Gianpaolo P.; Caldwell, Kelly M.; Kenigsberg, Alexander P.; Ganesan, Vishnu Khouri Roger K.; Kuprasertkul, Amy Hudak Steven J.; Lemack, Gary E.",Urology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637837/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2021.08.046,337
598000,Generation of glucocorticoid resistant SARS-CoV-2 T-cells for adoptive cell therapy,2020-09-15,"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an etiologic agent of diarrhea in dogs and is known to have spread worldwide. Mild disease or asymptomatic carriage are probably in many cases common outcomes of infection. To date, two different genotypes of CCoV are known, CCoV type I (CCoV-I) and CCoV type II (CCoV-II). CCoV type II is divided in two subtypes, CCoV-IIa (classical strains) and CCoV-IIb, with CCoV-IIb emerging as a result of a putative recombination between CCoV-IIa and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of CCoV in Greece and to genetically analyze the circulating strains. Between December 2007 and December 2009, 206 fecal samples were collected from dogs with diarrhea from kennels, pet shops and veterinary clinics of different country regions. RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR assays were used for CCoV detection and characterization. CCoV was identified in 65.1% of the dogs presenting diarrhea, being more frequently detected in animals younger than 3 months old and in animals housed in groups. In 47% of the positive samples more than one CCoV genotype/subtype were detected, with triple CCoV-I/CCoV-IIa/CCoV-IIb infections being identified for the first time. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CCoV-I Greek strains share low genetic relatedness to each other and to the prototype CCoV-I strains in the 5’ end of the S gene. Moreover, a divergent CCoV-IIa strain was identified. The circulation of highly variable CCoV-I and CCoV-IIb emerging strains, as well as the detection of the divergent strain, raise concerns on the importance of these new strains as primary pathogens of diarrhoeic syndromes diagnosed in dogs.","Ntafis, Vasileios; Mari, Viviana; Decaro, Nicola; Papanastassopoulou, Maria; Pardali, Dimitra; Rallis, Timoleon S.; Kanellos, Theophanis; Buonavoglia, Canio; Xylouri, Eftychia",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813000312; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.01.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23410992/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813000312,337

Group A rotavirus was detected in 24 (25%) of diarrhoeic lambs using sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ribonucleic acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (RNA-PAGE). Statistically no significant relation was found between rotavirus infection and age of the lambs. The prevalence of group A rotavirus was more related to meterological changes than age of the lambs as the number of diarrhoeic lambs with rotavirus infection was found to increase in spring months during which temperature and humidity ranged between 7.34 and 28.9 °C and 34.28 and 82.58%, respectively. The migration pattern of ovine rotavirus RNA in PAGE was typical of mammalian group A rotaviruses. O25, O26, O30, O43, O75, O76, O102, O113, O132, O153 and O157 E. coli serogroups were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs positive for rotavirus infection while as O8, O20, O21, O26, O39, O43, O45, O69, O75, O82, O104, O107, O113, O120, O127, O139, O141, O143, O153 and O157 serogroups of E. coli were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs without rotavirus infection. O8, O21, O43, O82, O104, O113, O120, O127, O132 and O139 serogroups, recovered from diarrhoeic faecal samples with or without rotavirus, were positive for congo red dye binding activity. O88, O113, O157 and O168 serogroups were isolated from non-diarrhoeic faecal samples out of which O88 and O168 were congo red positive. None of the lambs without diarrhoea carried rotavirus infection.

A set of four primers were designed based on the conservative sequence of coding F5 fimbriae. Temperature and time condition, specificity test, and sensitivity test were performed with the DNA of Escherichia coli (F5+). The results showed that the optimal reaction condition for LAMP was achieved at 61 °C for 45 min in a water bath. Ladder-like products were produced with those F5-positive samples by LAMP, while no product was generated with other negative samples. The assay of LAMP had a detection limit equivalent to 72 cfu/tube, which was more sensitive than PCR (7.2 × 10(2) cfu/tube). The agreement rate between LAMP and PCR was 100 % in detecting simulation samples.

Methods In spring 2019, ASTRO distributed an online survey to 3822 USRO members. The survey generated 984 complete responses (26% response rate) for analysis. Face validity testing confirmed respondents were representative of ASTRO’s RO membership. Results Nearly all respondents agreed that “ROs should be leaders in oncologic care.” Respondents indicated the ideal approach to patient care was to provide “an independent opinion on radiation therapy and other treatment options” (82.5%) or “an independent opinion on radiation therapy but not outside of it” (16.1%), with only 1.4% favoring provision of “radiation therapy at the request of the referring physician” as the ideal approach. Actual practice fully matched the ideal approach in 18.2% of respondents. For the remaining majority, actual practice did not always match the ideal and comprised a mix of approaches that included providing radiation at the referring physician’s request 24.0% of the time on average. Reasons for the mismatch included fear of alienating referring physicians and concern for offering an unwelcome opinion. One-fifth of respondents expressed a desire to expand the scope of service though interspecialty politics and insufficient training were potential barriers. Respondents interested in expanding scope of practice were on average earlier in their career (average years in practice 13.3) than those who were not interested (average years in practice 17.2, p<0.001). Radiopharmaceuticals administration, medical marijuana and anti-cancer medications prescribing, and RO inpatient service represented areas of interest for expansion but also knowledge gaps. Conclusions These results provide insight regarding US ROs’ scope of practice and attitudes on the ideal role of the RO. For most ROs, to provide an independent opinion on treatment options represented the ideal approach to care, but barriers such as concern of alienating referring physicians prevented many from fully adhering to their ideal in practice. Actual practice commonly comprised a mixed approach, including the least favored scenario of delivering radiation at the referring physician’s request one-quarter of the time, highlighting the influence of interspecialty politics on practice behavior. Advocacy for open communication and meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration presents an actionable solution towards a more balanced relationship with other specialties as ROs strive to better fulfill the vision of being leaders in oncologic care and being our best for our patients. The study also identified interest in expanding into nontraditional domains that offer opportunities to address unmet needs in the cancer patient’s journey and elevate radiation oncology within the increasingly value-based US healthcare system.","Fung, Claire Y.; Vapiwala, Neha; Mattes, Malcolm D.; Mohindra, Pranshu; Shah, Chirag; Yechieli, Raphael; Truong, Minh-Tam; Sanders, Tim; Arnone, Anna; Royce, Trevor J.; Ennis, Ronald D.",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.09.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301620343017?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360301620343017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956745/,337

Despite the high relevance for public authorities to adequately address stockpiling behavior, empirical studies on the psychological underpinnings of toilet paper stockpiling are still scarce. In this study, we investigated the relation between personality traits, perceived threat of Covid-19, and stockpiling of toilet paper in an online survey (N = 996) across 22 countries. Results suggest that people who felt more threatened by Covid-19 stockpiled more toilet paper. Further, a predisposition towards Emotionality predicted the perceived threat of Covid-19 and affected stockpiling behavior indirectly. Finally, Conscientiousness was related to toilet paper stockpiling, such that individuals higher in Conscientiousness tended to stockpile more toilet paper.

In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered as primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered as main secondary outcomes. Notably, In the last two follow-ups, each patient attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, a total of 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57 {+/-} 15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The following comorbidities were significantly different in the positive and negative PCEP groups: acute kidney disease (p=0.008) and diabetes (p=0.026).

Disruption in antenatal care (ANC) provisions during lockdown is expected due to diversion of public health facilities on pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of pregnant women who had not completed the ideal number of antenatal visits, availability of iron–folic acid (IFA) supplements and challenges in availing health services during the period of lockdown. METHODS: A concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted among pregnant women in Puducherry, India. Information on obstetric characteristics and details regarding antenatal visits were collected through telephonic interviews. In-depth interviews were conducted to understand the perceived challenges in availing health services during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Out of 150 pregnant women, 62 [41.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6–49.3] did not complete the ideal number of visits and 61 (40.7%, 95% CI 32.7–49.0) developed health problems.

Reasons behind the high financial burden of MDR-TB patients in China are the lack of a coordinated and multi-sourced financing model to secure patients’ access to the expensive novel medicines, and the absence of the safety-net for the patients with low ability to pay the costs. Appropriate health insurance benefit packages and provider payment mechanisms, supportive legal framework, coordinated policies as well as incentives for off-label use of evidence-based repurposed medicines are missing. The observations identified key intervention areas including continued efforts to make the novel effective medicines affordable and to strengthen the legislative protection for off-label use of evidence-based medicines; increase incentives for pharmaceutical companies to expand indications of established medicines based on the evidence; implement public initiatives to support the use of repurposed medicines for diseases with major public health significance, and scale up good practices from local pilots to create a coordinated multi-sourced financing model. A comprehensive approach to address the barriers in the full treatment course of MDR-TB and a safety-net for low-ability-to-pay patients are also critical to secure universal access to affordable MDR-TB medication.","Zhang, Yuou; Liu, Xuan; Yang, Linghe; Zhang, Guifang; Gu, Zhaoru; Chen, Zhongdan; Sun, Jing",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116687/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s256128,337

One potential mechanism for disparities in insomnia severity is perceived discrimination. This study tested discrimination as a mediator in the relationship between race and insomnia. METHODS: Participants were recruited from communities in the Detroit metropolitan area and were diagnosed with insomnia disorder using the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). The final sample included 1,458 individuals. Insomnia symptom severity was assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index and self-reported racial discrimination was evaluated using a single item. Racial discrimination was tested as a mediator in the relationship between race and insomnia symptom severity. Individuals were categroized as either White or a racial minority (i.e., non White individuals), with sensitivity analyses examining Black individuals and non-Black racial minority groups. RESULTS: Consistent with our hypothesis, racial discrimination was a significant mediator accounting for 57.3% of the relationship between race and insomnia symptom severity. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the indirect effect of racial discrimination was stronger in the non-Black racial minority group compared to Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support that racial discrimination is likely an important mechanism by which racial and ethnic sleep disparities exist. Implications for prevention, intervention, and treatment of insomnia in racial minorities to reduce health disparities are discussed.","Cheng, Philip; Cuellar, Ruby; Johnson, Dayna A; Kalmbach, David A.; Joseph, Christine LM; Cuamatzi Castelan, Andrea; Sagong, Chaewon; Casement, Melynda D.; Drake, Christopher L.",Sleep Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352721820301996; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928711/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721820301996,337

Veterans whose condition is the result of military service may be eligible for a disability pension. Department of Veterans Affairs compensation examinations, which determine the degree of disability and whether it was connected to military service, represent an opportunity to engage Veterans in pain management and substance use treatments. A multisite randomized clinical trial is testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) for Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal disorders. This telephone-based intervention is delivered through a hub-and-spoke configuration. DESIGN: This study is a two-arm, parallel-group, 36-week, multisite randomized controlled single-blind trial. It will randomize 1,100 Veterans experiencing pain and seeking service-connection for musculoskeletal disorders to either SBIRT-PM or usual care across eight New England VA medical centers. The study balances pragmatic with explanatory methodological features. Primary outcomes are pain severity and number of substances misused. Nonpharmacological pain management and substance use services utilization are tracked in the trial. SUMMARY: Early trial enrollment targets were met across sites. SBIRT-PM could help Veterans, at the time of their compensation claims, use multimodal pain treatments and reduce existing substance misuse. Strategies to address COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the SBIRT-PM protocol have been developed to maintain its pragmatic and exploratory integrity.","Martino, Steve; Lazar, Christina; Sellinger, John; Gilstad-Hayden, Kathryn; Fenton, Brenda; Barnett, Paul G; Brummett, Brad R; Higgins, Diana M; Holtzheimer, Paul; Mattocks, Kristin; Ngo, Tu; Reznik, Thomas E; Semiatin, Alicia M; Stapley, Todd; Rosen, Marc I",Pain Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313731/,337

They also have a 15 to 20-fold higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. Here we summarize evidence that: (i) this health disparity is partly due to insufficient vitamin D production, caused by melanin in the skin blocking the UVB solar radiation necessary for its synthesis; (ii) the vitamin D insufficiency is exacerbated at high latitudes because of the combination of dark skin color with lower UVB radiation levels; and (iii) the health of individuals with dark skin can be markedly improved by correcting deficiency and achieving an optimal vitamin D status, as could be obtained by supplementation and/or fortification. Moderate-to-strong evidence exists that high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and/or vitamin D supplementation reduces risk for many adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality rate, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, acute respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, asthma exacerbations, rickets, and osteomalacia. We suggest that people with low vitamin D status, which would include most people with dark skin living at high latitudes, along with their health care provider, consider taking vitamin D(3) supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) or possibly higher.","Ames, Bruce N.; Grant, William B.; Willett, Walter C.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33546262/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020499,337

The assay specifically detected PEDV and PCV3, with no fluorescence detected for other non-targeted pig pathogens. The assay showed a good linear relationship, and the limits of detection for this assay were 34.6 copies/μL and 61.2 copies/μL for PEDV and PCV3, respectively. The assay exhibited high repeatability and reproducibility, with intra-assay and inter-assay variation coefficients less than 2.0%. A clinical evaluation using intestinal tissue and fecal samples from piglets suffering from diarrhea at different pig farms in China revealed that the singular infection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 43.94% (29/66) and 16.67% (11/66), respectively, while the co-infection rate of PCV3 with PEDV was 27.27% (18/66). The results indicate this assay is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for PEDV and PCV3 monitoring and surveillance in the field, and provides technical support for the quantitative detection of clinical samples infected or co-infected with PEDV and PCV3.","Han, Hao-Ying; Zheng, Hui-Hua; Zhao, Yu; Tian, Run-Bo; Xu, Peng-Li; Hou, Hua-Lin; Chen, Hong-Ying; Yang, Ming-Fan",Molecular and Cellular Probes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735700/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850818302627; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850818302627; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2019.02.002,337

This study aimed to determine the feasibility of telemedicine for acute and chronic care provision in an underserved pediatric primary care center. Items assessed included patient demographic data, chief complaint, and alternative care locations if telemedicine was not available. In our setting, 62% of telemedicine visits were for acute concerns and 38% for chronic concerns. Of acute telemedicine visits, 16.5% of families would have sought care in the Emergency Department/Urgent Care, and 11.3% would have opted for no care had telemedicine not been offered. The most common chronic issues addressed were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (80.3%) and asthma (16.9%). Racial disparities existed among our telemedicine visits with Black patients utilizing telemedicine services less frequently than non-Black patients.

From earlier studies suggesting that EV shedding constitutes a cellular clearance mechanism, it has become evident that EV formation, secretion and uptake represent important mechanisms of intercellular communication and exchange of a wide variety of molecules, with relevance in both physiological and pathological situations. The putative role of EVs in hemostasis and thrombosis is supported by clinical and experimental studies unraveling how these cell-derived structures affect clot formation (and resolution). From those studies, it has become clear that the prothrombotic effects of EVs are not restricted to the exposure of tissue factor (TF) and phosphatidylserines (PS), but also involve multiplication of procoagulant surfaces, cross-linking of different cellular players at the site of injury and transfer of activation signals to other cell types. Here, we summarize the existing and novel clinical and experimental evidence on the role and function of EVs during arterial and venous thrombus formation and how they may be used as biomarkers as well as therapeutic vectors.","Zifkos, Konstantinos; Dubois, Christophe; Schäfer, Katrin",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502228/,337

The risk of a new influenza pandemic increases with the repeated interspecies transmission events that facilitate reassortment between animal influenza strains; thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the factors involved that promote or become a barrier to cross‐species transmission of Influenza A viruses (IAVs).

Asthma does not appear to increase risk for hospitalization or mortality with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to see if atopy actually protected those hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective chart review on all patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 over 2 months at a major adult and pediatric tertiary referral center hospital. Charts were evaluated for history of atopic disease, as were the need for ICU admission, requirement for supplemental oxygen and/or intubation, and in hospital mortality. RESULTS: No significant differences in outcomes for patients (n = 275) based on atopic disease were noted: ICU admission, 43% versus 44.7% (atopic versus no atopic disease, respectively; p = 0.84); supplemental oxygen use, 79.1% versus 73.6% (p = 0.36); intubation rate, 35.8% versus 36.5% (p = 0.92); and mortality rate, 13.4% versus 20.7% (p = 0.19). More patients with atopic disease had COPD listed as a diagnosis in their chart (38.8% versus 17.3%, p < 0.001). COPD was associated with an increased rate of ICU admission (aOR = 2.22 (1.15, 4.30) p = 0.02) and intubation (aOR = 2.05 (1.07, 3.92) p = 0.03). After adjusting for COPD, patients with atopic disease had a trend for reduced mortality (aOR 0.55 (0.23, 1.28), p = 0.16), but those with asthma did not (p > 0.2). CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients does not differ based on atopic status. However, adjusting for presence of COPD led to a suggestion of possible reduced severity in patients with atopy but not asthma.","Timberlake, Dylan T.; Narayanan, Deepika; Ogbogu, Princess U.; Raveendran, Rekha; Porter, Kyle; Scherzer, Rebecca; Prince, Benjamin; Grayson, Mitchell H.",World Allergy Organ J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1939455121000028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1939455121000028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520082/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100508,337

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a population-based mobile phone survey between 1 February and 10 February 2020 via random digit dialling. A total of 1011 adult residents in Wuhan (n=510), the epicentre and quarantined city, and Shanghai (n=501) were interviewed. Proportional quota sampling and poststratification weighting were used. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate perception factors associated with the public responses. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured anxiety levels using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and asked respondents to report their precautionary behaviours before and during the outbreak. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety was significantly higher (p<0.001) in Wuhan (32.8%) than Shanghai (20.5%). Around 79.6%–88.2% residents reported always wearing a face mask when they went out and washing hands immediately when they returned home, with no discernible difference across cities. Only 35.5%–37.0% of residents reported a handwashing duration above 40 s as recommended by the WHO. The strongest predictor of moderate or severe anxiety was perceived harm of the disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1), followed by confusion about information reliability (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9). None of the examined perception factors were associated with odds of handwashing duration above 40 s.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This assessment was divided into four sections: an institutional EHR readiness assessment, legal consultation, institutional review board application submission, and a test of healthcare data transmission over a blockchain infrastructure. RESULTS: All participating institutions reported the ability to electronically extract data from EHRs for research. Formal legal agreements were deemed unnecessary to the project but would be needed in future tests of real patient data exchange. Data transmission to the FDA blockchain met the success criteria of data connection from within the four institutions' firewalls, externally to the FDA blockchain via a SDB. DISCUSSION: The readiness survey indicated advanced analytic capability in hospital institutions and highlighted inconsistency in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format utilitzation across institutions, despite requirements of the 21st Century Cures Act. Further testing across more institutions and annual exercises leveraging the application of data exchange over a blockchain infrastructure are recommended actions for determining the feasibility of this approach during a public health emergency and broaden the understanding of technical requirements for multisite data extraction.

Changes to UK Government advice since the 1st Rank Forum on Vitamin D (2009) were discussed, including rationale for setting a reference nutrient intake (10 µg/d; 400 IU/d) for adults and children (4+ years). Current UK data show inadequate intakes among all age groups and high prevalence of low vitamin D status among specific groups (e.g. pregnant women and adolescent males/females). Evidence of widespread deficiency within some minority ethnic groups, resulting in nutritional rickets (particularly among Black and South Asian infants), raised particular concern. Latest data indicate that UK population vitamin D intakes and status reamain relatively unchanged since Government recommendations changed in 2016. Vitamin D food fortification was discussed as a potential strategy to increase population intakes. Data from dose–response and dietary modelling studies indicate dairy products, bread, hens’ eggs and some meats as potential fortification vehicles. Vitamin D(3) appears more effective than vitamin D(2) for raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, which has implications for choice of fortificant. Other considerations for successful fortification strategies include: (i) need for ‘real-world’ cost information for use in modelling work; (ii) supportive food legislation; (iii) improved consumer and health professional understanding of vitamin D’s importance; (iv) clinical consequences of inadequate vitamin D status and (v) consistent communication of Government advice across health/social care professions, and via the food industry.

610339,Existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient particulate matter samples: A nationwide study in Turkey,2021-01-25,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we examine the intersection of human migration and climate change. Growing evidence that changing environmental and climate conditions are triggers for displacement, whether voluntary or forced, adds a powerful argument for profound anticipatory engagement. RECENT FINDINGS: Climate change is expected to displace vast populations from rural to urban areas, and when life in the urban centers becomes untenable, many will continue their onward migration elsewhere (Wennersten and Robbins 2017; Rigaud et al. 2018). It is now accepted that the changing climate will be a threat multiplier, will exacerbate the need or decision to migrate, and will disproportionately affect large already vulnerable sections of humanity. Worst-case scenario models that assume business-as-usual approaches to climate change predict that nearly one-third of the global population will live in extremely hot (uninhabitable) climates, currently found in less than 1% of the earth’s surface mainly in the Sahara. SUMMARY: We find that the post–World War II regime designed to receive European migrants has failed to address population movement in the latter half of the twentieth century fueled by economic want, globalization, opening (and then closing) borders, civil strife, and war. Key stakeholders are in favor of using existing instruments to support a series of local, regional, and international arrangements to protect environmental migrants, most of whom will not cross international borders. The proposal for a dedicated UN agency and a new Convention has largely come from academia and NGOs. Migration is now recognized not only as a consequence of instability but as an adaptation strategy to the changing climate. Migration must be anticipated as a certainty, and thereby planned for and supported.","Balsari, Satchit; Dresser, Caleb; Leaning, Jennifer",Curr Environ Health Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-020-00291-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048318/,337

Two reviewers categorized the type of exchanges as sharing information, comparing experiences, organizing, and conceptualizing the content, as well as validating each other or galvanizing the discussion with “lightning strike” ideas. The conversation dynamics in this focus group included clear examples of interactivity in each of the categories proposed by Morgan (validating, sharing, comparing, organizing, conceptualizing, and lightning strikes) that were observed by two different reviewers with demonstrated high interrater reliability.

A Digital Application (DA) that blends the use of the Arduino sensors’ experiments with digital educational material, including Virtual Labs (VLs), was constructed from scratch to be used through the Interactive Board (IB) as a learning tool by three different student groups (N = 154). In the first stage of the learning process, all groups used only the digital material of the DA. In the second stage, the three groups used different learning tools of the DA. Through the IB, the first group used Arduino experiments, the second one the VLs, and the third only static visualizations. A pre- to post-test statistical analysis demonstrated that the first two groups were equivalent in regard to achievement in declarative knowledge tests and of a higher level than the third group.

Inflammation is a multistep process driven by a great number of mediators which regulate specific aspects of the inflammatory response, in agreement with a well-defined chronobiological program. A great number of inflammation-related diseases show a deeply altered immune chronobiology (e.g., COVID-19-related cytokines storm). This aspect highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the inflammatory phenomenon. It is fundamental to study inflammation as a multilevel phenomenon. Of particular interest is the low-grade chronic inflammation, which is an etiological factor of many chronic diseases. Nowadays, the therapeutic approach to low grade chronic inflammation is one of the great challenges of traditional pharmacology. Currently, no drugs specifically designed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory forms are available. Today, bioregulatory systems medicine (BrSM) and low dose medicine (LDM), two pharmacological paradigms grounded in systems medicine, potentially represent new tools for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. Scientific research has assessed the effectiveness and safety of both these therapeutic approaches, in particular for the management of chronic inflammatory conditions and chronic immunological dysregulations.","Fioranelli, Massimo; Roccia, Maria Grazia; Flavin, Dana; Cota, Linda",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22105277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067872/,337

We studied the clinical characteristics and therapies of severe cases in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze clinical, laboratory data and treatment of 60 severe cases with COVID-19 infection in Jiangsu Province between January 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The improvement and deterioration subgroups were compared to identify predictors of disease progression. RESULTS: A total of 653 infected cases with COVID-19 were reported in Jiangsu Province, of which 60 severe cases were included in this study. Up until April 20, 2020, the mortality of severe patients was 0%. The median age was 57 years. The average body mass index of these patients was 25 kg/m². White blood cell counts decreased in 45.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 63.3%, thrombocytopenia in 13.3% and procalcitonin levels in 88.3% of the patients were less than 0.5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and GCs therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups. Logistic regression analysis identified higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.08; P = 0.04), antiviral therapy with aerosol inhalation of interferon (OR: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.18-33.98; P = 0.03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.17-3.41; P = 0.01) as predictors of disease progression, whereas higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.57; P = 0.01) and early prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.98; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. The higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count were predictors of disease progression.

Fecal samples from 482 cats, approximately half of the cats with normal fecal consistency and half with diarrhea, were tested by zinc sulfate centrifugation and by real-time PCR for a panel of enteropathogens. At least one enteropathogen of feline or zoonotic importance was detected in a majority of cats, regardless of management model. For most enteropathogens, the presence or absence of diarrhea was not significantly associated with infection, the exceptions being Tritrichomonas foetus in sanctuary cats with diarrhea (26%) and normal fecal consistency (10%), respectively (P ≤ 0.04), and feline coronavirus in foster cats (80% and 58%) (P ≤ 0.001). The types of enteropathogens detected were related to the type of management model, e.g., viral and protozoal infections were most common in shelters, sanctuaries, and foster homes (confinement systems), whereas helminth infections were most common in trap-neuter-return programs (free-roaming cats). These results suggest that management practices for unowned cats are inadequate for control of enteropathogens and that the presence of diarrhea is a poor indicator of enteropathogen carriage. Risk-management strategies to reduce transmission to people and other animals should focus on sanitation, housing, compliance with preventive care guidelines, periodic surveillance, response to specific enteropathogens, humane population management of free-roaming community cats, public health education, and minimizing the duration and number of cats in mass confinement.","Andersen, L.A.; Levy, J.K.; McManus, C.M.; McGorray, S.P.; Leutenegger, C.M.; Piccione, J.; Blackwelder, L.K.; Tucker, S.J.",Vet J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023318301187; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.04.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023318301187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29871750/,337
613701,High-quality RT-PCR with chemically modified RNA controls,2020-11-11,"BACKGROUND: Acquisition of resistance to ""anoikis"" facilitates the survival of cells under independent matrix-deficient conditions, such as cells in tumor progression and the production of suspension culture cells for biomedical engineering. There is evidence suggesting that CD147, an adhesion molecule associated with survival of cells in tumor metastasis and cell-cell contacts, plays an important role in resistance to anoikis. However, information regarding the functions of CD147 in mediating cell-cell contacts and anoikis-resistance remains limited and even self-contradictory. RESULTS: An anoikis-resistant clone (HEK293ar), derived from anoikis-sensitive parental Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells, survived anoikis by the formation of cell-cell contacts. The expression of HAb18G/CD147 (a member of the CD147 family) was upregulated and the protein was located at cell-cell junctions. Upregulation of HAb18G/CD147 in suspended HEK293ar cells suppressed anoikis by mediating the formation of cell-cell adhesions. Anoikis resistance in HEK293ar cells also required E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Knock-down of HAb18G/CD147 and E-cadherin inhibited cell-cell contacts formation and increased anoikis sensitivity respectively. When HAb18G/CD147 was downregulated, E-cadherin expression in HEK293ar cells was significantly suppressed; however, knockdown of E-cadherin by E-cadherin siRNA or blocking of E-cadherin binding activity with a specific antibody and EDTA had no significant effect on HAb18G/CD147 expression. Finally, pretreatment with LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) inhibitor, disrupted cell-cell contacts and decreased cell number, but this was not the case in cells treated with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new evidence that HAb18G/CD147-mediated cell-cell contact confers anoikis resistance in an E-cadherin-dependent manner; and cell-cell contact mediated resistance to anoikis implicates PI3K pathway in a highly relevant cell model (HEK293ar). Understanding of the role of HAb18G/CD147 cell-cell contacts in anoikis resistance may help in understanding the survival of cells in anchorage-independent growth, such as cells in tumor metastasis and suspension culture produced for biomedical engineering. Our results also contribute to a better understanding of the biology of HEK293 cell spheroids, a major workhorse for producing human therapeutic agents and viral vaccines.","Ma, Xiao-Kui; Wang, Li; Li, Yu; Yang, Xiang-Ming; Zhao, Pu; HaoTang; Zhu, Ping; Li, Ling; Chen, Zhi-Nan",BMC Cell Biol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2121-11-27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398401/,337

Asthmatics display different phenotypes with distinct genetic components, environmental causes, and immunopathologic signatures, and are broadly characterized into type 2-high or type 2-low (non-type 2) endotypes by linking clinical characteristics, steroid responsiveness, and molecular pathways. Regardless of asthma severity and adequate disease management, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control, often triggered by respiratory infections. The interferon (IFN) family represents a group of cytokines that play a central role in the protection against and exacerbation of various infections and pathologies, including asthma. Type I and III IFNs in particular play an indispensable role in the host immune system to fight off pathogens, which seems to be altered in both pediatric and adult asthmatics. Impaired IFN production leaves asthmatics susceptible to infection and with uncontrolled type 2 immunity, promotes airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and inflammation which can lead to asthma exacerbations. However, IFN deficiency is not observed in all asthmatics, and alterations in IFN expression may be independent of type 2 immunity. In this review, we discuss the link between type I and III IFNs and asthma both in general and in specific contexts, including during viral infection, co-infection, and bacterial/fungal infection. We also highlight several studies which examine the potential role for type I and III IFNs as asthma-related therapies.","Rich, Helen E.; Antos, Danielle; Melton, Natalie R.; Alcorn, John F.; Manni, Michelle L.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101299/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.574027,337

However, there is limited experience in Asia, where the hospital is traditionally seen as a safe and trusted space for healing. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore attitudes and perceptions among patients and caregivers in Singapore toward this care model. Methods: A quantitative study design was adopted to collect data among patients and their caregivers from medical wards within two acute hospitals in Singapore. Using a series of closed-ended and open-ended questions, the investigator-administered survey aimed to explore barriers and facilitators determining patients' and caregivers' responses. The study questionnaire was pretested and validated. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression was performed to determine key factors influencing patients' decisions to enrol in such programmes. Results: Survey responses were collected from 120 participants (101 patients, 19 caregivers; response rate: 76%), of which 87 respondents (72.5%) expressed willingness to try HaH if offered. Many respondents valued non-quantifiable programme benefits, including perceived gains in quality of life. Among them, reasons cited for acceptance included preference for the comfort of their home environment, presence of family members, and confidence toward remote monitoring modalities. Among respondents who were unwilling to accept HaH, a common reason indicated was stronger confidence toward hospital care. Discussion: Most patients surveyed were open to having acute care delivered in their home environment, and concerns expressed may largely be addressed by operational considerations. The findings provide useful insights toward the planning of HaH programmes in Singapore.","Lai, Yi Feng; Lim, Yee Wei; Kuan, Win Sen; Goh, Joel; Soong, John Tshon Yit; Shorey, Shefaly; Ko, Stephanie Q.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.704465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368067/,337

Particularly important, self-sterilization occurs upon short solar irradiation of the membrane, as the embedded C-dots efficiently absorb visible light, concurrently giving rise to elevated temperatures through heat dissipation.","Singh, Seema; Shauloff, Nitzan; Prakash Sharma, Chetan; Shimoni, Ran; Arnusch, Christopher J.; Jelinek, Raz",J Colloid Interface Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021979721001880; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677194/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979721001880?v=s5,337

Infection in pregnant women can cause severe conditions for their babies. Until now, there is no data regarding Toxoplasma infection from Makassar pregnant mothers. This study aims to obtain information on Toxoplasma specific antibodies and to measure the risk factor associate with parasite infection. This cross-sectional study conducted in 9 of 47 primary health centres (Puskesmas) in Makassar. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected from 184 pregnant women aged 15–42 years old from September to October 2020. ELISA technique was used to examine the IgG and IgM antibodies. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to measure factors that independently associate with Toxoplasma antibody positivity. Our result showed the range of Toxoplasma IgM and IgG are 0.06–1.01 and 0.09–3.01, respectively. While no one of our participants has an acute Toxoplasma gondii infection (IgM positive), we found 32,6% pregnant mothers are exposed to parasite (positive IgG). Contact with cats [OR(95%CI): 10.45(3.77–28.99)], consume chicken satay [OR(95%CI): 9.72(3.71–25.48)] and consume un-boiled water/ filtered water [OR(95%CI): 5.98(1.77–20.23)] are independently associate with positive Toxoplasma IgG antibody. Based on the result, we conclude that pregnant women in Makassar are exposed to T. gondii and the oocyst and tissue cyst of parasite contaminates food and water in Makassar.","Polanunu, Nurul Fadilah Ali; Wahyuni, Sitti; Hamid, Firdaus",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086692/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245572,337

620449,A Droplet Digital PCR Assay to Detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA,2020-05-11,"There have been many chapters written about macrophage polarization. These chapters generally focus on the role of macrophages in orchestrating immune responses by highlighting the T-cell-derived cytokines that shape these polarizing responses. This bias toward immunity is understandable, given the importance of macrophages to host defense. However, macrophages are ubiquitous and are involved in many different cellular processes, and describing them as immune cells is undoubtedly an oversimplification. It disregards their important roles in development, tissue remodeling, wound healing, angiogenesis, and metabolism, to name just a few processes. In this chapter, we propose that macrophages function as transducers in the body. According to Wikipedia, “A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another.” The word transducer is a term used to describe both the “sensor,” which can interpret a wide range of energy forms, and the “actuator,” which can switch voltages or currents to affect the environment. Macrophages are able to sense a seemingly endless variety of inputs from their environment and transduce these inputs into a variety of different response outcomes. Thus, rather than functioning as immune cells, they should be considered more broadly as cellular transducers that interpret microenvironmental changes and actuate vital tissue responses. In this chapter, we will describe some of the sensory stimuli that macrophages perceive and the responses they make to these stimuli to achieve their prime directive, which is the maintenance of homeostasis.","Mosser, David M.; Hamidzadeh, Kajal; Goncalves, Ricardo",Cell Mol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-020-00541-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934339/,337

Here we address changes in dream features both during the first wave, when the Italian government imposed a total lockdown, and the second wave (autumn 2020), when a partial lockdown was effected. In April 2020 (total lockdown), 1,622 participants (M(age) = 34.1 ± 13.6 years; 1171F) completed an online survey including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a set of questions on dream features and their possible changes relative to the month preceding the lockdown (pre‐total lockdown). In November 2020 (partial lockdown), 214 participants (M(age) = 36.78 ± 14.2 years; 159F) from the previous sample completed the same survey. Approximately half of the subjects reported increased or decreased dream frequency (30.5% and 21.8%), length (27.1% and 15.8%) and vividness (31.5% and 17.1%) during total lockdown as well as during partial lockdown (frequency: 30.3% and 13.5%; length: 23.3% and 12.6%; vividness: 31.6% and 24.1%). Dream affect became significantly more negative in total lockdown relative to pre‐total lockdown and in partial lockdown relative to pre‐partial lockdown (both p < .001). Both in total lockdown and partial lockdown, increased negative dream emotionality significantly predicted changes in dream frequency, length and vividness, and was significantly predicted, in turn, by worsened sleep quality. Our data confirm that dream features are significantly affected by major life changes such as those imposed by a pandemic. The fact that between lockdowns negative dream affect returned almost to baseline level suggests that dream emotionality is closely related to lifestyle and wake‐time emotional changes. Also, our findings point to a modulating role of sleep quality on dream emotionality.","Conte, Francesca; Rescott, Marissa Lynn; De Rosa, Oreste; Cellini, Nicola; Coppola, Alessia; Cerasuolo, Mariangela; Malloggi, Serena; Giganti, Fiorenza; Ficca, Gianluca",J Sleep Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159658/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13425,337

Mortality rates are reportedly high without supportive treatment and care. Here we used next generation sequencing techniques to screen affected and unaffected individuals admitted to Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Perth between April and December 2015, with the resultant discovery of a novel nidovirus significantly associated with cases of respiratory disease according to a case definition based on clinical signs. Interestingly this virus was also found in 12% of apparently healthy individuals, which may reflect testing during the incubation period or a carrier status, or it may be that this agent is not causative in the disease process. This is the first report of a nidovirus in lizards globally. In addition to detection of this virus, characterisation of a 23,832 nt segment of the viral genome revealed the presence of characteristic nidoviral genomic elements providing phylogenetic support for the inclusion of this virus in a novel genus alongside Ball Python nidovirus, within the Torovirinae sub-family of the Coronaviridae. This study highlights the importance of next generation sequencing technologies to detect and describe emerging infectious diseases in wildlife species, as well as the importance of rehabilitation centres to enhance early detection mechanisms through passive and targeted health surveillance. Further development of diagnostic tools from these findings will aid in detection and control of this agent across Australia, and potentially in wild lizard populations globally.","O’Dea, Mark A.; Jackson, Bethany; Jackson, Carol; Xavier, Pally; Warren, Kristin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27828982/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165209,337

This disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs.

Here we report the results of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical agreement study. Thirty positive plasma or serum samples were taken from consenting individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ≥14 days from symptom onset. Seventy-five samples from before the believed circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (November 1, 2019) were used to assess specificity. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated along with the corresponding exact two-sided 95 % confidence intervals (CI) using an FDA Emergency Use Authorized PCR test as the reference method. Anti-CoV2 was shown to have 100 % sensitivity (PPA; 95 % CI 88.4–100 %) and 100 % specificity (NPA; 95 % CI 95.2–100 %). Against 157 pre-pandemic samples, no cross-reactivity was observed with seasonal coronaviruses or other respiratory pathogens tested. Additionally, no interference was observed when samples were spiked with: conjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg/ml; unconjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg/ml; hemoglobin 5 mg/ml; prednisolone 0.12 mg/ml; triglycerides 15 mg/ml.

This study aimed to examine how factors related to vaccine characteristics, their social normative influence and convenience of vaccination can affect the public's preference for the uptake of the COVID‐19 vaccine in China. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was administered to a sample of China's general population. Participants were asked to make a series of hypothetical choices and estimate their preference for different attributes of the vaccine. A mixed logit regression model was used to analyse the DCE data. Willingness to pay for each attribute was also calculated. RESULTS: Data of 1236 participants who provided valid responses were included in the analysis. There was strong public preference for high effectiveness of the vaccine, followed by long protective duration, very few adverse events and being manufactured overseas. Price was the least important attribute affecting the public preference in selecting the COVID‐19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The strong public preferences detected in this study should be considered when developing COVID‐19 vaccination programme in China. The results provide useful information for policymakers to identify the individual and social values for a good vaccination strategy. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The design of the experimental choices was fully based on interviews and focus group discussions participated by 26 Chinese people with diverse socio‐economic backgrounds.

621114,Generation of MERS-CoV Pseudotyped Viral Particles for the Evaluation of Neutralizing Antibodies in Mammalian Sera,2019-09-14,"In the USA, numerous summer programs are available for undergraduate students that seek to increase the number of individuals from groups underrepresented in medicine (URM) that matriculate to medical school. These programs have typically been conducted at research-focused institutions, involving hands-on-research and various enrichment experiences. For 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of on-campus student activities at American universities, necessitating a switch to a virtual format for these URM-focused programs. Outcomes, however, from these programs conducted virtually, necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been reported. The Penn Access Summer Scholars (PASS) program at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) targets URM undergraduates, providing two consecutive summers of mentored research and enrichment experiences, with the goal of enabling participants’ matriculation to PSOM. PASS has been an 8 week on-campus experience, but during summer 2020, virtual programming of 6 weeks was provided due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the 2020 virtual offering of PASS completed pre- and post-program surveys that included 5-point Likert-style and open-ended questions to determine the impact of the programing on self-assessments of research skills, familiarity with the physician identity, and preparedness to be a PSOM student. Post-program, participants also assessed program administration and content. With respect to program objectives, participants reported significant increases in their self-reported confidence in conducting research, understanding of physician identity, and sense of preparedness for medical school. The educational value of the program content, their level of engagement in the program and the overall quality of the program were rated as excellent or outstanding by large majorities of respondents. Content analyses of participant comments were consistent with these quantitative results. Therefore, a premedical summer enrichment program targeting URM undergraduates can be successfully conducted virtually to achieve program objectives and may increase the availability to these initiatives.","Zhou, Cecilia; Okafor, Chielozor; Hagood, Jamal; DeLisser, Horace M.",Medical education online,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789548/; https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1905918,337

The patients' signs and symptoms were temporally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have developed 2-4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). The clinical signs and symptoms present in this first cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1). On May 14, 2020, CDC published an online Health Advisory that summarized the manifestations of reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), outlined a case definition,† and asked clinicians to report suspected U.S. cases to local and state health departments. As of July 29, a total of 570 U.S. MIS-C patients who met the case definition had been reported to CDC. A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients had a clinical course consistent with previously published MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 (2-4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of Kawasaki disease.§ Median duration of hospitalization was 6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and report suspected cases to their state or local health departments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early detection and treatment.","Godfred-Cato, Shana; Bryant, Bobbi; Leung, Jessica; Oster, Matthew E.; Conklin, Laura; Abrams, Joseph; Roguski, Katherine; Wallace, Bailey; Prezzato, Emily; Koumans, Emilia H.; Lee, Ellen H.; Geevarughese, Anita; Lash, Maura K.; Reilly, Kathleen H.; Pulver, Wendy P.; Thomas, Deepam; Feder, Kenneth A.; Hsu, Katherine K.; Plipat, Nottasorn; Richardson, Gillian; Reid, Heather; Lim, Sarah; Schmitz, Ann; Pierce, Timmy; Hrapcak, Susan; Datta, Deblina; Morris, Sapna Bamrah; Clarke, Kevin; Belay, Ermias",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790663/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6932e2,337

However, studies about risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the potential impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment remain scarce. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had RT-PCR conversion at the NO.3 People's hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV/r treatment (≤10 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding.

624374,Correction to: SARS-CoV-2 testing in infertile patients: different recommendations in Europe and America,2020-07-31,"INTRODUCTION: Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wearing surgical face masks has become mandatory for healthcare staff in many countries when interacting with patients. Recently, it has been shown that wearing face masks impairs social interaction by diminishing a person’s ability to read the emotion of their counterparts, an essential prerequisite to respond adequately in social situations. It is easily conceivable that this may have a tangible negative influence on the communication and relationship between patients and healthcare personnel. We therefore investigated whether it has an effect on how patients perceive healthcare professionals when physicians and nursing staff wear portrait photos with their smiling faces in addition to face masks. METHODS: During the study period of 16 days, the medical staff of our Department wore surgical face masks at all times during any kind of interaction with patients. In a pseudorandomized order, all members of our staff additionally affixed their portrait photos to their work clothes on 8 of the 16 days. After completion of their visit, 226 patients were interviewed anonymously in a cross-sectional study design using a questionnaire in which they rated the following three items: friendliness of staff, medical quality of treatment, and how well they felt taken care of during treatment in our Department. RESULTS: On days, on which staff wore photos, mean scores of the questionnaires were significantly higher than on non-photo days (p = 0.013; mean ± standard deviation = 92.8 ± 11.3 vs. 91.0 ± 12.6; median (range) = 97 (98) vs. 96 (76)). When analyzed separately, the increased scores were only significant for the item friendliness of staff (p = 0.009; mean ± standard deviation = 95.8 ± 6.3 vs. 92.2 ± 11.5; median (range) = 98 (39) vs. 97 (54)). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the use of portrait photos with smiling faces has a positive effect on how patients perceive healthcare staff.","Wiesmann, Martin; Franz, Christiane; Sichtermann, Thorsten; Minkenberg, Jan; Mathern, Nathalie; Stockero, Andrea; Iordanishvili, Elene; Freiherr, Jessica; Hodson, Julian; Habel, Ute; Nikoubashman, Omid",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010319/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251445,337

DESIGN: Multivariable prognostic prediction model. SETTING: 127 Spanish hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Derivation (DC) and external validation (VC) cohorts were obtained from multicentre and single-centre databases, including 4035 and 2126 patients with confirmed COVID-19, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Prognostic variables were identified using multivariable logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients’ characteristics in the DC and VC were median age 70 and 61 years, male sex 61.0% and 47.9%, median time from onset of symptoms to admission 5 and 8 days, and 30-day mortality 26.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Age, low age-adjusted saturation of oxygen, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, dyspnoea and sex were the strongest predictors of mortality. Calibration and discrimination were satisfactory with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a 95% CI for prediction of 30-day mortality of 0.822 (0.806–0.837) in the DC and 0.845 (0.819–0.870) in the VC. A simplified score system ranging from 0 to 30 to predict 30-day mortality was also developed. The risk was considered to be low with 0–2 points (0%–2.1%), moderate with 3–5 (4.7%–6.3%), high with 6–8 (10.6%–19.5%) and very high with 9–30 (27.7%–100%). CONCLUSIONS: A simple prediction score, based on readily available clinical and laboratory data, provides a useful tool to predict 30-day mortality probability with a high degree of accuracy among hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Berenguer, Juan; Borobia, Alberto M; Ryan, Pablo; Rodríguez-Baño, Jesús; Bellón, Jose M; Jarrín, Inmaculada; Carratalà, Jordi; Pachón, Jerónimo; Carcas, Antonio J; Yllescas, María; Arribas, José R",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-216001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632764/,337

This study surveyed clinical trial participants to learn about the prevalence and impact of new technologies and other supportive solutions designed to improve patient engagement and retention. Patient perceptions of these convenience-enhancing solutions and how they have changed since our last study in 2017 were examined. METHODS: Based on 12,451 responses to a global online survey collected in 2019, we conducted an analysis of respondents who used convenience-enhancing solutions during their participation in a clinical trial. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of convenience-enhancing solutions is increasing and that their use correlates with high ratings for clinical trial satisfaction, as well as with high ratings for care and attention received during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of strategies and tactics are needed to reduce barriers to participation and improve retention. The use of convenience-enhancing solutions can help reduce these barriers. The solutions are also particularly popular among under-represented populations, revealing further potential opportunities to increase patient engagement specifically among these groups.","Sine, Shalome; de Bruin, Annick; Getz, Kenneth",Ther Innov Regul Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097288/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-021-00306-8,337

625732,Hypothetical targets and plausible drugs of coronavirus infection caused by SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-08-03,"Whether and when to mandate the wearing of facemasks in the community to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 remains controversial. Published literature across disciplines about the role of masks in mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is summarized. Growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne indicates that infection control interventions must go beyond contact and droplet measures (such as handwashing and cleaning surfaces) and attend to masking and ventilation. Observational evidence suggests that masks work mainly by source control (preventing infected persons from transmitting the virus to others), but laboratory studies of mask filtration properties suggest that they could also provide some protection to wearers (protective effect). Even small reductions in individual transmission could lead to substantial reductions in population spread. To date, only 1 randomized controlled trial has examined a community mask recommendation. This trial did not identify a significant protective effect and was not designed to evaluate source control. Filtration properties and comfort vary widely across mask types. Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties. However, there is no evidence that masks result in significant physiologic decompensation or that risk compensation and fomite transmission are associated with mask wearing. The psychological effects of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy, social relatedness, and competence. Evidence suggests that the potential benefits of wearing masks likely outweigh the potential harms when SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in a community. However, mask mandates involve a tradeoff with personal freedom, so such policies should be pursued only if the threat is substantial and mitigation of spread cannot be achieved through other means.","Czypionka, Thomas; Greenhalgh, Trisha; Bassler, Dirk; Bryant, Manuel B.",Ann Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370173/; https://doi.org/10.7326/m20-6625,337
625775,SARS-CoV-2 structural features may explain limited neutralizing-antibody responses,2021-01-04,"Introduction La pandémie de COVID 19 bouleverse le monde depuis plus d’un an. En l’absence de traitement efficace pour endiguer cette dernière, l’accent doit être mis sur les moyens de prévention : gestes barrières, dépistage, signalement et enfin vaccination. Le Service de Maladies Infectieuses comprenant l’activité Centre de Vaccination (CDV), peut se mobiliser pour mettre en place des actions de prévention. Matériels et méthodes Le CDV agit sur un territoire avec de fortes inégalités d’accès à la santé, tant sur le plan géographique que social. Nous avons adapté l’offre de soins en « allant vers » les populations avec mise en place des interventions de prévention. Une équipe mobile, le plus souvent infirmier et médecin, se déplace vers un site à la demande d’un partenaire (institution, association) permettant de délocaliser l’activité de prévention vers ce lieu (dépistage, vaccination). Dotée d’un camping-car médicalisé, l’équipe est autonome. La priorité est d’identifier des lieux dans lesquels la précarité, l’éloignement géographique ou les réticences représentent une entrave au dépistage et/ou à la vaccination. Fort d’une expérience de 12 ans, le service a adapté ces actions à la prévention du virus COVID 19, afin de répondre à l’afflux massif de touristes débordant les structures de dépistage existantes ou de palier à la limite du nombre de centres de vaccination autorisé. L’organisation de ces actions s’est déroulée sur 2 périodes, d’août à octobre 2020 et de février à aujourd’hui en proposant le dépistage par PCR et la vaccination. Résultats Les actions de dépistage par PCR ont permis de dépister 439 personnes dans 6 lieux stratégiques en mobilisant une équipe composée de 3 personnels soignants. Ces équipes ont parcouru le département à la rencontre de publics divers: touristes sur des plages ou des lieux de forte affluence touristique (village, port), lieux libertins, parkings. Les actions de vaccination Covid 19 HLM ont été mises en place par l’intermédiaire de partenariats avec les mairies de communes reculées, en collaboration avec l’agence régionale de santé (ARS) et la préfecture. À ce jour, 4 communes ont bénéficié de ce type d’actions et 340 personnes ont pu avoir accès à la vaccination complète anti-Covid 19. Elles ont concerné surtout des personnes âgées. Le succès de ces campagnes de vaccination réside dans l’implication des partenaires, l’organisation anticipée de la séance et l’adaptabilité des équipes. Un document tutoriel de référence a été rédigé afin d’accompagner les partenaires pour la mise en place de ces actions. Ces actions sont étendues aux structures médico-sociales accueillant des publics précaires éligibles à la vaccination. Conclusion La pandémie amplifie les inégalités d’accès à la santé et les situations critiques où les interventions HLM sont pertinentes. Notre expérience montre la transférabilité de ces actions (dépistage et vaccination) lors d’une situation épidémique sur un territoire très exposé. Par ailleurs ce type d’action de proximité renforce une communication positive autour des moyens de prévention du virus COVID-19 et notamment par rapport à la vaccination.","Ruffin, M.; Roy, M.; Eden, A.; Cornaglia, J.; Aumaître, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921001688; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921001688,337

627560,The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2,2020-03-07,"Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have suddenly become part of routine care in many hospitals. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the use of new technologies and new processes to care for hospitalized patients, including diabetes patients. The use of CGMs to automatically and remotely supplement or replace assisted monitoring of blood glucose by bedside nurses can decrease: the amount of necessary nursing exposure to COVID-19 patients with diabetes; the amount of time required for obtaining blood glucose measurements, and the amount of personal protective equipment necessary for interacting with patients during the blood glucose testing. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now exercising enforcement discretion and not objecting to certain factory-calibrated CGMs being used in a hospital setting, both to facilitate patient care and to obtain performance data that can be used for future regulatory submissions. CGMs can be used in the hospital to decrease the frequency of fingerstick point of care capillary blood glucose testing, decrease hyperglycemic episodes, and decrease hypoglycemic episodes. Most of the research on CGMs in the hospital has focused on their accuracy and only recently outcomes data has been reported. A hospital CGM program requires cooperation of physicians, bedside nurses, diabetes educators, and hospital administrators to appropriately select and manage patients. Processes for collecting, reviewing, storing, and responding to CGM data must be established for such a program to be successful. CGM technology is advancing and we expect that CGMs will be increasingly used in the hospital for patients with diabetes.","Perez-Guzman, M.

627942,Review of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission,2021-09-15,"There is recent evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19, but it is also possible that this cytokine may have a far more important role in the pathogenesis of viral infection. IL-6 is known to be modulated by Vitamin D, and there is preliminary evidence that deficiency of this vitamin is linked to poorer outcomes. To identify whether IL-6 levels prior to infection might predict outcome, early data on COVID-19 mortality from Italy and the UK were compared with previously published results of mean IL-6 levels from these countries as well as from the USA. There was a highly significant correlation (r = 0.9883; p = 0.00025) between age-stratified mortality rates and IL-6 levels from previously published data on healthy individuals. To determine whether Vitamin D may be beneficial at lowering IL-6 levels in patients, a limited analysis of trials examining the relationship between these entities published since 2015 was undertaken. Eight out of 11 studies described a significant lowering effect of Vitamin D on IL-6. Given that IL-6 likely facilitates viral cell entry and replication, levels prior to infection may predict mortality. This provides a rationale for prophylactic and therapeutic measures directed at lowering IL-6, including Vitamin D prescription.","Silberstein, Morry",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33182059/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106995; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920328976; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920328976?v=s5,337
628012,Novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and COVID19 disease; a systemic review on the global pandemic,2020-06-17,"The Angiotensin system is implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuaĺs susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID-19. We studied 204 COVID-19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 insertion/deletion and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Severe COVID-19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95%CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95%CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID-19. In conclusion, an adverse outcome of COVID-19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. Our work suggested that the ACE1-I/D might influence COVID-19 severity, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status. This result requires further validation in other large cohorts.","Gómez, Juan; Albaiceta, Guillermo M; García-Clemente, Marta; López-Larrea, Carlos; Amado-Rodríguez, Laura; Lopez-Alonso, Inés; Hermida, Tamara; Enriquez, Ana I.; Herrero, Pablo; Melón, Santiago; Alvarez-Argüelles, Marta E.; Boga, José A.; Rojo-Alba, Susana; Cuesta-Llavona, Elías; Alvarez, Victoria; Lorca, Rebeca; Coto, Eliecer",Gene,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811192030771X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.145102; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811192030771X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882331/,337

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire delivered to 329 cancer patients in 3 oncology cancer centers in Tunisia between February-May 2021. Logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratio predicting patient’s intentions toward the vaccine. RESULTS: Acceptance rate was 50.5%, 28.3% (n = 93) reported to definitely refuse the vaccine and 21.2% (n = 70) did not make their decision yet. High educational level, history of comorbidities, history of influenza vaccination in the current season, and patient’s opinion about the severity of COVID-19 did not predict vaccine resistance. However, patients who think that the vaccine may interfere with treatment efficacy (OR = 7.28, 95%CI [2.5–12.32]), or may impact cancer outcome (OR = 6.14, 95%CI [2.27–16.7]), were significantly more likely to refuse the vaccine. Patients who disagree that the vaccine is a major weapon against the pandemic (OR = 6.07, 95%CI [2.34–9.52]) or that it could reduce the virus transmission (OR = 7.34, 95%CI [4.22–11.81]) were also significantly more likely to reject the vaccination. Safety concerns were also significant predictive factors (OR = 7.9, 95%CI [4.10–11.27]. Confidence level in the authorities played a significant role in patient’s acceptance of the vaccine, indeed patients who are not registered (OR = 5.9, 95%CI [1.58–8.7]) or not informed about the Tunisian national vaccination platform EVAX (OR = 5.51, 95%CI [2.1–7.9]) were more likely to be against the vaccine.

Astronomical tuning of orbitally forced stratigraphic records to construct high-resolution Astronomical Time Scales (ATS) has led to a progressive refinement of the geologic time scale over the past two decades. In turn, these studies provide new insights regarding the durations and rates of major Earth events, evolutionary processes, and climate changes, all of which provide a scientific basis for contextualizing and predicting future global change trends. South China hosts some of the best-exposed and well-dated Neoproterozoic through Mesozoic stratigraphic sections in the world; many of which are suitable for cyclostratigraphy and calibrating the geologic time scale. In North China, several Cenozoic oil-bearing basins have deep boreholes with continuous sampling and/or well logging that enable derivation of astronomically tuned time scales for an improved understanding of basin evolution and hydrocarbon generation. This Special Issue focuses on case studies of astrochronology and applied cyclostratigraphy research using reference sections within China. In this introductory overview, we: (1) summarize all existing astrochronology studies of the Neoproterozoic through Cenozoic sections within China that have been used to enhance the international geologic time scale, (2) examine briefly the astronomically forced paleoclimate information recorded in various depositional systems and the modern techniques employed to analyze the periodicity of these signals encoded within the sedimentary record, and (3) summarize the 20 contributions to this Special Issue of Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology on 'Cyclostratigraphy and Astrochronology: Case studies from China’.","Huang, Chunju; Ogg, James G.; Kemp, David B.",Palaeogeogr Palaeoclimatol Palaeoecol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003101822030465X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934423/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003101822030465X,337

It will be critically explored if the term can be broadened to include neonatal nurse education interventions. DESIGN: A review of current literature will form the basis for the critical discussion of the term eHealth, and why it can be associated with neonatal nurse education. METHODS: The critical discussion will identify and review past and current literature relating to eHealth and its origins. It will portray the viability of the term eHealth as more than just a patient associated intervention, and why it should also be encompassed as a neonatal nurse education option. CONCLUSION: eHealth is traditionally identifiable as a service user intervention or source of information. The term should be broadened to encompass neonatal nurse education and used as a resource that is easily accessible and user friendly. This will in turn encourage the personal and professional development of neonatal nurses and should ultimately contribute to evidence based best practices in the clinical environment, despite the current global pandemic.","Cunningham, Colette; Moore, Zena; Connor, Tom O.; Patton, Declan; Bux, Dr Dhani; Nugent, Dr Linda",J Neonatal Nurs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355184120301800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1355184120301800,337

Many diagnostic techniques are showing great success and have many advantages, such as the rapid turnover of the results, high accuracy, and high specificity and sensitivity. However, some of these techniques have several pitfalls if samples were not collected, processed, and transported in the standard ways and if these techniques were not practiced with extreme caution and precision. This may lead to false‐negative/positive results. This may affect the downstream management of the affected cases. These techniques require regular fine‐tuning, upgrading, and optimization. The continuous evolution of new strains and viruses belong to the coronaviruses is hampering the success of many classical techniques. There are urgent needs for next generations of coronaviruses diagnostic assays that overcome these pitfalls. This new generation of diagnostic tests should be able to do simultaneous, multiplex, and high‐throughput detection of various coronavirus in one reaction. Furthermore, the development of novel assays and techniques that enable the in situ detection of the virus on the environmental samples, especially air, water, and surfaces, should be given considerable attention in the future. These approaches will have a substantial positive impact on the mitigation and eradication of coronaviruses, including the current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.","Hemida, Maged G.",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751621/,337

Historically, a small pneumothorax has been shown to be successfully treated without chest tube insertion, but this management has yet to be proven in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. In addition, pneumothorax in an intubated patient with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) provides additional uncertainty with pursuing non-operative management. CASE PRESENTATION: In this series we report four cases of patients with respiratory distress who tested positive for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal swab and developed ventilator-induced pneumothoraces which were successfully managed with observation alone. CONCLUSIONS: Management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia on positive pressure ventilation who develop small stable pneumothoraces can be safely observed without chest tube insertion.","Elder, Colby; Bawa, Sheina; Anderson, Douglas; Atkinson, Stephen; Etzel, Joshua; Moritz, Troy",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32958067/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-020-01297-7,337

The study aimed to explore the process of returning to gymnastics training after several months away from the gym, with a particular interest towards training load and injury. Twenty-six, national programmed gymnasts from Men's artistic, Women's artistic and Trampoline gymnastics recorded training load and injury whilst returning to training. At the end of data collection, three coaches were interviewed to further explore the experiences and practices of returning to training. Home-based training during lockdown was seen as beneficial in maintaining a level of fitness. Coaches described a gradual increase in training to reduce the risk of injury, and this partly explains a non-significant association between training load and a substantial injury (p = 0.441). However, week-to-week changes in training load following periods of additional restrictions (additional lockdown, periods of isolation, or substantial restrictions) were not always gradual. There was a significant association between an injury in the preceding week (niggle or substantial injury to a different body part) and a substantial injury in the subsequent week (RR: 5.29, p = 0.011). Monitoring training was described to be a useful practice during the process of returning to training. Coaches believed that although the short-term development of their gymnasts was affected, the long-term development would not be impacted from COVID-19. It is anticipated that learnings from this study can be applied to future practices and situations, particularly when gymnasts are away from the gym for an extended period.","Patel, Tejal Sarika; McGregor, Alex; Cumming, Sean P; Williams, Karen; Williams, Sean",Scand. j. med. sci. sports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34558741/; https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.14063,337

METHODS: Patient-reported disease activity assessed during face-to-face visits and/or via a smartphone application were compared between three periods of each 2 months duration (before, during and after the COVID-19-wave) from January to June 2020 in 666 patients with axSpA, RA and PsA in the Swiss Clinical Quality Management cohort. RESULTS: The number of consultations dropped by 52%, whereas the number of remote assessments increased by 129%. The proportion of patients with drug non-compliance slightly increased during the pandemic, the difference reaching statistical significance in axSpA (19.9% vs 13.2% before the pandemic, p=0.003). The proportion of patients with disease flares remained stable (<15%). There was no increase in mean values of the Bath Ankylosing Disease Activity Index, the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index-5 and the Patient Global Assessment in patients with axSpA, RA and PsA, respectively.

METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective observational study involving 843 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcomes, mortality, and mechanical ventilation use were compared among the three groups: control, prediabetes, and type-2 diabetes. Binomial regression analysis was used to determine predictors of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement. RESULTS: Age was a significant predictor of mortality. On stratifying our patients based on their age, older patients aged 55 years and above had no difference in mortality or mechanical ventilation requirement among the three groups of control, prediabetes, and type-2 diabetes. However, among the younger population aged less than 55 years, patients with type-2 diabetes had significantly higher mortality as compared with patients in control and prediabetes groups (27% vs 12.5% vs 9%, p 0.025). Additionally, newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes patients demonstrated lower mortality rate in comparison to previously known type-2 diabetes patients (18% vs 40%, p 0.005). Outcomes in the prediabetes group were similar to that in the control group. Admission hyperglycemia was associated with higher mortality regardless of diabetes status. CONCLUSION: In older patients aged 55 years and above, status of type-2 diabetes does not influence their mortality. However, in younger patients aged less than 55 years, the presence of type-2 diabetes is an important driver of mortality. Newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes, in comparison with previously diagnosed type-2 diabetes, may have better survival. Presence of prediabetes did not affect outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Makker, Jasbir; Sun, Haozhe; Patel, Harish; Mantri, Nikhitha; Zahid, Maleeha; Gongati, Sudharsan; Galiveeti, Sneha; Renner, Sharon W.; Chilimuri, Sridhar",Int J Endocrinol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5516192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221008/,337

Parallels with systemic inflammatory disorders such as atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) have implicated the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19, and particularly the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a released from cleavage of C3 and C5 respectively. C5a is a potent cell signalling protein that activates a cytokine storm – a hyper‐inflammatory phenomenon – within hours of infection and the innate immune response. However, excess C5a can result in a pro‐inflammatory environment orchestrated through a plethora of mechanisms, that propagates lung injury, lymphocyte exhaustion and an immune paresis. Furthermore, disruption of the homeostatic interactions between complement and extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways contributes to a net pro‐coagulant state in the microvasculature of critical organs. Fatal COVID‐19 has been associated with a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by a pro‐coagulant state and organ damage, particularly microvascular thrombi in the lungs and kidneys. Pathologic studies report strong evidence of complement activation. C5 blockade reduces inflammatory cytokines and their manifestations in animal studies, and has shown benefits in patients with aHUS, prompting investigation of this approach in the treatment of COVID‐19. This review describes the role of the complement pathway and particularly C5a and its aberrations in highly pathogenic virus infections, and therefore its potential as a therapeutic target in COVID‐19.","Chauhan, Anoop J.; Wiffen, Laura J.; Brown, Thomas P.",J Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32608159/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14981,337

The control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. This study investigates whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective preventive strategy. METHODS: The SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model with estimated parameters for the time series data of the daily MERS-CoV incidence in Korea was considered from May to December 2015. For 10,000 stochastic simulations, the SEIR model was computed using the Gillespie algorithm. Depending on the time of control intervention on the 20th, 40th, and 60th days after the identification of the index case, the box plots of MERS-CoV incidences in Korea were computed, and the results were analyzed via ANOVA. RESULTS: The box plots showed that there was a significant difference between the non-intervention and intervention groups (the 20th day, 40th day, and 60th day groups) and seemed to show no significant difference based on the time of intervention. However, the ANOVA revealed that early intervention was a good strategy to control the disease.

Investigating the serological response in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity is important for assessing the clinical utility of serological assays. GAP STATEMENT: However, few studies have investigated the clinical utility of antibody assays for COVID-19 or differences in antibody response in association with disease severity. AIM: The study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and clinical utility of VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests according to COVID-19 severity in patients in Japan. METHODOLOGY: We analysed 255 serum specimens from 130 COVID-19 patients and examined clinical records and laboratory data. Presence of total (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and specific IgG antibody for the spike 1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was determined using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. RESULTS: Overall, 98 (75.4 %) and 32 (24.6 %) patients had mild and severe COVID-19, respectively. On admission, 76 (58.5 %) and 45 (34.6 %) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody assays. Among 91 patients at discharge, 90 (98.9 %) and 81 (89.0 %) were positive for total and IgG antibody, respectively. Clinical background and laboratory findings on admission, but not the prevalence or concentration of total or IgG antibody, were associated with disease prognosis. Total and IgG antibody intensities were significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases in serum collected >11 days after onset, but not within 10 days.

The method used was a retrospective review of medical records, directly comparing the types and numbers of trauma cases as well as non-trauma cases that presented to the ED in March and April 2020 with the same period two years prior. Our results showed a reduction during both months of lockdown compared to the same time period in 2018 with trauma cases in March 2020 down 33.14% and April 2020 down 57.93%. The non-trauma ED cases were down 2.52% in March and 37.43% in April compared to two years prior. When comparing only the last 6 days of March, a significant percentage decrease is visible as trauma cases fell from 20.79% in 2018 to just 8.58% of the total cases in 2020. In conclusion, our data showed a significant reduction in almost all types of ED cases during the lockdown period, but most significantly in trauma-related cases which was likely due, inter alia, to the prohibition of alcohol sales, gatherings and unnecessary travel.","Manyoni, Mncedisi Junior; Abader, Muhammed Irfaan",Afr J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211419X20301464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2020.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520631/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211419X20301464?v=s5,337

The fact that only a small subset of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease suggests that there have to be some predisposing factors, but biomarkers that reliably predict disease severity have not been found so far. Since overactivation of the immune system is implicated in a severe form of COVID-19 and the IgG glycosylation is known to be involved in the regulation of different immune processes, we evaluated the association of inter-individual variation in IgG N-glycome composition with the severity of COVID-19. The analysis of 166 severe and 167 mild cases from hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal revealed statistically significant differences in the composition of the IgG N-glycome. The most notable difference was the decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in severe patients from all three cohorts. IgG galactosylation was also lower in severe cases in all cohorts, but the difference in galactosylation was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 304 inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects with two oral antidiabetic drugs (glimepiride 4 mg and metformin 500 mg) were randomised to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg once daily (OD) or placebo. Dose of hydroxychloroquine was selected as per body weight of the subject. Primary end point was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change at week 12 from baseline. Secondary endpoint was change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post prandial plasma glucose (PPG), body weight and any adverse reaction including no of hypoglycemic events, as well as a change in the percentage of subjects with A1C < 7.0% and > 6.5% after 12 weeks of treatment.. In follow-up of 400 mg once daily was once again divided to 200 mg twice daily (BD) to study the effect on tolerability profile for further 12 weeks. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine was associated with significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (7–8.5%) in 12 weeks −0.78%, −0.91% and 1.2% for hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg OD, respectively, versus 0.13% with placebo (P < 0.005). FPG and PPG were reduced by −25 to −38 mg/dl and 34–53 mg/dl, respectively. Body weight also reduced in each group of HCQ. Hypoglycemia was reported only with 300 mg (1.2%) and 400 mg (2.1%) group of HCQ. It was observed that patients who complains with mild GI disturbance with HCQ 400 mg glycemic efficacy was maintained with 200 mg BD with significant relief of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine added to sulphonylurea and metformin, improves glycemic control significantly in T2DM patients. Glycemic effect of different dose of hydroxychloroquine is dose dependent. The safety/tolerability profile of hydroxychloroquine was favourable except GI disturbance which is more frequent with 400 mg. This can be avoided with 200 mg BD without compromise on efficacy.","Chakravarti, H.

Every year thousands of crowded events are organised around the globe. Majority of the crowded events are religious in nature, with sensitivities and emotions attached. Organisation of crowded events, especially during a pandemic like COVID-19, poses a considerable challenge. To contain the spread of a human to human contagious disease, several restrictions, including wearing face masks, maintain social distancing, and adhering to regular cleaning and sanitisation, are critical. These restrictions stress the need for the event organisers, including the local or central government, to overhaul policies and practices about crowd management during a pandemic. Some crowded events are regular, whereas the others are occasional, which could be spontaneous such as a protest march, a political rally or a funeral procession. Controlling spontaneous crowded events can be quite difficult, especially during a crisis like COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we shall review several crowded events which have taken place during the ongoing pandemic and investigate their impact and contribution in the spreading or containing COVID-19.

This disease quickly evolved into a public health concern and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19’s high transmission rate and potential to cause a spectrum of systemic diseases makes it imperative for researchers and clinicians worldwide to collaborate and develop a strategy to manage and contain this disease. Studies have shown a wide range of hematological abnormalities and virus-related coagulopathies in affected patients, resulting in an increased propensity to develop serious thrombotic complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in severe cases. The fatal implications of coagulopathy in the form of pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebral infarction compelled us to study in-depth the pathophysiology and treatment options related to COVID-19. This analysis reviews published reports on patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and associated coagulopathy, defined as abnormalities in the coagulation parameters prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer. In this review, we present the hematological manifestations of COVID-19, focusing on virus-associated coagulopathy and relevant pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, and treatment.","Khandait, Harshwardhan; Gandotra, Garima; Sachdeva, Sonali; Kramer, Courtney A.; Nye, Derek; Golamari, Reshma; Jain, Rohit",SN Compr Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00607-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134847/,337

As of May 23, 2020, according to WHO, there are 213 countries, areas or territories with COVID-19 positive cases. To effectively address this situation, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics and to concoct efficient control measures to mitigate/contain the spread. In this work, the COVID-19 dynamics is modelled using susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed model with a nonlinear incidence rate. In order to control the transmission, the coefficient of nonlinear incidence function is adopted as the Governmental control input. To adequately understand the COVID-19 dynamics, bifurcation analysis is performed and the effect of varying reproduction number on the COVID-19 transmission is studied. The inadequacy of an open-loop approach in controlling the disease spread is validated via numerical simulations and a robust closed-loop control methodology using sliding mode control is also presented. The proposed SMC strategy could bring the basic reproduction number closer to 1 from an initial value of 2.5, thus limiting the exposed and infected individuals to a controllable threshold value. The model and the proposed control strategy are then compared with real-time data in order to verify its efficacy.","Rohith, G.; Devika, K.

This is distinct from HLH associated with immunodeficiency states termed primary HLH -with radically different therapy strategies in both situations. COVID-19 infection with MAS typically occurs in subjects with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and historically, non-survival in ARDS was linked to sustained IL-6 and IL-1 elevation. We provide a model for the classification of MAS to stratify the MAS-like presentation in COVID-19 pneumonia and explore the complexities of discerning ARDS from MAS.

However, the communities of practice in question show uneasy or under-developed collaborations, due to a variety of factors. We argue that an important factor is the way issues are raised and questions are formulated, i.e., their framing. Based on complementary perspectives on health and knowledge, this overview provides an inter- and trans-disciplinary analysis of the role of the framing of « nature » in One Health discourses as a barrier or a facilitator to collaboration, as revealed by the scientific literature. We find that the lack of reflection by scientists about the framing under which they operate appears as a major factor of misunderstanding between disciplines, and a barrier for inter- and trans-disciplinary solutions to improve management of health risks and benefits. Hence, to build such solutions, framing will have to be a conscious and repeated step in the process, acknowledging and explaining the diversity of viewpoints and values. The interdisciplinary dialogues inherent in this process promote translation between scientific domains, policy-makers and citizens, with a critical but pluralistic recourse to various framings of health risks and benefits associated with nature, and a deep awareness of their practical and ethical consequences.","Antoine-Moussiaux, Nicolas; Janssens de Bisthoven, Luc; Leyens, Stéphane; Assmuth, Timo; Keune, Hans; Jakob, Zinsstag; Hugé, Jean; Vanhove, Maarten P.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major problem in patients discharged from acute care, but no data are available on the frailty risk in survivors of COVID‐19 infection. DESIGN: A descriptive cross‐sectional study (STROBE checklist). METHODS: At admission to sub‐acute care in 2020, 236 COVID‐19 patients (median age 77 years – interquartile range 68–83) were administered BRASS and classified into 3 levels of frailty risk. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also administered to measure physical function and disability. Differences between BRASS levels and associations between BRASS index and clinical parameters were analysed. RESULTS: The median BRASS index was 14.0 (interquartile range 9.0–20.0) denoting intermediate frailty (32.2%, 41.1%, 26.7% of patients exhibited low, intermediate and high frailty, respectively). Significant differences emerged between the BRASS frailty classes regards to sex, comorbidities, history of cognitive deficits, previous mechanical ventilation support and SPPB score. Patients with no comorbidities (14%) exhibited low frailty (BRASS: median 5.5, interquartile range 3.0–12.0). Age ≥65 years, presence of comorbidities, cognitive deficit and SPPB % predicted <50% were significant predictors of high frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID‐19 survivors exhibit substantial frailty and require continuing care after discharge from acute care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The BRASS index is a valuable tool for nurses to identify those patients most at risk of frailty, who require a programme of rehabilitation and community reintegration.","Mandora, Elena; Comini, Laura; Olivares, Adriana; Fracassi, Michela; Cadei, Maria Grazia; Paneroni, Mara; Marchina, Lucia; Suruniuc, Adrian; Luisa, Alberto; Scalvini, Simonetta; Corica, Giacomo; Vitacca, Michele",J Clin Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434372/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15637,337
639907,Potential use of noncoding RNAs and innovative therapeutic strategies to target the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2,2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Thailand experienced the first wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during March–May 2020 and has been facing the second wave since December 2020. The area facing the greatest impact was Samut Sakhon, a main migrant-receiving province in the country. The Department of Disease Control (DDC) of the Thai Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) considered initiating a vaccination strategy in combination with active case finding (ACF) in the epidemic area. The DDC commissioned a research team to predict the impact of various vaccination and ACF policy scenarios in terms of case reduction and deaths averted, which is the objective of this study. METHODS: The design of this study was a secondary analysis of quantitative data. Most of the data were obtained from the DDC, MOPH. Deterministic system dynamics and compartmental models were exercised. A basic reproductive number (R(0)) was estimated at 3 from the beginning. Vaccine efficacy against disease transmission was assumed to be 50%. A total of 10,000 people were estimated as an initial population size. RESULTS: The findings showed that the greater the vaccination coverage, the smaller the size of incident and cumulative cases. Compared with a no-vaccination and no-ACF scenario, the 90%-vaccination coverage combined with 90%-ACF coverage contributed to a reduction of cumulative cases by 33%. The case reduction benefit would be greater when R(0) was smaller (~53% and ~51% when R(0) equated 2 and 1.5, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study reaffirmed the idea that a combination of vaccination and ACF measures contributed to favourable results in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, relative to the implementation of only a single measure. The greater the vaccination and ACF coverage, the greater the volume of cases saved. Though we demonstrated the benefit of vaccination strategies in this setting, actual implementation should consider many more policy angles, such as social acceptability, cost-effectiveness and operational feasibility. Further studies that address these topics based on empirical evidence are of great value.","Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong; Nittayasoot, Natthaprang; Thammawijaya, Panithee; Teekasap, Pard; Ungchusak, Kumnuan",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377040/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s318012,337

This has increased the workload on radiologists, and a number of cases are in backlog. This is not only the case for COVID-19, but for the other abnormalities needing radiological diagnosis as well. In this work, we present an automated technique for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 on computed tomography images. The proposed technique consists of four primary steps: (1) data collection and normalization, (2) extraction of the relevant features, (3) selection of the most optimal features and (4) feature classification. In the data collection step, we collect data for several patients from a public domain website, and perform preprocessing, which includes image resizing. In the successive step, we apply discrete wavelet transform and extended segmentation-based fractal texture analysis methods for extracting the relevant features. This is followed by application of an entropy controlled genetic algorithm for selection of the best features from each feature type, which are combined using a serial approach. In the final phase, the best features are subjected to various classifiers for the diagnosis. The proposed framework, when augmented with the Naive Bayes classifier, yields the best accuracy of 92.6%. The simulation results are supported by a detailed statistical analysis as a proof of concept.","Akram, Tallha; Attique, Muhammad; Gul, Salma; Shahzad, Aamir; Altaf, Muhammad; Naqvi, S.

This response in dengue virus infection remains to be elucidated. Triptolide and tetrandrine, compounds derived from two commonly used Chinese herbs, both demonstrate anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects partly through modulation of COX-2 expression and, hence, may have antiviral effects. In this study, we examined, firstly, the immune response to dengue virus infection with respect to COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in human lung cells (A549), liver cells (HepG2) and dendritic cells. Secondly, we assessed the potential antiviral effects of triptolide and tetrandrine on dengue virus infection vis-à-vis expression of COX-2, PGE(2), transcription factors, as well as virus production. We found that dengue virus infection enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in A549 cells, similarly to the response in dendritic cells, but not in HepG2 cells. In dengue virus-infected A549 cells, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) were also activated, and both were dose-dependently inhibited by triptolide (0.5–4 ng/ml). Tetrandrine (1–10 μM) had no similar immunosuppressive effects and, moreover, at higher concentrations, enhanced NF-κB and AP-1 activity, COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production. However, unexpectedly, tetrandrine, but not triptolide, dose-dependently suppressed dengue virus production in A549 cells, independent of PGE(2) level. Our findings imply that triptolide and tetrandrine may attenuate dengue virus infection in human lung cells, but through distinct pathways.","Liou, Jun-Ting; Chen, Zih-Yan; Ho, Ling-Jun; Yang, Shih-Ping; Chang, Deh-Ming; Liang, Chun-Chin; Lai, Jenn-Haung",Eur J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18565510/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299908004871; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299908004871; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.04.056,337

642346,Potential CD8+ T Cell Cross-Reactivity Against SARS-CoV-2 Conferred by Other Coronavirus Strains,2020-11-05,"Concepts for sustainable bioeconomy systems are gradually replacing the ones on linear product chains. The reason is that continuously expanding linear chain activities are considered to contribute to climate change, reduced biodiversity, over-exploitation of resources, food insecurity, and the double burden of disease. Are sustainable bioeconomy systems a guarantee for a healthy planet? If yes, why, when, and how? In literature, different sustainability indicators have been presented to shed light on this complicated question. Due to high degrees of complexity and interactions of actors in bioeconomy systems, trade-offs and non-linear outcomes became apparent. This fueled the debates about the normative dimensions of the bioeconomy. In particular, the behavior of actors and the utilization of products do not seem to be harmonized according to the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability. Potential conflicts require a new conceptual framework that is here introduced. It consists of a ‘sustainability’ cylinder captured between an inner-cylinder, representing order, and an outer-cylinder for chaos, based on the laws of physics and complex adaptive systems. Such a framework permits (bioeconomy) systems to propagate in the sustainability zone only if they follow helical pathways serving as the new norms. Helices are a combination of two sinusoidal patterns. The first represents here the sustainable behavior of interacting actors and the second the balanced usage of resources and products. The latter counteracts current growth discourses. The applicability of the conceptual cylinder framework is positively verified via 9 cases in Europe, which encompass social-organizational and product-technological innovations. –","de Vries, Hugo; Donner, Mechthild; Axelos, Monique",J Agric Environ Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10806-021-09850-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821130/,337

One of the results showed that teachers in three types of settings received different support. This either helped them to cope with the new situation of remote teaching, e.g. by choosing a platform for online teaching or providing meetings with a methodologist (private settings and language schools) or caused more confusion by leaving the decisions to the teachers (public settings).

The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus.

Consequently, dermatology conferences were forced to adapt to such changes. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on international dermatology conferences. We retrospectively investigated decisions made for international dermatology conferences scheduled for 2020. Thirty-three major conferences were analyzed. Their data were obtained from their respective websites (data was accessed 2 June 2021). Among 33 conferences analyzed, 13 (39.4%) were conducted as scheduled, nine (27.3%) were canceled, eight (24.3%) were postponed to 2021 or 2022, and three (9.1%) were delayed but conducted in 2020. The number of the cancellation (44.4%) and postponement (75%) was the largest in the second quarter of the year. During the fourth quarter, most conferences were held on schedule (70%) but were run virtually. Eight out of 13 virtual conferences shortened their duration (61.5%). Most (90.9%) conferences have decided on the schedule of their meetings for 2021 or 2022 while three (9.1%) remain undecided.

Patients with underlying comorbidities have a high risk of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, serological assays are urgently needed to diagnose asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, to estimate the prevalence of infection, and for disease prevention and control. This study aimed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. METHODS: An ELISA test was designed and established to detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples from 41 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) - positive hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Forty-two convalescent patients' sera served as positive controls, while 117 pre-pandemic serum samples were used as negative controls. RESULTS: A comparison between different SARS-CoV-2 proteins was performed, which included the full-length spike (S) protein and the S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S protein showed the strongest reactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in patients' serum samples. Additionally, since antibodies could be detected at very low concentrations, the assay was found to be sensitive. CONCLUSION: The current assay was specific, since cross-reactions with other SARS coronaviruses and respiratory viruses such as influenza were not found. Additionally, it was highly sensitive, since the test was able to identify antibodies even at very low concentrations. Therefore, this assay has promise as a screening method at the population level and may be used for in future seroepidemiological studies.","Mahallawi, Waleed H.",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361220302018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658361220302018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424527/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2020.11.011,337

Here, we used a DF1 cell line expressed viral receptor-binding protein to efficiently identify chicken Annexin A2 (chANXA2) as a novel receptor for retrovirus ALV-J (avian leukosis virus subgroup J). Our data demonstrate that antibodies or siRNA to chANXA2 significantly inhibited ALV-J infection and replication, and over-expression of chANXA2 permitted the entry of ALV-J into its non-permissible cells. Our findings have not only identified chANXA2 as a novel biomarker for anti-ALV-J, but also demonstrated that cell lines with the expression of viral receptor-binding protein could be as efficient tools for isolating functional receptors to identify novel anti-viral targets.","Mei, Mei; Ye, Jianqiang; Qin, Aijian; Wang, Lin; Hu, Xuming; Qian, Kun; Shao, Hongxia",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25604889/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07935,337

While key elements of the application process such as submission timelines and documentation guidelines are usually outlined in the faculty handbook of the specific institution, many aspects of assembling the dossier are not necessarily detailed in writing anywhere. Instead, there are important elements of the T&P process that typically rely on institutional knowledge and guidance that is often communicated informally. Junior faculty who have limited access to “informal communications” are at a significant disadvantage when they go through the T&P process even when they show accomplishments in teaching effectiveness, research, and service. The problem is especially important for women and underrepresented minority faculty in STEM disciplines that are less well represented among senior faculty in STEM. Senior faculty often serve as informal or formal mentors to their less seasoned colleagues. The goal of this article is to help demystify the T&P process by offering practical suggestions and describing some of the specific materials and steps that are an important part of documenting the development of a faculty member at a PUI.","Vega, Leticia R.; Hengartner, Christoph J.",BMC Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158049/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12919-021-00219-2,337

This pandemic continues to cause widespread personal suffering, along with severe pressure on medical and health care providers. The symtoms of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the subsequent prognosis is worsened in individuals who have pre‐exisiting comorbidities prior to infection by the virus. Individuals with obesity/overweight, insulin resistance and diabetes typically have chronic low‐grade inflammation characterized by increased levels of several pro‐inflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome: this state predisposes to greater risk for infection along with more adverse outcomes.

644789,Loss of orf3b in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains,2020-12-24,"BACKGROUND: With the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc globally, the extremely vulnerable subset of cancer palliative care patients has to go through the worst nightmare. Difficulty in accessing medical care in the event of increased symptom burden, obstacles in reaching hospitals at time of emergencies or end of life, limited access to medication, social distancing causing isolation, leading to psychosocial burden, lack of bereavement support, are few of the issues we identified. Palliative home care is an important tool to allay the anxieties and address the fears of cancer patients and caregivers, by ensuring continuity of care and providing the much needed handholding in these difficult times. This article aims to highlight the home-based care strategy and experience of the Cipla Palliative Care and Training Center during the COVID-19 lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have utilized the data of documentation of the process of designing the protocol, the data entered by the team on unique data management software that is used at the palliative care center to record all palliative care interventions and reflections of the team on their experience of home visits during this period. RESULTS: Continuity of care through home visits will ensure better management of patients in terms of physical symptoms, psychosocial support, allaying fears, and anxieties, as well as the ultimate goal of an improved quality of life. Physical symptoms (24%), morphine drop off (19%), psychosocial support (15%), end of life care (33%), and procedures (9%) were the major indications of visits. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for support, thus reiterating the importance of continuity of care. With abundant precautions and protocols in place, home care through visits is possible. With the lockdown and restrictions now entering their fourth phase, we need to be ready now more than ever to adapt to changing times and evolving definitions of the “New Normal.”","Page, Nivedita; Naik, Vinay; Singh, Priya; Fernandes, Prakash; Nirabhawane, Vivek; Chaudhari, Santosh",Indian J Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33088091/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpc.ijpc_151_20,337

Post Pregnancy Family Planning Choices, an operations research study, aims to examine the effectiveness of a package of postpregnancy FP interventions, inclusive of postpartum and postabortion FP. The interventions are being implemented in selected public and private facilities in Indonesia and Kenya and focus on quality FP counseling and service provision prior to discharge. This manuscript presents the study protocol, documenting how the study team intends to determine key factors that influence uptake of postpregnancy FP. Methods: This is a multi-country, quasi-experimental three-year operations research study in Brebes and Batang Districts of Indonesia and Meru and Kilifi Counties of Kenya. Quantitative and qualitative data is collected longitudinally through interviews and health facility assessments at multiple time points. Data is gathered from 22 health facilities; 8,796 antenatal, postpartum, and postabortion clients; and key informants at national, subnational, facility, and community levels. Quantitative study data is collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Once data are thoroughly cleaned and reviewed, regression models and multilevel analyses will explore quantitative data. Qualitative study data is collected using audio recordings and transcribed to Microsoft Word, then analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Qualitative datasets will be analyzed using grounded theory methods. Discussion: The ultimate goals of the study are to generate and disseminate actionable evidence of positive drivers, barriers, and activities that do not yield results with regard to increasing postpregnancy FP programmatic activities, and to institutionalize postpregnancy FP in the public and private sectors in Indonesia and Kenya. We hope these learnings and experience will contribute to global efforts to advance and scale up postpregnancy FP in similar settings beyond these two countries.

Given incomplete reporting of contextual disaggregation in cumulative case data reported by health departments in the U.S., this research links county- and state-level characteristics to the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A statistical exponential growth model is estimated to describe the outbreak rate using publicly available county-level outbreak data. County- and state-level effects are simultaneously tested with a multilevel linear model using full maximum likelihood. Results: Mirroring findings from international cultural research, collectivism as a value is positively associated with the outbreak rate. The racial and ethnic composition of counties contributes to differences in the outbreak, with Black/African and Asian Americans being more affected. As expected, counties with a higher median age have a stronger outbreak, and so do counties with more people below the age of 18. Higher income, education, and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Contrariwise, obesity is negatively and significantly related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Smoking is negatively related, but only directionally informative. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak, but population density does not give statistical significance. Conclusions: The results show that contextual factors influence the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Because of a high intrastate and intercounty variation in these factors, policy makers need to look at pandemics from the smallest subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented effectively.","Messner, W.; Payson, S.

In permissive cell lines, effects of SARS-CoV on cellular gene expression were analysed using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Caco-2 and CL-14 cell lines were found to be highly permissive to SARS-CoV, due to the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a functional receptor.

Over the March-May 2020 study period, excess mortality is only found among those aged 65 and over. For this group, we find a significant negative income gradient in excess mortality, with excess deaths in the bottom income decile more than twice as high as in the top income decile for both men and women. However, given the high inequality in mortality in normal times, the income gradient in all-cause mortality is only marginally steeper during the peak of the health crisis when expressed in relative terms. Leveraging our individual-level data, we gauge the robustness of our results for other socioeconomic factors and decompose the role of individual vs. local effects. We provide direct evidence that geographic location effects on individual mortality are particularly strong during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, channeling through the local number of Covid infections. This makes inference about the income gradient in excess mortality based on geographic variation misguided.

There are no approved therapeutic agents available for RVFV; however, finding an effective antiviral agent against RVFV is important. This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of medicinal plant extracts. Twenty medicinal plants were screened for their anti-RVFV activity using the cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method. The cytotoxicity assessment of the extracts was done before antiviral screening using the MTT assay. Antioxidant and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species’ (ROS/RNS) inhibitory activity by the extracts was investigated using non-cell-based and cell-based assays. Out of twenty plant extracts tested, eight showed significant potency against RVFV indicated by a decrease in tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) < 10(5). The cytotoxicity of extracts showed inhibitory concentrations values (IC(50)) > 200 µg/mL for most of the extracts. The antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory results revealed that extracts scavenged free radicals exhibiting an IC(50) range of 4.12–20.41 µg/mL and suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by 60–80% in Vero cells. This study demonstrated the ability of the extracts to lower RVFV viral load and their potency to reduce free radicals.","More, Garland K.; Makola, Raymond T.; Prinsloo, Gerhard",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572659/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020221,337

We previously developed potent fully human monoclonal antibodies and inhibitory peptides against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory illness with high mortality. Here, we describe the generation of antibody-peptide bispecific fusion proteins, each of which contains an anti-MERS-CoV single-chain antibody m336 (or normal human IgG1 CH3 domain as a control) linked with, or without, a MERS-CoV fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P. We found that one of these fusion proteins, designated as m336 diabody-pep, exhibited more potent inhibitory activity than the antibody or the peptide alone against pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, suggesting its potential to be developed as an effective bispecific immunotherapeutic for clinical use.","Wang, Lili; Xu, Jiyan; Kong, Yu; Liang, Ruiying; Li, Wei; Li, Jinyao; Lu, Jun; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Yu, Fei; Wu, Yanling; Ying, Tianlei",Antibodies (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antib8040053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690009/,337

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary pediatric hospital in the State of Qatar at the time of the study. Qatar is a rapidly developing country with limited national data on the awareness of medication misuse among adults living with children at home and on the safety practices regarding medication disposal. RESULTS: 305 questionnaires were completed (response rate = 90%). More than 80% of parents were in between 20 and 39 years of age, 70% of them were females, and 80% were college graduates. Approximately 90% of participants have immediate relatives who were taking medications for chronic diseases. Almost 60% of parents stated that they keep unused medications at home, whereas 10% were not aware of the fate of the left over medications. Approximately 95% of the parents dispose the expired medications. In terms of the mode of disposing the medications, 66% of caregivers dispose the medication bottle or package in the trash can, whereas 14% remove the medications from the bottles or packages and throw them in the trash, and 15% put them through the drain. When asked if participants read disposal measures in the medication pamphlet, only 10% answered “always,” whereas 26% answered “sometimes.” Participants were asked if they have heard of any medications take-back programs, 75% answered no, whereas 14% were not sure. However, almost 60% of them will use the take-back program if available and 18% were not sure. CONCLUSION: Parents residing in the State of Qatar have deficiencies in knowledge about medication disposal. Parent's attitudes and perceptions are considered indispensable targets for community health intervention. Our next step is to share our data with the ministry of health to spread awareness about the proper disposal of medicines and take-back programs in Qatar.","Hendaus, Mohamed A.; Darwish, Shereen; Saleh, Manar; Mostafa, Omar; Eltayeb, Ahmed; Al-Amri, Mohammed; Siddiqui, Faisal J.; Alhammadi, Ahmed",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568157/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1141_20,337

The main focus of this paper is to investigate the effect of polynomial trajectories on the vibration of the cable-suspended payload and to show which polynomial trajectory results in less vibration. A mathematical analysis and a parametric study were carried out to investigate the effect of the degree of the polynomial trajectory on its kinematic behavior. A conjecture relates the degree of the polynomial trajectory and its kinematic behavior to the corresponding payload vibration was introduced. The base excitation model of vibratory systems was proposed as the model of the transportation system of interest. The vibration analysis of both the transportation system and the polynomial trajectories was conducted analytically to show which polynomial trajectory has the least payload vibration. A second stage of payload vibration reduction was provided by introducing a method to reduce the transmitted vibration from the quadrotor to the payload for any quadrotor trajectory. A roadmap to design the transportation task that can reduce the payload vibration was proposed. Both the simulation and the experimental results were presented, discussed and analyzed to verify the findings of this paper.","Alkomy, Hassan; Shan, Jinjun",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06464-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972816/,337

Methods We reviewed the clinical course of 37 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection supported by venovenous ECMO at four ECMO referral centers within a large healthcare system. Patient characteristics, progression of hemodynamics and inflammatory markers, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results The patients had median age of 51 years (interquartile range [IQR] 40-59), and 73% were male. Peak plateau pressures, vasopressor requirements, and arterial PaCO2 all improved with ECMO support. In our patient population, 24/37 patients (64.8%) survived to decannulation and 21/37 patients (56.8%) survived to discharge. Among patients discharged alive from the ECMO facility, 12 patients were discharged to a long-term acute care or rehabilitation facility, 2 were transferred back to the referring hospital for ventilatory weaning, and 7 were discharged directly home.

The responses regarding immunosuppressive therapy for remission induction and maintenance, COVID-19 testing, and preventive measures were recorded. A total of 304 responses were recorded. Most of the respondents were from India (83.9%) and comprised rheumatologists (66%) in practice for ≥ 5 years (71%). Though a majority preferred Rituximab or intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) as a remission induction agent, a significant proportion opted for oral CYC and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) also. Only one-third wanted to test for COVID-19 before initiating immunosuppressive therapy in patients with organ/life-threatening manifestations. Rituximab was the most favored maintenance therapy (47%), followed by azathioprine, MMF, and methotrexate. The results of this focused survey of managing AAV patients depict the real-world dilemmas and physicians’ choices in this setting.","Kopp, Chirag Rajkumar; Naidu, GSRSNK; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Deo, Prateek; Jakulla, Roopesh Sai; Makan, Kavita; Maharaj, Ajesh; Agarwal, Vikas; Sharma, Aman",Rheumatol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34427760/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04975-4,337

We aimed to develop a risk score to identify patients with increased risk of COVID-19, allowing proper identification and allocation of limited resources. A retrospective study was conducted of 338 patients who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency room to regular floors and tested for COVID-19 at an acute care hospital in the Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The dataset was split into development and validation sets with a ratio of 6:4. Demographics, presenting symptoms, sick contact, triage vital signs, initial laboratory and chest X-ray results were analysed to develop a prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a stepwise fashion to develop a prediction model, and a scoring system was created based on the coefficients of the final model. Among 338 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, 136 (40.2%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 202 (59.8%) patients tested negative. Sick contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case (3 points), nursing facility residence (3 points), constitutional symptom (1 point), respiratory symptom (1 point), gastrointestinal symptom (1 point), obesity (1 point), hypoxia at triage (1 point) and leucocytosis (−1 point) were included in the prediction score. A risk score for COVID-19 diagnosis achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–0.92) in the development dataset and 0.85 (95% CI 0.78–0.92) in the validation dataset. A risk prediction score for COVID-19 can be used as a supplemental tool to assist clinical decision to triage, test and quarantine patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room.","Sung, Joowhan; Choudry, Naveed; Bachour, Rima",Epidemiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183384/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820002769,337

The second objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective pre-post study was conducted with first time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada between July 15th and September 19th, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrolment (after birth) and six-weeks postpartum. Variety of standardized measures were used and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes and qualitative feedback was analysed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 88 women enrolled. Self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B:33.33; F:37.11, p=0.000) while anxiety (STAI) declined (B:38.49; F:34.79; p=0.004). No other significant changes were found. In terms of acceptability, 89% of participants felt that the number of messages were just right, 84.5% felt the messages contained all the information they needed relative to caring for a newborn and 98.8% indicated they would recommend this program to other new mothers. CONCLUSION: Essential Coaching for Every Mother may play a role increasing maternal self-efficacy and decreasing anxiety, although future work with a control group is important to delineate the true effects of the program. Overall, mothers were satisfied with the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program and would recommend it for other mothers, during COVID-19 and beyond.","Dol, J.; Aston, M.; Grant, A.; McMillan, D.; Tomblin Murphy, G.; Campbell-Yeo, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249598v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249598,337
651278,Engineering of the current nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND: When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, surgical services had to design and implement a new system to safely manage patients and prevent workforce exposure. METHODS: A team of clinicians and educators rapidly reengineered the surgical care process. An online learning management system (LMS) and authoring tool that supported iterative remote asynchronous communication was used to build a learning module employed to train an interprofessional team to the new care process. RESULTS: Care process redesign was accomplished in a concentrated effort involving clinicians and educators. Patient flow and the role of each team member at every phase of care was presented in the LMS. The LMS was refined by input from team members provided through the authoring tool directly to the educator on the screens where the edit was applicable. The LMS was deployed after four days to more than 100 surgical team members who managed their first COVID-19 patient two days later. The number of COVID-19 patients managed was limited, but there were no untoward patient events and no staff exposure. CONCLUSION: Care process reengineering and deployment efforts are accelerated by early involvement of educators and use of an LMS with an authoring tool that supports rapid module build and refinement in a socially distant workplace. The LMS enables access on any online platform at a time convenient to team members who can then learn at their own pace. This reengineering and LMS development approach can be generally applied to speed many care process modification and improvement efforts.","Stickney, Isaac; Schoenbrod, Tanja; Cushing, Haley; Grosvenor, Julie; Cushing, Brad",Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622541/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553725021000301; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553725021000301?v=s5,337

DESIGN: Regression discontinuity and time-to-event analysis. SETTING: Two large academic hospitals in a unified health system. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS: Adult decedents who received greater than or equal to 1 day of ICU care during their terminal admission over a 12-month period. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of a visit restriction policy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 940 adult decedents without coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period. For these patients, ICU length of stay was 0.8 days longer following policy implementation, although this effect was not statistically significant (95% CI, –2.3 to 3.8; p = 0.63). After excluding patients admitted before the policy but who died after implementation, we observed that ICU length of stay was 2.9 days longer post-policy (95% CI, 0.27–5.6; p = 0.03). A time-to-event analysis revealed that admission after policy implementation was associated with a significantly longer time to first do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort care order (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.1; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Policies restricting family presence may lead to longer ICU stays and delay decisions to limit treatment prior to death. Further policy evaluation and programs enabling access to family-centered care and palliative care during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic are imperative.","Azad, Tej D.; Al-Kawaz, Mais N.; Turnbull, Alison E.; Rivera-Lara, Lucia",Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826588/,337
651472,Potential zoonotic sources of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections,2020-10-23,"Abstract Background The 2nd-to-4th digit ratio (2D: 4D) is a putative predictor of a prenatal exposure to sex hormones. 2D:4D is sexually dimorphic (males < females). Studies, linking digit ratio and full facial shapes among Europeans, show that a low 2D:4D is associated with a set of male-specific facial features. Buryats – Mongolian people from Southern Siberia – demonstrate a different pattern of facial sexual dimorphism than Europeans (narrower and more vertically elongated faces in men as opposed to women). Aim The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between facial shape and the 2D:4D in comparison to the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism in Buryats. Subjects Buryats: 88 men and 80 women aged 20 ± 2 years. Outcome measures To assess relationship between facial shape and 2D:4D we used a geometric morphometric approach based on standardized full-face frontal photographs and direct measurements of the digit lengths among right-handed individuals. Results The results revealed that 2D:4D was associated with facial morphology in Buryat men, and to a lesser extent in women. Narrower faces, elongated in the vertical direction, and a narrower lower facial outline, were characteristic of Buryat men with low 2D:4D ratios, which corresponded to the male-like facial shapes in Buryats. Conclusions In Europeans, such facial features were reported for men with high 2D:4D, which corresponded to female-like European facial shapes. Hence, our results show that sex-specific morphogenesis in humans is multidirectional, and that digit ratio is capable of predicting sex-specific facial traits even in populations with differing sexually-dimorphic morphology.","Rostovtseva, Victoria V.; Mezentseva, Anna A.; Windhager, Sonja; Butovskaya, Marina L.",Early Hum Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750625/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220304540?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220304540; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105138,337

652240,Infection with MERS-CoV Causes Lethal Pneumonia in the Common Marmoset,2014-08-21,"Background: Between the end of February and the beginning of June 2020, Italy was certainly one of the most affected countries in the world by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, the web interest in the novel coronavirus has undergone a drastic surge. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze quantitatively the impact of COVID-19 on web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects, as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic. We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian web user in the international, national, and regional COVID-19 situation. By doing so, from the analysis of web searches, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population. Methods: To conduct this research we used the ""Google Trends"" tool, which returns normalized values, called ""relative search volume"" (RSV), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the web popularity of a group of queries. By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being. Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations {rho} ; between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region. We chose a p-value (p) threshold =.1. Results: After the two initial spikes that occurred on February 23 and March 9, 2020, the general web interest in COVID-19 in Italy has waned, as has the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p< .1 only until March 14, 2020). Anyway, web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (ASV=92,SD=6). We also found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at national but not international nor regional level. Between 20 February and 10 June, 2020, web interest relating to hygiene and prevention increased by 116 and 901% respectively compared to those from 1 January to 19 February, 2020 (95% CIs: [115.3,116.3],[850.3,952,2]). Significant correlations between regional cumulative web searches and COVID-19 cases were found only between February 26 and March 7, 2020 ({rho}-best= .43, 95% CI:[.42.44],p= .07). During the COVID-19 pandemic until 10 June, 2020, national web searches of the generic terms ""fear"" and ""anxiety"" grew by 8 and 21% respectively (95% CIs: [8.0,8.2],[20.4,20.6]) compared to those of the period 1 January, 2018 - 29 December, 2019. We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data. Conclusions: The Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem. In general, web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region; we conclude that the danger, once it arrived in the country, was perceived similarly in all regions. We can state that the period of maximum effectiveness of the online information, in relation to this type of situation, is limited to 3-4 days from a specific key event. If such a scenario were to occur again, we suggest that all government agencies focus their web disclosure efforts over that time. Despite this, we have found cyclical correlations with research related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress. Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related web queries.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize SARS-CoV-2 infections in staff and students in an urban public school setting and evaluate test-based strategies to support ongoing risk assessment and mitigation for kindergarten through 12th grade in-person learning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot quality improvement program engaged 3 schools in Omaha, Nebraska, for weekly saliva polymerase chain reaction testing of staff and students participating in in-person learning over a 5-week period from November 9 to December 11, 2020. Wastewater, air, and surface samples were collected weekly and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA to evaluate surrogacy for case detection and interrogate transmission risk of in-building activities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and environmental samples and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 2885 supervised, self-collected saliva samples were tested from 458 asymptomatic staff members (mean [SD] age, 42.9 [12.4] years; 303 women [66.2%]; 25 Black or African American [5.5%], 83 Hispanic [18.1%], 312 White [68.1%], and 35 other or not provided [7.6%]) and 315 students (mean age, 14.2 [0.7] years; 151 female students [48%]; 20 Black or African American [6.3%], 201 Hispanic [63.8%], 75 White [23.8%], and 19 other race or not provided [6.0%]). A total of 46 cases of SARS-CoV-2 (22 students and 24 staff members) were detected, representing an increase in cumulative case detection rates from 1.2% (12 of 1000) to 7.0% (70 of 1000) among students and from 2.1% (21 of 1000) to 5.3% (53 of 1000) among staff compared with conventional reporting mechanisms during the pilot period. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater samples from all pilot schools as well as in air samples collected from 2 choir rooms. Sequencing of 21 viral genomes in saliva specimens demonstrated minimal clustering associated with 1 school. Geographical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases reported district-wide demonstrated higher community risk in zip codes proximal to the pilot schools. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of staff and students in 3 urban public schools in Omaha, Nebraska, weekly screening of asymptomatic staff and students by saliva polymerase chain reaction testing was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 case detection, exceeding infection rates reported at the county level. Experiences differed among schools, and virus sequencing and geographical analyses suggested a dynamic interplay of school-based and community-derived transmission risk. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the performance and community value of test-based SARS-CoV-2 screening and surveillance strategies in the kindergarten through 12th grade educational setting.","Crowe, John; Schnaubelt, Andy T.; SchmidtBonne, Scott; Angell, Kathleen; Bai, Julia; Eske, Teresa; Nicklin, Molly; Pratt, Catherine; White, Bailey; Crotts-Hannibal, Brodie; Staffend, Nicholas; Herrera, Vicki; Cobb, Jeramie; Conner, Jennifer; Carstens, Julie; Tempero, Jonell; Bouda, Lori; Ray, Matthew; Lawler, James V.; Campbell, W.

This HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay is simple and rapid, and amplification can be completed within 35 min under isothermal conditions at 60 °C. The 100% detection limit of HIV-1 RT-LAMP was determined using a standard strain (WHO HIV-1 [97/656]) in octuplicate and found to be 120 copies/ml. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated for use for clinical diagnosis using plasma samples collected from 57 HIV-1-infected and 40 uninfected individuals in Cameroon, where highly divergent HIV-1 strains are prevalent. Of the 57 samples from infected individuals, 56 harbored group-M HIV-1 strains, such as subtypes A, B, G, F2, and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) _01, _02, _09, _11, _13; all were RT-LAMP positive. One sample harboring group-O HIV-1 and the 40 HIV-1-uninfected samples were RT-LAMP negative. These findings indicate that HIV-1 RT-LAMP can detect HIV-1 group-M RNA from plasma samples rapidly and with high sensitivity and specificity. These data also suggest that this RT-LAMP assay can be useful for confirming HIV diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.","Hosaka, Norimitsu; Ndembi, Nicaise; Ishizaki, Azumi; Kageyama, Seiji; Numazaki, Kei; Ichimura, Hiroshi",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19186193/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409000020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409000020,337
654742,Implementation of an efficient SARS-CoV-2 specimen pooling strategy for high throughput diagnostic testing,2021-09-07,"Rural areas of the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, exacerbated by COVID-19-related economic upheavals. While polysubstance use is an important determinant of overdose risk, variability in polysubstance use as a result of numerous factors (e.g., access, preference) has yet to be described, particularly among rural persons with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). Survey data on past-month use of prescription and illicit opioids and 12 non-opioid psychoactive drug classes were analyzed from a national sample of rural (n = 3872) and urban (n = 8153) residents entering treatment for OUD from 2012 to 2019. Trend analyses for opioid and stimulant use were compared between rural and urban PWOUD. Latent class analyses assessed substance use trends through identified typologies of rural/urban PWOUD, which then underwent comparative analyses. By 2019, prescription opioid use remained greater in rural versus urban PWOUD, and methamphetamine use showed greater growth in rural, compared to urban areas. Latent class analyses identified variability in polysubstance use, with five identical subgroups in rural/urban PWOD: high polysubstance, polyprescription, prescription opioid-focused, prescription opioid-focused with polysubstance use, and illicit opioid-focused. Polyprescription was highest in rural areas, with illicit opioid-focused use highest in urban areas. Demographic characteristics, co-morbid conditions and healthcare coverage were all associated with between-group differences. There is significant variability in polysubstance use that may identify specific prevention and treatment needs for subpopulations of OUD patients: interventions focused on reducing opioid prescriptions, early engagement with mental health resources, wider distribution of naloxone, and screening/treatment plans that take into account the use of multiple substances.","Ellis, Matthew S; Kasper, Zachary A; Cicero, Theodore J",Preventive medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293380/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106729,337
655227,Cold and dry winter conditions are associated with greater SARS-CoV-2 transmission at regional level in western countries during the first epidemic wave,2021-06-17,"Lack of detailed knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been hampering the development of treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we report that RNA triggers the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, N. By analyzing all 29 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we find that only N is predicted as an LLPS protein. We further confirm the LLPS of N during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 100,849 genome variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the GISAID database, we identify that ~37% (36,941) of the genomes contain a specific trio-nucleotide polymorphism (GGG-to-AAC) in the coding sequence of N, which leads to the amino acid substitutions, R203K/G204R. Interestingly, N(R203K/G204R) exhibits a higher propensity to undergo LLPS and a greater effect on IFN inhibition. By screening the chemicals known to interfere with N-RNA binding in other viruses, we find that (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), a polyphenol from green tea, disrupts the LLPS of N and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, our study reveals that targeting N-RNA condensation with GCG could be a potential treatment for COVID-19.","Zhao, Ming; Yu, Yu; Sun, Li-Ming; Xing, Jia-Qing; Li, Tingting; Zhu, Yunkai; Wang, Miao; Yu, Yin; Xue, Wen; Xia, Tian; Cai, Hong; Han, Qiu-Ying; Yin, Xiaoyao; Li, Wei-Hua; Li, Ai-Ling; Cui, Jiuwei; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Xue-Min; Li, Tao",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22297-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837182/,337

Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis using inverse variance random effect models including all studies that evaluate the role of ACEIs/ARBs and reported adjusted odds ratio. Results: Nine studies met our eligibility criteria that enrolled a population of 58615 patients infected with SASR-CoV-2. Prior use of ACEIs/ARBs were associated with significant reduction of inpatient mortality among infected patients with SASR-CoV-2, adjusted odds ratio from 4 studies 0.33, 95% confidence interval ( 0.22,0.49) with zero in between studies heterogeneity and with significant reduction of critical or fatal outcome , pooled adjusted odds ratio from 5 studies 0.32,95% confidence interval ( 0.22,0.46) with no in between studies heterogeneity. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prior use ACEIs /ARBs is associated with a decreased risk of death or critical outcome among SASR-CoV-2 infected patients.This findings is limited by the observational nature of included studies.However, it provides a reassurance to the public not to stop prescribed ACEIs /ARBs due to fear of severe COVID-19. It also calls upon investigators and ethics committee to reconsider the ongoing randomized trials of discontinuation of these drugs.","Abdulhak, Aref A.

655810,The impact of viral transport media on PCR assay results for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-05,"More recently emerging strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cause severe diarrhea and especially high mortality rates in infected piglets, leading to substantial economic loss to worldwide swine industry. These outbreaks urgently call for updated and effective PEDV vaccines. Better understanding in PEDV biology and improvement in technological platforms for virus production can immensely assist and accelerate PEDV vaccine development. In this study, we explored the ability of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein in improving viral yields in cell culture systems. We demonstrated that PEDV N expression positively affected both recovery of PEDV from infectious clones and PEDV propagation in cell culture. Compared to Vero E6 cells, Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV N could accelerate growth of a slow-growing PEDV strain to higher peak titers by 12 hours or enhance the yield of a vaccine candidate strain by two orders of magnitude. Interestingly, PEDV N also slightly enhances replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus, a PEDV relative in the Nidovirales order. These results solidify the importance of N in PEDV recovery and propagation and suggest a potentially useful consideration in designing vaccine production platforms for PEDV or closely related pathogens.","Liwnaree, Benjamas; Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Sungsuwan, Suttipun; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840701/,337
655877,Inhibiting the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 through perturbations in human lung cell metabolic network,2020-11-24,"To evaluate the perioperative morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 who undergo urgent and emergent surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although COVID-19 infection is usually associated with mild disease, it can lead to severe respiratory complications. Little is known about the perioperative outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We examined patients who underwent urgent and emergent surgery at 2 hospitals in New York City from March 17 to April 15, 2020. Elective surgical procedures were cancelled throughout and routine, laboratory based COVID-19 screening was instituted on April 1. Mortality, complications, and admission to the intensive care unit were compared between patients with COVID-19 detected perioperatively and controls. RESULTS: Among 468 subjects, 36 (7.7%) had confirmed COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 55.6% were detected preoperatively and 44.4% postoperatively. Before the routine preoperative COVID-19 laboratory screening, 7.7% of cases were diagnosed preoperatively compared to 65.2% after institution of screening (P = 0.0008). The perioperative mortality rate was 16.7% in those with COVID-19 compared to 1.4% in COVID-19 negative subjects [aRR = 9.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.68–15.21]. Serious complications were identified in 58.3% of COVID-19 subjects versus 6.0% of controls (aRR = 7.02; 95%CI, 4.96–9.92). Cardiac arrest, sepsis/shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury were more common in those with COVID-19. The intensive care unit admission rate was 36.1% in those with COVID-19 compared to 16.4% of controls (aRR = 1.34; 95%CI, 0.86–2.09). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk for serious perioperative morbidity and mortality. A substantial number of patients with COVID-19 are not identified until after surgery.","Knisely, Anne; Zhou, Zhen Ni; Wu, Jenny; Huang, Yongmei; Holcomb, Kevin; Melamed, Alexander; Advincula, Arnold P.; Lalwani, Anil; Khoury-Collado, Fady; Tergas, Ana I.; St. Clair, Caryn M.; Hou, June Y.; Hershman, Dawn L.; D’Alton, Mary E.; Huang, Yolanda Ya-Chin; Wright, Jason D.",Ann Surg,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074900/,337

The first confirmed case in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)was reported on 29(th) January 2020. Current data suggests that children with COVID-19 have a mild disease course. There is a lack of extensive published data about COVID-19 infection among children in the Arabian Gulf region. METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included children with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted between March 1(st) and June 15(th), 2020 to three large hospitals in Dubai, UAE. Serial nasal swabs for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing were collected during hospitalization. We investigated patients’ demographics,clinical characteristics, radiological and laboratory investigations during their inpatient hospital course. RESULTS: 111 children were included in our study and represented 22 nationalities. Fifty-nine (53.2%) were boys. The mean age was 7 years (±5.3), and 15.3% of children were younger than 1 year. Only 4 (3.6%) children had pre-existing asthma, all of whom had an uneventful clinical course. At presentation 43 (38.7%) were asymptomatic, 68 (61.2%) had mild or moderate symptoms and none had severe illness requiring intensive care. Fever (20.7%), cough (19.8%) and rhinorrhea (15.3%) were the most common presenting symptoms, most of which resolved by day 5 of hospitalization. Most of our patients had a normal chest x-ray. The most common laboratory abnormalities on admission included variations in neutrophil count (24.7%), aspartate transaminase (22.5%), alkaline phosphatase (36.7%) and lactate dehydrogenase (42.5%). Children were infrequently prescribed targeted medications, with only 4 (3.6%) receiving antibiotics. None of the 52 patients tested for viral co-infections were positive. COVID-19 PCR turned negative at a median of 10 days [6–14 days] after the first positive test. Overall, there was no significant difference in time to negative PCR between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSION: This pediatric study of COVID-19 presents a first look into the burden of COVID-19 infection among children in the UAE. Patients had various laboratory abnormalities despite clinical stability. We conclude that a large percentage of children with COVID-19 infection experience no symptoms, and severe disease is uncommon in the UAE. Ongoing surveillance, contact tracing and public health measures will be essential in containing future outbreaks.","Ennab, Farah; ElSaban, Mariam; Khalaf, Eman; Tabatabaei, Hanieh; Amar, H K; Devi, Bindu Radha; Hanif, Kashif; Elhassan, Hiba; Saravanan, Ketharanathan; Cremonesini, David; Popatia, Rizwana; Malik, Zainab A; Ho, Samuel B; Abusamra, Rania",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piab031.039,337
657172,Humoral responses in naive or SARS-CoV-2 experienced individuals vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: A large number of studies have explored the association between frailty and mortality among COVID-19 patients, with inconsistent results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on this issue. METHODS: Three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to 20th January 2021 were searched for relevant literature. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess quality bias, and STATA was employed to pool the effect size by a random effects model. Additionally, potential publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, with a total of 23,944 COVID-19 patients, for quantitative analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of frailty was 51% (95% CI: 44–59%). Patients with frailty who were infected with COVID-19 had an increased risk of mortality compared to those without frailty, and the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) were 1.99 (95% CI: 1.66–2.38) and 2.48 (95% CI: 1.78–3.46), respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis based on population showed that the pooled ORs for hospitalized patients in eight studies and nursing home residents in two studies were 2.62 (95% CI: 1.68–4.07) and 2.09 (95% CI: 1.40–3.11), respectively. Subgroup analysis using the frailty assessment tool indicated that this association still existed when using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) (assessed in 6 studies, pooled OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.52–5.45; assessed in 5 studies, pooled HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.66–2.38) and other frailty tools (assessed in 4 studies, pooled OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.81–2.16). In addition, these significant positive associations still existed in the subgroup analysis based on study design and geographic region. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that frailty is an independent predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Thus, frailty could be a prognostic factor for clinicians to stratify high-risk groups and remind doctors and nurses to perform early screening and corresponding interventions urgently needed to reduce mortality rates in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

657889,Unique Fibrinogen-binding motifs in the Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein of SARS CoV-2: Potential Implications in Host-Pathogen Interactions,2020-06-24,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency, and therefore the prevention and treatment of this disease is an important priority of world health. In the present study, some risk factors, including unhealthy nutrition, obesity, and physical inactivity, were assessed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and their effects on the severity and duration of disease were evaluated. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional study. Data was collected from all patients who visited the respiratory emergency department from March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020 in the University Hospital. The outcome measures were body mass index, diet quality that was evaluated with a 16-item food intake questionnaire, and physical activity level that was assessed by the global physical activity questionnaire. RESULTS: Two hundred and six patients’ data was analyzed. The results investigated that patients with lower levels of physical activity or lower MET.min/week were affected by a more severe form of the disease (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). We found that patients with a healthier dietary pattern were affected by lower severity of illness (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It seems that increasing levels of physical activity may partly reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. Some dietary patterns such as increasing fruit and poultry consumption as well as drinking less tea were correlated significantly with a less severe form of the disease. The results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potentially harmful effect of smoking on the severity or duration of symptoms.","Tavakol, Zahra; Ghannadi, Shima; Tabesh, Mastaneh Rajabian; Halabchi, Farzin; Noormohammadpour, Pardis; Akbarpour, Samaneh; Alizadeh, Zahra; Nezhad, Malihe Hassan; Reyhan, Sahar Karimpour",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01468-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558839/,337

Among hospitalized children in Caen, hMPV is detected in 9.7% of the cases after RSV (37%), rhinovirus (18%), influenza virus (14.5%), adenovirus (9%), and parainfluenza virus (5%). Most of hMPV infections are observed in children suffering from bronchiolitis, but the localization to lower respiratory tract and the severity of the disease are less frequent in comparison with RSV infections. hMPV is very difficult to isolate using cell culture.

Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity but not quality of the T cell response, while in convalescents the second dose helped neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.","Neidleman, Jason; Luo, Xiaoyu; McGregor, Matthew; Xie, Guorui; Murray, Victoria; Greene, Warner C.; Lee, Sulggi A.; Roan, Nadia R.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013277/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443888,337

Multidisciplinary strategies across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly progressing field of psychedelic science shows that psilocybin therapy offers a promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder. The COMPASS Pathways (COMPASS) phase 2b double-blind trial of psilocybin therapy in antidepressant-free, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is underway to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin therapy to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of psilocybin therapy in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. An additional COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will begin to address this question, with potential implications for the future delivery of psilocybin therapy.

METHODS: Cross‐sectional survey of pregnant women in two obstetric hospitals in Hanoi and Ca Mau provinces, Vietnam. Data on acceptance and WTP for COVID‐19, demographic characteristics, maternal characteristics, and risk perceptions toward COVID‐19 were collected. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were performed to identify factors associated with the acceptance and WTP for the vaccine. RESULTS: Of 651 pregnant women, 60.4% accepted to receive the vaccine, and 82.6% of the total pregnant women were willing to pay for a COVID‐19 vaccine with the mean amount of WTP of USD 15.2 (SD ± 27.4). The most common reason for refusing vaccination was “Worry about the safety of the vaccine” (66.9%) in Hanoi and “The preventive effect of COVID‐19 is low” (45.2%) in Ca Mau. A higher income, having children, self‐perceived risk of COVID‐19 infection, and perceived risk to friends were associated with a higher likelihood of acceptance and WTP for the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing COVID‐19 vaccination and resource mobilisation among pregnant women in Vietnam is feasible, although communication programmes to improve risk perception and awareness about vaccine should be developed for facilitating acceptance of the vaccine.","Nguyen, Long Hoang; Hoang, Men Thi; Nguyen, Lam Duc; Ninh, Ly Thi; Nguyen, Ha Thi Thu; Nguyen, Anh Duy; Vu, Linh Gia; Vu, Giang Thu; Doan, Linh Phuong; Latkin, Carl A.; Tran, Bach Xuan; Ho, Cyrus S.H.; Ho, Roger C.M.",Trop Med Int Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370375/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13666,337

We evaluated the extent to which associations are moderated by three personal characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and two pandemic-specific risk factors (job loss, COVID-19 diagnosis). METHODS Data are from a random 25 percent subsample of Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants who completed a COVID-19 module introduced in June 2020. We estimated logistic regression models to predict each of five self-reported hardships during the pandemic. RESULTS Bivariate analyses showed that persons with three or more functional limitations were more likely to report both types of food insecurity, and difficulty paying regular and medical bills since the start of the pandemic, relative to those with no limitations. After controlling for health conditions, effects were no longer significant for paying medical bills, and attenuated yet remained statistically significant for other outcomes. Patterns did not differ significantly on the basis of the moderator variables. Job loss substantially increased the risk of economic insecurity but not food insecurity. DISCUSSION Older adults with more functional limitations were vulnerable to economic and food insecurity during the pandemic, potentially exacerbating the physical and emotional health threats imposed by COVID-19. Supports for older adults with disability should focus on logistical as well as financial support for ensuring their food security.","Choi, Shinae L; Carr, Deborah; Namkung, Eun Ha","The journals of gerontology.

Main protease, Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 draws significant attention as a drug target. Herein, we have screened FDA approved organosulfur drugs (till 2016) and our laboratory synthesized organosulfur and organoselenium compounds (L1-L306) against Mpro-apo using docking followed by classical MD simulations. Additionally, a series of compounds (L307-L364) were chosen from previous experimental studies, which were reported to exhibit inhibitory potentials towards Mpro. We found several organosulfur drugs, particularly Venetoclax (FDA approved organosulfur drug for Leukemia) to be a high-affinity binders to the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The results reveal that organosulfur compounds including Venetoclax preferentially bind (non-covalently) to the non-catalytic pocket of the protein located in the dimer interface. We found that the ligand binding is primarily favoured by ligand-protein van der Waals interaction and penalized by desolvation effect. Interestingly, Venetoclax binding alters the local flexibility of Mpro and exerts pronounced effect in the C-terminal as well as two loop regions (Loop-A and Loop-B) that play important roles in catalysis.

Aim: To conduct in vivo assessments of the [Formula: see text] in the radial artery of healthy volunteers and simultaneously probe the relation between the [Formula: see text] and hemodynamic behavior such as red blood cell (RBC) aggregation. Approach: The effects of PA-based measurements of blood hemodynamics were studied as a function of the subjects’ age (20s, 30s, and 40s). The pulsatile blood flow in the human radial artery of 12 healthy subjects was imaged in the 700 to 900 nm optical wavelength range using a linear array-based PA system. Results: The PA power when blood velocity is minimum ([Formula: see text]) was larger than the one attained at maximum blood velocity ([Formula: see text]), consistent with predictions based on the cyclical variation of RBC aggregation during pulsatile flow. The difference between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at 800 nm ([Formula: see text]) increased with age (1.7, 2.2, and 2.6 dB for age group of 20s, 30s, and 40s, respectively). The [Formula: see text] computed from [Formula: see text] was larger than the one from [Formula: see text]. Conclusions: The [Formula: see text] increased with participant age. The [Formula: see text] metric could be a surrogate of noninvasively monitoring the age-induced changes in RBC aggregation. The [Formula: see text] change during a cycle of pulsatile blood flow also increased with age, demonstrating that RBC aggregation can affect the [Formula: see text] change.","Bok, Taehoon; Hysi, Eno; Kolios, Michael C.",J Biomed Opt,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754541/; https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jbo.26.3.036006,337
661243,Evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 Inactivation Efficacy Associated With Buffers From Three Kits Used on High-Throughput RNA Extraction Platforms,2021-09-16,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially characterized due to its impacts on the respiratory system; however, many recent studies have indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) significantly affects the brain. COVID-19 can cause neurological complications, probably caused by the induction of a cytokine storm, since there is no evidence of neurotropism by SARS-CoV-2. In line with this, the COVID-19 outbreak could accelerate the progression or affect the clinical outcomes of neuropsychiatric conditions. Thus, we analyzed differential gene expression datasets for clinical samples of COVID-19 patients and identified 171 genes that are associated with the pathophysiology of the following neuropsychiatric disorders: alcohol dependence, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, panic disorder, schizophrenia, and sleep disorder. Several of the genes identified are associated with causing some of these conditions (classified as elite genes). Among these elite genes, 9 were found for schizophrenia, 6 for autism, 3 for depression/major depressive disorder, and 2 for alcohol dependence. The patients with the neuropsychiatric conditions associated with the genes identified may require special attention as COVID-19 can deteriorate or accelerate neurochemical dysfunctions, thereby aggravating clinical outcomes.","Quincozes-Santos, André; Rosa, Rafael Lopes; Tureta, Emanuela Fernanda; Bobermin, Larissa Daniele; Berger, Markus; Guimarães, Jorge Almeida; Santi, Lucélia; Beys-da-Silva, Walter Orlando",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354620301617; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100196; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354620301617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521688/,337

Viral cell entry requires spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor and spike cleavage by TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease. Targeting of TMPRSS2 by either androgen blockade or direct inhibition is already in clinical trials in early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The likely initial cells of SARS-CoV-2 entry are the ciliated cells of the upper airway. We therefore used differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells maintained at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to test the impact of targeting TMPRSS2 on the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results We first modelled the systemic delivery of compounds. Enzalutamide, an oral androgen receptor antagonist, had no impact on SARS-Cov-2 infection. By contrast, camostat mesylate, an orally available serine protease inhibitor, blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry. However, camostat is rapidly metabolised in the circulation in vivo, and systemic bioavailability after oral dosing is low. We therefore modelled local airway administration by applying camostat to the apical surface of the differentiated ALI cultures. We demonstrated that a brief exposure to topical camostat is effective at restricting SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Conclusion These experiments demonstrate a potential therapeutic role for topical camostat for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2, which can now be evaluated in a clinical trial.","Guo, Wenrui; Porter, Linsey M; Crozier, Thomas WM; Coates, Matthew; Jha, Akhilesh; McKie, Mikel; Nathan, James A; Lehner, Paul J; Greenwood, Edward JD; McCaughan, Frank",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.23.440619,337

This paper investigates the impact of COVID 19 on the progress of the SDGs and provides insight into how green recovery stimulus, driven by circular economy (CE)-based solid waste management (SWM) could assist in attaining the intended targets of UN-SDG. It was understood in this review that the guiding principles of the UN-SDGs such as, public health, environmental concerns, resource value and economic development are similar to those that have driven the growth of waste management activities; thus, in order to achieve the goals of UN-SDG, a circular economy approach in solid waste management system should be prioritized in the post-COVID economic agenda. However, policy, technology and public involvement issues may hinder the shift to the CE model; therefore, niche growth might come from developing distinctive waste management-driven green jobs, formalizing informal waste pickers and by focusing in education and training of informal worker. The review also emphasized in creating green jobs by investing in recycling infrastructure which would enable us to address the climate change related concerns which is one of the key target of UN- SDG. The CE-based product designs and business models would emphasize multifunctional goods, extending the lifespan of products and their parts, and intelligent manufacturing to help the public and private sectors maximise product utility (thus reducing waste generation) while providing long-term economic and environmental benefits. The study also recommended strong policies that prioritized investments in decentralization of solid waste systems, localization of supply chains, recycling and green recovery, information sharing, and international collaboration in order to achieve the UN-SDGs.","Sharma, Hari Bhakta; Vanapalli, Kumar Raja; Samal, Biswajit; Cheela, V R Sankar; Dubey, Brajesh K; Bhattacharya, Jayanta",The Science of the total environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426367/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149605,337

One of these interventions was a surveillance system which included an Ebola alert management system. This study analyzed the performance of this system. A descriptive cross-sectional study of the Ebola virus disease alerts which were reported in South Sudan from August 2018 to November 2019 was conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods. As of 30 November 2019, a total of 107 alerts had been detected in the country out of which 51 (47.7%) met the case definition and were investigated with blood samples collected for laboratory confirmation. Most (81%) of the investigated alerts were South Sudanese nationals. The alerts were identified by health workers (53.1%) at health facilities, at the community (20.4%) and by screeners at the points of entry (12.2%). Most of the investigated alerts were detected from the high-risk states of Gbudwe (46.9%), Jubek (16.3%) and Torit (10.2%). The investigated alerts commonly presented with fever, bleeding, headache and vomiting. The median timeliness for deployment of Rapid Response Team was less than one day and significantly different between the 6-month time periods (K-W = 7.7567; df = 2; p = 0.0024) from 2018 to 2019. Strengths of the alert management system included existence of a dedicated national alert hotline, case definition for alerts and rapid response teams while the weaknesses were occasional inability to access the alert toll-free hotline and lack of transport for deployment of the rapid response teams which often constrain quick response. This study demonstrates that the Ebola virus disease alert management system in South Sudan was fully functional despite the associated challenges and provides evidence to further improve Ebola preparedness in the country.","Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Lako, Richard; Bunga, Sudhir; Berta, Kibebu; Kol, Matthew; Ramadan, Patrick Otim; Ryan, Caroline; Udenweze, Ifeanyi; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Conteh, Ishata; Huda, Qudsia; Gai, Malick; Saulo, Dina; Papowitz, Heather; Gray, Henry John; Chimbaru, Alex; Wangdi, Kencho; Grube, Steven M.; Barr, Beth Tippett; Wamala, Joseph Francis",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253169/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008872,337

Many sporting events have been either postponed or canceled, and national sporting organizations have had to make highly complex decisions in the face of scientific uncertainty and risk. This article applies these lessons to the world of sport with the goal of assisting sporting organizations to make sound and reasoned decisions during a pandemic. DATA SOURCES A narrative approach using both academic literature sources and live examples from the authors' experience. We use Daniels and Sabin's accountability for reasonableness framework to facilitate decision-making in the face of such uncertainty. MAIN RESULTS Decision-making in the context of uncertainty has the potential to create conflict and disengagement from key stakeholders. Evidence from recent pandemics has illustrated that an ethical approach to decision-making results in reasoned decision-making and confers a legitimacy to decisions that ultimately supports engagement and satisfaction from stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS The incorporation of ethical considerations into risk assessment and management when making complex decisions, which incorporate high levels of uncertainty, will assist sporting organizations have positive outcomes.","Hamilton, Bruce; Burt, Peter; Anderson, Lynley",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jsm.0000000000000968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446649/,337

Methods Salivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR. The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected. Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered. Results Twenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females. The mean age was 61.5 +/− 11.2 years. Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases. All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse association between LDH and Ct values. Two patients showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or respiratory swabs showed conversion. Conclusions Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2. The role of saliva in COVID-19 diagnosis could not be limited to a qualitative detection of the virus, but it may also provide information about the clinical evolution of the disease.","Azzi, Lorenzo; Carcano, Giulio; Gianfagna, Francesco; Grossi, Paolo; Gasperina, Daniela Dalla; Genoni, Angelo; Fasano, Mauro; Sessa, Fausto; Tettamanti, Lucia; Carinci, Francesco; Maurino, Vittorio; Rossi, Agostino; Tagliabue, Angelo; Baj, Andreina",J Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298676/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302139,337

Neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were present in 89% of previously infected HCW. T cell responses tended to be lower following asymptomatic infection than in those reporting case-definition symptoms of COVID-19, while nAb titers were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and antibody responses were sometimes discordant. Eleven percent lacked nAb and had undetectable T cell responses to spike protein but had T cells reactive with other SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

METHODS: The number of diagnosed OME in e five referral centers, between 1 March 2018 and 1 March 2021, has been reviewed and collected. To estimate the reduction of OME incidence in children and adults during the COVID-19 pandemic period the OME incidence in three period of time were evaluated and compared: group 1—patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2018 and 01/03/2019 (not pandemic period). Group 2—patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2019 and 1/03/2020 (not pandemic period). Group 3—patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2020 and 1/03/2021 (COVID-19 pandemic period). RESULTS: In the non-pandemic periods (group 1 and 2), the incidence of OME in the five referral centers considered was similar, with 482 and 555 diagnosed cases, respectively. In contrast, the OME incidence in the same centers, during the pandemic period (group 3) was clearly reduced with a lower total number of 177 cases of OME estimated. Percentage variation in OME incidence between the first non-pandemic year considered (group 1) and the pandemic period (group 3) was—63, 3%, with an absolute value decrease value of—305 cases. Similarly, comparing the second non-pandemic year (group 2) and the pandemic year (group 3) the percentage variation of OME incidence was—68, 1% with an absolute value of—305 cases decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a lower incidence of OME during the pandemic period compared with 2 previous non pandemic years. The drastic restrictive anti-contagion measures taken by the Italian government to contain the spread of COVID-19 could have had a positive impact on the lower OME incidence during the last pandemic year.","Iannella, Giannicola; Magliulo, Giuseppe; Lechien, Jerome R.; Maniaci, Antonino; Perrone, Tiziano; Frasconi, Pier Carlo; De Vito, Andrea; Martone, Chiara; Ferlito, Salvatore; Cocuzza, Salvatore; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Meccariello, Giuseppe; Monticone, Valentina; Greco, Antonio; de Vincentiis, Marco; Ralli, Massimo; Savastano, Vincenzo; Bertin, Serena; Pace, Annalisa; Milani, Alessandro; Polimeni, Roberta; Pelucchi, Stefano; Ciorba, Andrea; Vicini, Claudio",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218309/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-021-06958-4,337

Data synthesis and extraction Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, progression to severe disease, median time for clinical recovery and anti-viral clearance. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies with 5207 participants were included in the analysis.

Like most surgical specialties, urology has shifted towards an emergency mentality. Currently, the beginning of the de-escalation phase of the pandemic has been observed, which will certainly pose new challenges to the urological community. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic search was conducted through the Medline and Web of Science databases. The main keywords used in the search were: ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘urology’. The search included articles without time and language limitation. RESULTS: During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic urological services had to focus on maintaining urgent-oncological and emergency-trauma procedures. First adapted recommendations were released at the end of March 2020. Primarily, they included information regarding the prioritization of surgical procedures. Currently, the beginning of the de-escalation phase in many countries has forced the necessity of establishing new degrees of priority for surgical interventions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancellations and rescheduling significantly extend the waiting time for outpatient appointments and surgical procedures. A network of expert high-volume centres, at every level of referentiality, should guarantee the continuity of oncological care, supported with telemedicine systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial decrease in clinical activity of urology residents. There also is huge potential for remote technology to address and improve education and training continuation in this field. CONCLUSIONS: Urological care has been severely impaired by the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists must adapt to the dynamically changing reality, prioritizing the safety and well-being of their patients and their clinic workforce.","Nowak, Łukasz; Krajewski, Wojciech; Kiełb, Paweł; Śliwa, Anna; Zdrojowy-Wełna, Aleksandra; Zdrojowy, Romuald",Cent European J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133652/; https://doi.org/10.5173/ceju.2020.0087,337

668661,Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for the COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on SARS-CoV immunological studies,2020-02-04,"Phylodynamics has become an increasingly popular statistical framework to extract evolutionary and epidemiological information from pathogen genomes. By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole primary data source. Integrating various sources of information, however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed reconstructions of transmission trees.

669047,IMMUNO-COVâ¢ v2.0: Development and Validation of a High-Throughput Clinical Assay for Measuring SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Antibody Titers,2021-02-19,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop a Pandemic Risk Exposure Measurement (PREM) model to determine the factors that affect a country’s prospective vulnerability to a pandemic risk exposure also considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To develop the model, drew up an inventory of possible factor variables that might expose a country’s vulnerability to a pandemic such as COVID-19. This model was based on the analysis of existing literature and consultations with some experts and associations. To support the inventory of selected possible factor variables, we have conducted a survey with participants sampled from people working in a risk management environment carrying out a risk management function. The data were subjected to statistical analysis, specifically exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach Alpha to determine and group these factor variables and determine their reliability, respectively. This enabled the development of the PREM model. To eliminate possible bias, hierarchical regression analysis was carried out to examine the effect of the “Level of Experienced Hazard of the Participant (LEH)” considering also the “Level of Expertise and Knowledge about Risk and Risk Management (LEK)”. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis loaded best on four factors from 19 variables: Demographic Features, Country’s Activity Features, Economic Exposure and Societal Vulnerability (i.e. the PREM Model). This model explains 65.5% of the variance in the level of experienced hazard (LEH). Additionally, we determined that LEK explains only about 2% of the variance in LEH. CONCLUSION: The developed PREM model shows that monitoring of Demographic Features, Country’s Activity Features, Economic Exposure and Societal Vulnerability can help a country to identify the possible impact of pandemic risk exposure and develop policies, strategies, regulations, etc., to help a country strengthen its capacity to meet the economic, social and in turn healthcare demands due to pandemic hazards such as COVID-19.","Grima, Simon; Kizilkaya, Murat; Rupeika-Apoga, Ramona; Romānova, Inna; Dalli Gonzi, Rebecca; Jakovljevic, Mihajlo",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116987/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s270553,337

We have since seen its fast spread worldwide. A likely contributing factor was the lack of symptoms of some of the carriers, making them unaware of their risk of spreading to other more vulnerable individuals. The other important finding has been the reported cases of infectivity despite lack of symptoms. We describe the SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia patterns in asymptomatic individuals. The common computed tomography (CT) thorax patterns found are peripheral ground‐glass opacification (GGO) with upper or lower lobe predominance.

670382,Modulation of Autophagy by SARS-CoV-2: A Potential Threat for Cardiovascular System,2020-11-30,"Isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts has been used as an early COVID-19 containment measure in many countries, with additional physical distancing measures also introduced as outbreaks have grown. To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures - including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing - may be required to reduce transmission. Using a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40,162 UK participants, we simulated the impact of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing and physical distancing scenarios. As well as estimating reduction in effective reproduction number, we estimated, for a given level of COVID-19 incidence, the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated that combined testing and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone (50-65% compared to 2-30%). If limits are placed on gatherings outside of home/school/work (e.g. maximum of 4 daily contacts in other settings), then manual contact tracing of acquaintances only could have a similar effect on transmission reduction as detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where there were 10,000 new symptomatic cases per day, we estimated in most contact tracing strategies, 140,000 to 390,000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimates that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number that is below one in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control.","Kucharski, Adam J; Klepac, Petra; Conlan, Andrew; Kissler, Stephen M; Tang, Maria; Fry, Hannah; Gog, Julia; Edmunds, John",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077024; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077024v1?rss=1,337

Over the past year, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing has moved from highly centralized laboratories to at-home and even over the-counter. This transition has been lionized for its potential public health impact via isolation, but has been less examined for its effect on individual health and therapeutics. Since early initiation of antiviral therapy routinely has been associated with greater treatment efficacy for viral infections, these diagnostic testing innovations offer new opportunities for both clinical testing as well as clinical trials for antiviral therapy.

Self-assessed health was also examined as a potential moderator. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample (N = 463) completed online questionnaires during a COVID-19-related lockdown that measured engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours (e.g., exercising and eating fruits and vegetables), adherence to coronavirus protective behaviours (e.g., wearing a face mask and practicing social distancing), and self-assessed health (subjective evaluation of overall health). RESULTS: As predicted, higher engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours prior to the pandemic was significantly correlated with higher adherence to coronavirus protective behaviours (Pearson r(459) = .308, p < .001). Adherence levels were higher than engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours, and self-assessed health was related to the latter but not to the former. Moderation was examined using model 1 in PROCESS for SPSS; as expected, the association was stronger among individuals with higher levels of self-assessed health (coefficient 95% CI [.04, .20]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight cross-behavioural facilitating processes, specifically between lifestyle behaviours and adherence to recommended protective behaviours during the pandemic.

671847,Challenges and Issues of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines,2021-05-14,"Lockdown restrictions were implemented in Italy from 10 March 2020 to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to evaluate air pollution changes, with focus on nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), before and during the lockdown in Rome and in the surroundings. Significant NO(2) declines were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic with reductions of − 50%, − 34%, and − 20% at urban traffic, urban background, and rural background stations, respectively. Tropospheric NO(2) vertical column density (VCD) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was used to evaluate the spatial-temporal variations of the NO(2) before and during the lockdown for the entire area where the surface stations are located. The evaluation is concerned with the pixels including one or more air quality stations to explore the capability of the unprecedented high spatial resolution to monitor urban and rural sites from space with relation to the surface measurements. Good agreement between surface concentration and TROPOMI VCD was obtained in Rome (R = 0.64 in 2019, R = 0.77 in 2020) and in rural sites (R = 0.71 in 2019). Inversely, a slight correlation (R = 0.20) was observed in rural areas during the lockdown due to very low levels of NO(2). Finally, the TROPOMI VCD showed a sharp decline in NO(2), larger in urban (− 43%) than in rural sites (− 17%) as retrieved with the concurrent surface measurements averaging all the traffic and urban background (− 44%) and all the rural background stations (− 20%). These results suggest air pollution improvement in Rome gained from implementing lockdown restrictions.

671898,Selenium – associated gene signatures within the SARS-CoV-2 – host genomic interaction interface,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case-fatality rates (CFRs) across countries, leading to uncertainty about the true lethality of the disease. A large part of this variation may be due to the ages of individuals who are tested and identified. OBJECTIVE: To measure the contribution of distortions from the age distributions of confirmed cases to CFRs within and across populations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional demographic study using aggregate data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age. SETTING: Population-based data from China, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals with confirmed COVID-19, as reported by each country as of 19 April 2020 (N = 1 223 261). MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific COVID-19 CFRs and age-specific population shares by country. RESULTS: The overall observed CFR varies widely, with the highest rates in Italy (9.3%) and the Netherlands (7.4%) and the lowest rates in South Korea (1.6%) and Germany (0.7%). Adjustment for the age distribution of cases explains 66% of the variation of across countries, with a resulting age-standardized median CFR of 1.9%. Among a larger sample of 95 countries, the observed variation in COVID-19 CFRs is 13 times larger than what would be expected on the basis of just differences in the age-composition of countries. LIMITATION: The age-adjusted rates assume that, conditional on age, COVID-19 mortality among diagnosed cases is the same as that among undiagnosed cases and that individuals of all ages are equally susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. CONCLUSION: Selective testing and identifying of older cases considerably warps estimates of the lethality of COVID-19 within populations and comparisons across countries. Removing age distortions and focusing on differences in age-adjusted case fatality will be essential for accurately comparing countries' performance in caring for patients with COVID-19 and for monitoring the epidemic over time.

In this study, we evaluated whether remdesivir and its main active metabolite GS‐441524 would be adsorbed by CytoSorb(®). Serum containing remdesivir or GS‐441524 was circulated in a custom‐made system containing a CytoSorb(®) device. Concentrations of remdesivir and GS‐441524 before and after the adsorber were analyzed by liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. Measurements of remdesivir in the outgoing tube after the adsorber indicated almost complete removal of remdesivir by the device. In the reservoir, concentration of remdesivir showed an exponential decay and was not longer detectable after 60 mins. GS‐441524 showed a similar exponential decay but, unlike remdesivir, it reached an adsorption–desorption equilibrium at ~48 µg/L. Remdesivir and its main active metabolite GS‐441524 are rapidly eliminated from the perfusate by the CytoSorb(®) adsorber device in vitro. This should be considered in patients for whom both therapies are indicated, and simultaneous application should be avoided.

674775,Comparison of Four SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Assays,2020-12-28,"The complement system represents a crucial part of innate immunity. It contains a diverse range of soluble activators, membrane-bound receptors, and regulators. Its principal function is to eliminate pathogens via activation of three distinct pathways: classical, alternative, and lectin. In the case of viruses, the complement activation results in effector functions such as virion opsonisation by complement components, phagocytosis induction, virolysis by the membrane attack complex, and promotion of immune responses through anaphylatoxins and chemotactic factors. Recent studies have shown that the addition of individual complement components can neutralise viruses without requiring the activation of the complement cascade. While the complement-mediated effector functions can neutralise a diverse range of viruses, numerous viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert complement recognition/activation by encoding several proteins that inhibit the complement system, contributing to viral survival and pathogenesis. This review focuses on these complement-dependent and -independent interactions of complement components (especially C1q, C4b-binding protein, properdin, factor H, Mannose-binding lectin, and Ficolins) with several viruses and their consequences.","Murugaiah, Valarmathy; Varghese, Praveen M.; Beirag, Nazar; DeCordova, Syreeta; Sim, Robert B.; Kishore, Uday",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063241/,337

Sixty-eight samples were positive for more than one assay and one genetic locus and were defined as true positive samples. All the assays showed a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 95.8 to 100). The N2 assay kit of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the N2 assay of the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) were the most sensitive assays with 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 94.7 to 100), followed by the CDC N1 kit, E assay by Corman, and NIID N2 assay multiplex with internal control reactions. These assays are reliable as first-line molecular assays in laboratories when combined with appropriate internal control reactions.","Matsumura, Yasufumi; Shimizu, Tsunehiro; Noguchi, Taro; Nakano, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Masaki; Nagao, Miki",J Mol Diagn,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S152515782030581X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259955/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.11.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152515782030581X?v=s5,337
677437,"SUMO pathway, blood coagulation and oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 infection",2021-02-03,"Objective: There has been much discussion and debate around the underreporting of COVID-19 infections and deaths in India. In this short report we first estimate the underreporting factor for infections from publicly available data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research on reported number of cases and national seroprevalence surveys. We then use a compartmental epidemiologic model to estimate the undetected number of infections and deaths, yielding estimates of the corresponding underreporting factors. We compare the serosurvey based ad hoc estimate of the infection fatality rate (IFR) with the model-based estimate. Since the first and second waves in India are intrinsically different in nature, we carry out this exercise in two periods: the first wave (April 1, 2020 - January 31, 2021) and part of the second wave (February 1, 2021 - May 15, 2021). The latest national seroprevalence estimate is from January 2021, and thus only relevant to our wave 1 calculations. Results: Both wave 1 and wave 2 estimates qualitatively show that there is a large degree of 'covert infections' in India, with model-based estimated underreporting factor for infections as 11.11 (95% credible interval (CrI) 10.71 - 11.47) and for deaths as 3.56 (95% CrI 3.48 - 3.64) for wave 1. For wave 2, underreporting factor for infections escalate to 26.77 (95% CrI 24.26 - 28.81) and to 5.77 (95% CrI 5.34 - 6.15) for deaths. If we rely on only reported deaths, the IFR estimate is 0.13% for wave 1 and 0.03% for part of wave 2. Taking underreporting of deaths into account, the IFR estimate is 0.46% for wave 1 and 0.18% for wave 2 (till May 15). Combining waves 1 and 2, as of May 15, while India reported a total of nearly 25 million cases and 270 thousand deaths, the estimated number of infections and deaths stand at 491 million (36% of the population) and 1.21 million respectively, yielding an estimated (combined) infection fatality rate of 0.25% . There is considerable variation in these estimates across Indian states. Up to date seroprevalence studies and mortality data are needed to validate these model-based estimates.","Purkayastha, S.; Kundu, R.; Bhaduri, R.; Barker, D.; Kleinsasser, M.; Ray, D.; Mukherjee, B.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.21257823; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.25.21257823v1?rss=1,337

When mice were administered β-endorphin and then 24 h later infected intracerebrally with tsG31-Ks5 VSV, 70% of the animals died within 8 days of infection. In comparison, less than 10% of the animals had died after 21 days when infected with tsG31-KS5 VSV alone. When mice were injected with β-endorphin and tsG31-KS5 VSV simultaneously, or with β-endorphin 21 days after infection, the more aggressive clinical disease was not observed. Superficially, the more lethal disease induced by β-endorphin appeared to be a result of a mild hypothermia caused by the neuropeptide. β-Endorphin, however, did not influence the disease in nude (nu/nu) mice even though their core temperatures were reduced to an extent similar to that of BALB/c (+/+) mice, implicating the involvement of T lymphocytes in the alteration of the course of infection in normal mice.","Doll, Sharon C.; Johnson, Terry C.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165572889900970; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165572889900970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2553770/,337

Two different sequential assembly approaches in comparison with a direct single-step protocol were applied, and molecular organization in correlation with biological activity of the resulting nanoparticle systems was investigated. Differences in the structure of the nanoparticles were revealed by thorough physicochemical characterization including small angle neutron scattering (SANS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). All hybrid systems, combining lipid and polymer, displayed significantly increased transfection in comparison to lipid/mRNA and polymer/mRNA particles alone. For the hybrid nanoparticles, characteristic differences regarding the internal organization, release characteristics, and activity were determined depending on the assembly route. The systems with the highest transfection efficacy were characterized by a heterogenous internal organization, accompanied by facilitated release. Such a system could be best obtained by the single step protocol, starting with a lipid and polymer mixture for nanoparticle formation.","Siewert, Christian D.; Haas, Heinrich; Cornet, Vera; Nogueira, Sara S.; Nawroth, Thomas; Uebbing, Lukas; Ziller, Antje; Al-Gousous, Jozef; Radulescu, Aurel; Schroer, Martin A.; Blanchet, Clement E.; Svergun, Dmitri I.; Radsak, Markus P.; Sahin, Ugur; Langguth, Peter",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9092034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899484/,337

METHODS: A 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6-month follow-up was conducted among healthy but high-risk office workers. Participants were recruited from six organizations in Bangkok, Thailand (N=193) and randomly assigned at cluster level into active break intervention (N=47), postural shift intervention (N=46), and control (N=100) groups. Participants in the intervention groups received a custom-designed apparatus to facilitate designated active breaks and postural shifts during work. Participants in the control group received a placebo seat pad. The primary outcome measure was new onset of neck and low-back pain during 6-month follow-up. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighty-six (96%) predominantly female participants were successfully followed up over six months. New onset of neck pain during the 6-month follow-up occurred in 17%, 17%, and 44% of the participants in the active break, postural shift, and control groups, respectively. For new onset of low-back pain, these percentages were 9%, 7%, and 33%, respectively. Hazard rate (HR) ratios after adjusting for biopsychosocial factors indicated a protective effect of the active break and postural shift interventions for neck pain [HR(adj) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20–0.98 for active break and HR(adj) 0.41, 95% CI 0.18–0.94 for postural shift] and low-back pain (HR(adj) 0.34, 95% CI 0.12–0.98 for active break and HR(adj) 0.19, 95% CI 0.06–0.66 for postural shift).

Symptoms such as a cough, dyspnea, and fever are common to a large number of inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential to limit the use of hospital services and inappropriate diagnostic techniques. A particular radiological pattern can orient the clinical and laboratory scenario and guide the diagnostic workup. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our COVID-19 unit for suspected coronavirus infection. She was complaining of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, and low grade fever. A chest X-ray showed diffuse, alveolar, and interstitial lung involvement with micronodules tending to coalescence. This radiographic pattern known as “galaxy sign”, consistent with diffuse, coalescing nodular miliary pulmonary involvement, simulating a non-specific alveolar opacification of the lungs is typical of a few pneumological differential diagnoses, represented by sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and metastatic lesions, and virtually excludes an interstitial viral pneumonitis.

682055,A Simplified Quantitative Real-Time PCR Assay for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Growth in Cell Culture,2020-09-02,"Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are associated with a significant mortality rate, and existing drugs show poor efficacy. Identifying novel targets/pathways required for MERS infectivity is therefore important for developing novel therapeutics. As an enveloped virus, translocation through the endolysosomal system provides one pathway for cellular entry of MERS-CoV. In this context, Ca2+-permeable channels within the endolysosomal system regulate both the luminal environment and trafficking events, meriting investigation of their role in regulating processing and trafficking of MERS-CoV. Knockdown of endogenous two-pore channels (TPCs), targets for the Ca2+ mobilizing second messenger NAADP, impaired infectivity in a MERS-CoV spike pseudovirus particle translocation assay. This effect was selective as knockdown of the lysosomal cation channel mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) was without effect. Pharmacological inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release using several bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids also blocked MERS pseudovirus translocation. Knockdown of TPC1 (biased endosomally) or TPC2 (biased lysosomally) decreased the activity of furin, a protease which facilitates MERS fusion with cellular membranes. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TPC1 activity also inhibited endosomal motility impairing pseudovirus progression through the endolysosomal system. Overall, these data support a selective, spatially autonomous role for TPCs within acidic organelles to support MERS-CoV translocation.","Gunaratne, Gihan S.; Yang, Yang; Li, Fang; Walseth, Timothy F.; Marchant, Jonathan S.",Cell Calcium,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143416018301210; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2018.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143416018301210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121440/,337

The dynamics of epidemic spread in large-scale populations are very complex. Further, human behavior, social contact networks, and pandemics are closely intertwined and evolve as the epidemic spread. Individuals’ changing behaviors in response to public policies and their evolving perception of how an infectious disease outbreak is unfolding can dramatically alter normal social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. Mathematical models are key to understanding the spread of epidemics. In this chapter, we discuss a recent approach of diffusion in network models for studying the complex dynamics of epidemics in large-scale populations. Analyzing these models leads to very challenging computational problems. Further, using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads to issues that are characteristic of big data applications. The chapter describes the state of the art in computational and big data epidemiology.","Pyne, Saumyadipta; Vullikanti, Anile Kumar S.; Marathe, Madhav V.",Handbook of Statistics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444634924000083; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444634924000083,337

Furthermore, we analysed the self-reported vaccination coverage of our participants regarding 19 vaccines. Of the respondents, 89.5% claimed to provide advice about vaccination to their friends and family. In conclusion, European MS and JD have a very positive attitude towards vaccination. However, their behaviour and knowledge demonstrate certain gaps which should be further addressed in medical education.","Rostkowska, Olga M.; Peters, Alexandra; Montvidas, Jonas; Magdas, Tudor M.; Rensen, Leon; Zgliczyński, Wojciech S.; Durlik, Magdalena; Pelzer, Benedikt W.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808446/,337

This question has not been investigated enough, especially regarding infectious diseases. This study investigates the correlations between public health expenditure and the incidence of tuberculosis in China using a provincial panel dataset. The analysis focuses on the correlations between public health expenditure and tuberculosis incidence, using the fixed effects models and Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) method. Overall, a 10% increase of public health expenditure per capita is associated with a 0.0019% decrease of tuberculosis incidence. A series of robustness tests show that the correlation between public health expenditure and TB incidence is valid. Future research should focus more on the performance of public health, particularly infectious diseases like tuberculosis, and provide references for health policymakers.","Liu, Jie; Han, Ziqiang; Veuthey, Justin; Ma, Ben",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978844/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3034,337
685864,Single-dose intranasal administration of AdCOVID elicits systemic and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in mice,2020-10-11,"Summary Influenza virus M2 and PB1-F2 proteins have been proposed to activate the Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages by altering intracellular ionic balance or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the precise mechanism by which these viral proteins trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. Here we show that influenza virus stimulates oxidized DNA release from macrophages. Ion channel activity of the M2 protein or mitochondrial localization of the PB1-F2 protein was required for oxidized DNA release. While the oxidized DNA enhanced influenza virus-induced IL-1β secretion, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production by antioxidant Mito-TEMPO decreased the virus-induced IL-1β secretion. In addition, we show that influenza virus stimulates IL-1β secretion from macrophages in an AIM2-dependent manner. These results provide a missing link between influenza viral proteins and the NLRP3 inflammaseome activation, and reveal the importance of influenza virus-induced oxidized DNA in inflammasomes activation.","Moriyama, Miyu; Nagai, Minami; Maruzuru, Yuhei; Koshiba, Takumi; Kawaguchi, Yasushi; Ichinohe, Takeshi",iScience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101270; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004220304569; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220304569?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32592999/,337
685962,Characterization of Persistent SARS-CoV Infection in Vero E6 Cells,2006,"The development of biometric applications, such as facial recognition (FR), has recently become important in smart cities. Many scientists and engineers around the world have focused on establishing increasingly robust and accurate algorithms and methods for these types of systems and their applications in everyday life. FR is developing technology with multiple real-time applications. The goal of this paper is to develop a complete FR system using transfer learning in fog computing and cloud computing. The developed system uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) because of the dominant representation; there are some conditions including occlusions, expressions, illuminations, and pose, which can affect the deep FR performance. DCNN is used to extract relevant facial features. These features allow us to compare faces between them in an efficient way. The system can be trained to recognize a set of people and to learn via an online method, by integrating the new people it processes and improving its predictions on the ones it already has. The proposed recognition method was tested with different three standard machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). The proposed system has been evaluated using three datasets of face images (SDUMLA-HMT, 113, and CASIA) via performance metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and time. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superiority over other algorithms according to all parameters. The suggested algorithm results in higher accuracy (99.06%), higher precision (99.12%), higher recall (99.07%), and higher specificity (99.10%) than the comparison algorithms.","Salama AbdELminaam, Diaa; Almansori, Abdulrhman M.; Taha, Mohamed; Badr, Elsayed",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270670/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242269,337

This study uses data from three waves (Wave 1: 2017/18, Wave 2: 2018/19, and Wave 3: 2019/20) of the COMPASS study. Students in grades 9 and 10 who reported substance use at baseline (n = 738) report their substance use (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, and e-cigarettes) and anxiety and depression symptoms at each wave. A Repeated Measures Latent Class Analysis (RMLCA) is used to determine substance use classes, and mixed models are used to examine the associations between substance use classes and anxiety and depression. We identify three classes of substance use: (1) occasional alcohol and e-cigarette use, (2) escalating poly-substance use, and (3) consistent poly-substance use. After controlling for relevant covariates, consistent poly-substance use is associated with depression (Female OR: 1.24 [95%CI: 0.46, 2.02]; Male OR 1.13 [95%CI: 0.38, 1.87]) but not anxiety. Escalating poly-substance use is associated with depression among males (OR 0.72 [95%CI: 0.10, 1.33]).

A total of 281 older patients with severe COVID-19 were categorized into two age groups (60–79 years and ≥ 80 years). Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data, and outcome were obtained. Patients aged ≥ 80 years had higher mortality (63.6%) than those aged 60–79 years (33.5%). Anorexia and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and COPD, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), osmotic pressure, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, high-sensitivity troponin I and procalcitonin, and higher SOFA scores were more common in patients aged > 80 years than those aged 60–79 years and also more common and higher in non-survivors than survivors. LDH, osmotic pressure, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, high-sensitivity troponin I, and procalcitonin were positively correlated with age and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), whereas CD8+ and lymphocyte counts were negatively correlated with age and SOFA. Anorexia, comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LDH, osmotic pressure, and SOFA were significantly associated with 28-day all-cause mortality. LDH, osmotic pressure and SOFA were valuable for predicting 28-day all-cause mortality, whereas the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of LDH was the largest, with sensitivity of 86.0% and specificity of 80.8%. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 aged ≥ 80 years had worse condition and higher mortality than did those aged 60–79 years, and anorexia and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, COPD, elevated plasma osmotic pressure, LDH, and high SOFA were independent risk factors associated with 28-day all-cause mortality in older patients with severe COVID-19. LDH may have the highest predictive value for 28-day all-cause mortality in all examined factors.","Jiang, Yi; Abudurexiti, Subi; An, Meng-Meng; Cao, Da; Wei, Jie; Gong, Ping",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79508-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353956/,337

Also, transplant patients being immunocompromised, there is higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection along with atypical presentation and unpredicted course of the disease. Result was that across India, elective living related kidney transplant came to a halt. Cadaver renal transplant, being emergency in nature still done, though very few.

However, it is unclear how newly synthesized genomes and messenger RNAs can travel from these sealed replication compartments to the cytosol to ensure their translation and the assembly of progeny virions. In this study, we used cellular cryo–electron microscopy to visualize a molecular pore complex that spans both membranes of the double-membrane vesicle and would allow export of RNA to the cytosol. A hexameric assembly of a large viral transmembrane protein was found to form the core of the crown-shaped complex.

Here, we discovered the m(6)A reader YTHDF2 as a caspase substrate via proteome-wide prediction, followed by in vitro and in vivo validations. We further demonstrated that cleavage-resistant YTHDF2 blocks, while cleavage-mimicking YTHDF2 fragments promote, the replication of a common human oncogenic virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Intriguingly, our study revealed a feedback regulation between YTHDF2 and caspase-8 via m(6)A modification of CASP8 mRNA and YTHDF2 cleavage during EBV replication. Further, we discovered that caspases cleave multiple components within the m(6)A RNA modification pathway to benefit EBV replication.

METHODS: In 347 COVID-19 inpatients, SARS-CoV-2 Ct values (via RT-qPCR) on admission were compared in between two assays and correlated with the antibody response (in the course of the disease), the clinical course and the time since onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Ct values for two of three target genes showed significant differences between the two assays used (p=0.012 and p<0.0001). Ct values were significantly higher for antibody positive patients (p<0.0001). Ct values were positively correlated with the amount of time since onset of symptoms (R: 0.332-0.363; p<0.001). Patients with fatal outcomes showed higher viral loads than survivors (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Ct values depend strongly on the assay used and the target gene examined and should not be used as quantitative values to guide therapeutic or diagnostic decisions. The inverse association between the antibody status and the viral load suggests that antibodies contribute to the elimination of the virus, independent of the outcome, which is influenced by the viral load on admission and might depend more strongly on other parts of the immune response.","Markewitz, Robert; Torge, Antje; Wandinger, Klaus-Peter; Pauli, Daniela; Dargvainiene, Justina; Franke, Andre; Bujanda, Luis; Marimón, José Maria; Banales, Jesus M.; Gutierrez-Stampa, María A.; Nafría, Beatriz; Junker, Ralf",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.07.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221005701?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273511/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221005701,337

Sputum examination can be useful in diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but is less well established in children. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in induced sputum (IS) specimens from children hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. METHODS. Among children aged 1–59 months, we compared organism detection by multiplex PCR in IS and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. To assess whether organism presence or density in IS specimens was associated with chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia (radiographic pneumonia), we compared prevalence and density in IS specimens from children with radiographic pneumonia and children with suspected pneumonia but without chest radiographic changes or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of pneumonia (nonpneumonia group). RESULTS. Among 4232 cases with World Health Organization–defined severe or very severe pneumonia, we identified 1935 (45.7%) with radiographic pneumonia and 573 (13.5%) with nonpneumonia. The organism detection yield was marginally improved with IS specimens (96.2% vs 92.4% for NP/OP specimens for all viruses combined [P = .41]; 96.9% vs 93.3% for all bacteria combined [P = .01]). After accounting for presence in NP/OP specimens, no organism was detected more frequently in the IS specimens from the radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases. Among high-quality IS specimens, there were no statistically significant differences in organism density, except with cytomegalovirus, for which there was a higher quantity in the IS specimens from cases with radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases (median cycle threshold value, 27.9 vs 28.5, respectively; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS. Using advanced molecular methods with IS specimens provided little additional diagnostic information beyond that obtained with NP/OP swab specimens.","Thea, Donald M.; Seidenberg, Phil; Park, Daniel E.; Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Fu, Wei; Shi, Qiyuan; Baggett, Henry C.; Brooks, W.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the currently available literature on the topic to determine the prevalence of mental health problems in HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for articles published from December 2019 to August 15, 2020. We identified studies reporting the prevalence of any mental health condition in HCWs involved directly or indirectly in providing services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence proportion for individual outcome was extracted as an estimate of interest. We performed random-effects meta-analyses evaluated using Q statistic, I(2) statistic, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses and assessed study quality. This review was done in adherence to the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The study protocol was registered prospectively at PROSPERO (CRD42020182005). RESULTS: We identified 1958 studies, of which 33 studies including 39703 participants (with a median = 393; range = 88–14825) were finally included for analysis. The estimated overall prevalence were as follows: depression 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9–39.3, I(2) = 99%), anxiety 32.5% (95% CI: 26.4–39.0, I(2) = 99%), insomnia or sleep disturbance 36.6% (95% CI: 36.6–48.3, I(2) = 99%), and stress 37.7% (95% CI: 24.0–52.3, I(2) = 100%). CONCLUSION: HCWs who are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic have a significant prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia and poor sleep quality, and stress.

Negative and traumatic childbirth experiences can also lead to fear of childbirth, avoiding or negatively influencing a subsequent pregnancy, mother-infant bonding problems, problems with breastfeeding, depression and reduced quality of life. For PTSD in general, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy has proven to be effective. However, little is known about the preventive effects of early intervention EMDR therapy in women after a traumatic birth experience. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of early intervention EMDR therapy in preventing PTSD and reducing PTSD symptoms in women with a traumatic birth experience. METHODS: The PERCEIVE study is a randomized controlled trial. Women suffering from the consequences of a traumatic birth experience will be randomly allocated at maximum 14 days postpartum to either EMDR therapy or ‘care-as-usual’. Patients in the EMDR group receive two sessions of therapy between 14 (T0) and 35 days postpartum. All participants will be assessed at T0 and at 9 weeks postpartum (T1). At T1, all participants will undergo a CAPS-5 interview about the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. The primary outcome measure is the severity of PTSD symptoms, whereas the secondary outcomes pertain to fear of childbirth, mother-infant bonding, breastfeeding, depression and quality of life. The study will be conducted at a large city hospital and at multiple midwifery practices in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. DISCUSSION: It is to be expected that the results of this study will provide more insight about the safety and effectiveness of early intervention EMDR therapy in the prevention and reduction of PTSD (symptoms) in women with a traumatic birth experience.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence models may aid in the clinical decision-making process for sports scientists, team physicians, and athletic trainers in translating the data acquired from wearable sensors to accurately and efficiently make decisions regarding the health, safety, and performance of athletes. This narrative review discusses the application of commercial sensors utilized by sports teams today and the emergence of descriptive analytics to monitor the internal and external workload, hydration status, sleep, cardiovascular health, and return-to-sport status of athletes. This review is written for those who are interested in the application of wearable sensor data and data science to enhance performance and reduce injury burden in athletes of all ages.","Seshadri, Dhruv R.; Thom, Mitchell L.; Harlow, Ethan R.; Gabbett, Tim J.; Geletka, Benjamin J.; Hsu, Jeffrey J.; Drummond, Colin K.; Phelan, Dermot M.; Voos, James E.",Front Sports Act Living,https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2020.630576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554111/,337
688356,"Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil",2021-01-26,"On March 1, 2020, New York State confirmed its first case of COVID-19. This state has had the largest initial mortality in the United States with more than 479,000 confirmed cases and over 25,000 deaths as of October 10, 2020. All elective surgeries in New York State were suspended on March 23, 2020, due to the national state of emergency. Syosset Hospital is a 75-bed community hospital dedicated primarily to elective surgery. During the COVID-19 surge, the hospital was converted to provide needed beds for the treatment of COVID-19 illness. In anticipation of the resumption of urgent elective procedures, this hospital became one of the two designated sites within the Northwell Health system to be “non-COVID.” Once the hospital was emptied of all inpatients, a complete and thorough cleaning and disinfection was performed on the entire building. All equipment was thoroughly decontaminated following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In anticipation of the resumption of elective surgery, each surgeon evaluated their cancelled case list to determine patient priority, based on a scale of 1 (elective, non-urgent), 2 (semi-urgent), 3 (urgent), to 4 (highly urgent). Site-specific disaster credentialing was expedited so that emergent surgeries could be performed by surgeons located at other Northwell sites. To ensure a structured and informative onboarding process, each visiting surgeon received a “welcome” email which requested pertinent information to facilitate the surgical process. Presurgical, surgical, and postoperative protocols were revised based on federal and local guidance and regulations. Resumption of elective surgery post COVID-19 placed the hospital into uncharted territory.","Krauss, Eugene S; Segal, Ayal; Schulman, Debra; Dengler, Nancy; Bily, Thomas; Cronin, MaryAnne; Altner, Kathleen",Orthop Res Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402851/; https://doi.org/10.2147/orr.s285452,337

Advanced organ support for lung and heart offers the possibility to buy the time needed for recovery. However, remaining a bridging strategy, extracorporeal life support cannot act as the ultimate treatment of the underlying COVID‐19 disease. Appropriate patient selection criteria addressed by experts and scientific organizations, such Extracorporeal Life Support Organization and World Health Organization may provide significant help in the difficult decision‐making and to reduce mortality in patients with profound respiratory and/or cardiac failure due to COVID‐19. Severe, systemic cytokine‐mediated inflammation associated with the SARS‐CoV‐2 has also been described. Effects of crosstalk between coagulation and inflammatory pathways appear to significantly affect disease progression and lead to poor outcomes. Multiple therapeutic strategies, including antibody therapies (such as Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, Siltuximab), therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and blood purification techniques for direct removal of cytokines, including filtration, dialysis (diffusion), and adsorption are available. Further, we believe, that research should be facilitated and promoted, particularly under the guidance of recognized scientific societies or expert‐based multicenter investigation, with rapid communication of critical and relevant information to enhance better appraisal of patient profiles, complications, and treatment modalities.","Swol, Justyna; Lorusso, Roberto",Artif Organs,https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.13748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516506/,337
689057,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and the Skin,2021-08-28,"Scholars and funding bodies alike are increasingly calling for transformative research that delivers socially robust and impact-oriented outcomes. This paper argues that the Human Scale Development approach (HSDA) introduced by Max-Neef and colleagues in Latin America during the 1980s can serve as a method for transformative science (TSc). HSDA is both a theory and a participatory methodology and thus contributes toward fulfilling the objectives of TSc, which are scientific, practical and educational. In this paper, we begin by explicating how the fundamental human needs (FHN) approach of the HSDA can support scholars and practitioners alike in addressing complex sustainability challenges. We then refer to the methodological adaptations to the original proposal that we have previously developed to illustrate how Max-Neef's methodological approach might be further extended and to demonstrate how these changes can strengthen HSDA and make it even more useful for generating knowledge needed in sustainability transformations. To inform and support research that builds on the co-production of knowledge, we test HSDA with regard to TSc quality criteria and show how it adds value to the existing canon of TSc methods. To this end, we develop an analytical framework that can be deployed to assess the quality of TSc methods.","Spiering, Salina; Barrera, María del Valle",Sustain Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-00966-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035864/,337

This cross-sectional study on household food insecurity during COVID-19 used data from a nationally representative sample of US households through the 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS) (including all 50 states and the District of Columbia, n = 74,413 households). Six generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were estimated, and the results indicated that households headed by Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, or other racial/ethnic minorities were not significantly more food insecure than White households during the pandemic. However, among food-insecure households, Black households were more likely to report that they could not afford to buy more food; Asian and Hispanic households were more likely to be afraid to go out to buy food; Asian households were more likely to face transportation issues when purchasing food; while White households were more likely to report that stores did not have the food they wanted. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities were significantly less confident about their household food security for the next 4 weeks than Whites. The coronavirus pandemic crisis has exposed and exacerbated the food injustice in American society. Policymakers and local officials should take concerted actions to improve the capacity of food supply and ensure food equality across all racial/ethnic groups.","Morales, Danielle Xiaodan; Morales, Stephanie Alexandra; Beltran, Tyler Fox",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00892-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33057998/,337

To facilitate antiviral screening against SARS-CoV-2 without requirement for high biosafety level facility, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored replicon of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01 strain, in which secreted Gaussia luciferase (sGluc) was encoded in viral subgenomic mRNA as a reporter gene. The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-α), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression to zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation. This replicon system would be helpful for performing antiviral screening and dissecting virus-host interactions.","Zhang, Yang; Song, Wuhui; Chen, Shuiye; Yuan, Zhenghong; Yi, Zhigang",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217430/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104974; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220303880; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220303880?v=s5,337
689788,mRNA Vaccines: Possible Tools to Combat SARS-CoV-2,2020-06-10,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical manifestations of COVID‐19 run from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Older age and comorbidities are associated to more severe disease. A role of obesity is suspected. METHODS: We enrolled patients hospitalized in the medical COVID‐19 ward with SARS‐CoV‐2 related pneumonia. Primary outcome of the study was to assess the relationship between the severity of COVID‐19 and obesity classes according to BMI. RESULTS: 92 patients (61.9% males; age 70.5±13.3 years) were enrolled. Patients with overweight and obesity were younger than normal‐weight patients (68.0±12.6 and 67.0±12.6 years vs. 76.1±13.0 years, p<0.01). A higher need for assisted ventilation beyond pure oxygen support (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation or Non‐Invasive Ventilation) and a higher admission to intensive or semi‐intensive care units was observed in patients with overweight and obesity (p<0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) even after adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively), or when patients with dementia or advanced cancer were removed from the analysis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with overweight and obesity admitted in a medical ward for SARS‐CoV‐2 related pneumonia, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive or semi‐intensive care units than normal weight patients.","Busetto, Luca; Bettini, Silvia; Fabris, Roberto; Serra, Roberto; Dal Pra’, Chiara; Maffei, Pietro; Rossato, Marco; Fioretto, Paola; Vettor, Roberto",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32463545/,337
690155,The challenges of informative wastewater sampling for SARS-CoV-2 must be met: lessons from polio eradication,2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND Influenza virus infections can cause hospitalizations in children, and annual vaccination of children can provide protection against influenza. METHODS We analyzed a test-negative design study with data spanning from 2010/11 through 2019/20 to evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza hospitalization in children by age group, influenza type/subtype and time period within each season. We enrolled children admitted to hospital with acute febrile respiratory illnesses. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by culture and/or RT-PCR to determine influenza status, and vaccination status was obtained by interviewing parents or legal guardians and was verified where possible. VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression model adjusting for sex, age and age-squared, matching on week. RESULTS Influenza seasons in Hong Kong are prolonged with influenza-associated hospitalizations occurring in almost every month of the year during the study period. Influenza vaccination was effective in preventing influenza-associated hospitalizations in children of all ages. Influenza VE was higher in younger children than in older children, and higher against hospitalization due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 than A(H3N2) and B. CONCLUSIONS The childhood influenza vaccination program in Hong Kong has prevented influenza-associated hospitalizations particularly in younger children. Our findings support the use of influenza vaccines in children as an effective approach to influenza control and prevention.","Chua, Huiying; Kwan, Mike Y W; Chan, Eunice L Y; Wong, Joshua S C; Peiris, J S Malik; Cowling, Benjamin J; Chiu, Susan S",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301433/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.014,337
690291,"Prevalence, environmental fate, treatment strategies, and future challenges for wastewater contaminated with SARS‐CoV‐2",2021-07-09,"Background COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which spread worldwide, revealing uphill repercussions. The infection is mediated by coronavirus spike protein and host cell receptor ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2). Several cell lines have been used as an in vitro model to test potential drugs and to study the viral kinetics. Since lungs are one of the first organs affected by the virus, pulmonary cell lines such as: A549 (lung cells) and BEAS-2B (Bronchial epithelium cells) are the most studied. However, these cells present a slow viral replication profile which complicate the testing of new antiviral drugs and viral replication studies. High levels of ACE2, which is observed in some groups of patients, is associated with the increase of viral replication and severe symptoms. Thus, the development of a BEAS-2B cell line overexpressing ACE2 would be a useful model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and to study new drugs. Aims Develop a BEAS-2B cell line overexpressing ACE2 and evaluate the role of ACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics. Methods BEAS-2B were transfected with pCEP-ACE2-myc and selected with hygromycin (125ng/ul) for 20 days, creating BEAS-2B-ACE2 cell line. ACE2 expression was quantified by RT-qPCR. Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence were used to quantify the ACE2 protein levels. ACE2 activity was evaluated using (MCA-Ala-Pro-Lys(Dnp)-OH) substrate. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.2). Viral kinetics were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Proliferation analysis was performed by MTT assay. Results Long-term overexpression ACE2 in BEAS-2B-ACE2 was confirmed by RT-qPCR, Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence. Compared to BEAS-2B, ACE2 mRNA expression was 100-fold higher (p<0.05), ACE2 protein levels increased 12X (p<0.05) and the immunofluorescence showed that ACE2 protein was more abundantly in BEAS-2B-ACE2. A 50X (p<0.0001) increase in the ACE2 activity was observed 2 months after the transfection. There was no difference in proliferation between BEAS-2B-ACE2 and BEAS-2B. Overexpression of ACE2 increased the viral kinetics. BEAS-2B-ACE2 presented 1000X (p<0.05) more SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cells and supernatant compared with BEAS-2B, 48 and 72 hours after infection. Conclusion Here we show for the first time that overexpression of ACE2 in BEAS-2B drastically changes the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and increases viral load – making it an useful cell line for future studies of SARS-CoV-2.","Bartolomeo, CS; Alves, TN; Lemes, RMR; Ivanov, GZ; Morais, RLT; Costa, AJ; Nishino, MS; Bassani, TB; Pereira, GJS; Smaili, SS; Maciel, RMB; Okuda, LH; Braconi, CT; Maricatto, JT; Janini, LMR; Ureshino, RP; Prado, CM; Stilhano, RS",Cytotherapy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1465324921000669; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465324921000669,337
