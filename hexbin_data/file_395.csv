3185,3185,3185,Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality among Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,18.321695,9.913652,2018-05-08,"Background: There is uncertainty regarding which factors are associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with pulmonary TB (PTB). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with PTB. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Global Health, for cohort and case-control studies that reported risk factors for in-hospital mortality in PTB. We pooled all factors that were assessed for an association, and presented relative associations as pooled odds ratios (ORs). Results: We identified 2,969 records, of which we retrieved 51 in full text; 11 cohort studies that evaluated 5,468 patients proved eligible. Moderate quality evidence suggested an association with co-morbid malignancy and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.01–3.40). Low quality evidence showed no association with positive sputum smear (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.40–2.48), or male sex (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84–1.41), and very low quality evidence showed no association with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.31, 95% IC 0.38–4.46), and previous TB infection (OR 2.66, 95% CI 0.48–14.87). Conclusion: Co-morbid malignancy was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death among pulmonary TB patients. There is insufficient evidence to confirm positive sputum smear, male sex, diabetes mellitus, and previous TB infection as predictors of in-hospital mortality in TB patients.","de Almeida, Carlos Podalirio Borges; Ziegelmann, Patrícia Klarmann; Couban, Rachel; Wang, Li; Busse, Jason Walter; Silva, Denise Rossato",Sci Rep,395,27
3395,3395,3395,The association between transforming growth factor beta1 polymorphism and susceptibility to pulmonary fibrosis: A meta-analysis (MOOSE compliant),17.990679,10.053476,2018-09-14,"Although many studies have investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) gene with pulmonary fibrosis (PF), but their association is still controversial. To clarify this, we performed a meta-analysis. Studies related to TGF-β1 and PF were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Wanfang (up to November 30, 2017). We targeted TGF-β1 SNPs that have been reported by ≥3 studies to be included in the current meta-analysis, resulting in only 1 final SNP (rs1800470). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in the models of allele comparison (T vs C), homozygote comparison (TT vs CC), dominant (TT vs TC + CC), recessive (TT + TC vs CC) to evaluate the strength of the associations. A total of 7 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant association between TGF-β1 rs1800470 and PF was found (T vs C: OR [95% CI] = 0.96 [0.80, 1.15]; TT vs CC: 0.87 [0.61, 1.22]; TT vs TC + CC: 0.80 [0.62, 1.04]; TT + TC vs CC: 1.13 [0.83, 1.54]). In subgroup analyses by ethnicity or original disease, no statistically significant association between TGF-β1 rs1800470 polymorphisms and PF was demonstrated. This meta-analysis revealed that TGF-β1 rs1800470 polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to PF development.","Xin, Lili; Jiang, Miao; Su, Guangbao; Xie, Miao; Chen, Hui; Liu, Xiao; Xu, Muge; Zhang, Geng; Gong, Jiening",Medicine (Baltimore),395,19
4468,4468,4468,What we can do? The risk factors for multi-drug resistant infection in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU): a case-control study,18.235674,9.801638,2020-02-07,"Ricin toxin is a plant‐derived, ribosome‐inactivating protein that is rapidly cleared from circulation by Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs)—with fatal consequences. Rather than being inactivated, ricin evades normal degradative pathways and kills both KCs and LSECs with remarkable efficiency. Uptake of ricin by these 2 specialized cell types in the liver occurs by 2 parallel routes: a “lactose‐sensitive” pathway mediated by ricin's galactose/N‐acetylgalactosamine‐specific lectin subunit (RTB), and a “mannose‐sensitive” pathway mediated by the mannose receptor (MR; CD206) or other C‐type lectins capable of recognizing the mannose‐side chains displayed on ricin's A (RTA) and B subunits. In this report, we investigated the capacity of a collection of ricin‐specific mouse MAb and camelid single‐domain (V(H)H) antibodies to protect KCs and LSECs from ricin‐induced killing. In the case of KCs, individual MAbs against RTA or RTB afforded near complete protection against ricin in ex vivo and in vivo challenge studies. In contrast, individual MAbs or V(H)Hs afforded little (<40%) or even no protection to LSECs against ricin‐induced death. Complete protection of LSECs was only achieved with MAb or V(H)H cocktails, with the most effective mixtures targeting RTA and RTB simultaneously. Although the exact mechanisms of protection of LSECs remain unknown, evidence indicates that the Ab cocktails exert their effects on the mannose‐sensitive uptake pathway without the need for Fcγ receptor involvement. In addition to advancing our understanding of how toxins and small immune complexes are processed by KCs and LSECs, our study has important implications for the development of Ab‐based therapies designed to prevent or treat ricin exposure should the toxin be weaponized.","Mooney, Bridget; Torres‐Velez, Fernando J.; Doering, Jennifer; Ehrbar, Dylan J.; Mantis, Nicholas J.",J Leukoc Biol,395,12
6722,6722,6722,Extracorporeal Life Support: Four Decades and Counting,18.232553,9.901239,2017-04-12,"The use of extracorporeal support systems in cardiac and/or pulmonary failure is an established treatment option. Although scientific evidence is limited there is an increasing amount of data from individual studies, e.g. Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial 2010, suggesting that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a veno-venous pump-driven system is a life-saving procedure in severe respiratory failure. Initially established as a rescue option for postcardiotomy cardiac failure extracorporeal life support (ECLS) as a pump-driven veno-arterial cardiovascular support system is increasingly being used in cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction, as bridging to transplantation or as part of extended cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) as an arterio-venous pumpless system is technically easier to handle but only ensures sufficient decarboxylation and not oxygenation. Therefore, this method is mainly applied in primarily hypercapnic respiratory failure to allow lung protective ventilation. Enormous technical improvements, e.g. extreme miniaturization of the extracorporeal assist devices must not obscure the fact that this therapeutic option represents an invasive procedure frequently associated with major complications. With this in mind a widespread use of this technology cannot be recommended and the use of extracorporeal systems should be restricted to centers with high levels of expertise and experience.","Pilarczyk, K.; Trummer, G.; Jakob, H.-G.; Dusse, F.; Marggraf, G.",Z Herz Thorax Gefasschir,395,1

Identification of readiness for weaning from CPAP can balance benefits with risks of CPAP exposure. We tested the hypothesis that preterm infants that successfully transition off CPAP have higher oxygen saturations prior to weaning compared with infants who fail weaning from CPAP. METHODS: This was a single-center-matched case–control study in infants ≤30 weeks’ gestation receiving ≤30% FiO(2) weaned off CPAP during the first postnatal week. Cases were infants placed back on CPAP within 7 days of being taken off CPAP, whereas control infants remained off CPAP for 7 consecutive days following CPAP discontinuation. Infants were matched on gestational age at birth (±10 days). Prospectively collected histograms detailing the distribution of oxygen saturations prior to CPAP discontinuation were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: Over a 12-month monitoring period, 36 infants met inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics, morbidities, and clinical variables did not differ between cases and controls. Controls achieved oxygen saturations of 95–97 and 97–100% for longer duration compared to cases (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In preterm infants with RDS receiving CPAP and ≤30% FiO(2), infants with higher oxygen saturations had greater success in transitioning off CPAP.","Gentle, Samuel J.; Ambalavanan, Namasivayam; Carlo, Waldemar A.",Pediatr Res,395,1

Its infestation in humans usually does not produce symptoms. However, in some patients, severe and life-threatening forms of this infection can occur, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Severe parasitic infection is triggered by any imbalance in the host’s immunity favouring the auto-infective cycle. This results in an increase in the intraluminal parasitic burden. In addition, tissue infestation is also very common. Clinical presentation is variable, and it is very difficult to diagnose clinically. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. In some cases, the diagnosis is established only on histopathological examination of the excised tissue by the pathologist. Here, the authors report a case of an elderly male diabetic patient, who presented to the emergency department with the features of acute abdomen. On exploratory laparotomy, he was found to have the features suggestive of gangrene of small bowel. Resection of the gangrenous bowel was done, and end-to-end anastomosis was done as the rest of the bowel appeared to be normal. However, the patient died of multi-organ failure and septicaemia on the second postoperative day. The resected intestine showed tissue infestation of Strongyloides stercoralis on histopathological examination. In this review article, the authors summarize a case of hyper infection syndrome of strongyloidiasis and discuss the various aspects of Strongyloides stercoralis infection with emphasis on life cycle of the parasite and different clinical features of the disease.","Karanam L, Sampath Kumar; Basavraj, Gopi Krishna; Papireddy, Chaitanya Kumar Reddy",Indian J Surg,395,27

Effective therapy and vaccination are needed to control viral expansion. However, current anti-IAV drugs risk inducing drug-resistant virus emergence. Although intranasal administration of whole inactivated virus vaccine can induce efficient protective immunity, formalin and β-propiolactone are the currently used and harmful inactivating agents. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activity of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) tea extract against human IAV and evaluated its potential as a novel anti-IAV drug and a safe inactivating agent for whole inactivated vaccine. The in vitro study revealed that the pH of hibiscus tea extract is acidic, and its rapid and potent antiviral activity relied largely on the acidic pH. Furthermore, the mouse study showed that the acidic extract was not effective for either therapeutic or vaccination purposes. However, hibiscus tea extract and protocatechuic acid, one of the major components of the extract, showed not only potent acid-dependent antiviral activity but also weak low-pH-independent activity. The low-pH-independent activity did not affect the conformation of immunodominant hemagglutinin protein. Although this low-pH-independent activity is very limited, it may be suitable for the application to medication and vaccination because this activity is not affected by the neutral blood environment and does not lose antigenicity of hemagglutinin. Further study of the low-pH-independent antiviral mechanism and attempts to enhance the antiviral activity may establish a novel anti-IAV therapy and vaccination strategy.","Takeda, Yohei; Okuyama, Yuko; Nakano, Hiroto; Yaoita, Yasunori; Machida, Koich; Ogawa, Haruko; Imai, Kunitoshi",Food Environ Virol,395,1

However, a multitude of questions remain to be addressed, including how to deal with the latent viral reservoir, how to boost the host immune response to the virus and what the hurdles are to reach relevant viral compartments in the body. Advances have been made especially with regard to identifying agents that can reactivate the latent virus in vivo and boost the cellular and humoral immunity, but it remains largely unclear whether any of these strategies can awaken a sufficiently large fraction of the viral reservoir and whether the boosted immunity can prevent rapid viral replication once antiretroviral treatments are stopped.","Alvarez, Lucia Bailon; Mothe, Beatriz; Berman, Lance; Brander, Christian",Drugs,395,1

Although IL-36γ has been proven to promote inflammation at epithelial sites and protect against specific pathogen infection, the detailed roles in severe influenza infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we have found that the expression of IL-36γ is higher in influenza-induced ARDS patients than healthy individuals. IL-36γ was induced in human lung epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Influenza A virus (IAV) infection, and its induction was synergistically correlated with initiation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) axis. We also have found that expression of superficial IL-36R was elevated in severe influenza patients and in IAV-stimulated cells. Furthermore, although IL-36γ enhanced the induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs), which promoted IAV-mediated IFN-stimulated STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylated inhibition in lung epithelial cells, the downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were not affected. Finally, we have revealed that IL-36γ treatment could promote apoptosis and inhibit autophagy in the early stages of IAV infection. Overall, these findings demonstrated IL-36γ is a critical host immune factor in response to IAV infection. It has potential activity in the regulation of the interferon signaling pathway and was involved in different types of programmed cell death in human airway epithelial cells as well.","Liu, Shuai; Li, Hui; Wang, Yeming; Li, Haibo; Du, Sisi; Zou, Xiaohui; Zhang, Xulong; Cao, Bin",Front Immunol,395,1

Surgical treatment for FAC patients should be carried out urgently. However, even after surgery, the mortality rate can be 40–50%. Although FAC is one of the most unfavorable surgical diseases with a poor prognosis, there are a few reports on the perioperative diagnosis and management of FAC based on autopsy findings. We herein report the surgical case of a 64-year-old man who developed multiple colon necrosis and perforation due to FAC. A detailed autopsy revealed FAC as the cause of death. Additionally, we reviewed the existing literature on FAC patients who underwent surgery and followed their perioperative diagnosis and management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old man presented with anorexia, diarrhea, and altered consciousness on arrival to our hospital. Computed tomography revealed a large mass in the upper right lobe of his lung, and the patient was admitted for close investigation. Bloody diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and hypotension were observed soon after admission. Urgent abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed extensive intestinal ischemia, intestinal pneumatosis, and free intra-abdominal gas. The preoperative diagnosis was bowel necrosis and perforation with intussusception of the small intestinal tumor. Emergency subtotal colectomy and enterectomy were performed soon after the contrast-enhanced computed tomography. He was taken to an intensive care unit after surgery. However, he could not recover from sepsis and died with disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure on the 10th-day post-surgery. A histopathological examination of the resected colon showed transmural necrosis and massive amoebae invasion. He was diagnosed with FAC. An autopsy revealed that he had developed pulmonary large cell carcinoma with small intestinal metastasis. The death was caused by intestinal ischemia, necrosis and the perforation of the residual bowel caused by amoebae invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Since FAC is a lethal disease with a high mortality rate and antibiotic therapies except metronidazole are ineffective, preoperative serological testing and perioperative metronidazole therapy in FAC patients can dramatically improve their survival rates.","Tomino, Takahiro; Ninomiya, Mizuki; Minagawa, Ryosuke; Matono, Rumi; Yumi Oshiro; Kitahara, Daichi; Izumi, Takuma; Taniguchi, Daisuke; Hirose, Kosuke; Kajiwara, Yuichiro; Minami, Kazuhito; Nishizaki, Takashi",Surg Case Rep,395,17

METHODS: Retrospective study of 2434 patients (age <21 years) admitted to a PICU from 1 January 2006 through 31 March 2016 and captured in the Virtual Pediatric Systems database with ICD9 diagnosis 277.87, disorders of mitochondrial metabolism. Factors influencing mortality and prolonged length of stay (≥14 days) were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Predictors independently affecting mortality (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, p < 0.05): age 1–23 months 3.4 (1.7–6.6) and mechanical ventilation 4.7 (2.6–8.6) were risk factors; post-operative 0.2 (0.1–0.6), readmission 0.5 (0.3–0.9), and neurologic reason for admittance 0.3 (0.1–0.9) were factors reducing risk. Predictors affecting prolonged length of stay: mechanical ventilation 7.4 (5.2–10.3) and infectious reason for admittance 2.0 (1.3–3.2) were risk factors, post-operative patients 0.3 (0.2–0.5) had lower risk. The utility of PRISM and PIM2 scores in this patient group was evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The single most predictive factor for both mortality and prolonged length of stay is the presence of mechanical ventilation. Age 1–23 months is a risk factor for mortality, and infectious reason for admittance indicates risk for prolonged length of stay. IMPACT: Presence of mechanical ventilation is the factor most strongly associated with negative outcome in patients with mitochondrial disease in pediatric intensive care. Age 1–23 months is a risk factor for mortality, and infectious reason for admittance indicates risk for prolonged length of stay. PRISM3 and PIM2 are not as accurate in patients with mitochondrial disease as in a mixed patient population.","Ehinger, Johannes K.; Karlsson, Michael; Sjövall, Fredrik; Leffler, Märta; McCormack, Shana E.; Kubis, Sherri E.; Åkesson, Anna; Falk, Marni J.; Kilbaugh, Todd J.",Pediatr Res,395,27

During osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, BM-MSCs show a preference for glycolysis during proliferation but shift to an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-dependent metabolism. The MSC immunoregulatory fate is achieved with cell polarization, and the result is sustained production of immunoregulatory molecules (including PGE2, HGF, IL1RA, IL6, IL8, IDO activity) in response to inflammatory stimuli. MSCs adapt their energetic metabolism when acquiring immunomodulatory property and shift to aerobic glycolysis. This can be achieved via hypoxia, pretreatment with small molecule-metabolic mediators such as oligomycin, or AKT/mTOR pathway modulation. The immunoregulatory effect of MSC on macrophages polarization and Th17 switch is related to the glycolytic status of the MSC. Indeed, MSCs pretreated with oligomycin decreased the M1/M2 ratio, inhibited T-CD4 proliferation, and prevented Th17 switch. Mitochondrial activity also impacts MSC metabolism. In the bone marrow, MSCs are present in a quiescent, low proliferation, but they keep their multi-progenitor function. In this stage, they appear to be glycolytic with active mitochondria (MT) status. During MSC expansion, we observed a metabolic shift toward OXPhos, coupled with an increased MT activity. An increased production of ROS and dysfunctional mitochondria is associated with the metabolic shift to glycolysis. In contrast, when MSC underwent chondro or osteoblast differentiation, they showed a decreased glycolysis and inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In parallel the mitochondrial enzymatic activities increased associated with oxidative phosphorylation enhancement. MSCs respond to damaged or inflamed tissue through the transfer of MT to injured and immune cells, conveying a type of signaling that contributes to the restoration of cell homeostasis and immune function. The delivery of MT into injured cells increased ATP levels which in turn maintained cellular bioenergetics and recovered cell functions. MSC-derived MT may be transferred via tunneling nanotubes to undifferentiated cardiomyocytes and leading to their maturation. In this review, we will decipher the pathways and the mechanisms responsible for mitochondria transfer and activity. The eventual reversal of the metabolic and pro-inflammatory profile induced by the MT transfer will open new avenues for the control of inflammatory diseases.","Jorgensen, Christian; Khoury, Maroun",Front Immunol,395,27

The effects of Metabolic syndrome are multiple and wide ranging; some of which have an impact on the central nervous system and cause neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is a catabolic intracellular process, essential for the recycling of cytoplasmic materials and for the degradation of damaged cellular organelle. Therefore, autophagy is primarily a cytoprotective mechanism; even if excessive cellular degradation can be detrimental. To date, it is known that systemic autophagic insufficiency is able to cause metabolic balance deterioration and facilitate the onset of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to highlight the current state of knowledge regarding the connection between metabolic syndrome and the onset of several neurological diseases related to it.

Therapeutic interventions are largely ineffective. A better understanding of the pathophysiology is required. Ion channels contribute substantially to the “hallmarks of cancer.” Their expression is dysregulated in cancer, and they are “misused” to drive cancer progression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Ion channels are located in the cell membrane at the interface between the intracellular and extracellular space. They sense and modify the tumor microenvironment which in itself is a driver of PDAC aggressiveness. Ion channels detect, for example, locally altered proton and electrolyte concentrations or mechanical stimuli and transduce signals triggered by these microenvironmental cues through association with intracellular signaling cascades. While these concepts have been firmly established for other cancers, evidence has emerged only recently that ion channels are drivers of PDAC aggressiveness. Particularly, they appear to contribute to two of the characteristic PDAC features: the massive fibrosis of the tumor stroma (desmoplasia) and the efficient immune evasion. Our critical review of the literature clearly shows that there is still a remarkable lack of knowledge with respect to the contribution of ion channels to these two typical PDAC properties. Yet, we can draw parallels from ion channel research in other fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. Evidence is accumulating that pancreatic stellate cells express the same “profibrotic” ion channels. Similarly, it is at least in part known which major ion channels are expressed in those innate and adaptive immune cells that populate the PDAC microenvironment. We explore potential therapeutic avenues derived thereof. Since drugs targeting PDAC-relevant ion channels are already in clinical use, we propose to repurpose those in PDAC. The quest for ion channel targets is both motivated and complicated by the fact that some of the relevant channels, for example, K(Ca)3.1, are functionally expressed in the cancer, stroma, and immune cells. Only in vivo studies will reveal which arm of the balance we should put our weights on when developing channel-targeting PDAC therapies. The time is up to explore the efficacy of ion channel targeting in (transgenic) murine PDAC models before launching clinical trials with repurposed drugs.","Hofschröer, Verena; Najder, Karolina; Rugi, Micol; Bouazzi, Rayhana; Cozzolino, Marco; Arcangeli, Annarosa; Panyi, Gyorgy; Schwab, Albrecht",Front Pharmacol,395,12

However, H7N9 is still prevalent in poultry. To surveil the prevalence, genetic characteristics, and antigenic changes of H7N9, over 7000 oropharyngeal and cloaca swab specimens were collected from live poultry markets and farms in 15 provinces of China from 2017 to 2019. A total of 85 influenza virus subtype H7N9 strains were isolated and 20 representative strains were selected for genetic analysis and antigenicity evaluation. Results indicated the decreased prevalence of low-pathogenic H7N9 strains while highly-pathogenic H7N9 strains became dominated since the introduction of vaccine. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strains from 2019 formed an independent small branch and were genetically distant to strains isolated in 2013–2018. Analysis of key amino acid sites showed that the virus strains may adapt to the host environment evolutionally through mutation. Our analysis predicted additional potential glycosylation sites for HA and NA genes in the 2019 strains. Sequence analysis of HA gene in strains isolated from 2018 to 2019 showed that there were an increased nucleotide substitution rate and an increased mutation rate in the first and second nucleotides of coding codons within the open reading frame. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay showed that H7-Re1 and H7-Re2 exhibited a lower HI titer for isolates from 2019, while H7-Re3 and rLN79 showed a high HI titer. The protective effect of the vaccine decreased after 15 months of use. Overall, under vaccination pressure, the evolution of influenza virus subtype H7N9 has accelerated.

Study Design: This was a follow-up study. Participants who met the entry criteria were administered with escitalopram (5–10 mg/day) as an initial treatment. Self-evaluation and observer valuations were arranged at the end of weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, with blood samples collected at baseline and during weeks 2 and 12. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then carried out by incorporating three cytokines selected by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. Internal validation was estimated using the bootstrap method with 1,000 repetitions. Results: A total of 85 patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including 62 responders and 23 non-responders, were analyzed. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and lipocalin-2 were selected by the LASSO regression model. The area under the curve (AUC) from the logistic model was 0.811 and was confirmed as 0.7887 following bootstrapping validation. Conclusions: We established and validated a good prediction model to facilitate the individualized prediction of escitalopram treatment for MDD and created a personalized approach to treatment for patients with depression.","Zhou, Jingjing; Zhou, Jia; Sun, Zuoli; Feng, Lei; Zhu, Xuequan; Yang, Jian; Wang, Gang",Front Psychiatry,395,1

The purpose of this study is to clarify the active ingredients and mechanism of GD in the treatment of diarrhea with IDHS. The TCMSP database was used to screen out the active ingredients of the four Chinese herbal medicines in GD, and the targets of the active ingredients were predicted. We selected the targets related to diarrhea through the DisGeNET database, then used the NCBI database to screen out related targets of lactase and sucrase, and constructed the visual network to search for the active ingredients of GD in the treatment of diarrhea and related mechanisms of the targets. Combined with network pharmacology, we screened out 146 active ingredients in GD corresponding to 252 ingredient targets, combined with 328 disease targets in diarrhea, and obtained 12 lactase targets and 11 sucrase targets. The key active ingredients involved quercetin, formononetin, β-sitosterol kaempferol, and wogonin. Furthermore, molecular docking showed that these five potential active ingredients had good affinities with the core targets PTGS2. The active ingredients in GD (such as quercetin, formononetin, and β-sitosterol) may increase the microbial activity of the intestinal mucosa of mice and reduce the microbial activity of the intestinal contents through multiple targets, thereby achieving the effect of treating diarrhea.","Li, Xiaoya; Zhang, Chenyang; Tan, Zhoujin; Yuan, Jiali",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,395,27

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to collect pilot data to determine the preliminary reliability and feasibility of the two tests to confirm the equivalence of the adaptation and translation. METHOD: The study was conducted in a peri-urban community in South Africa. Twenty-one first-language Northern Sotho caregivers of children aged between 18 and 48 months were recruited by employing snowball sampling. The participants were asked to complete the Northern Sotho and the culturally adapted English M-CHAT-R/F, which were presented in random order. RESULTS: The preliminary content validity and equivalence were evident, with no difference at the 5% interval of the Wilcoxon signed rank test. All 21 toddlers screened presented with a low risk for autism following the recommended execution of the Follow-Up section for the toddlers in the medium risk category. All participants completed the two screening tests, with none indicating unfamiliar words or constructs. A higher preference for the English adapted version was found but a need for the Northern Sotho screening test was also evident CONCLUSION: The Northern Sotho translation of the M-CHAT-R/F, as well as the adapted English version, appears feasible and is ready for comprehensive validation.","Vorster, Carlien; Kritzinger, Alta; Coetser, Lovina E.; van der Linde, Jeannie",S Afr J Commun Disord,395,33

We present a systematic approach that sheds light on the patterns observed in hundreds of transcriptomic datasets from over sixty indications by using pathways and molecular interactions as a template. Our analysis employs transcriptomic datasets to construct dozens of disease specific co-expression networks, alongside a human protein-protein interactome network. Leveraging the interoperability between these two network templates, we explore patterns both common and particular to these diseases on three different levels. Firstly, at the node-level, we identify most and least common proteins across diseases and evaluate their consistency against the interactome as a proxy for their prevalence in the scientific literature. Secondly, we overlay both network templates to analyze common correlations and interactions across diseases at the edge-level. Thirdly, we explore the similarity between patterns observed at the disease-level and pathway knowledge to identify signatures associated with specific diseases and indication areas. Finally, we present a case scenario in schizophrenia, where we show how our approach can be used to investigate disease pathophysiology.","Figueiredo, Rebeca Queiroz; Raschka, Tamara; Kodamullil, Alpha Tom; Hofmann-Apitius, Martin; Mubeen, Sarah; Domingo-Fernández, Daniel",Nucleic Acids Res,395,12

Instead, indirect parameters such as oxygen desaturation or bradycardia are captured. We propose a Kalman filter-based detection of respiration activity and hence apnea using multichannel esophageal signals in neonatal intensive care unit patients. METHODS: We performed a single-center observational study with moderately preterm infants. Commercially available nasogastric feeding tubes containing multiple electrodes were used to capture signals with customized software. Multichannel esophageal raw signals were manually annotated, processed using extended Kalman filter, and compared with standard monitoring data including chest impedance to measure respiration activity. RESULTS: Out of a total of 405.4 h captured signals in 13 infants, 100 episodes of drop in oxygen saturation or heart rate were examined. Median (interquartile range) difference in respiratory rate was 0.04 (−2.45 to 1.48)/min between esophageal measurements annotated manually and with Kalman filter and −3.51 (−7.05 to −1.33)/min when compared to standard monitoring, suggesting an underestimation of respiratory rate when using the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Kalman filter-based estimation of respiratory activity using multichannel esophageal signals is safe and feasible and results in respiratory rate closer to visual annotation than that derived from chest impedance of standard monitoring.","Bürgin, Corine; Simmen, Patrizia; Gupta, Nishant; Suter, Lilian; Kreuzer, Samuel; Haeberlin, Andreas; Schulzke, Sven M.; Trachsel, Daniel; Niederhauser, Thomas; Jost, Kerstin",Pediatr Res,395,19

Despite that, natural rubber has been identified with some drawbacks such as low modulus and strength and therefore opens up the opportunity for adding a reinforcing agent. Apart from the conventional fillers such as silica, carbon black and lignocellulosic fibers, nanocellulose is also one of the ideal candidates. Nanocellulose is a promising filler with many excellent properties such as renewability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, reactive surface, low density, high specific surface area, high tensile and elastic modulus. However, it has some limitations in hydrophobicity, solubility and compatibility and therefore it is very difficult to achieve good dispersion and interfacial properties with the natural rubber matrix. Surface modification is often carried out to enhance the interfacial compatibilities between nanocellulose and natural rubber and to alleviate difficulties in dispersing them in polar solvents or polymers. This paper aims to highlight the different surface modification methods employed by several researchers in modifying nanocellulose and its reinforcement effects in the natural rubber matrix. The mechanism of the different surface medication methods has been discussed. The review also lists out the conventional filler that had been used as reinforcing agent for natural rubber. The challenges and future prospective has also been concluded in the last part of this review.","Hakimi, Nik Muhammad Faris; Lee, Seng Hua; Lum, Wei Chen; Mohamad, Siti Fatahiyah; Osman Al Edrus, Syeed SaifulAzry; Park, Byung-Dae; Azmi, Anis",Polymers (Basel),395,22

This is generally a multifactorial issue with potential nutritional, infectious and management contributors. Commonly encountered respiratory and enteric pathogens include porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus (IAV), porcine enteric coronaviruses (TGEV/PEDV/PDCV), and group A, B, and C rotaviruses, as well as Salmonella typhimurium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Streptococcus suis, and Haemophilus parasuis. Infection with one or more of these agents can ultimately antagonize pig health and performance. However, while these specific pathogens may be causing an observed disease symptom, pigs may have been predisposed to infection due to various management, nutritional, and environmental risk factors. As many of these potential pathogens are endemic in production systems, it is important to remember that simply detecting a potential pathogen within a population is often not sufficient to assign cause for poor growth and production. To help fully interpret the impact of a detected agent, diagnostic efforts should focus on providing proof that the agent is actually causing disease. Molecular detection methods, such as PCR, are increasingly available for common pathogens and have high diagnostic sensitivity but lower diagnostic specificity. This paper will discuss the clinical signs and gross and microscopic lesions associated with common nursery pig pathogens, as well as proper sampling and diagnostic testing necessary to detect and confirm disease following infection with these agents.","Burrough, Eric R; Gabler, Nicholas K",J Anim Sci,395,12

METHODS: Control and leadership engagement were key to our success. Control of collection process, creating collection “kits”, methods of shipment, results reporting and regulated distribution. Key players maintained order and track all samples on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet utilized was the most vital tool in weeks to come. Daily updates for both supplies and samples. Simultaneously, researching test capabilities with current analyzers. Daily huddles and group meetings to coordinate all efforts which included manning. RESULTS: Supply counts three times a day at the start and collection “kits” weekly. This measured the capabilities initially. Counting errors lead to numerous redundancies. This was a burden and abandoned. Reference laboratory instructions were verified for all transport media allowed and was as a starting point. Daily usage was subtracted. Patient management was populated with sample specificities, patient demographics and testing locations.

In Mexico City, the COVID-19 peak started in mid-April 2020. A considerable proportion of those diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated by ambulatory care. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics at diagnosis of ambulatory patients diagnosed with COVID-19, their willingness to donate plasma and their clinical outcomes at one month of the follow-up call program implementation. METHODS: A call strategy follow-up program (FUP) was established on April 19, 2020. All ambulatory patients received at least 3 calls every 48–72 hours, followed by 2 weekly calls. A team of voluntary medical students, general practitioners, fellows, and medical specialists was assembled for this purpose. Signs of alarm (fever >72 hours, shortness of breath, respiratory insufficiency) and other clinical signs were collected on every call. Willingness to donate plasma and possibility of a correct home isolation were also addressed. RESULTS: From April 19 to May 18, 2020, a total of 360 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2, of whom 350 were followed. Their median age was 44 years (33–51), and 55% were female. 145 (41%) had completed all FUP calls and 194 (55%) referred to be asymptomatic in their last call. We identified 8 patients with signs of alarm during the calls, and 2 of them required hospitalization. During the FUP, 66% referred fatigue that limited their activities, 56% anosmia or dysgeusia, 32% headache, and 22% diarrhea. 90% were capable to properly isolate in their homes. Willingness to donate plasma was assessed in 89 patients, of whom, 75 (84%) manifested their willingness to donate. CONCLUSION: Ambulatory follow-up is feasible and effective to identify those in need of hospitalization. Remarkably, half of the ambulatory patients had no comorbidities and presented anosmia/dysgeusia as the most frequent symptoms during follow-up. Willingness to donate plasma was high in this cohort.

Plans were presented and discussed during an initial individual face-to-face counseling session. Due to COVID 19, a second counseling session was conducted via Zoom. For three months after the 2nd counseling session, participants received weekly text messages reinforcing the information received. RESULTS: Participants reported significant improvements in their intake of most recommended foods. Reductions in weight, waist circumference, and in the reported intake of non-recommended foods and beverages were not significant. Most participants either strongly agreed (14) or agreed (4) that the personalized nutrition plan provided useful information. The coronavirus pandemic was mentioned by 20% of participants as a barrier to following their personalized nutrition plan recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a personalized approach in providing dietary recommendations utilizing precision nutrition has the potential to increase self-efficacy and improve dietary intake among low income African Americans with chronic disease. It also demonstrated that it is feasible to recruit and retain individuals of African ancestry to participate in an investigation that assesses and discloses gene-associated disease risk.

This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a box model physical simulator is an option to supplement standard training. However, the value of this modality on trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare the benefits and harms of box model training for surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience versus standard surgical training or supplementary animal model training. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA We planned to include all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus other forms of training including standard laparoscopic training and supplementary animal model training in surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience. We also planned to include trials comparing different methods of box model training. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently identified trials and collected data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS We identified eight trials that met the inclusion criteria. One trial including 17 surgical trainees did not contribute to the meta-analysis. We included seven trials (249 surgical trainees belonging to various postgraduate years ranging from year one to four) in which the participants were randomised to supplementary box model training (122 trainees) versus standard training (127 trainees). Only one trial (50 trainees) was at low risk of bias. The box trainers used in all the seven trials were video trainers. Six trials were conducted in USA and one trial in Canada. The surgeries in which the final assessments were made included laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repairs, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic tubal ligation, laparoscopic partial salpingectomy, and laparoscopic bilateral mid-segment salpingectomy. The final assessments were made on a single operative procedure.There were no deaths in three trials (0/82 (0%) supplementary box model training versus 0/86 (0%) standard training; RR not estimable; very low quality evidence). The other trials did not report mortality. The estimated effect on serious adverse events was compatible with benefit and harm (three trials; 168 patients; 0/82 (0%) supplementary box model training versus 1/86 (1.1%) standard training; RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.02 to 8.43; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported patient quality of life. The operating time was significantly shorter in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (1 trial; 50 patients; MD -6.50 minutes; 95% CI -10.85 to -2.15). The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery was significantly higher in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (1 trial; 50 patients; 24/24 (100%) supplementary box model training versus 15/26 (57.7%) standard training; RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.37). None of the trials reported trainee satisfaction. The operating performance was significantly better in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (seven trials; 249 trainees; SMD 0.84; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10).None of the trials compared box model training versus animal model training or versus different methods of box model training. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to determine whether laparoscopic box model training reduces mortality or morbidity. There is very low quality evidence that it improves technical skills compared with standard surgical training in trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience. It may also decrease operating time and increase the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery in the first total extraperitoneal hernia repair after box model training. However, the duration of the benefit of box model training is unknown. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. Such trials should assess the long-term impact of box model training on clinical outcomes and compare box training with other forms of training.","Gurusamy, Kurinchi Selvan; Nagendran, Myura; Toon, Clare D; Davidson, Brian R",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,395,1

For biomaterials in bone reconstruction, the promotion of osteogenic differentiation and reduction of inflammation are desirable. Fibrillar coatings are interesting because of fibrils' high surface area-volume ratio, aiding adsorption and adhesion. Fibrils also serve as a matrix for the immobilization of biomolecules with biological activity, such as the phenolic compound phloroglucinol (PG), the subunit of marine polyphenols. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of PG coatings on fibroblast- and osteoblast-like cells to increase the osseointegration of titanium implants. Collagen fibril coatings, containing PG at low and high concentrations, were produced on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) scaffolds generated by additive manufacturing (AM). These coatings, especially PG-enriched coatings, reduced hydrophobicity and modulated the behavior of human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cell lines. Both osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells spread and adhered well on PG-enriched coatings. Coatings significantly reduced the inflammatory response. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation was promoted by collagen coatings with a high PG concentration. Thus, the enrichment of collagen fibril coatings with PG is a promising strategy to improve Ti6Al4V implants for bone contact in orthopedics and dentistry and is worthy of further investigation.","Mieszkowska, Anna; Beaumont, Harrison; Martocq, Laurine; Koptyug, Andrey; Surmeneva, Maria A; Surmenev, Roman A; Naderi, Javad; Douglas, Timothy E L; Gurzawska-Comis, Katarzyna A",International journal of molecular sciences,395,1

Here we introduce an alternative approach for glymphatic system quantification in the mouse brain via T1 mapping which also captures drainage of Gd-DOTA to the cervical lymph nodes. The Gd-DOTA injection into CSF was performed on the bench after which the mice underwent T1 mapping using a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence on a 9.4 T MRI. In Ketamine/Xylazine (KX) anesthetized mice, glymphatic transport and drainage of Gd-DOTA to submandibular and deep cervical lymph nodes was demonstrated as 25-50% T1 reductions in comparison to control mice receiving CSF saline. To further validate the T1 mapping approach we also verified increased glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA transport in mice anesthetized with KX in comparison with ISO. The novel T1 mapping method allows for quantification of glymphatic transport as well as drainage to the deep and superficial cervical lymph nodes. The ability to measure glymphatic transport and cervical lymph node drainage in the same animal longitudinally is advantageous and time efficient and the coupling between the two systems can be studied and translated to human studies.","Xue, Yuechuan; Liu, Xiaodan; Koundal, Sunil; Constantinou, Stefan; Dai, Feng; Santambrogio, Laura; Lee, Hedok; Benveniste, Helene",Scientific reports,395,5

Knowledge about etiology and outcome in affected patients is limited, and prospective trials on management and treatment are hardly feasible. Case reports are therefore an important source of information. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in June 2016 and May 2018, supplemented by a manual search. Titles and abstracts were systematically assessed for eligibility, followed by full-text screening for included papers. Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. Cases of cerebral gas embolism due to any iatrogenic cause were included. Criteria for exclusion were: animal studies, non-cerebral localization, extravascular gas only, and non-iatrogenic causes. 264 cases reported in 189 papers were included. RESULTS A broad range of procedures leading to iatrogenic cerebral gas embolism (ICGE) were identified and a comprehensive list is presented in this article. Procedures were mostly reported as conducted correctly, but procedure related error, patient activity, or defective equipment were also reported as causes. Neurological, neuropsychological, and cardiopulmonary symptoms were common. The diagnosis was frequently based on or confirmed by radiology, usually CT. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was applied in a large number of cases. CONCLUSION The reported causes, symptoms and signs, and outcomes of ICGE vary significantly, and awareness of the condition in the medical community is essential. A standardized method of reporting could facilitate higher quality research in the field.","Hatling, Dyveke; Høgset, Anne; Guttormsen, Anne Berit; Müller, Bernd",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,395,4

The authors recently identified a racial disparity in access to a laparoscopic approach to inguinal hernia repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and colectomy. The present study further evaluates this patient cohort to assess the relationship between the race and postoperative complications and test the mediating effect of the selected surgical approach. METHODS After institutional review board approval, patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent inguinal hernia repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, or colectomy in 2016 were identified. Patient demographics, including the self-reported race and ethnicity, as well as clinical, operative, and postoperative variables were recorded. After the exclusion of cases associated with diagnoses of cancer, a 4:1 propensity score matching algorithm generated a clinically balanced cohort of patients of white and black self-reported race. The mediating effect of an open approach to surgery on the relationship between black self-reported race and postoperative complications was evaluated via a series of regressions. RESULTS There were 41,340 unilateral inguinal hernia repairs, 3182 bilateral inguinal hernia repairs, 60,444 cholecystectomies, 50,523 appendectomies, and 58,012 colectomies included in the database in 2017. Exclusion of cases associated with cancer and subsequent propensity score matching returned 17,540 unilateral hernia repairs, 890 bilateral hernia repairs, 23,865 cholecystectomies, 11,660 appendectomies, and 12,320 colectomies. On mediation analysis, any complication, severe complication, and death were significant when regressed on black self-reported race (any: odds ratio [OR] = 1.210, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.132-1.291, P < 0.001; severe: OR = 1.352, 95% CI = 1.245-1.466, P < 0.001; death: OR = 1.358, 95% CI = 1.000-1.818, P = 0.044), and open surgery was a significant mediator in the incidence of any complication and severe complication (any: OR = 1.180, 95% CI = 1.105-1.260, P < 0.001 and severe: OR = 1.307, 95% CI = 1.203-1.418, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These findings underscore the importance of access to a minimally invasive approach to surgery. However, other factors may contribute to racial disparities in postoperative complications after common abdominal operations.","Haider, Syed; Wood, Kasey; Bui, Anthony; Leitman, I Michael",The Journal of surgical research,395,1

However, different genetic variants can affect the metabolism of HCQ leading to inter-individual differences in its efficacy. In this study, we investigated the effects of variants in CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 on the risk of Covid-19 infection among patients receiving HCQ for controlling rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS A total of 60 patients were genotyped for CYP2D6*2XN, CYP2D6*4, CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*2. They were receiving HCQ for the treatment of RA. The patients were evaluated clinically for fever and dry cough, radiologically via chest computed tomography (CT) and immunologically via anti-Covid-19 IgG and IgM titers. RESULTS Variants in CYP2D6 significantly affected the grade of ground glass (CYP2D6*4 AA carriers showed the higher risk for grade 3) and the risk of positive anti-Covid-19 IgM (CYP2D6*2XN CC and CYP3A4*1B AA had the lowest risk), the duration of HCQ, the use of corticosteroids or gender did not affect the Covid-19 status significantly. CONCLUSIONS In general, the outcome of the studied patients receiving HCQ was good (no deaths, no intubation needed). CYP2D6 variants could affect the outcome of Covid-19 infection.","Salem Hareedy, Mohammad; Rashad, Sonya Mohamed; Hetta, Helal F; Hassanien, Sara Mahmoud; Abdellatif, Hebatallah; Hassanien, Manal",Drug metabolism and personalized therapy,395,1

Diagnostic studies that anticipate the changes in morphology are essential for earlier detection of residual viable tumor tissue or local recurrences to identify patients who will benefit from a new treatment. Our study has determined the diagnostic yield of PET/CT studies at baseline and follow-up and adequate time between them and the ablation intervention. Seven patients with single tumor lesion with a total of 8 ablations were included. CT and PET/CT studies were performed at baseline and follow-up after ablation. Average times between PET studies at baseline and follow-up and the ablative therapy were 1.8 and 3.4 months, respectively. Mean scores in metabolic activities of the PET at baseline and follow-up were 7.6 and 4.3g/ml of SUVmax, respectively. The Dual Time Point technique helped to identify viable tissue after ablation in 3 cases. Follow-up PET/CT studies have conditioned the various treatment strategies adopted by clinical oncologists. The high yield of the PET/CT study including the Dual Time Point technique may be considered as a study replacement of initial and follow-up Contrast-Enhanced CT before and after treatment with RFA and AMO, this achieving considerable reduction in the exposure to high radiation levels.

Since the role of HPV was demonstrated, few studies have focused on HPV-negative OPSCC. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of therapeutic strategy (surgical vs. non-surgical) on oncologic outcomes in patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. MATERIAL AND METHOD All p16-negative OPSCCs treated from 2009 to 2014 in 7 tertiary-care centers were included in this retrospective study and were classified according to the therapeutic strategy: surgical strategy (surgery ± adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy) vs. non-surgical strategy (definitive radiotherapy ± chemotherapy). Patients not eligible for surgery (unresectable tumor, poor general-health status) were excluded. Univariate, multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were performed to compare overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS Four hundred seventy-four (474) patients were included in the study (surgical group: 196; non-surgical group: 278). Five-year OS, DSS and RFS were 76.5, 81.3 and 61.3%, respectively, in the surgical group and 49.9, 61.8 and 43.4%, respectively, in the non-surgical group. The favorable impact of primary surgical treatment on oncologic outcomes was statistically significant after multivariate analysis. This effect was more marked for locally-advanced than for early-stage tumors. Propensity score matching analysis confirmed the prognostic impact of primary surgical treatment for RFS. CONCLUSION Therapeutic strategy is an independent prognostic factor in patients with p16-negative OPSCC and primary surgical treatment is associated with improved OS, DSS and RFS. These results suggest that surgical strategy is a reliable option for advanced stage OPSCC.","Culié, Dorian; Viotti, Julien; Modesto, Anouchka; Schiappa, Renaud; Chamorey, Emmanuel; Dassonville, Olivier; Poissonnet, Gilles; Guelfucci, Bruno; Bizeau, Alain; Vergez, Sebastien; Dupret-Bories, Agnes; Garrel, Renaud; Fakhry, Nicolas; Santini, Laure; Lallemant, Benjamin; Chambon, Guillaume; Sudaka, Anne; Peyrade, Frederic; Saada-Bouzid, Esma; Benezery, Karen; Jourdan-Soulier, Florence; Chapel, Françoise; Ramay, Anne Sophie; Roger, Pascal; Galissier, Thibault; Coste, Valérie; Ben Lakdar, Aicha; Guerlain, Joanne; Temam, Stephane; Mirghani, Haitham; Gorphe, Phillipe; Bozec, Alexandre",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,395,31

In particular, generative deep learning not only provides competitive prediction performance, but also allows for uncovering structure by generating synthetic samples. However, exploration and visualization is not as straightforward as with image applications. RESULTS We demonstrate how log-linear models, fitted to the generated, synthetic data can be employed to extract patterns from omics data, learned by deep generative techniques. Specifically, interactions between latent representations learned by the approaches and generated synthetic data are used to determine sets of joint patterns. Distances of patterns with respect to the distribution of latent representations are then visualized in low-dimensional coordinate systems, e.g., for monitoring training progress. This is illustrated with simulated data and subsequently with cortical single cell gene expression data. Using different kinds of deep generative techniques, specifically variational autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines, the proposed approach highlights how the techniques uncover underlying structure. It facilitates the real world use of such generative deep learning techniques in order to gain biological insights from omics data. AVAILABILITY The code for the approach as well as an accompanying Jupyter notebook, which illustrates the application of our approach, is available via the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ssehztirom/Exploring-generative-deep-learning-for-omics-data-by-using-log-linear-models.

An attempt to reduce infection and spread of the disease, for most nations, has led to a lockdown period, where people's movement has been restricted resulting in a consequential impact on employment, lifestyle behaviours and wellbeing. As such, this study aimed to explore adults' thoughts and behaviours in response to the outbreak and resulting lockdown measures. METHODS Using an online survey, 1126 adults responded to invitations to participate in the study. Participants, all aged 18 years or older, were recruited using social media, email distribution lists, website advertisement and word of mouth. Sentiment and personality features extracted from free-text responses using Artificial Intelligence methods were used to cluster participants. RESULTS Findings demonstrated that there was varied knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19 and high concern about infection, severe illness and death, spread to others, the impact on the health service and on the economy. Higher concerns about infection, illness and death were reported by people identified at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Behavioural clusters, identified using Artificial Intelligence methods, differed significantly in sentiment and personality traits, as well as concerns about COVID-19, actions, lifestyle behaviours and wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS This time-sensitive study provides important insights into adults' perceptions and behaviours in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown. The use of Artificial Intelligence has identified that there are two behavioural clusters that can predict people's responses during the COVID-19 pandemic, which goes beyond simple demographic groupings. Considering these insights may improve the effectiveness of communication, actions to reduce the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support community recovery.","Flint, S W; Piotrkowicz, A; Watts, K",Perspectives in public health,395,1

Granted, it causes asymptomatic infection, but fatal cases and neurologic disorders were also recorded, especially in humans, horses and some exposed birds. The virus is globally spread and birds are considered an amplifying and reservoir host of WNV, helping to spread the disease due to their close contact with main hosts. In this study, we aimed to detect the presence of antibodies against WNV in backyard hens that were reared in the western Anatolian part of Turkey. A total of 480 chicken sera were randomly collected from six provinces in the west of Turkey (Mugla, Izmir, Aydin, Afyonkarahisar, Kutahya and Manisa) with 80 samples from each province (40 in spring and 40 in fall seasons). They were tested by using a competitive ELISA method to identify the specific avian antibodies of IgG that produced against the WNV envelope proteins (pr-E). Twelve of 480 (2.5%) sera were found seropositive, three of these positive sera were detected from the Izmir province (3.75%) collected in the spring session and the other nine positive sera were detected from the Mugla province (11.25%) collected in the fall session. Both of these provinces are located seaside and have suitable climate conditions for vectors of infection. The results indicated that WNV infection is in circulation in these provinces, and that may put the other susceptible vertebrates under risk of infection.","Albayrak, Harun; Sahindokuyucu, Ismail; Muftuoglu, Bahadir; Tamer, Cuneyt; Kadi, Hamza; Ozan, Emre; Yilmaz, Ozge; Kilic, Hamza; Kurucay, Hanne Nur; Coven, Fethiye; Gumusova, Semra; Yazici, Zafer; Elhag, Ahmed Eisa",Veterinary medicine and science,395,1

However, conventional nucleic acid analysis has to be carried out in laboratories because of requiring expensive instruments and trained personnel. If people could do nucleic acid detection at home by themselves, the application of nucleic acid detection would be greatly accelerated. We herein reported a polypropylene (PP) bag-based method for convenient detection of nucleic acids in the oil-sealed space. The PP bag has three chambers which are responsible for lysis, washing and amplification/detection, respectively. After adding sample, nucleic acids are adsorbed on magnetic particles (MPs) and moved into these three chambers successively through immiscible oil channel by an external magnet. Combined with isothermal amplification, the PP bag can be incubated in a water bath or milk warmer and acted as a reaction tube. With highly specific CRISPR technology, Salmonella typhimurium (St) and SARS-CoV-2 can be visually detected in these PP bags within 1 h, indicating its potential household application. To further improve the reliability of nucleic acid testing at home, a logic decision method is introduced by detecting both target and endogenous reference gene. Positive/negative/invalid detection result can be obtained by chronologically adding the CRISPR reagents of target and endogenous reference gene. We anticipate that this PP bag can provide a novel toolkit for nucleic acid detection in people's daily life.","Wu, Hui; Chen, Yanju; Shi, Ya; Wang, Liu; Zhang, Mengyao; Wu, Jian; Chen, Huan",Biosensors & bioelectronics,395,1

This interaction contributes to the immunosuppressive bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, ultimately leading to reduced effector cell function. PD-L1 is overexpressed in MMBM and is associated with the resistance to immune-based approaches for treating MM. Ruxolitinib (RUX), an inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases, is approved for myeloproliferative diseases. We investigated the effects of RUX alone or in combination with anti-MM agents on the expression of PD-L1 and T-cell cytotoxicity in MM. We showed that the expression of the PD-L1 gene was markedly increased in BM mononuclear cells from patients with MM with progressive disease versus those in complete remission. Furthermore, RUX treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of PD-L1 gene expression in the MM tumour cells cultured alone or co-cultured with stromal cells compared with untreated cells. The results also demonstrated that RUX increased MM cell apoptosis in the presence of interleukin-2-stimulated T cells to a similar degree as the treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. In summary, these results indicate that RUX can block PD-L1 expression resulting in augmentation of anti-MM effects of T cells.","Chen, Haiming; Li, Mingjie; Ng, Nicole; Yu, Erin; Bujarski, Sean; Yin, Zhengyi; Wen, Mingxiang; Hekmati, Tara; Field, Dylan; Wang, Jasper; Nassir, Isabella; Yu, Janna; Huang, Justin; Daniely, David; Wang, Cathy S; Xu, Ning; Spektor, Tanya M; Berenson, James R",British journal of haematology,395,24

To meet the demand in our institution, our surge plan included rapid mobilization of a novel continuous renal replacement treatment (CRRT) machine named SAMI. The SAMI is a push-pull filtration enhanced dialysis machine that can conjugate extremely high single-pass solute removal efficiency with very precise fluid balance control. MATERIAL AND METHODS Machine assembly was conducted on-site by local biomedical engineers with remote assistance by the vendor. One 3-h virtual training session of 3 dialysis nurses was conducted before SAMI deployment. The SAMI was deployed in prolonged intermittent replacement therapy (PIRRT) mode to maximize patients covered per machine per day. Live on-demand vendor support was provided to troubleshoot any issues for the first few cases. After 4 weeks of the SAMI implementation, data on treatments with the SAMI were collected, and a questionnaire was provided to the nurse trainees to assess device usability. RESULTS On-site installation of the SAMI was accomplished with remote assistance. Delivery of remote training was successfully achieved. 23 PIRRT treatments were conducted in 10 patients. 7/10 of patients had CO-VID-19. The median PIRRT dose was 50 mL/kg/h (IQR [interquartile range] 44 - 62 mL/kg/h), and duration of the treatment was 8 h (IQR 6.3 - 8 h). Solute control was adequate. The user response was favorable to the set of usability questions involving user interface, on-screen instructions, machine setup, troubleshooting, and the ease of moving the machine. CONCLUSION Assembly of the SAMI and training of nurses remotely are possible when access to vendor employees is restricted during states of emergency. The successful deployment of the SAMI in our institution during the pandemic with only 3-h virtual training supports that operating the SAMI is simple and safe.","Yessayan, Lenar T; Heung, Michael; Girard, Francine A; Shaikhouni, Salma; Szamosfalvi, Balazs",Blood purification,395,1

Hyper- and hypovolaemia may contribute to these complications. We hypothesized that goal-directed haemodynamic management based on oesophageal Doppler monitoring would reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in a randomized clinical parallel-arm trial. Methods One hundred patients scheduled for thoracic surgery were randomly assigned to either standard haemodynamic management (control group) or goal-directed therapy (GDT group) guided by an oesophageal Doppler monitoring-based algorithm. The primary endpoint was postoperative pulmonary complications, including spirometry. Secondary endpoints included haemodynamic variables, renal, cardiac, and neurological complications, and length of hospital stay. The investigator assessing outcomes was blinded to group assignment. Results Forty-eight subjects of each group were analysed. Compared to the control group, fewer subjects in the GDT group developed postoperative pulmonary complications (6 vs. 15 patients; P = 0.047), while spirometry did not differ between groups. Compared to the control group, patients of the GDT group showed higher cardiac index (2.9 vs. 2.1 [l min - 1 m - 2 ]; P < 0.001) and stroke volume index (43 vs. 34 [ml m 2 ]; P < 0.001) during surgery.

RESULTS Eight cadaveric studies and three clinical studies were included for review. All studies reported displacement in the coronal plane, four studies reported in the sagittal plane, and one reported findings in the rotational plane. Four cadaveric studies had a similar experimental set up and the weighted mean associated with instability in the coronal plane could be calculated and was 2.9 mm at the anterior portion of the distal tibiofibular joint and 3.4 mm at the posterior portion. Syndesmotic instability in the sagittal plane is less extensively studied, however available data from a cadaveric study suggests thresholds of 2.2 mm of posterior fibular translation when performing an anterior to posterior hook test and 2.6 mm of anterior fibular translation when performing a posterior to anterior hook test. CONCLUSIONS The results have concluded that the commonly used 2.0 mm threshold value of distal tibiofibular diastasis may lead to overtreatment of syndesmotic instability, and that using threshold values of 2.9 mm measured at the anterior portion of the incisura and 3.4 mm at the posterior portion may represent better cut off values. Given the ready availability of 3 mm probes among standard arthroscopic instrumentation, at the very least surgeons should use 3 mm in lieu of 2 mm probes intraoperatively.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of RFA and APC in the treatment of GAVE. MATERIALS AND METHODS Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases along with major gastroenterology annual meetings were performed through March 2017. Measured outcomes for comparative effectiveness and safety including improvement in hemoglobin levels, transfusion dependence, number of treatment sessions, complications, follow-up, and author-reported endoscopic success were compared among RFA and APC studies. RESULTS In total, 24 studies (n=508) involving APC and 9 studies (n=104) on RFA were included. Mean age of patients included was comparable in both groups (65.33±7.80 y for APC vs. 66.96±6.23 y for RFA; P=0.98). Pooled mean follow-up was significantly longer for APC compared with RFA (19.52±13.11 vs. 7.43±3.72 mo; P<0.001). In total, 47% of RFA patients were refractory to previous treatment with APC. RFA required fewer mean treatment sessions compared with APC (2.10 vs. 3.39, respectively; P<0.001). RFA resulted in fewer and less severe complications as compared with APC (1.92% vs. 5.12%, respectively; P<0.001). Although the reported endoscopic success was better with RFA compared with APC (97% vs. 66%; P<0.001), the posttreatment pooled hemoglobin increase and reduction in transfusion dependence was higher for APC compared with RFA [weighted mean difference 3.10 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 2.92-3.28) vs. 1.95 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.26); P<0.001; and 88% vs. 66%; P<0.001, for APC and RFA, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS There is limited long-term data on RFA for GAVE; however, available evidence suggests RFA has a comparable efficacy and tolerability compared with APC. In addition, RFA seems to be effective for APC-refractory GAVE patients. Future controlled trials are needed to directly compare treatment efficacy, long-term durability, safety, and cost-effectiveness between these interventions.","McCarty, Thomas R; Rustagi, Tarun",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,395,1

In 2018, the first United Nations high level meeting (UNHLM) on tuberculosis, declared DR-TB a global public health priority. Bold country targets were established for 2018-2022. This study reviews the DR-TB situation in 2018 and the UNHLM targets accomplishments in the 10 world high burden countries (HBCs). METHODS Ecological descriptive analysis of the 10 DR-TB HBCs (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation, and South Africa) that share 70% of the global DR-TB burden; complemented by a cascade of care analysis and a survey gathering additional information on key advances and setbacks 2 years post the UNHLM declaration. RESULTS Most countries are showing historical advances and being on track for the 2018 and 2019 targets. However, according to the cascade of care, no country is capable of providing effective care for 50% of the estimated patients. Increasing levels of fluoroquinolone resistance and access to timely susceptibility testing can jeopardize ongoing adoption of shorter, all-oral treatment regimens. The programmatic management of DR-TB in children remains minimal. Achievements for 2020 and beyond might be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a global risk of recoil in DR-TB care with long-term consequences in terms of deaths, suffering and wider antimicrobial resistant transmission. Investment to support DR-TB services is more important now than ever to meet the aspirations of the UNHLM declaration.","Monedero-Recuero, Ignacio; Gegia, Medea; Wares, Douglas Fraser; S Chadha, Sarabjit; Mirzayev, Fuad",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,395,16

The objectives of this study were to investigate the use of peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) against KSHV early lytic genes and to assess their efficacy in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice against PEL engraftment. PPMOs are short, single-stranded DNA analogues that contain a backbone of morpholine rings and phosphorodiamidate linkages and have high delivery efficiency into cells. METHODS PEL cells were treated with PPMOs against viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) and expression of vIRF-1 was analysed. PPMOs against vIRF-1 and viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) were evaluated against PEL cell engraftment in SCID mice. The PPMOs were incubated with BCBL-1 cells and then introduced into the peritoneal cavities of SCID mice, followed by 9 more doses of PPMOs administered at 2-day intervals. At weeks 3 and 9 after BCBL-1 delivery, peritoneal lavage was collected and the ratio of PEL cells among total cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS Treatment of PEL cells with PPMOs against vIRF-1 led to a reduction of vIRF-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction of vIRF-1 expression resulted in higher levels of cellular interferon regulatory factor 3 and of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. SCID mice receiving a PPMO against vIL-6 had no engraftment of PEL cells and remained healthy throughout the 120-day study. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that PPMOs can be effective antiviral agents against KSHV. Blocking the expression of early lytic genes might be beneficial for the control of KSHV-associated malignant diseases.","Zhang, Yan-Jin; Patel, Deendayal; Nan, Yuchen; Fan, Sumin",Antiviral therapy,395,16

DESIGN A qualitative interview study. METHODS The study was conducted between September 2019 and March 2020. Expert nurses were asked to think aloud about 20 patient problems in nursing. A directed content analysis approach including quantitative data processing was used to analyse the transcribed data. RESULTS Through the analysis of 3912 statements, scripts were identified and a nursing script model is proposed; the medical illness script, including enabling conditions, fault and consequences, is extended with management, boundary, impact, occurrence and explicative statements. Nurses often used explicative statements when pathophysiological causes are absent or unknown. To explore the applicability of Illness script theory we analysed scripts' richness and maturity with descriptive statistics. Expert nurses, like medical experts, had rich knowledge of consequences, explicative statements and management of familiar patient problems. CONCLUSION The knowledge of expert nurses about patient problems can be described in scripts; the components of medical illness scripts are also relevant in nursing. We propose to extend the original illness script concept with management, explicative statements, boundary, impact and occurrence, to enlarge the applicability of illness scripts in the nursing domain. IMPACT Illness scripts guide clinical reasoning in patient care. Insights into illness scripts of nursing experts is a necessary first step to develop goals or guidelines for student nurses' development of clinical reasoning. It might lay the groundwork for future educational strategies.","Vreugdenhil, Jettie; Döpp, Donna; Custers, Eugène J F M; Reinders, Marcel E; Dobber, Jos; Kusukar, Rashmi A",Journal of advanced nursing,395,8

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification mechanism and a novel research target. Thus, exploring the relationship between methylation-driven genes and KIRC prognosis is important. The methylation profile, methylation-driven genes, and methylation characteristics in KIRC was revealed through the integration of KIRC methylation, RNA-seq, and clinical information data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The Lasso regression was used to establish a prognosis model on the basis of methylation-driven genes. Then, a trans-omics prognostic nomogram was constructed and evaluated by combining clinical information and methylated prognosis model. A total of 242 methylation-driven genes were identified. The Gene Ontology terms of these methylation-driven genes mainly clustered in the activation, adhesion, and proliferation of immune cells. The methylation prognosis prediction model that was established using the Lasso regression included four genes in the methylation data, namely, FOXI2, USP44, EVI2A, and TRIP13. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 0.810, 0.824, and 0.799, respectively, in the training group and 0.794, 0.752, and 0.731, respectively, in the testing group. An easy trans-omics nomogram was successfully established. The C-indices of the nomogram in the training and the testing groups were 0.8015 and 0.8389, respectively. This study revealed the overall perspective of methylation-driven genes in KIRC and can help in the evaluation of the prognosis of KIRC patients and provide new clues for further study.","Tang, Weihao; Cao, Yiling; Ma, Xiaoke",Bioscience reports,395,16

METHODS According to the fifth and sixth editions of the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, we carried out the case analysis and infectious disease investigation and research on the confirmed and suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the second-floor ward of the hospital from January 28th, 2020, to February 26th, 2020. RESULTS From January 28th, 2020 to February 26th, 2020, 83 patients were admitted, 40 were cured, and 7 died. Before February 13th, 69 patients were admitted, including 22 confirmed patients and 47 suspected patients. After February 13th, the data of newly hospitalized suspected patients decreased to 2 people. The average time from onset to diagnosis was 5.38 days. About 57.1% of the confirmed patients were isolated at home before admission, and 53.2% of the suspected patients were isolated by hospital observation before admission.

METHODS A total of 122 blebs in 270 IAs selected for surgery were studied using patient-specific vascular reconstructions from 3D angiographic images. Bleb geometry, location on the aneurysm, and frequency of occurrence in aneurysms at different locations were analyzed. Associations between gender, age, smoking, hypertension, hormone therapy, dental infection, and presence of blebs were investigated. RESULTS Of all aneurysms with blebs, 77% had a single bleb and 23% had multiple blebs. Only 6% of blebs were at the neck, while 46% were in the body and 48% in the dome. Aneurysms with blebs were larger (p<0.0001), more elongated (p=0.0002), and with wider necks than aneurysms without blebs. Bleb presence was associated with dental infection (p=0.0426) and negatively associated with hormone therapy (p=0.0426) in women. Anterior and posterior communicating arteries had larger percentages of aneurysms with blebs than internal carotid arteries. Patients with a history of hypertension tended to have a larger percentage of aneurysms with blebs. However, these trends did not reach significance in this sample. CONCLUSIONS Blebs are common in IAs, and most aneurysms harboring blebs have a single bleb. Blebs in the aneurysm neck are rare, but they are equally common in the body and dome. The presence of blebs in IAs was associated with dental infection, and negatively associated with hormone replacement therapy.","Salimi Ashkezari, Seyedeh Fatemeh; Detmer, Felicitas J; Mut, Fernando; Chung, Bong Jae; Yu, Alexander K; Stapleton, Christopher J; See, Alfred P; Amin-Hanjani, Sepideh; Charbel, Fady T; Rezai Jahromi, Behnam; Niemelä, Mika; Frösen, Juhana; Zhou, Ji; Maiti, Spandan; Robertson, Anne M; Cebral, Juan R",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,395,1

METHODS Clinical and radiologic data from consecutive stroke patients with large anterior circulation infarcts involving the pMCA were analyzed. Stroke subtypes were categorized according to Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria. Neurologic deficits were assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and vessel recanalization was determined using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale at the end of SER. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 or lesser. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with a median age of 66 years were included. Of those, 24 received prior systemic tissue plasminogen activator and 33 received primary SER. Atrial fibrillation was more common in patients who underwent SER but there were no other between-group differences in baseline variables, procedure-related variables, or outcome parameters. Six patients died and 27 patients achieved an mRS of 2 or less at 90 days. Patients who were treated with tPA before SER needed less stentriever passes to recanalize the occluded vessel, but bridging did not impact the chances for either survival or favorable outcome. Age (odds ratio [OR], .92; 95% confidence interval [CI], .85-.98) and NIHSS score (OR, .12; 95% CI, .02-.78) were the only variables associated with outcome on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Primary SER and bridging resulted in equally high survival and good outcome rates. Our results suggest that the benefits of primary SER in such critically ill patients may bypass the need for bridging therapy and merit further study.","Leker, Ronen R; Pikis, Stelios; Gomori, John M; Cohen, Jose E",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,395,17

It has been suggested that positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) may have a prognostic value and help to identify patients at risk of progression. [18F]fluoro-3'-deoxy-3'-L-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) has been recently developed as a PET proliferation tracer. At present, there are no studies investigating its role in GEP. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the value of 18F-FLT-PET for the evaluation of GEP. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients with biopsy-proven locally advanced or metastasized, well-differentiated GEP neuroendocrine tumours were prospectively enrolled and scheduled for 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT-PET. Images were compared with other conventional diagnostic procedures, namely computed tomography, ultrasound, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and with clinical and diagnostic follow-up. RESULTS Evaluation criteria were interpreted in terms of assumed presence of tumoral tissue. According to the patient's status, FDG was positive in five out of the seven patients with stable disease and in two out of the three patients with progressive disease. No positive case was identified by 18F-FLT in either the primary or the metastatic tumour site, whatever the status of patients, and this was probably a reflection of the slow proliferation rate of tumours. CONCLUSION These preliminary data suggest that 18F-FLT-PET is not a suitable tracer for the evaluation of advanced well-differentiated GEP tumours. FDG showed good diagnostic performance but does not help to identify patients at risk of progression.","Giammarile, Francesco; Billotey, Claire; Lombard-Bohas, Catherine; Le Bars, Didier; Bournaud, Claire; Masson, Sandrine; Walter, Thomas; Houzard, Claire; Scoazec, Jean-Yves; Hervieu, Valérie; Vuillez, Jean-Philippe; Cornu, Catherine; Janier, Marc; Borson-Chazot, Françoise",Nuclear medicine communications,395,16

Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social distancing and confinement measures with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far too many cities around the world, rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateaulike states have appeared, where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model also describes the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","Santana-Cibrian, Mario; Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel A; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,395,24

There has been inadequate attention to the delivery of behavioural interventions to younger children (5-11 years old). Objective Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of behavioural interventions for children aged 5-11 years. Data sources We searched five databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library, from January 2005 to August 2019. Study selection The inclusion criteria were (1) children aged 5-11, (2) cognitive and/or behavioural interventions, (3) randomised controlled trials and (4) 2005 onward. Two researchers independently identified studies for inclusion. Data extraction Two researchers independently extracted data from eligible papers. Results The search identified 10 541 papers. We extracted information on 117 interventions (from 152 papers). Many of the interventions were categorised as complex. This was particularly true for clinical populations; 78.7% were delivered to both the child and parent, and 33.9% took place across multiple settings, typically health and school settings. Most (70.9%) were 'First Wave' (behavioural) interventions, and few (4.3%) were 'Third Wave' (characterised by metacognition, acceptance and mindfulness). Thirty-nine per cent used interactive techniques (play, arts, story and/or games). Purely digital and paper-based interventions were rare, but around a third used these tools as supplements to face-face delivery. There were differences in interventions for younger (5-7 years) and older (8-11 years) children. Conclusions Interventions designed and delivered to children should be developmentally sensitive. This review highlights characteristics of interventions delivered to children 5-11 years old: the involvement of the child's parent, using behavioural (rather than cognitive) modalities, using interactive techniques and some interventions were delivered across multiple settings.","Brigden, Amberly; Parslow, Roxanne Morin; Linney, Catherine; Higson-Sweeney, Nina; Read, Rebecca; Loades, Maria; Davies, Anna; Stoll, Sarah; Beasant, Lucy; Morris, Richard; Ye, Siyan; Crawley, Esther",BMJ paediatrics open,395,31

A comparative analysis of both forms of Mpro was carried out to elucidate the binding site architectural differences in the presence and absence of '13b'. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the presence of '13b' enhances the stability of Mpro than the unbound APO form. The N- and C- terminals of both the protomers stabilize each other, and making it's interface essential for the active form of Mpro. In comparison to monomer, the relatively high affinity of '13b' is gained in dimer pocket due to the high stability of the pocket by the interaction of S1 residue of chain B with residues F140, E166 and H172 of chain A, which is absent in monomer. The comprehensive essential dynamics, protein structure network analysis and thermodynamic profiling highlight the hot-spots, pivotal in molecular recognition process at protein-ligand and protein-protein interaction levels, cross-validated through computational alanine scanning study. A comparative description of '13b' binding mechanism in both forms illustrates valuable insights into the inhibition mechanism and the selection of critical residues suitable for the structure-based approaches for the identification of more potent Mpro inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/ MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95%CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, 6 studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/ M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95%CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49AU/mL (range: 7.25AU/mL-140.32AU/mL) and 3.79AU/mL (range: 0.16AU/mL-45.83AU/mL), p = 0.0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

In her view, a central problem is that the definition of pandemics is based solely on disease transmission across several countries, and not on spread and severity together, which conflates two very different situations: emergency and nonemergency disease outbreaks. A greater emphasis on severity, such that pandemics are defined as severe and rapidly spreading infectious disease outbreaks, would make them ""true global health emergencies,"" allowing for priority resource allocation and effective collective actions in emergency response efforts. Sympathetic to the position taken by de Campos, here I highlight some of the challenges in the definition of severity during an infectious disease outbreak.","Undurraga, Eduardo A",Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees,395,19

The North Fork of Clear Creek (NFCC), Colorado, USA was historically impaired by AMD from two major point-source inputs, with some stream segments devoid of aquatic life prior to remediation. In the summer of 2017, the North Clear Creek Water Treatment Plant (NCCWTP) began AMD water treatment. To predict and characterize the biological recovery of NFCC to improvements in water quality, we conducted stream mesocosm and field experiments, as well as biomonitoring of benthic communities using a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) study design. The NFCC stream community responded rapidly to improved water quality. Benthic algal biomass increased at impacted sites and macroinvertebrate surveys showed significant increases in abundance, taxa richness, and emerging adult aquatic insects. However, the dominant taxa colonizing downstream segments of NFCC differed considerably from those predicted based on previous field and experimental results. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is the result of differences in metal exposure regimes observed between our field and mesocosm approaches (i.e., fluctuating vs stable), colonization attributes (i.e., open vs closed system), and spatiotemporal differences in metal sensitivity due to macroinvertebrate phenology. We expect continued biological recovery in NFCC, but habitat impairment and residual sources of metals will continue to impair aquatic life until those stressors abate. Applying a combination of controlled experimental and BACI field approaches to predict and evaluate AMD-remediation projects in the future will improve the ability to understand the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms influencing stream recovery.","Kotalik, Christopher J; Cadmus, Pete; Clements, William H",The Science of the total environment,395,1

This systematic review examined the effectiveness or worth of methods used to engage children and young people with long-term conditions in their consultations. Searches were undertaken in October 2016 in eight databases and of the grey literature. Two reviewers independently screened the results, extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies using a validated and reliable checklist. A narrative synthesis of mixed method data was undertaken. Twelve studies were included in the review. Interventions used to engage children and young people mainly focused on face-to-face outpatient consultations, with an emphasis on diabetes and asthma. Most of the interventions focused on either improving health professionals' communication skills or encouraging children's and young people's engagement through providing condition-related information or a structured way to be included in consultations. Fewer interventions were child-led or directed towards developing children's and young people's skills to become key reporters of their condition. This review has demonstrated that interventions targeted at children and young people with long-term conditions can improve their levels of engagement in consultations.

METHODS The redesigned curriculum included a structured project timeline, resident research in progress meetings, faculty mentorship, scholarly skills workshops, and mentored journal clubs. We conducted a curriculum evaluation via surveys of residents prior to implementation and after years 1 and 2, measuring satisfaction with the scholarly environment and opportunities, and confidence and participation in specific scholarly activities using Likert scales from 1 (least confidence) to 5. RESULTS Compared to baseline (n=28), after 2 years (n=27) of the curriculum, residents reported increased mean confidence in critical appraisal of scientific articles (2.6±1.1 to 3.3±0.7, P=.007), carrying out a scholarly project (2.5±0.8 to 3.4±1.0, P=.005), and writing an abstract (3.0±0.8 to 3.8±0.7, P=.002).

Both viruses infect the respiratory tract, show similar symptoms, and use surface proteins to infect the host. Influenza requires hemagglutinin and neuraminidase to infect, whereas SARS-CoV-2 uses protein S. Both viruses depend on a viral RNA polymerase to express their proteins, but only SARS-CoV-2 has a proofreading mechanism, which results in a low mutation rate compared to influenza. E1KC4 and camostat mesylate are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, achieving an effect similar to oseltamivir. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate, nucleoside analogs have been developed (such as EIDD-2801), which insert lethal mutations in the viral RNA. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate suggests that a vaccine, as well as the immunity developed in recovered patients, could provide long-lasting protection compared to vaccines against influenza, which are rendered obsolete as the virus mutates.","Manzanares-Meza, Laura D; Medina-Contreras, Oscar",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,395,1

However, reasons driving this behavior are unclear. In this study, we examined barriers to and facilitators of absenteeism during the influenza season. DESIGN Cross-sectional mixed methods study. SETTING Ambulatory and inpatient settings in a large, tertiary-care healthcare system. METHODS An anonymous electronic survey was sent to HCWs between June 11 and July 13, 2018, asking participants to self-report influenza-like illness (ie, ILI symptoms of fever, chills, cough, or sore throat) during the 2017-2018 influenza season. We conducted a logistical regression analysis to identify factors associated with absenteeism. RESULTS Of 14,250 HCWs, 17% responded to the survey. Although 1,180 respondents (51%) reported symptoms of ILI, 575 (43%) did not stay home while ill. The most commonly perceived barriers to ILI absenteeism included being understaffed (odds ratio [OR], 1.78; P = .04), unable to find a replacement for work (OR, 2.26; P = .03), desiring not to use time off (OR, 2.25; P = .003), and paid by the hour or unable to afford being absent (OR, 2.05; P = .02). Common perceived facilitators of absenteeism included support from coworkers and management, clearer policy, better sick days availability, and lower perceived threat of disciplinary action. CONCLUSIONS Reporting to work with ILI symptoms is common among HCWs. Most barriers and facilitators are related to systems. Addressing system factors, such as policies regarding sick days and sick leave and ensuring adequate backup staffing, is likely to facilitate absenteeism among ill HCWs.","Hoang Johnson, Diep; Osman, Fauzia; Bean, Jero; Stevens, Linda; Shirley, Daniel; Keating, Julie A; Johnson, Shabvon; Safdar, Nasia",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,395,11

In the central nervous system (CNS), LTP has been recorded at numerous synapses and is a prime candidate mechanism associating activity-dependent plasticity with learning and memory. LTP involves long-lasting increase in synaptic strength with various underlying mechanisms. In the CNS, the predominant type of LTP is believed to be dependent on activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is highly calcium-permeable. However, various forms of NMDAR-independent LTP have been identified in diverse areas of the nervous system. The NMDAR-independent LTP may require activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) or ionotropic receptors other than NMDAR such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor or calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR). In this review, NMDAR-independent LTP of various areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems are discussed.","Alkadhi, Karim A",Progress in neurobiology,395,0

However, in general, PPIs display exposed binding pockets at the interface, and as such, have been largely unexploited for therapeutic interventions with low-molecular weight compounds. Here, we used docking and various rescoring strategies in an attempt to recover PPI inhibitors from a set of active and inactive molecules for 11 targets collected in ChEMBL and PubChem. Our focus is on the screening power of the various developed protocols and on using fast approaches so as to be able to apply such a strategy to the screening of ultralarge libraries in the future. First, we docked compounds into each target using the fast ""pscreen"" mode of the structure-based virtual screening (VS) package Surflex. Subsequently, the docking poses were postprocessed to derive a set of 3D topological descriptors: (i) shape similarity and (ii) interaction fingerprint similarity with a co-crystallized inhibitor, (iii) solvent-accessible surface area, and (iv) extent of deviation from the geometric center of a reference inhibitor. The derivatized descriptors, together with descriptor-scaled scoring functions, were utilized to investigate possible impacts on VS performance metrics. Moreover, four standalone scoring functions, RF-Score-VS (machine-learning), DLIGAND2 (knowledge-based), Vinardo (empirical), and X-SCORE (empirical), were employed to rescore the PPI compounds. Collectively, the results indicate that the topological scoring algorithms could be valuable both at a global level, with up to 79% increase in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for some targets, and in early stages, with up to a 4-fold increase in enrichment factors at 1% of the screened collections. Outstandingly, DLIGAND2 emerged as the best scoring function on this data set, outperforming all rescoring techniques in terms of VS metrics. The described methodology could help in the rational design of small-molecule PPI inhibitors and has direct applications in many therapeutic areas, including cancer, CNS, and infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Singh, Natesh; Chaput, Ludovic; Villoutreix, Bruno O",Journal of chemical information and modeling,395,1

Radon is a natural gas with radioactive properties, which can have a hermetic effect when used in small doses. Radon was used to activate antioxidant mechanisms in rats, which resulted an anxiolytic effect and positively enhanced the effect of balneotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS To study the effect of radon in balneotherapy, groups of experimental animals (rats) were exposed to three different treatments. The radon-containing waters of Tskaltubo spring were inhaled in one group and 5 after taking the water in another group. Saline was used for inhalation in animals of the saline group. In animals of the control and sham control groups, inhalation was not used. To assess the anxiolytic effect of radon inhalation, the anxiety was induced and behavioral tests were performed (the open field and the elevated plus-maze test) after 24 h and 5 days of inhalation procedures. RESULTS The anxiety test results showed that exposure to low doses of radon led to a decrease in the level of anxiety in rats. The data show that the total distance traveled by rats in the open field test after inhalation of radon was significantly greater than that by animals in the sham control and control groups. During the open field and elevated plus-maze tests, rats that had inhaled radon spent more time in the central part of the open field and on the open arms of the maze than did the other groups of rats. In the group of rats that had not inhaled radon, an increase in anxiety was observed. The basis of this reaction was an increase in the glutathione concentration. CONCLUSION Based on our research, it can be concluded that the inhalation of small doses of radon, associated with treatments of waters from the Tskaltubo spring, activated the antioxidant systems of the body and enhanced the positive effect of balneotherapy. Clinically, this is expressed as a decrease in anxiety. Inhalation of small doses of radon activated antioxidant processes in the brain, causing an increase in glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio in the brain.","Dondoladze, Khatuna; Nikolaishvili, Marina; Zurabashvili, David",International journal of radiation biology,395,1

Study Selection English-language studies using qSOFA for prediction of mortality (in-hospital, 28-day, or 30-day) in adult patients with suspected infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), emergency department (ED), or hospital wards. Data Extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standard criteria. Data Synthesis Thirty-eight studies were included (n = 385 333). qSOFA was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 60.8% (95% CI, 51.4% to 69.4%) and a pooled specificity of 72.0% (CI, 63.4% to 79.2%) for mortality. The SIRS criteria were associated with a pooled sensitivity of 88.1% (CI, 82.3% to 92.1%) and a pooled specificity of 25.8% (CI, 17.1% to 36.9%). The pooled sensitivity of qSOFA was higher in the ICU population (87.2% [CI, 75.8% to 93.7%]) than the non-ICU population (51.2% [CI, 43.6% to 58.7%]). The pooled specificity of qSOFA was higher in the non-ICU population (79.6% [CI, 73.3% to 84.7%]) than the ICU population (33.3% [CI, 23.8% to 44.4%]). Limitation Potential risk of bias in included studies due to qSOFA interpretation and patient selection. Conclusion qSOFA had poor sensitivity and moderate specificity for short-term mortality. The SIRS criteria had sensitivity superior to that of qSOFA, supporting their use for screening of patients and as a prompt for treatment initiation.

It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries and is responsible for several outbreaks in developed countries. Studying certain parameters of the pathogen, such as the incubation period, provides a better understanding of its pathophysiology and its characteristics within a population. Outbreak investigations and human experimental studies provide an avenue to study these relevant parameters. METHODS In this study, the authors have undertaken a systematic review of outbreak investigation reports and experimental studies, extracted reported data, tested for heterogeneity, identified subgroups of studies with limited evidence of heterogeneity between them and identified factors that may contribute to the distribution of incubation period. Following identification of relevant studies, we extracted both raw and summary incubation data. We tested for heterogeneity by deriving the value of I2 and conducting a KS-test to compare the distribution between studies. We performed a linear regression analysis to identify the factors associated with incubation period and using the resulting p-values from the KS-test, we conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis to classify studies with limited evidence of heterogeneity into subgroups. RESULTS We identified thirteen studies to be included in the review and extracted raw incubation period data from eleven. The value of I2 was 84% and the proportion of KS test p-values that were less than 0.05 was 63.6% indicating high heterogeneity not due to chance. We identified vaccine history and attack rates as factors that may be associated with incubation period, although these were not significant in the multivariable analysis (p-value: 0.1). From the hierarchical clustering analysis, we classified the studies into five subgroups. The mean incubation period of the subgroups ranged from 9.7 days to 21.2 days. Outbreaks reporting cases with previous vaccination history were clustered in a single subgroup and reported the longest incubation period. CONCLUSIONS We identified attack rate and previous vaccination as possible associating factors, however further work involving analyses of individual patient data and developing mathematical models is needed to confirm these as well as examine additional factors that have not been included in our study.","Awofisayo-Okuyelu, Adedoyin; McCarthy, Noel; Mgbakor, Ifunanya; Hall, Ian",BMC infectious diseases,395,1

New research on the role of early life exposures and the ability of chemicals to act via multiple biological pathways, including immunosuppression, inflammation, and endocrine disruption as well as mutagenesis, further supports the potential for chemicals and chemical mixtures to influence disease. Epidemiologic observations, such as higher leukemia incidence in children living near roadways and industrial sources of air pollution, and new in vitro technologies that decode carcinogenesis at the molecular level, illustrate the diverse evidence that primary prevention of some cancers may be achieved by reducing harmful chemical exposures. The path forward requires cross-disciplinary approaches, increased environmental research investment, system-wide collaboration to develop safer economic alternatives, and community engagement to support evidence-informed action.

The genome copies of M13 and T7 phages were quantified by TaqMan or SYBR Green qPCR referenced against M13 and T7 DNA standard curves of known concentrations. TaqMan qPCR was capable of quantifying M13 and T7 phage DNA simultaneously with a detection range of 2.75*101-2.75*108genome copies(gc)/μL and 2.66*101-2.66*108 genome copies(gc)/μL respectively. TaqMan qPCR demonstrated an efficient amplification efficiency (Es) of 0.97 and 0.90 for M13 and T7 phage DNA, respectively. SYBR Green qPCR was ten-fold more sensitive than TaqMan qPCR, able to quantify 2.75-2.75*107gc/μL and 2.66*101-2.66*107gc/μL of M13 and T7 phage DNA, with an amplification efficiency Es of 1.06 and 0.78, respectively. Due to its superior sensitivity, SYBR Green qPCR was used to enumerate M13 and T7 phage display clones selected against a cell line, and quantified titers demonstrated accuracy comparable to titers from traditional double-layer plaque assay. Compared to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, both qPCR methods exhibited increased detection sensitivity and reproducibility. These qPCR methods are reproducible, sensitive, and time-saving to determine their titers and to quantify a large number of phage samples individually or simultaneously, thus avoiding the need for time-intensive double-layer plaque assay. These findings highlight the attractiveness of qPCR for phage enumeration for applications ranging from selection to next-generation sequencing (NGS).","Peng, Xiujuan; Nguyen, Alex; Ghosh, Debadyuti",Journal of virological methods,395,20

METHODS Before and after a modified Biering-Sorensen fatigue protocol for the back extensors, countermovement (CMJ) and lateral jumps (LJ) were performed on a force plate under stable and unstable (balance pad on the force plate) conditions. Performance measures for LJ (contact time) and CMJ height and leg and trunk muscles EMG activity were tested in 14 male experienced jumpers during 2 time intervals for CMJ (braking phase, push-off phase) and 5 intervals for LJ (-30 to 0, 0-30, 30-60, 60-90, and 90-120 ms) in non-fatigued and fatigued conditions. RESULTS A significant main effect of test (fatigue) (p = 0.007, f = 0.57) was observed for CMJ height. EMG analysis showed a significant fatigue-induced decrease in biceps femoris and gastrocnemius activity with CMJ (p = 0.008, f = 0.58 andp = 0.04, f = 0.422, respectively). LJ contact time was not affected by fatigue or surface interaction. EMG activity was significantly lower in the tibialis anterior with LJ following fatigue (p = 0.05, f = 0.405). A test x surface (p = 0.04, f = 0.438) interaction revealed that the non-fatigued unstable CMJ gastrocnemius EMG activity was lower than the non-fatigued stable condition during the onset-of-force phase. CONCLUSION The findings revealed that fatiguing the trunk negatively impacts CMJ height and muscle activity during the performance of CMJs. However, skilled jumpers are not additionally affected by a moderately unstable surface as compared to a stable surface.","Howard, Joshua; Granacher, Urs; Behm, David G",European journal of applied physiology,395,1

No effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are available clinically. Evidences implicate the involvement of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Herein, artesunate (AS) was discovered to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression and the molecular mechanism was investigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The effect of AS on sepsis-induced immunosuppression was investigated in mice and in vitro. Bioinformatics predicted VDR as a candidate interactor for AS, which was then identified using PCR and immunoblotting. Vdr, Atg16l1, and NF-κB p65 were modified to investigate AS's effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines release, bacterial clearance, and autophagy activities in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. KEY RESULTS AS significantly reduced the mortality of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) -induced sepsis immunosuppression mice challenged with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine release and bacterial clearance to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, AS interacted with VDR, and then inhibiting its nuclear translocation, which influenced ATG16L1 transcription and subsequent autophagy activity. AS inhibited the physical interaction between VDR and NF-κB p65 in lipopolysaccharide tolerant macrophages, and then promoted the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, which activated the transcription of NF-κB p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings provide evidence that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-κB dependent manner, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of AS as a bidirectional immunomodulator.","Shang, Shenglan; Wu, Jiaqi; Li, Xiaoli; Liu, Xin; Li, Pan; Zheng, Chunli; Wang, Yonghua; Liu, Songqing; Zheng, Jiang; Zhou, Hong",British journal of pharmacology,395,26

This study aimed to identify the DTI-related factors with individually computerized interference and analyze the relative implications of decreasing DTI in healthy farmers.It followed 3 computerized experiments:The reaction time of correct releases (CRT) of BT1 in all tasks was measured, and the CRT ratios of DT were divided by the CRT values from CT and MT to obtain the DTI value. CRT during CT and MT was decreased compared to that during DT. The interference by CT (CRT of DT/CRT of MT × 100, CTI) was increased compared to the interference by MT (CRT of DT/CRT of CT×100, MTI). Additionally, comprehensive baseline characteristics, body composition, psycho-cognitive, and physical factors were assessed.Of a total of 54 participants, 16 are males (67.2 ± 8.9 years) and 38 females (62.5 ± 6.6 years). CTI showed significant correlations with age (r = 0.436, P < .001), farming period (r = 0.290, P = .033), score of the Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of CERAD Assessment Packet (r = -0.329, P = .015), CRT of the Go/No-Go test (r = 0.67, P < .001), score of the short physical performance battery (r = -0.304, P = .026), and time of the timed up and go test (r = 0.364, P = .007). Regression analysis showed that the CRT of the Go/No-Go test (β = 0.558, P < .001) was the most explanatory factors for CTI.Based on the individualized DTI values quantified, interference during cognitive task was mostly related to CRT of Go/No-Go test, reflecting the attentional level. These results could suggest strategies for the active attentional training to reduce DTI and passive simplification and modification of lifestyles.","Shin, Dabi; Kang, Eun Kyoung",Medicine,395,24

Nevertheless, there are some concerns that soy can have a negative effect on thyroid function and can alter the levels of thyroid hormones. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the link between soy or soy product consumption and thyroid function via the measurement of thyroid hormone levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken on all randomised controlled trials of studies including soy as an intervention and where free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured. The search included PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and sources for the grey literature. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model, with standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval as summary statistics. A total of 18 articles were suitable for review. The meta-analysis showed no significant changes in fT3 (WMD: 0.027 pmol/L, 95% CI: -0.052, 0.107, p = 0.499; I2: 55.58%), fT4 (WMD: -0.003 pmol/L, 95% CI: -0.018, 0.011, p = 0.656; I2: 87.58%) while an elevation in TSH levels was observed (WMD: 0.248 mIU/L, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.494, p = 0.049; I2: 80.31%) levels with soy supplementation. There was no evidence of publication bias. Soy supplementation has no effect on the thyroid hormones and only very modestly raises TSH levels, the clinical significance, if any, of the rise in TSH is unclear.","Otun, Jemiliat; Sahebkar, Amirhossein; Östlundh, Linda; Atkin, Stephen L; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat",Scientific reports,395,26

Although many studies focus on the effectiveness and safety of systemic antipsoriatic therapies in the general population, their effectiveness in older adults with psoriasis has not been systematically assessed. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of systemic antipsoriatic therapies in patients 65 years or older. Evidence Review A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on November 11, 2019. No date limit was used. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, large case series, and meta-analyses assessing efficacy (or effectiveness) and/or safety of systemic antipsoriatic therapies in patients 65 years or older were included. Findings The initial search yielded 11 096 results, of which 31 unique articles with 39 561 patients were included in analysis. Overall, limited data were available per systemic agent, and overall quality of the included studies on conventional systemic therapies was low. At the end of the induction phase (12-16 weeks after start of treatment), a reduction of 75% in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index was achieved in 49% of 74 methotrexate sodium users 65 years or older, 46% to 52.6% of 178 older cyclosporin users, 27% to 47.8% of 108 older acitretin users, 15.6% to 64% of 256 etanercept users 65 years or older, 66.7% to 93% of 43 infliximab users 65 years or older, 60.7% to 65% of 100 adalimumab users 65 years or older, 56.5% of 46 ustekinumab users 65 years or older, and 86.4% of 67 secukinumab users 65 years or older. Effectiveness of acitretin, etanercept, adalimumab, and secukinumab appeared not to be associated with age; studies regarding other systemic antipsoriatic therapies did not provide age group comparisons. Older age was significantly associated with renal function deterioration in cyclosporin users and with lymphopenia in fumaric acid esters users (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.65-3.55; P < .001). Infections were the most frequently reported adverse event in patients 65 years or older using biologics, but no significant association with age was found. Conclusions and Relevance On the basis of limited available evidence, age alone should not be a limiting factor in psoriasis management. Awareness of comorbidities and concomitant medication use is very important, as well as appropriate dosing and frequent laboratory and clinical monitoring. More real-world evidence and (sub)analyses of prospective cohort studies on the effectiveness and safety of systemic therapies in older adults are critical to optimize personalized, effective, and safe antipsoriatic management in this growing patient group.","van Winden, Marieke E C; van der Schoot, Lara S; van de L'Isle Arias, Mariluz; van Vugt, Lieke J; van den Reek, Juul M P A; van de Kerkhof, Peter C M; de Jong, Elke M G J; Lubeek, Satish F K",JAMA dermatology,395,24

In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil Santamaría, María; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo Rodríguez, Iratxe; Jaureguizar Albondiga-Mayor, Joana; Picaza Gorrochategi, Maitane",Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental,395,1

In this study we examine the efficacy of LSG as a stand-alone operation in the veteran population. METHODS This is a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent LSG as a stand-alone procedure at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs medical center with a minimum 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Of 205 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 71 patients had a sleeve gastrectomy, 40 of whom had the operation performed at least 12 months previously. Thirty-six (90%) were available for 1-year follow-up, with a mean follow-up duration of 22 months (range: 12-42), a mean body mass index of 48.3 kg/m(2), and an 83% male population. Mean percent excess weight loss was 61% at an average of 22 months, with no significant difference between severely obese, morbidly obese, and super obese cohorts. Diabetes remission was seen in 56% of patients, hypertension remission in 51.6%, and obstructive sleep apnea remission in 46.4%, and gastroesophageal reflux disease improved or did not change in 83%. Medication use significantly decreased after surgery. CONCLUSION LSG is safe and effective as a stand-alone bariatric operation in the high-risk veteran population. It is effective in severely obese, morbidly obese, and super obese patients. LSG induces remission or improvement in comorbidities of nearly all patients, translating to a decrease in medication use.","Eisenberg, Dan; Bellatorre, Anna; Bellatorre, Nina",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,395,1

Paediatric services in particular required adjustment, not only for the paediatric patients but also for their carers and the staff looking after them. Strategies were divided into streams, including the impact of COVID-19 on the hospital and the role of RCWMCH in Western Cape Province, communication strategies, adaptation of clinical services at the hospital, specifically with a paediatric-friendly approach, and staff engagement. Interventions utilised: (i) Specific COVID-19 planning was required at a children's hospital, and lessons were learnt from other international children's hospitals. A similar number of patients and staff were infected by the virus (244 patients and 212 staff members by 21 December 2020). (ii) Measures were put in place to assist creation of capacity at metro hospitals' adult services by accepting children with emergency issues directly to RCWMCH, as well as accepting adolescents up to age 18 years. (iii) The communication strategy was improved to include daily engagement with heads of departments/supervisors by earlymorning structured information meetings. There were also changes in the methods of communication with staff using media such as Zoom, MS Teams and WhatsApp. Hospital-wide information and discussion sessions were held both on social platforms and in the form of smallgroup physical meetings with senior hospital administrators (with appropriate distancing). Labour union representatives were purposefully directly engaged to assess concerns. (iv) Clinical services at the hospital were adapted. These included paediatric-friendly services and physical changes to the hospital environment. (v) Staff engagement was particularly important to assist in allaying staff anxiety, developing a staff screening programme, and provision and training in use of personal protective equipment, as well as focusing on staff wellness. In conclusion, visible management and leadership has allowed for flexibility and adaptability to manage clinical services in various contexts. It is important to utilise staff in different roles during a crisis and to consider the different perspectives of people involved in the services. The key to success, that included very early adoption of the above measures, has been hospital staff taking initiative, searching for answers and identifying and implementing solutions, effective communication, and leadership support. These lessons are useful in dealing with second and further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Parbhoo, A N; Numanoglu, A; Argent, A C; Franken, M; Mukosi, M; McCulloch, M I",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,395,24

In a context of restrictions on movement outside the home in both countries, and where alcohol providers are trying to find new ways to reach their customers, this may lead to an intensification of the social and health harms associated with home drinking. By examining the current situation in both Australia and the UK, we argue that heightened risks from home drinking amid COVID-19 bring into sharp focus long-standing weaknesses within licensing systems in both countries: the regulation of off-premise outlets to minimise harms from drinking at home. We call for critical conversations on how licensing systems should be revised to take more responsibility for protecting people from the health and social harms associated with home drinking, both under COVID-19 and in the future.","Reynolds, Joanna; Wilkinson, Claire",Drug and alcohol review,395,19

Participants performed three RST (10-sec maximal sprints with 20-sec recovery until exhaustion) with measurements of power output and V̇O2peak as well as oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the vastus lateralis and prefrontal cortex. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed by femoral nerve stimulation to evoke the vastus lateralis. Tests were conducted with proximal lower limb bilateral vascular occlusion at 0%, 45%, and 60% of resting pulse elimination pressure. Total work decreased with BFR (52.5 ± 22.9% at 45%, 68.6 ± 32.6% at 60%, P < 0.01 compared with 0%) as V̇O2peak (12.6 ± 9.3% at 45%, 18.2 ± 7.2% at 60%, compared with 0%, P < 0.01). Decreased changes in muscle deoxyhemoglobin (∆[HHb]) during sprints were demonstrated at 60% compared to 0% (P < 0.001). Changes in total hemoglobin concentrations (∆[tHb]) increased at both 45% and 60% compared with 0% (P < 0.001). Cerebral ∆[tHb] increased toward exhaustion (P < 0.05). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation level (VAL), and root mean square (RMS)/M-wave ratio decreased at 60% compared with 0% (P < 0.001, all). MVC and VAL decreased between 45% and 60% (P < 0.05, both). The application of BFR during RST induced greater changes in tissue perfusion (via blood volume, ∆[tHb]) suggesting a possible stimulus for vascular blood flow regulation. Additionally, high-intensity sprint exercise with partial ischemia may challenge cerebral blood flow regulation and influence local fatigue development due to protection of cerebral function.","Willis, Sarah J; Alvarez, Laurent; Borrani, Fabio; Millet, Grégoire P",Physiological reports,395,26

Introduction: The COVID-19 Precision Recovery Program (PRP) is a remote patient monitoring (RPM) clinical program that was deployed by a New York health system to perform physiologic and symptomatic monitoring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Methods: The present cross-sectional descriptive study reports retrospective data collected from the PRP during the COVID-19 crisis in New York. Results: One hundred twelve patients were included; mean (standard deviation) age was 49 (17.6) years and 60.7% were female. Most prevalent reported comorbidities were hypertension (36.3%), hypercholesterolemia (26.5%), and diabetes (17.7%). Less than half (44.6%) had a positive polymerase chain reaction COVID test (PCR-test), 33% had an unknown COVID status, and 17.9% had a negative test result. The most commonly reported symptoms included dyspnea (55.4%) and anxiety (55.4%). Anxiety was ranked as the most severe symptom (9.8%), followed by difficulty concentrating (4.5%). Symptom presentation did not significantly differ based on PCR-test status. Discussion: RPM can be a valuable tool for delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Considering similarities in symptom presentation between PCR-test statuses, access to COVID-related clinical care should not be based on PCR-test results. Conclusions: RPM has strong potential to assist in the effective management of suspected COVID-19 patients.","Tabacof, Laura; Kellner, Christopher; Breyman, Erica; Dewil, Sophie; Braren, Stephen; Nasr, Leila; Tosto, Jenna; Cortes, Mar; Putrino, David",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,395,24

In the United States, the gaps in the mental health care system struggle to meet the needs of vulnerable populations and have caused a major public health problem. We aim to increase the awareness of health care professionals, psychiatrists, and policy makers regarding failures and gaps in the mental health care system and suggest new ideas to overcome the growing burden of mental disorders. METHOD We utilized data from PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, Embase and Clinicaltrials.gov databases to analyze available information on the US mental health system. We included any relevant articles addressing the prevalence of mental diseases, disparities and the gaps for an accessible and affordable mental health system, as well as the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic. KEYWORDS 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'mental health', 'Health, Mental' were used. RESULTS Following scoping review of several studies we noticed that while prevalence of mental health problems in the US varies between states and socio-demographic groups, it is among the top 10 causes of premature death and disability in adults. We noticed that mental health problems are currently one of the costliest public health issues in the healthcare system. Tracking Poll from one of the studies in our scoping review suggested that financial inequities are magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic and that psychological distress was substantially larger among respondents with lower income (33%), Hispanics (28%) and Blacks (26%). Furthermore, in another poll 62% of US population are shown to be anxious due to COVID-19. We observed that the prevalence of reported symptoms of psychological distress among US adults increased when compared to 2018. Common barriers such as failure of accessibility, insufficient funding, insufficient psychiatric beds, limited insurance access and economic burden, clinician shortages, fragmented care, insufficient mental health care policies and insufficient education and awareness about mental illness become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic era. CONCLUSIONS The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is alarming, which affects public health and has made the health care system more vulnerable. Pandemic events not only cause acute negative impact, they also result in long-lasting health problems, isolation and stigma. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens the mental health of the population and its long-term consequences can lead to a secondary pandemic. The outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health emphasize the need for policies and strategies to support and strengthen a concerted effort to address its burden on the US mental health care system. In addition, it magnifies the need for high quality and well-funded research for future pandemics.","Radfar, Amir; Caceres, Maria Mercedes Ferreira; Sosa, Juan Pablo; Filip, Irina",CNS spectrums,395,16

The authors have used this approach for several thoracic surgical procedures. METHODS This prospective study compared 20 cases between standard three-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and the single-incision approach using a standard abdominal SILS system. In both groups, postsurgical analgesia was provided with 15 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% at 3 h intervals via a paravertebral catheter. The hospital length of stay and chest drain duration (in hours) were recorded as well as postoperative pain using an analogic visual pain scale (AVPS). A telephone survey was conducted for all the outpatients. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS This study of 20 procedures included 11 lung biopsies, 6 pneumothorax procedures, 2 mediastinic cystectomies, and 1 catamenial pneumothorax procedure. No statistically significant difference was reported in hospital length of stay or chest drain duration between the two groups. However, postoperative pain at 24 h was significantly less in the SILS group (AVPS, 4.40) than in the VATS group (AVPS, 6.20) (p = 0.035). The SILS group reported two minor surgical wound complications and one catamenial pneumothorax recurrence that did not require drainage. The VATS group reported one case of skin rash with no identifiable cause. CONCLUSIONS The use of the SILS port in thoracic surgery results in less postoperative pain. This is related to the port's protective effect over the periostium and the intercostal nerve, relieving them of direct contact with surgical instruments. However, the findings showed a higher incidence of surgical wound complications with the SILS port, which can be attributed to increased pressure on the skin and soft tissues surrounding the port and to the fact that this same incision was used for chest drain placement, thus increasing the risk for complications.","Mier, José M; Chavarin, Abraham; Izquierdo-Vidal, Cristina; Fibla, Juan J; Molins, Laureano",Surgical endoscopy,395,24

However, dysphagia management varies greatly between units and internationally, and there is currently no consensus, standard intervention or treatment. A review mapping the existing literature on dysphagia treatment is needed. In this paper, the protocol for a scoping review to identify and map dysphagia treatment following ABI is outlined. OBJECTIVE The objective of the scoping review is to systematically map the existing research literature to answer the research question: Which non-surgical, non-pharmacological interventions are used in the treatment of dysphagia in patients with moderate and severe acquired brain injury in the acute and subacute phase? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The methodological framework for the study is based on methodology by Arksey and O'Malley and methodological advancement by Levac et al. We will search electronic databases in June 2019: MEDLINE (Ovid); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library); EMBASE (Ovid); CINAHL (EBSCO); PsycINFO; Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science; OTseeker; Speechbite and PEDro. The search terms will be limited to patients with moderate to severe ABI and dysphagia. Four review authors will independently conduct an initial screening of title and abstract and subsequent full-text review of included studies. Data will be extracted and summarised in diagrammatic or tabular form (numerical summary), and a descriptive format (narrative summary). The strategy for data synthesis entails qualitative methods to categorise the interventions based on the treatment modality and subgroup diagnosis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Scoping the existing literature will provide a foundation for further evaluating and developing our dysphagia treatment and inform future studies assessing the effectiveness of treatments. The review is part of an ongoing expansive research into dysphagia. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.","Eskildsen, Signe Janum; Jakobsen, Daniela; Riberholt, Christian Gunge; Poulsen, Ingrid; Curtis, Derek John",BMJ open,395,1

During the initial surge of patients admitted with COVID-19, there was also a corresponding increase in healthcare workers (HCWs) detected with COVID-19 infection. The latter being isolated, and the large number of staff members that had come into contact with COVID-19 being quarantined from work, placed further strain on the healthcare services. The staff mass screening strategy was a policy decision made by the hospital in response to infection among HCWs, and it aimed to reduce in-hospital transmission (particularly among asymptomatic staff), mitigate workforce depletion due to unnecessary quarantining, and protect the healthcare workforce. In this study, we assessed the detection rate of COVID-19 infection from staff mass testing over a five-week period, and described our experience of adopting this surveillance screening strategy alongside ongoing contact tracing and symptomatic screening strategies. Although it was thought that such periodic staff surveillance might be helpful in protecting the healthcare workforce within a short period, the long-term implications, especially in settings with limited resources, is significant and therefore explored in this paper. Our findings might provide an evidence-based reference for the future planning of an optimal strategy with the least compromise in care for a larger proportion of non-COVID-19 patients amid efforts against COVID-19 in a large non-COVID-designated hospital with hybrid status.","Foo, Diana Hui Ping; King, Teck Long; Lee, Huey Chun; Santhramogan, Priyadarvena; Ganasan, Vijay; Fong, Alan Yean Yip; Ngian, Hie Ung",Hospital practice,395,32

The purpose of this paper is to present our initial experience of laparoscopic percutaneous jejunostomy with unidirectional barbed sutures in esophageal cancer patients and compare it with our early cases using traditional transabdominal sutures. METHODS A total of 118 esophageal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic percutaneous jejunostomy were identified in a single institution in Taiwan from June 2014 to May 2016. The authors' traditional technique consisted of using transabdominal sutures with bolsters to fix a jejunum loop onto the anterior abdominal wall. A novel technique was introduced using intracorporeal suturing with knotless unidirectional barbed monofilament absorbable sutures (V-Loc) to attain a seal around the feeding catheter. A comparison between these two techniques was performed. RESULTS Twenty cases with barbed V-Loc sutures and 98 cases with transabdominal sutures were identified. The V-Loc sutures appeared to reduce peristomal skin ulcers (19.4 vs. 0 %, p = 0.040), postoperative pain scores during the first 24 h (1.8 ± 1.4 vs. 0.9 ± 1.1, p = 0.007) and on postoperative day 2 (1.7 ± 1.4 vs. 1.0 ± 0.8, p = 0.026) when compared to patients receiving transabdominal sutures. The mean suturing time using V-Loc sutures was 22 min (14-60 min). The mean onset to resumption of enteral feeding was 1.8 ± 0.8 days and the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay was 8 ± 5.1 days, both of which were comparable in the two groups. There was no surgical mortality in our series. CONCLUSIONS In the study cohort, the use of knotless unidirectional barbed sutures instead of traditional transabdominal sutures had similar outcomes and appears to be a feasible option for intracorporeal jejunopexy when performing laparoscopic jejunostomy in patients with esophageal cancer.","Yang, Shun-Mao; Hsiao, Wei-Ling; Lin, Jui-Hsiang; Huang, Pei-Ming; Lee, Jang-Ming",Surgical endoscopy,395,1

Until recently, only abscess drainage was possible. Since 2007, removable and repositionable covered metal self-expandable stents (RReCoMSeS) have been used in our hospital to cover leaks. METHODS Patients with postsurgical gastrointestinal leaks treated with RReCoMSeS between January 2007 and March 2010 were retrospectively evaluated and described. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were treated with RReCoMSeS (totally covered Choo/Hanaro and partially covered Endoflex stents). Included patients had anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy (15) and bariatric surgery (11). Overall successful sealing of the leak occurred in 81 % (including multiple procedures). In total 33 RReCoMSeS were used (mean 1.3 stents and 1.7 procedures per patient). Twenty-one of 33 RReCoMSeS succeeded in sealing the leak (64 %). Migration occurred in 24 % RReCoMSeS, and 9 % disintegrated. One stent (3 %) caused a perforation. CONCLUSIONS RReCoMSeS are a safe alternative for treating postsurgical leaks in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In 81 % of patients and with 64 % of the inserted stents, leaks were sealed successfully, with few complications. Fewer stents per patient were needed thanks to their repositionability.

Times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, from symptom onset to first medical visit and from first medical visit to confirmed diagnosis were described and turned into binary variables by the maximally selected rank statistics method. Then, survival analysis, including a log-rank test, Cox regression, and conditional inference tree (CTREE) was conducted, regarding whether patients progressed to a severe disease level during the observational period (assessed as severe pneumonia according to the Chinese Expert Consensus on Clinical Practice for Emergency Severe Pneumonia, admission to an intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation, or death) as the prognosis outcome, the dependent variable. Independent factors included whether the time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was longer than 5 days (the exposure) and other demographic and clinical factors as multivariate adjustments. The clinical characteristics of the patients with different times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis were also compared. Results The medians of the times from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis, from symptom onset to first medical visit, and from first medical visit to confirmed diagnosis were 6, 3, and 2 days.

However, little research has investigated the association between EL, ADHD and comorbid symptoms in preschoolers. This study assessed dimensional EL in preschoolers and its link with ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention) and behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. aggression and anxiety). METHOD One hundred and fifty-four preschoolers aged 3-6 years old were rated on questionnaires by parents. EL was assessed with the index from the Conners Rating Scale-Revised and behavioural and emotional problems with an adapted version of the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions analyses were conducted. RESULTS Higher EL was associated with higher hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, anxiety and aggression problems. After controlling for other behavioural and emotional problems and sociodemographic variables, EL remained associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Emotional lability seems to be a potential marker for ADHD symptoms with internalizing problems in preschoolers and could be a target for diagnosis and early interventions.

STUDY SELECTION We included studies with ten or more hospitalized adults with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other viral pathogens that described the occurrence of acute cardiac injury. This was defined by the original publication authors or by: 1) myocardial ischemia, 2) new cardiac arrhythmia on echocardiogram, or 3) new or worsening heart failure on echocardiogram. DATA EXTRACTION We compared the rates of cardiac injury among patients with respiratory infections with viruses that down-regulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-1, to those with respiratory infections from other influenza viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including Influenza H3N2 and influenza B. DATA SYNTHESIS Of 57 studies including 34,072 patients, acute cardiac injury occurred in 50% (95% CI, 44-57%) of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The overall risk of acute cardiac injury was 21% (95% CI, 18-26%) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. In comparison, 37% (95% CI, 26-49%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p = 0.061) and 12% (95% CI, 7-22%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p < 0.001) experienced a cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS Acute cardiac injury may be associated with whether the virus binds angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Acute cardiac injury occurs in half of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients, but only 12% of patients infected by viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2.","Cheng, Matthew P; Cau, Alessandro; Lee, Todd C; Brodie, Daniel; Slutsky, Arthur; Marshall, John; Murthy, Srin; Lee, Terry; Singer, Joel; Demir, Koray K; Boyd, John; Ohm, Hyejee; Maslove, David; Goffi, Alberto; Bogoch, Isaac I; Sweet, David D; Walley, Keith R; Russell, James A",Critical care medicine,395,31

While MYB fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) frequently is used to confirm the diagnosis of AdCC, the pathognomonic MYB-NFIB fusion is only present in 40% to 70% of cases. Likewise, although MYB RNA overexpression is seen in the vast majority of AdCC regardless of translocation status, MYB IHC has shown suboptimal specificity for this diagnosis. In this study, we sought to determine whether a novel chromogenic RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) platform could directly detect MYB RNA overexpression and offer a rapid diagnostic adjunct for AdCC. We performed MYB RNA ISH on 84 cases of AdCC as well as 128 other salivary tumors and 108 basaloid and sinonasal carcinomas that mimic AdCC. MYB RNA ISH was 92% sensitive for AdCC, including 97% of cases with MYB rearrangement and 83% without MYB rearrangement by FISH. It was also 89% specific for AdCC overall, with 95% specificity among other salivary tumors and 81% specificity in basaloid and sinonasal carcinomas. In contrast, MYB IHC was 94% sensitive but just 54% specific for AdCC. Overall, MYB RNA ISH provides superior sensitivity for the diagnosis of AdCC compared with MYB FISH and superior specificity compared with MYB IHC. This assay could provide a useful tool for rapidly confirming the diagnosis of AdCC in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens.","Rooper, Lisa M; Lombardo, Kara A; Oliai, Bahram R; Ha, Patrick K; Bishop, Justin A",The American journal of surgical pathology,395,22

Obtaining the stress index (SI), however, requires quantitatively analyzing the shape of pressure-time curve with dedicated instruments or a specific ventilator, which may encumber its clinical implementation. We hypothesized that the SI could be qualitatively determined through a visual inspection of ventilator waveforms. METHODS Thirty-six adult subjects undergoing volume controlled ventilation without spontaneous breathing were enrolled. For each subject, 2 trained clinicians visually inspected the pressure-time curve directly from the ventilator screen. They then qualitatively categorized the shape of pressure-time curve as linear, a downward concavity, or an upward concavity at the bedside. We simultaneously recorded airway pressure and flow signals using a dedicated instrument. A quantitative off-line analysis was performed to calculate the SI using specific research software. This quantitative analysis of the SI served as the reference method for classifying the shape of the pressure-time curve (ie, linear, a downward concavity, or an upward concavity). We compared the SI categorized by visual inspection with that by the reference. RESULTS We obtained 200 SI assessments of pressure-time curves, among which 125 (63%) were linear, 55 (27%) were a downward concavity, and 20 (10%) were an upward concavity as determined by the reference method. The overall accuracy of visual inspection and weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) was 93% (88-96%) and 0.88 (0.82-0.94), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity to distinguish a downward concavity from a linear shape were 91% and 98%, respectively. The respective sensitivity and specificity to distinguish an upward concavity from a linear shape were 95% and 95%. CONCLUSIONS Visual inspection of the pressure-time curve on the ventilator screen is a simple and reliable approach to assess SI at the bedside. This simplification may facilitate the implementation of SI in clinical practice to personalize mechanical ventilation.

Here we determined the ability of MIC-1 to detect precancerous lesions and CRC in an asymptomatic cohort from CRC Screening Program. METHODS We screened 2759 subjects with risk factors. Endoscopic and histopathological analyses revealed that 19 and 47 subjects had CRC or precancerous lesions. We randomly selected 24 subjects with normal colonoscopies as healthy controls. We used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of MIC-1 for CRC and precancerous lesions. RESULTS The optimal thresholds of MIC-1 levels with precancerous lesions or CRC were 314.12 pg/mL (sensitivity, 91.50%; specificity, 54.20%) and 357.64 pg/mL (sensitivity, 82.40%; specificity, 70.80%). Moreover, MIC-1 levels distinguished precancerous lesions better than CEA, CA19-9, or CA24-2 (AUC: 0.760 vs 0.529, 0.624, and 0.585) or CRC (AUCs: 0.821 vs 0.743, 0.657, and 0.688) from the healthy controls. The combination of MIC-1, CEA, CA19-9 and CA24-2 showed the highest in sensitivity and specificity for CRC diagnosis (sensitivity, 94.10%; specificity, 87.50%).

We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of LIHR in KP transplant recipients performed over a period of 4 years and compared the results with LIHR in non-transplant patients during the same period. A total of 36 transplant patients were compared with 62 nontransplant patients. There were five patients converted to the open procedure in the transplant and four in nontransplant patients (p-NS). There were three seromas and one patient had a bowel perforation in the transplant group versus eight seromas, one bowel perforation and one small bowel obstruction noted in the nontransplant group. One patient in each group had a mesh infection requiring explant. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 2.2 years in the transplant group and 3 years in the nontransplant group. Overall there were five recurrences in the transplant group and four in the nontransplant group (p = NS).

PURPOSE This study was undertaken to validate a novel experimental model for the study of ligament strains and to determine the length changes in the superficial medial collateral, lateral collateral, and medial patellofemoral ligaments. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Passive motions and loaded squats of 12 cadaveric specimens were performed while controlling ankle load and optically tracking the motion of the bones. Preexperiment and postexperiment computed axial tomography scans allow the transformation of rigid body motion to relative motion of relevant anatomic landmarks on the femur, tibia, and patella. RESULTS The superficial medial collateral ligament is a near-isometric ligament with a strain of less than 2%. The ligament is a little more slack in midflexion (30 degrees to 50 degrees ) and in deep flexion, but length changes are not significant (P > .05). The lateral collateral ligament behaves near isometric (<2% strain) from 0 degrees to 70 degrees of knee flexion. Cartilage compression in a loaded environment relieves tension from the collateral ligaments (P < .05). The medial patellofemoral ligament is nonisometric. The cranial part of the medial patellofemoral ligament is most taut at full extension, while the caudal part is most taut at 30 degrees of knee flexion. CONCLUSION Ligament insertion sites on the femur, patella, and fibula can be derived from computed axial tomography scans. The described model allows the study of dynamic ligament behavior. The superficial medial collateral ligament is a near-isometric ligament with no significant length changes. The medial patellofemoral ligament behaves differently in its cranial and caudal parts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In knees with chronic medial collateral ligament insufficiency, isometric repair of the superficial medial collateral ligament can be attempted. A medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with a double fixation on the medial patellar border is supported. The cranial bundle should be tightened at full extension and the caudal bundle at 30 degrees of knee flexion.","Victor, Jan; Wong, Pius; Witvrouw, Eric; Sloten, Jos Vander; Bellemans, Johan",The American journal of sports medicine,395,1

Alternative clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract may offer benefits in terms of collection, comfort and infection risk. The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tested saliva or nasal specimens compared with RT-PCR tested nasopharyngeal specimens. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and NHS evidence from December 2019 to 20 July 2020. Eighteen studies were identified; 12 for saliva, four for nasal and two included both specimen types. For saliva-based studies, the proportion of saliva samples testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 82.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 76.7% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 65.4% to 100%. For nasal-based studies, the proportion of nasal swabs testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 81.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 70% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 62.3% to 100%. The results indicate an inconsistency in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the specimen types included, often with neither the index nor the reference of interest detecting all known cases. Depending on the test environment, these clinical specimens may offer a viable alternative to standard.

RESULTS A direct relationship was observed between the pandemic and a decrease in BD. Although emergency obstetric visits decreased, the frequency of deliveries and cases of PPH remained unchanged. After applying strategies to promote voluntary BD, a very slight increase was observed in the frequency of BD, with a negative indicator persisting between donation and blood demand. CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to shortages at BBs. In this context, typical measures to encourage an altruistic attitude toward donation have not had a significant impact. As causes of PPH continue, quality of care may be affected by the current situation at BBs.

The aim was to compare acute strength of various gastrotomy closure techniques in an in vitro porcine stomach model by assessing leak pressures. METHODS Standardized gastrotomies were closed manually, without the use of an endoscope, by one of seven NOTES closure devices: (i) T tags, (ii) purse string modified T tags, (iii) Eagle Claw VIII, (iv) Resolution clips, (v) flexible stapler; (vi) purse string suturing device, and (vii) flexible Endostitch. After closure, each specimen was fixed on the experimental apparatus and the pressure was gradually increased. By linking the pressure gauge and two cameras, the leak location and pressure could be determined in detail. We began by collecting gold standard reference values, by testing 15 gastrotomies closed with interrupted surgical sutures; these were associated with a mean leak pressure of 206 mmHg (SD 59). Using a noninferiority design, a sample size of 11 specimens for each NOTES closure technique was determined. RESULTS The Resolution clips ( P = 0.0285), Eagle Claw VIII ( P = 0.0325), flexible stapler ( P < 0.001) and flexible Endostitch ( P = 0.002) produced noninferior closures in comparison with the predetermined gold standard; T tags ( P > 0.6775), purse string modified T tags ( P > 0.999), and the purse string suturing device ( P = 0.9875) resulted in inferior closures. CONCLUSIONS The Eagle Claw VIII, Resolution clips, flexible stapler and flexible Endostitch produced noninferior closures in comparison with surgical closure in this model. These techniques seem to be the prime candidates for further testing in animal experiments before human trials can be initiated.","Voermans, R P; Worm, A M; van Berge Henegouwen, M I; Breedveld, P; Bemelman, W A; Fockens, P",Endoscopy,395,6

Within this context, the notion of Yasashii Nihongo or Simplified Japanese has been gaining attention over recent years. Originally designed as a tool for transmitting information in disaster-related situations and proposed for disaster mitigation purposes, at present it is being advocated as a means of communication to be used in non-disaster situations as well. The authors argue that ultimately Yasashii Nihongo for non-disaster situations may be just a means to an end. Seen from the perspective of ""reasonable accommodation"", a concept prevalent in the domain of disability studies, they assert that by de facto creating a new linguistic category making it a tacit prerequisite to communicate in ""Japanese only"", Yasashii Nihongo is but a concept geared towards the language majority (speakers using Japanese as their first language) and is potentially serving no other purpose than to alleviate the psychological burden of having to speak in a language other than Japanese, thus potentially leading to a new form of discrimination towards language minorities. Offering an alternative approach for improving multicultural communication aimed at establishing a communicative space based on openness, equality, and mutual respect for each other's cultural, linguistic and ethnic identities, the authors propose the introduction of language education based on the notion of plurilingualism, as outlined in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) by the Council of Europe.","Ito, Hideaki; Tokarev, Alexander",F1000Research,395,1

The burden of RSV infection in adults, particularly in the older age group, is increasingly recognised. However, RSV disease burden and molecular epidemiology in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR) has not been reviewed systematically. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the epidemiological aspects of RSV (incidence, prevalence, seasonality and hospitalisation status) and the associated molecular data in the WPRO countries. Methods A systematic search was conducted in international literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science) to identify RSV-related publications from January 2000 to October 2017 in the WPR countries. Results A total of 196 studies from 15 WPR countries were included. The positivity rate for RSV among respiratory tract infection patients was 16.73% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 15.12%-18.4%). The RSV-positive cases were mostly found in hospitalised compared with outpatients (18.28% vs 11.54%, P < 0.001), and children compared with adults (20.72% vs 1.87%, P < 0.001). The seasonality of RSV in the WPR countries follows the latitude, with the peak of RSV season occurring in the winter in temperate countries, and during the rainy season in tropical countries. The molecular epidemiology pattern of RSV in WPR countries was similar to the global pattern, with NA1 (RSV A) and BA (RSV B) being the predominant genotypes. Conclusions The available data on RSV are limited in several countries within the WPR, with most data focusing on children and hospitalised patients. Further studies and surveillance, incorporating laboratory testing, are needed to determine the burden of RSV infection in the WPR countries.","Pangesti, Krisna N A; El Ghany, Moataz Abd; Kesson, Alison M; Hill-Cawthorne, Grant A",Journal of global health,395,1

Susceptibility to stress can entail damaging behaviours, a common problem in pig production. Breeding animals with increased stress resilience is difficult for various reasons. First, studies on neuroendocrine and behavioural stress responses in farm animals are scarce, as it is difficult to record adequate phenotypes under field conditions. Second, damaging behaviours and stress susceptibility are complex traits, and their biology is not yet well understood. Dissecting complex traits into biologically better defined, heritable and easily measurable proxy traits and developing biomarkers will facilitate recording these traits in large numbers.

Brain pericytes in the peri-infarct area express macrophage markers in response to injury stimuli and are involved in neovascularization. In the kidney, nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)+ pericytes have been found to accumulate after renal injury. These accumulated NG2+ cells are not involved in scar formation. However, the role of accumulated NG2+ cells in injured kidneys remains unknown. Here, using a reversible ischemic reperfusion model, we found that renal NG2+ cells were increased in injured kidneys and expressed macrophage markers (CD11b or F4/80) on day 3 after reperfusion. Isolated NG2+ cells from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) kidneys also had phagocytic activity and expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine genes, including mannose receptor and IL-10. These macrophage-like NG2+ cells did not likely differentiate into myofibroblasts because they did not increase α-SMA expression. Intravenous transfusion of renal NG2+ cells isolated from donor mice on day 3 after reperfusion into recipient mice on day 1 after I/R surgery revealed that NG2+ cell-injected mice had lower plasma blood urea nitrogen, reduced KIM-1 mRNA expression, ameliorated renal damage, and reduced cellular debris accumulation than PBS-injected mice on day 5 after reperfusion. In conclusion, these data suggest that renal NG2+ cells have an M2 macrophage-like ability and play a novel role in facilitating the recovery process after renal I/R injury.","Kittikulsuth, Wararat; Nakano, Daisuke; Kitada, Kento; Suzuki, Norio; Yamamoto, Masayuki; Nishiyama, Akira",American journal of physiology.

Several studies have demonstrated its high success rate and low morbidity. This study aimed to identify the predictors of adverse outcomes associated with UU. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients with UD treated with UU at the study institution. Patients with less than 6 months of follow-up were excluded. Charts were reviewed for demographics, pre-operative imaging, surgical indications, operative notes, and follow-up data. Pre-operative and intra-operative variables were tested for association with adverse outcomes including unplanned surgery, worsening hydronephrosis, and febrile UTI recurrence. RESULTS A total of 35 patients underwent UU for UD between 2009 and 2017 at the study institution. The majority (33/35) had a distal anastomosis. A concomitant re-implantation of the recipient ureter was performed in 9 (25.7%) patients. After a median follow-up of 36.7 months, adverse outcomes developed in 9 patients (25.7%). No further surgery was required in 88.6% of the subjects. Adverse outcomes were associated with female gender (p = 0.048) and hydronephrosis of both upper and lower moieties (p = 0.015) and were more likely associated with ectopic ureteroceles (50%, p = 0.074) and having a concomitant re-implant performed (44.4%, p = 0.19) (table). DISCUSSION In this study, the low re-operation rates of UU for treating UD in patients with ectopic ureters or intravesical ureteroceles was demonstrated. The majority of patients with ectopic ureteroceles treated with UU and concomitant ureteral re-implantation had worsening hydronephrosis of both moieties and recurrent febrile UTI in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Interestingly, some of them had progression of hydronephrosis after excision of the upper pole. While worsening of hydronephrosis of the recipient moiety after UU was historically attributed to yo-yo reflux, most of the study patients did not have worsening hydronephrosis despite having distal anastomosis. Therefore, mechanical obstruction should be ruled out, and any underlying bladder dysfunction should be aggressively managed in patients with worsening hydronephrosis or recurrent UTI after UU before considering additional surgery. CONCLUSION Ureteroureterostomy is a successful option for UD with a low risk of adverse events in patients with ectopic ureters or intravesical ureteroceles. However, it should be cautiously considered in patients with hydronephrosis of both moieties, with ectopic ureteroceles, or if a concomitant re-implant is needed.","Abdelhalim, A; Chamberlin, J D; Truong, H; McAleer, I M; Chuang, K-W; Wehbi, E; Stephany, H A; Khoury, A E",Journal of pediatric urology,395,1

While a decreased expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in the tumor microenvironment of patients with DCIS breast cancer was linked to progression to invasive breast cancer (IBC), the downstream effector(s) contributing to this process remain elusive. The current report shows elevated expression of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5a (STAT5a) within the DCIS-like lesions in Cav-1 KO mice following estrogen treatment and inhibition of STAT5a expression prevented the formation of these mammary lesions. In addition, STAT5a overexpression in a human DCIS cell line (MCF10DCIS.com) promoted their invasion, a process accelerated by estrogen treatment and associated with increased levels of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) precursor. In sum, our results demonstrate a novel regulatory axis (Cav-1♦STAT5a♦MMP-9) in DCIS that is fully activated by the presence of estrogen. Our studies suggest to further study phosphorylated STAT5a (Y694) as a potential biomarker to guide and predict outcome of DCIS patient population.","Dees, Sundee; Pontiggia, Laura; Jasmin, Jean-Francois; Sotgia, Federica; Lisanti, Michael P; Mercier, Isabelle",Aging,395,1

However, the role of RRBP1 in bladder cancer is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of RRBP1 and its influence on cell proliferation in bladder cancer. Methods Quantification real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the expression levels of RRBP1 in 138 bladder cancer and matched adjacent normal bladder tissues. Then, the clinical significance of RRBP1 in bladder cancer was evaluated. The effect of RRBP1 on cell proliferation and its potential mechanism were further explored. Results Results show that the mRNA levels of RRBP1 in bladder cancer were significantly higher compared with those in normal tissues (P< 0.001). IHC results show the high-expression rate of RRBP1 in bladder cancer was 68.8%, which was significantly greater than those in normal tissues (40.6%, P< 0.001). RRBP1 high-expression was significantly associated with differentiation, T stage and lymph node metastasis in bladder cancer (P< 0.05). The overall survival time of patients with RRBP1 high-expression was significantly reduced compared to those with RRBP1 low-expression. Moreover, RRBP1 overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation, which was correlated with Smad1/Smad3/TGF-β1 signal pathway. Conclusion RRBP1 high-expression correlates with prognosis and promotes cell proliferation in bladder cancer, which could be a potential biomarker.","Lv, Shuang-Wu; Shi, Zhen-Guo; Wang, Xiao-Hui; Zheng, Peng-Yi; Li, Hui-Bing; Han, Qing-Jiang; Li, Zhi-Jun",OncoTargets and therapy,395,1

Here, we report the formation of a replication focus by prototypical archaeal Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) in the model archaeon Sulfolobus This rod-shaped virus belongs to the viral family Rudiviridae, carrying linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes, which are very common in geothermal environments. We demonstrate that SIRV2 DNA synthesis is confined to a focus near the periphery of infected cells. Moreover, viral and cellular replication proteins are recruited to, and concentrated in, the viral replication focus. Furthermore, we show that of the four host DNA polymerases (DNA polymerase I [Dpo1] to Dpo4), only Dpo1 participates in viral DNA synthesis. This constitutes the first report of the formation of a viral replication focus in archaeal cells, suggesting that organization of viral replication in foci is a widespread strategy employed by viruses of the three domains of life.IMPORTANCE The organization of viral replication in foci or viral factories has been mostly described for different eukaryotic viruses and for several bacteriophages.

We hypothesised that there was a relationship between rcSO2 values and short term outcome in infants of GA < 32weeks. METHODS RcSO2 values were recorded for the first 48 h of life using an INVOS monitor with a neonatal sensor. The association between cranial ultrasound scan measured brain injury and rcSO2 was assessed. RESULTS 120 infants were included. Sixty-nine percent (83) of infants had a normal outcome (no IVH, no PVL, and survival at 1 month); less than one-quarter, 22% (26), had low grade IVH 1 or 2 (moderate outcome); and 9% (11) of infants had a severe outcome (IVH ≥ 3, PVL or died before 1 month age). rcSO2 values were lower for infants GA < 28weeks when compared with those GA 28-32, p < 0.001. There was no difference in absolute rcSO2 values between the three outcome groups but a greater degree of cerebral hypoxia was associated with preterm infants who had low grade 1 or 2 IVH. CONCLUSION Infants of GA < 28 weeks have lower cerebral oxygenation in the first 2 days of life. A greater degree of hypoxia was seen in infants with grade 1 or 2 haemorrhage.

However, recent in vivo radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their non-inflammatory synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and meningeal immune regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) activated astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the production of transforming growth factor-beta, which also contributes to the disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced life-expectancy in schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality.","Corsi-Zuelli, Fabiana; Deakin, Bill",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,395,1

The surge of COVID-19 cases in India and across the globe necessitates a rapid and sensitive molecular assay. Rapid point-of-care (PoC) assays (Truenat Beta CoV and Truenat SARS-CoV-2 assays) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 have been developed which are expected to shorten the turnaround time of reporting of results and also can be used for field investigations of COVID-19. The objectives of the study were to validate the performance of Truenat Beta CoV and Truenat SARS-CoV-2 PoC assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases with reference to analytical sensitivity, precision/inter-machine variation, clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Methods The rapid PoC screening and confirmatory assays were prospectively validated at the State Level Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bengaluru, under technical supervision by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)was considered as the reference standard against which the rapid assays were validated for all samples tested based on analytical sensitivity, precision/inter-machine variation, clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity.

The HERCULES Trial is a prospective, multicenter trial of renal stenting in patients with uncontrolled HTN and ARAS evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the RX Herculink Elite Renal Stent System (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA). METHODS A total of 202 patients (241 total lesions; 78 bilateral lesions) were enrolled between August 2007 and October 2009. The primary endpoint was 9-month binary restenosis determined by duplex ultrasound and/or angiography. Secondary endpoints included changes in blood pressure, antihypertensive medications, and RF between baseline and 9 months. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was measured at baseline, 24 hr and 30 days postprocedure. RESULTS Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) at baseline was 162 mm Hg. Nearly 70% of patients were receiving three or more antihypertensive medications (mean 3.4 medications per patient). Baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 ± 0.4 and 61.5% of subjects had estimated glomerular filtration <60. The restenosis rate was 10.5% at 9 months. The study device, procedure, and clinical success rates were 96.0, 99.2, and 98.0%, respectively. Freedom from major adverse events was 94.8%. At 9 months, the mean SBP significantly decreased (mean 145, paired t test P < 0.0001) after stenting with no change in medications. There was no correlation between SBP reduction and baseline BNP or BNP reduction. CONCLUSIONS HERCULES demonstrates clinically and statistically significant SBP reduction in patients with uncontrolled HTN, low in-stent restenosis, and complication rates. This study highlights that when appropriate patients are selected for renal artery stenting, impressive reductions in blood pressure may be anticipated. Although the magnitude of absolute reduction in SBP was related to baseline SBP, elevated baseline BNP levels were not predictive of reduction in SBP. Further studies for predictors of clinical response following percutaneous renal revascularization are needed.","Jaff, Michael R; Bates, Mark; Sullivan, Timothy; Popma, Jeffrey; Gao, Xingyu; Zaugg, Margo; Verta, Patrick",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,395,1

The main purpose of this study was to assess long-term results of surgery for prolapse of the rectum. METHODS We carried out a retrospective study to evaluate changing trends in surgical strategies and outcome in all patients treated in our hospital over 19 years. RESULTS Ninety-three patients were operated and 30 (32%) experienced recurrence of external prolapse during a median (range) follow-up time of 82 (2-231) months. There were 37 reoperations for recurrence, bringing the total number of operations to 130. From 1998 to 2010, laparoscopic posterior suture rectopexy was the preferred abdominal procedure with Delorme's operation as the perineal alternative. Observed recurrence rates were 15/49 (31%) and 8/15 (53%) during a median observation time of 84 and 9 months, respectively. From 2011 to 2017, these procedures were replaced by ventral mesh rectopexy and Altemeier's rectosigmoidectomy. The observed recurrence rate for ventral mesh rectopexy was 3/22 (14%) during a median observation time of 29 months. The 30-day mortality rate was 3% and complication rate 14%. CONCLUSIONS The recurrence rates were high after all procedures, with no significant difference between posterior suture rectopexy and ventral mesh rectopexy, but the short observation time for the latter procedure is a limitation of the study. Both procedures had low complication rates, and ventral mesh rectopexy had no mortality.","Gleditsch, Dagfinn; Wexels, Wilhelm Andreas; Nesbakken, Arild",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,395,31

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate all published studies that investigated the effects of BCAAs on seizures, emphasizing therapeutic efficacy and possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS On 31 January, 2017, the following databases were searched for relevant studies: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), Scopus (Elsevier), the Cochrane Library, and the unindexed material in PubMed (National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health). The searches were repeated in all databases on 18 February, 2019. We only included full-length preclinical and clinical studies that were published in the English language that examined the effects of BCAA administration on seizures. RESULTS Eleven of 2045 studies met our inclusion criteria: ten studies were conducted in animal models and one study in human subjects. Seven seizure models were investigated: the strychnine (one study), pentylenetetrazole (two studies), flurothyl (one study), picrotoxin (two studies), genetic absence epilepsy in rats (one study), kainic acid (two studies), and methionine sulfoximine (one study) paradigms. Three studies investigated the effect of a BCAA mixture whereas the other studies explored the effects of individual BCAAs on seizures. In most animal models and in humans, BCAAs had potent anti-seizure effects. However, in the methionine sulfoximine model, long-term BCAA supplementation worsened seizure propagation and caused neuron loss, and in the genetic absence epilepsy in rats model, BCAAs exhibited pro-seizure effects. CONCLUSIONS The contradictory effects of BCAAs on seizure activity likely reflect differences in the complex mechanisms that underlie seizure disorders. Some of these mechanisms are likely mediated by BCAA's effects on glucose, glutamate, glutamine, and ammonia metabolism, activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway, and their effects on aromatic amino acid transport and neurotransmitter synthesis. We propose that a better understanding of mechanisms by which BCAAs affect seizures and neuronal viability is needed to advance the field of BCAA supplementation in epilepsy.","Gruenbaum, Shaun E; Chen, Eric C; Sandhu, Mani Ratnesh Singh; Deshpande, Ketaki; Dhaher, Roni; Hersey, Denise; Eid, Tore",CNS drugs,395,8

Few studies have examined how social media use contributes to HPV-related knowledge gaps among parents and caregivers. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between social media use and HPV-related awareness and knowledge with a focus on differences by gender and race/ethnicity among a nationally representative sample of adults with children in the household. METHODS We used data from the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) Survey (2017-2019) (N = 2,720). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the association of social media use on HPV awareness and knowledge outcomes. RESULTS Compared to non-users, engaging in one, two, three, or four social media behaviors were associated with greater HPV awareness (aOR: 2.09; 95%CI: 1.18-3.70, aOR: 2.49; 95%CI: 1.40-4.42, aOR: 2.64; 95%CI: 1.15-6.05, and aOR: 2.44; 95%CI: 1.11-5.36, respectively). Increased social media use was associated with increased HPV vaccine awareness. Men, African American, Hispanic, and Asian American respondents were less likely to be aware of HPV or HPV vaccine. Social media use was not associated with cancer knowledge. CONCLUSIONS Increased social media use is associated with an increased awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine for adults with children in the household. Social media-based efforts can be utilized to increase knowledge of the benefits of HPV vaccination as cancer prevention, which may be a precursor to reducing HPV vaccine hesitancy and encouraging uptake to decrease cancer incidence rates among vulnerable populations.","Lama, Yuki; Quinn, Sandra Crouse; Nan, Xiaoli; Cruz-Cano, Raul",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,395,30

We show that oral application of broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice changed not only diversity, but composition and sharing of gut and vaginal microbiomes in mice and influenced cervical cancer development in an orthotopic tumor model. Antibiotics decreased richness and diversity indexes in the gut but increased them in the vagina. Some beneficial taxa, such as Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae increased their abundance in the vagina while other pathogenic species, such as Proteobacteria, were decreased.

Methods: A total of 6 059 respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swab, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates and alveolar lavage fluid, as well as relative clinical data were collected from patients with acute respiratory infections from seven sentinel hospitals during November, 2009 to April, 2016 in Shanghai. Respiratory specimens were tested by RT-PCR with HCoV-conserved primers and subsequently genotyped by DNA sequencing. Using specific primers to amplify and sequence full-length Spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and nucleocapsid (N) gene from HCoV-OC43 positive samples. Further genotype and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-OC43 were performed by conducting phylogenetic trees. Results: Among 6 059 patients, the total frequency of HCoV was 63 (1.04%), in which HCoV-OC43 was the most frequently detected species with 34 positive samples, followed by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) with 18 and 10 positive sample respectively. However, other HCoV like human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were not been detected, which illustrated that HCoV-OC43 was the dominant subtype. The full-length of S, RDRP and N gene were obtained from 29 HCoV-OC43 positive samples. According to the sequence-analysis, 27 of which was genotype D, 2 of which was genotype B and others genotype, including genotype E, F and G, were not detected. The result indicated that the genotype D may be the dominant genotype. Further analysis of S protein that help HCoV-OC43 to entry host cell and stimulate the host immune system to produce neutralizing antibody found that two important functional domains in S protein, N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) contained more amino acid substitution and positive selection sites, accompanied with amino acid insertion/deletion. 13 positive selection sites were all located in the NTD or RBD, 10 of which were located in the NTD and 3 in the RBD. Conclusion: Human coronavirus OC43 was the major circulation human coronaviurs in Shanghai from 2009 to 2016, in which genotype D was the dominant genotype. NTD and RBD regions of the S protein were hypervariable region during HCoV-OC43 evolution, and had amino acid substitutions as well as amino acid insertion/deletion.","Yang, Y J; Hu, Y W",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],395,16

Furthermore the levels of Runx2, Alp, Oc and Opn suggest an increase in osteoblasts proliferation, especially in early stages of osseointegration. %BIC in healthy and diabetic (7 days) depicted statistically significant differences for NANO group. BV/TV, BS/BV and To.Po demonstrated higher values for NANO group in all evaluated time point and irrespective of systemic condition, but BS/BV 30 days (healthy rat) and 7 and 30 days (diabetic rat).

Examples include the preparation of cotton candy, the atomization of metals, the manufacture of glass fibers, and the formation of elongated structures in volcanic eruptions known as Pele's hair. Usually, solid-like deformations during solidification are neglected as the melt is much more malleable in its initial liquid-like form. Here we demonstrate how elastic deformations in the midst of solidification, i.e., while the melt responds as a very soft solid ([Formula: see text] Pa), can lead to the formation of previously unknown periodic structures. Namely, we generate an array of droplets on a thin layer of liquid elastomer melt coated on the outside of a rotating cylinder through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Then, as the melt cures and goes through its gelation point, the rotation speed is increased and the drops stretch into hairs. The ongoing solidification eventually hardens the material, permanently ""freezing"" these elastic deformations into a patterned solid. Using experiments, simulation, and theory, we demonstrate that the formation of our two-step patterns can be rationalized when combining the tools from fluid mechanics, elasticity, and statistics. Our study therefore provides a framework to analyze multistep pattern formation processes and harness them to assemble complex materials.","Jambon-Puillet, Etienne; Piéchaud, Matthieu Royer; Brun, P-T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,395,1

Enfuvirtide is the first entry inhibitor to have been approved for clinical use. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Relevant information through searches of MEDLINE (1998 to June 2010) and meeting abstracts of major HIV/AIDS conferences (2003 - June 2010) using the search terms 'enfuvirtide', 'T-20' and 'fusion inhibitor'. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN Enfuvirtide blocks HIV fusion to host cells. It works against the different HIV-1 variants but is not active against HIV-2. The recommended dosage of enfuvirtide is 90 mg b.i.d. subcutaneously. The two large Phase III pivotal clinical trials TORO 1 and 2 showed that enfuvirtide is an effective therapeutic option as rescue therapy in combination with other active antiretroviral drugs. Resistance to enfuvirtide is conferred by mutations in the HR1 region of gp41. Single and double mutations have been shown to result in high-level resistance to enfuvirtide. Postmarketing studies have been helpful to define more precisely the place of enfuvirtide in the sequence of antiretroviral therapy. TAKE HOME MESSAGE The emergence of new compounds and new classes of drugs, highly active against multiresistant virus but more convenient to administer than enfuvirtide, will probably prevent the extensive use of enfuvirtide. This drug remains attractive in some subgroups of patients because of its excellent systemic tolerance and the lack of interactions with the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.","Joly, Véronique; Jidar, Kaoutar; Tatay, Mercedes; Yeni, Patrick",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,395,1

Some viruses like herpes simplex, herpes zoster, adenovirus, enterovirus 70, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus are well-known for their role in ocular pathology. In recent years, emerging and resurging viral infections represent an important public health problem. The Asia-Pacific region has witnessed a number of pandemic and epidemic outbreaks caused by these viruses during the last 2 decades. The number of ocular complications being reported in patients of these viral infections has also increased significantly during this period. Ophthalmologists and physicians should be aware of ocular manifestations of newly emerging or resurging viral diseases. We conducted a review of the literature published during the last 20 years with the objectives of finding out outbreaks of emerging and reemerging viruses in the Asia-Pacific region and finding out any ocular involvement in these viral infections.

Whether this relatively conservative strategy will impact in-hospital outcome for NSTEMI patients remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS The current study included all consecutive NSTEMI patients who visited the emergency department in Fuwai Hospital from February 1 to March 31, 2020 and all the NSTEMI patients in the same period of 2019 as a historical control. Very-high-risk patients were defined as clinical presentation of heart failure, cardiac shock, cardiac arrest, recurrent chest pain, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The primary outcome was in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or heart failure. A total of 115 NSTEMI patients were enrolled since the outbreak of COVID-19, and a total of 145 patients were included in the control group. There was a tendency toward higher MACE risk in 2020 compared with 2019 (18.3% vs. 11.7%, p = .14). Among very-high-risk patients, early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy in 2019 was associated with reduced MACE risk compared with delayed PCI in 2020 (60.6% [20/33] in 2020 vs. 27.9% [12/43] in 2019, p = .01). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pandemic results in a significant reduction in immediate/early PCI and a trend toward higher adverse event rate during hospitalization, particular in very-high-risk patients.","Liu, Shuai; Song, Chenxi; Yin, Dong; Wang, Yang; Zhao, Yanyan; Yang, Weixian; Qiao, Shubin; Dou, Kefei; Xu, Bo",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,395,1

The Restech Dx-pH probe is a transnasal catheter that measures oropharyngeal pH. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic potential of oropharyngeal pH monitoring to predict responsiveness to PPI therapy in patients with laryngeal symptoms. METHODS We conducted a physician-blinded prospective cohort study at a single academic institution between January 2013 and October 2014. Adult patients with Reflux Symptom Index scores (RSI) ≥13 off PPI therapy were recruited. Patients underwent video laryngoscopy and 24-h oropharyngeal pH monitoring, followed by an 8- to 12-week trial of omeprazole 40 mg daily. Prior to and following PPI therapy, patients completed various symptom questionnaires. The primary outcome was the association between PPI response and oropharyngeal pH metrics. PPI response was separated into three subgroups based on the post-treatment RSI score and % RSI response: non-response=RSI ≥13; partial response=post-treatment RSI <13 and change in RSI <50%; and complete response=post-treatment RSI <13 and change in RSI ≥50%. The primary analysis utilized a multinomial logistic regression controlling for the pre-treatment RSI score. A secondary analysis assessed the relationship between the change in RSI (post-pre) and oropharyngeal pH metrics via ordinary least square regression. RESULTS Thirty-four patients completed the study and were included in final analysis. Symptom response to PPI therapy was as follows: 50% no response, 15% partial response, and 35% complete response. Non-responders had a higher pre-treatment RSI (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in oropharyngeal acid exposure (below pH of 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and RYAN scores) between responder types. The secondary analysis noted a trend between lower PPI response and a greater total percent time below pH of 5.0 (P=0.03), upright percent time below pH of 5.0 (P=0.07), and RYAN supine (corrected; P=0.03), as well as an association between PPI response and greater decreases in the Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory (P<0.01), Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (P<0.01), and Negative Affect Scale (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Oropharyngeal pH testing did not predict laryngeal symptom response to PPI therapy. Contrary to hypothesis, our study signaled that the degree of oropharyngeal acid exposure is inversely related to PPI response. In addition, reduction in negative affect and psychological distress parallels PPI response.","Yadlapati, Rena; Pandolfino, John E; Lidder, Alcina K; Shabeeb, Nadine; Jaiyeola, Diana-Marie; Adkins, Christopher; Agrawal, Neelima; Cooper, Andrew; Price, Caroline P E; Ciolino, Jody D; Gawron, Andrew J; Smith, Stephanie S; Bove, Michiel; Tan, Bruce K",The American journal of gastroenterology,395,31

Consequently, many institutions mandate hand injection for MR angiography, limiting precision of infusion rates and durations of delivery. OBJECTIVE To determine whether electronic injection of gadolinium-based contrast media through a range of small-caliber, single-lumen PICCs would be safe without risk of catheter rupture over the range of clinical protocols and determine whether programmed flow rates and volumes were realized when using PICCs for contrast delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experiments were performed and recorded using the Medrad Spectris Solaris EP MR Injection System. PICC sizes, contrast media and flow rates were based on common institutional protocols. RESULTS No catheters were damaged during any experiments. Mean difference between programmed and delivered volume was 0.07 ± 0.10 mL for all experiments. Reduced flow rates and prolonged injection durations were observed when the injector's pressure-limiting algorithm was triggered, only in protocols outside the clinical range. CONCLUSION PICCs commonly used in children can withstand in vitro power injection of gadolinium-based contrast media at protocols significantly above clinical levels.","Moriarty, John M; Kung, Geoffrey L; Ramos, Yanerys; Moghaddam, Abbas N; Ennis, Daniel B; Finn, J Paul",Pediatric radiology,395,16

METHODS HCV pseudotype and subgenomic replicon assays were used in this study. The interaction of compounds with HCV receptors was examined using flow cytometry. Intracellular RNA levels were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. RESULTS Procyanidin B1 (PB1), a dimer of (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, purified from Cinnamomi cortex, inhibits infection by vesicular stomatitis virus and HCV pseudotype virus in Huh-7 cells, with 50% effective concentrations of 29 and 15 microM, respectively. No inhibitory effects were observed in each component of PB1. We found that PB1 does not interfere with viral entry or receptor expression, but inhibits HCV RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that PB1 suppresses HCV RNA synthesis, possibly as a HCV RNA polymerase inhibitor. Our results might contribute towards the development of more effective inhibitors for HCV infection from natural plants.","Li, Shenwei; Kodama, Eiichi N; Inoue, Yuuki; Tani, Hideki; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Zhang, Jing; Tanaka, Takashi; Hattori, Toshio",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,395,1

The present study evaluated the daily urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion profile and the salivary levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 20 controls and 20 ASD participants, as well as correlating these measures with sleep disturbances. Although 60% of ASD participants showed a significant nighttime rise in aMT6s excretion, this rise was significantly attenuated, compared to controls (p<0.05). The remaining 40% of ASD individuals showed no significant increase in nocturnal aMT6s. ASD individuals showed higher nocturnal levels of saliva TNF, but not IL-6. Dysfunction in the initiation and maintenance of sleep, as indicated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children correlated with nighttime aMT6s excretion (r=-0.28, p<0.05). Dysfunction in sleep breathing was inversely correlated to aMT6s (r=-0.31, p<0.05) and positively associated with TNF level (r=0.42, p<0.01). Overall such data indicate immune-pineal axis activation, with elevated TNF but not IL-6 levels associated with disrupted pineal melatonin release and sleep dysfunction in ASD. It is proposed that circadian dysregulation in ASD is intimately linked to heightened immune-inflammatory activity. Such two-way interactions of the immune-pineal axis may underpin many aspects of ASD pathophysiology, including sleep disturbances, as well as cognitive and behavioral alterations.","da Silveira Cruz-Machado, Sanseray; Maria Guissoni Campos, Leila; Cristina Fadini, Cintia; Anderson, George; Markus, Regina P; Pinato, Luciana",Journal of pineal research,395,1

METHODS The study population consisted of The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Pediatric interns/residents and PGY-1 Anesthesia interns rotating through the NICU. Prior to participating in the study, the residents completed a survey addressing past experiences with intubation, comfort level, and prior use of direct and videolaryngoscopy. Participants then performed timed trials of both direct and videolaryngoscopy on the SimNewB(®). They had up to three attempts to successfully intubate, with up to 30 s on each attempt. After randomization, participants received one of the following teaching interventions: standard, computer module, or both. This was followed by a second intubation trial and survey completion. RESULTS Thirty residents were enrolled in the study. There was significant improvement in time to successful intubation in both methods after any teaching intervention (direct 22.0 ± 13.4 s vs 14.7 ± 5.9 s, P = 0.002 and videolaryngoscopy 42.2 ± 29.3 s vs 26.8 ± 18.6 s, P = 0.003). No differences were found between the types of teaching. Residents were faster at intubating with direct laryngoscopy compared to videolaryngoscopy before and after teaching. By the end of the study, only 33% of residents preferred using videolaryngoscopy over direct laryngoscopy, but 76% felt videolaryngoscopy was better to teach intubation. CONCLUSIONS Both standard teaching and computer module teaching of neonatal intubation on a mannequin model results in improved time to successful intubation and overall improved resident confidence with intubation equipment and technique. Although intubation times were lower with direct laryngoscopy compared to videolaryngoscopy, the participating residents felt that videolaryngoscopy is an important educational tool.","Koele-Schmidt, Lindsey; Vasquez, Margarita M",Paediatric anaesthesia,395,25

Coronavirus nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) encodes helicase, which plays pivotal roles during viral replication by unwinding viral RNA. However, the biochemical characterization of PEDV nsp13 remains largely unknown. In this study, PEDV nsp13 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The recombinant nsp13 possessed ATPase and helicase activities for binding and unwinding dsDNA/RNA substrates with 5'-overhangs, and Mg2+ and Mn2+ were critical for its ATPase and helicase activities. PEDV nsp13 also unwound dsDNA into ssDNA in the pH from 6.0-9.0, and used energy from all nucleoside triphosphates and deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Lys289 (K289) of PEDV nsp13 was essential for its ATPase and helicase activities. These results provide new insights into the biochemical properties of PEDV nsp13, which is a potential target for developing antiviral drugs.","Ren, Jie; Ding, Zhen; Fang, Puxian; Xiao, Shaobo; Fang, Liurong",Veterinary microbiology,395,28

There are no accepted targeted therapies for use after acquired resistance develops. Metastasectomy is used in other cancers to manage oligometastatic disease. We hypothesized that local therapy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. METHODS Patients who received non-central nervous system local therapy were identified by a review of data from a prospective biopsy protocol for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy and other institutional biospecimen registry protocols. RESULTS Eighteen patients were identified, who received elective local therapy (surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or radiation). Local therapy was well tolerated, with 85% of patients restarting TKI therapy within 1 month of local therapy. The median time to progression after local therapy was 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2-27 months). The median time until a subsequent change in systemic therapy was 22 months (95% CI: 6-30 months). The median overall survival from local therapy was 41 months (95% CI: 26-not reached). CONCLUSIONS EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy are amenable to local therapy to treat oligometastatic disease when used in conjunction with continued EGFR inhibition. Local therapy followed by continued treatment with an EGFR TKI is well tolerated and associated with long PFS and OS.

These adverse sequelae may be mediated by altered inflammatory profiles observed in patients with CH. A pro-inflammatory immunologic profile is also associated with worse outcomes of certain infections, including SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease Covid-19. Whether CH predisposes to severe Covid-19 or other infections is unknown. Among 525 individuals with Covid-19 from Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) and the Korean Clonal Hematopoiesis (KoCH) consortia, we show that CH is associated with severe Covid-19 outcomes (OR = 1.85, 95%=1.15-2.99, p = 0.01), in particular CH characterized by non-cancer driver mutations (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.15-3.50, p = 0.01). We further explore the relationship between CH and risk of other infections in 14,211 solid tumor patients at MSK. CH is significantly associated with risk of Clostridium Difficile (HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.30, p = 6×10-3) and Streptococcus/Enterococcus infections (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.15-2.13, p = 5×10-3).

Less is known about the effect of CO2 on the neurological function of infants. OBJECTIVE To describe the effect of acute severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 >70 mm Hg) on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and cerebral oxygenation in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN Observational study of full-term and preterm infants with acute severe hypercapnia (identified by arterial blood gas measurements), monitored with aEEG. Visual analysis of the aEEG was performed in all infants. In preterm infants <32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), analysis of two-channel EEG was performed. Mean spontaneous activity transients (SAT) rate (SATs/min), interval between SATs (ISI in seconds) and the ISI percentage (ISP) were calculated for 10-min periods before, during and after hypercapnia. Mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy were also calculated for these periods. RESULTS Twenty-five infants (21 preterm, 4 full-term) comprising 32 episodes of acute severe hypercapnia were identified. Twenty-seven episodes were accompanied by a transient aEEG depression. Twenty-two episodes in 15 preterm infants <32 weeks PMA were quantitatively analysed. During hypercapnia, SAT rate decreased and ISI and ISP increased significantly. No significant change occurred in rScO2 or FTOE during hypercapnia. CONCLUSION Profound depression of brain activity due to severe hypercapnia is also seen in infants. It can be recognised by an acute depression of the aEEG, without clinically detectable changes in cerebral oxygenation.","Weeke, Lauren C; Dix, Laura M L; Groenendaal, Floris; Lemmers, Petra M A; Dijkman, Koen P; Andriessen, Peter; de Vries, Linda S; Toet, Mona C",Archives of disease in childhood.

Focusing on the UK, this article provides a rigorous exploration of the drivers of public support for social distancing at their formative stage, via mixed methods. Synthesizing insights from crisis management and securitization theory, thematic analysis is employed to map the main frames promoted by the government and other actors on the nature/severity, blame/responsibility, and appropriate response to the pandemic, which 'follows the science'. The impact of these on public attitudes is examined via a series of regression analyses, drawing on a representative survey of the UK population (n = 2100). Findings challenge the prevailing understanding that support for measures is driven by personal health considerations, socio-economic circumstances, and political influences. Instead, crisis framing dynamics, which the government is well-positioned to dominate, have the greatest impact on driving public attitudes. © The Author(s), 2021.

Therefore, we investigated a case study of Brno city in the Czech Republic. We used qualitative techniques such as case study, exploration, observation, and description. We analyzed and comprehended the trends in the various features of smart city and sustainable development of the city of Brno. The findings showed that Brno city is doing its best to maintain smart city models through its governance organs and structures. The city is also working hard to improve some of the aspects that are still lagging. The ongoing developments and the future ones are based on strategic planning for both the short term and long term such as Brno2023, Brno2030, and Brno2050. It was found that Brno has a very well-planned transport system and is integrated with other aspects such as technology, energy, such as the electricity that moves the trolleybuses and trams, and environment. We strongly conclude that even though Brno city still struggles to achieve total sustainability, it is still a model and reflection of a smart and sustainable city.

Recent studies have yielded equivocal data on same day versus next day administration of pegfilgrastim. There has been limited real world evidence addressing lung cancer (LC) patients and the use of same day pegfilgrastim. We evaluated our own institutional data on the safety of same day pegfilgrastim administration in LC patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed by searching electronic health records using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes corresponding with a lung cancer diagnosis between November 1, 2013 and August 31, 2018 at The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC). Patients included in the study were 18 years of age or older, diagnosed with biopsyconfirmed lung cancer, treated at UACC, and receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim on the same day. The outcomes of interest included FN incidence after the first cycle and across all cycles of CTX, CIN grade 3/4 and CTX dose delays or hospitalizations due to CIN/FN after first cycle and across all cycles of CTX. Results: 1,181 patient records were reviewed and 114 patients met the inclusion criteria;87 (76%) patients had non-small cell LC and 27 (24%) patients had small cell LC. The median age was 68 years, 52% of patients had cancer stage of 3 to 4, and 63% of patients had 0-1 ECOG status. The FN risk assessment was mild in 72% of patients. The mean (SD) of baseline absolute neutrophil count was 5.68 (3.09). In total 384 CTX cycles were received. The table shows the results of all intended outcomes. One patient experienced FN after the first cycle of CTX of irinotecan and 5 patients developed 6 FN episodes across all cycles;2 patients were on carboplatin etoposide;1 patient on cisplatin etoposide;1 patient on vinorelbine and 1 patient was on pemetrexed and then on irinotecan CTX when the two FN episodes were developed. Conclusions: This study showing that same day administration of pegfilgrastim was as effective as next day administration in LC patients, without warranting any concerns for febrile neutropenia or delayed engraftment. Utilization of same day pegfilgrastim, in light of biosimilars and COVID, provides a unique opportunity for cancer care without concerns for FN as stated in previous studies.

A search for that compound could be a long, complex, and expensive process, and sometimes it is urgent to develop a drug, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to provide a theoretical overview of the application of computer-aided methods in pharmacokinetic studies during drug development. Computer-aided in silico methods filter a large number of compounds to a few ones with best properties, thus shortening the whole process and making it more efficient. Virtual screening, whether it is ligand-based or structure-based, identifies molecules that are most likely to bind to a receptor or an enzyme. It is becoming a more substantial method during drug development. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methods are based on the mathematical algorithm that predicts chemical features encoded within descriptors (chemical attributes that control the observed response). These studies consist of data preparation, data processing, and data interpretation for a set of substances and are very valuable. In silico evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties helps predict drug behaviour in vivo by combining pharmacokinetic processes into one model. The most important physicochemical properties related to ADME processes are logP and logD, as well as solubility and pKa. The progress of in silico methods in drug development is unstoppable, thus their use nowadays is ever-increasing. The future of drug development lies in in silico methods, as they are cost-effective and time-saving, with good prediction accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hamidović, A.; Hasković, E.; Muhić, S.; Planinić, M.; Omerović, N.; Škrbo, S.","International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina, CMBEBIH 2021",395,1

Endothelial VWF is stored in cell-specific secretory granules, Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), uniquely rod-like exocytic organelles generated in a wide range of lengths (0.5 to 5.0 µm). It has been shown that WPB size responds to physiological cues and pharmacological treatment and that, under flow, VWF secretion from shortened WPBs produces a dramatic reduction of platelet and plasma VWF adhesion to an endothelial surface. WPB-shortening therefore represents a novel target for antithrombotic therapy acting via modulation of VWF adhesive activity. To this aim, we screened a library of licenced drugs and identified several that prompt WPB size reduction. These compounds therefore constitute a novel set of potentially antithrombotic compounds. Summary The size of the endothelial secretory granules that store Von Willebrand Factor correlates with its activity, central to haemostasis and thrombosis. Here, human-licenced drugs that reduce the size of these secretory granules are identified, providing a set of novel potential anti-thrombotic compounds.","Ferraro, Francesco; Costa, Joana R.; Ketteler, Robin; Kriston-Vizi, Janos; Cutler, Daniel F.",bioRxiv,395,1

The N95 respirators are meant for single usage; however, they can be used after decontamination in-light of the economy and shortfall in availability. At this juncture, the respirators performance after various types of sterilization and usage condition is required to be analyzed in detail. With this motto, this work has proceeded. The filtration efficiency, pressure drop, and quality factor of the respirator are evaluated for two face velocities (5.8 and 26.4 cm/s) following different sterilization methods. Sterilization techniques used here are dry air oven heating, gamma irradiation, and immersing in a 10% concentration of liquid hydrogen peroxide. The particle filtration performance and electrostatic surface charge density measurement are used to determine the facemasks efficacy after sterilization. The methods recommended to sterilize N95 masks without affecting their performance are (i) using dry air heat at 80oC and (ii) H2O2 soaking. The highest reduction in filtration efficiency is observed to be 30-35% after gamma irradiation due to a change in the electrostatic properties of the respirator layers. However, the filtration efficiency does not change significantly for other sterilization methods despite a change in charge density, but there is no direct correlation with filtration efficiency. Electrostatic charge measurement of the filtration layer is a crucial indicator of filtration efficiency degradation.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance. ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 32.4 years ({+/-} 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040). ConclusionsPresence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.

Design/methodology/approach: This relationship was examined using the list of values (LOV). Based on a sample of 600 respondents born between 1977 and 1994, a self-administered online questionnaire was conducted. Findings: The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach demonstrated that Generation Y members who give higher priority to self-direction, social affiliation and hedonic orientation values have greater entrepreneurial intentions. Across gender, the PLS-multigroup analysis (MGA) approach reveals that self-direction values enhance entrepreneurial intention for Generation Y females but not for males. Social affiliation values improve entrepreneurial intention for Generation Y males but not for females. Hedonic orientation values rise entrepreneurial intentions for both Generation Y males and females similarly. The findings give also a ranking of the nine LOV. Research limitations/implications: Across-cultural comparisons are lacking in this research. This study only focuses on the value–intention relationship. Future research could study the value–attitude–behavior. Practical implications: The results provide implications to all agents concerned by promoting new enterprises and feminine entrepreneurship regarding the implementation of personal values in fostering the venture creation process and stimulation of people to become business owners. Originality/value: Little is known about the role of personal values in venture creation. The findings provide support for the role personal values play in building entrepreneurial intentions. The focus here was on Generation Y. The generation that faces problems of unemployment, job loss and poverty specifically in the time of crises of the COVID-19 pandemic. The value-based entrepreneurship approach is a proliferating field of research as the world seeks to rebuild economies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ettis, S. A.",Gender in Management,395,13

Transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) is a complicated immunological response to transfusion that results in immunosuppression. The mechanisms of TRIM include the presence of residual white blood cells and apoptotic cells, the infusion of immunosuppressive cytokines that are present in donor components or that occur during blood processing, the transfer of metabolically active growth factor-loaded particles and extracellular vesicles, and the presence of hemoglobin or extracellular vesicles binds to hemoglobin. TRIM variables include donor-specific factors and processing variables. TRIM can explain, at least partially, the controversial negative clinical results observed in patients with covid19. Many potential treatment methods have been used in clinical practice, including supportive interventions, immunomodulators, antiviral therapy, and infusion of convalescent plasma. Here, we summarize current potential treatments for COVID-19 infectionrelated diseases and discuss the clinical value of blood transfusion-related technologies for COVID-19 treatment in blood transfusion-related immune regulation.","Obeagu, E.

Mavrilimumab is a clinical stage fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks GM-CSFRα. It has demonstrated efficacy and acceptable safety profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and it’s currently undergoing investigation in phase II studies in giant cell arteritis and in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyper-inflammation (NCT03827018, NCT04397497, respectively). The present study investigates its potential as a therapeutic strategy to target MDSCs in the TME as an adjuvant to immunotherapy.MethodsCancer cell supernatants were collected when cells reached confluency. Human GM-CSF was measured by ELISA. Healthy donor CD14+ monocytes were incubated (± mavrilimumab) with cancer cell supernatants for either 3 or 6 days followed by phenotypic analysis (CD14, CD33, HLA-DR, CD11b, CD206, CD80, PD-L1, Arginase-1) by flow cytometry. On day 3, autologous CD3+ T cells were stimulated with CD3/CD28 and IL-2 and co-cultured with putative MDSCs for 5 days. T-cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry.ResultsGM-CSF is expressed in the supernatant of cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW-480, Panc-1, Capan-1). Human monocytes cultured with conditioned medium from colorectal carcinoma (SW-480) or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Capan-1) show downregulation of HLA-DR, increased expression of PD-L1, Arg-1, CD206, and can suppress T-cell proliferation in-vitro. Similarly, peripheral blood monocytes purified from pancreatic cancer patients suppress T-cell proliferation ex-vivo. Notably, Mavrilimumab inhibits the polarization of healthy donor monocytes to M-MDSCs and restores T-cell proliferation.ConclusionsTargeting of GM-CSFRα with mavrilimumab may alleviate the pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs in the TME. Future clinical studies should evaluate whether targeting of the GM-CSFRα in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors is a viable therapeutic option to bolster their efficacy.Ethics ApprovalThe study was approved by the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK Ethics Board.

The virus causes acute wheezing in children or, less commonly, croup or pneumonia. METHODS/RESULTS Molecular epidemiology studies have shown that field strains exhibit sufficient sequence diversity to designate 2 subgroups of circulating viruses. Small animal and nonhuman primate models of infection have been described, which will allow studies of pathogenesis and immunity. Recombinant viruses have already been generated by several groups using reverse genetics, which facilitates the study of the biology of the virus and the generation of live attenuated vaccine candidates.

In pursuit of personalized medicine, researchers continue active exploration of the genetic and molecular framework of PDAC to apply novel therapeutics and enhance outcomes. In patients who have PDAC, germline mutations-such as those in the BRCA1/2 and PALB2 genes-are predominantly associated with the DNA damage response and repair pathway. On the basis of studies completed in patients with BRCA-mutated advanced breast and ovarian cancer, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been evaluated for safety, tolerability, and efficacy in patients with advanced PDAC who are carrying germline BRCA gene mutations. Results have demonstrated meaningful activity and identified BRCA as a predictive and targetable biomarker in PDAC, and have also identified the role of olaparib as a maintenance therapy in PDAC. On the basis of the principle of synthetic lethality, and to avert resistance to PARP inhibitors, clinical trials of combination therapy with PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy have been conducted with an early signal. As we continue to explore the role of PARP inhibitors in the management of PDAC, recent clinical trials are studying the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy, targeted inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors.

Specimens were tested for BCV, using an antigen-capture ELISA. Serum samples were obtained at arrival and again 28 days after arrival and tested for antibodies to BCV, using an antibody-detection ELISA. Information was collected regarding treatment for cattle with respiratory tract disease and average daily gain during the feeding period. Pulmonary lesions were evaluated at slaughter. RESULTS Cattle shedding BCV from the nasal cavity and developing an antibody response against BCV were 1.6 times more likely to require treatment for respiratory tract disease than cattle that did not shed the virus or develop an immune response against BCV. Additionally, cattle that shed BCV from the nasal cavity were 2.2 times more likely to have pulmonary lesions at slaughter than cattle that did not shed the virus. The BCV shedding or seroconversion status did not affect average daily gain.

There is limited information on current practices in pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratories in the United States (US). OBJECTIVES To describe current practice patterns and make recommendations regarding potential resource allocation for congenital cardiac catheterization during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A web-based survey was distributed regarding case candidacy and catheterization laboratory preparedness. Centers were categorized based on the current degree of disease burden in that community (as of April 1, 2020). Data and consensus opinion were utilized to develop recommendations. RESULTS Respondents belonged to 56 unique US centers, with 27 (48.2%) located in counties with a high number of COVID-19 cases. All centers have canceled elective procedures. There was relative uniformity (>88% agreement) among centers as to which procedures were considered elective. To date, only three centers have performed a catheterization on a confirmed COVID-19 positive patient. Centers located in areas with a higher number of COVID-9 cases have been more involved in a simulation of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) than low-prevalence centers (46.7% vs 10.3%, respectively; P<.001). Currently, only a small fraction of operators has been reassigned to provide clinical services outside their scope of practice.

Bringing Hong's own account of his own actions into dialogue with one of the most influential secondary accounts of his actions, the paper highlights the gross disparity between the two. Having argued that the rhetorical structuring of the secondary account is, ultimately, responsible for Hong's characterisation as a ""bad"" scientist, it then moves to explore how subsequent accounts developed their own characterisations. What becomes clear is that as secondary accounts began feeding off one another, references to Hong's account disappeared. Aided by the concepts of the ""vanishing"" and the ""phantasm"", the paper concludes with a consideration of how this process left Hong's work with a very peculiar form of existence.","Attenborough, Frederick Thomas",Public understanding of science,395,27

It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans. The source of origin, transmission to humans, and mechanisms associated with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet clear, however, its resemblance to SARS-CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through genome sequencing-related studies. The development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infections. In this review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the current outbreak in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.","Khan, Suliman; Siddique, Rabeea; Shereen, Muhammad Adnan; Ali, Ashaq; Liu, Jianbo; Bai, Qian; Bashir, Nadia; Xue, Mengzhou",J. clin. microbiol,395,1

We aim to systematically explore the association of COVID-19 severity and mortality rate with the history of cardiovascular diseases and/or other comorbidities and cardiac injury laboratory markers. METHODS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to estimate pooled results from the 56 studies. The prognostic performance of cardiac markers for predicting adverse outcomes and to select the best cutoff threshold was estimated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining cardiac markers with demographic and clinical features was applied to predict mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 17 794 patients showed patients with high cardiac troponin I (OR = 5.22, 95% CI = 3.73-7.31, P < .001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 2.84-4.66, P < .001) were more likely to develop adverse outcomes. High troponin I more than 13.75 ng/L combined with either advanced age more than 60 years or elevated AST level more than 27.72 U/L was the best model to predict poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 severity and mortality are complicated by myocardial injury. Assessment of cardiac injury biomarkers may improve the identification of those patients at the highest risk and potentially lead to improved therapeutic approaches.","Toraih, Eman A; Elshazli, Rami M; Hussein, Mohammad H; Elgaml, Abdelaziz; Amin, Mohamed; El-Mowafy, Mohammed; El-Mesery, Mohamed; Ellythy, Assem; Duchesne, Juan; Killackey, Mary T; Ferdinand, Keith C; Kandil, Emad; Fawzy, Manal S",J. med. virol,395,1

Despite this, the research lacks spatiotemporal statistical and mathematical analysis based on large datasets. We describe a novel methodology to extract useful spatiotemporal information from COVID-19 pandemic data. (2) Methods: We perform specific analyses based on mathematical and statistical tools, like mathematical morphology, hierarchical clustering, parametric data modeling and non-parametric statistics. These analyses are here applied to the large dataset consisting of about 19,000 COVID-19 patients in the Veneto region (Italy) during the entire Italian national lockdown. (3) Results: We estimate the COVID-19 cumulative incidence spatial distribution, significantly reducing image noise. We identify four clusters of connected provinces based on the temporal evolution of the incidence. Surprisingly, while one cluster consists of three neighboring provinces, another one contains two provinces more than 210 km apart by highway. The survival function of the local spatial incidence values is modeled here by a tapered Pareto model, also used in other applied fields like seismology and economy in connection to networks. Model's parameters could be relevant to describe quantitatively the epidemic. (4) Conclusion: The proposed methodology can be applied to a general situation, potentially helping to adopt strategic decisions such as the restriction of mobility and gatherings.","Spassiani, Ilaria; Sebastiani, Giovanni; Palù, Giorgio",Viruses,395,1

A consequence, perhaps, of death becoming increasingly overmedicalised, nearly one in two UK nationals die institutional deaths. In this article we, two architectural scholars engaged in teaching, research and practice and a nurse and healthcare scholar with a focus on end-of-life care and peoples' experiences, wish to draw attention to a controversy resulting from a paucity in current literature on the terms of reference of the dying 'patient' as we navigate the future implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. This contributes to a relative lack of touchstones for architects to refer to when designing person-centred palliative care environments. Unlike common building types, architects are extremely unlikely to have lived experience of palliative care environments as patients; and therefore, require the help of healthcare professionals to imagine and empathise with the requirements of a person dying away from home. This paper includes a review of ageing and dying literature to understand, and distil from an architectural perspective, who, design professionals, are designing for and to remember the nuanced characteristics of those we hold a duty of care toward. We ask readers to heed the importance of accurate terms of reference, especially when commissioning and/or designing environments of palliative care.

We conducted a Google Trends search using keywords related to pet adoption. Relative search volume (RSV) was scored between 0 and 100 for the lowest and the highest, respectively. Top countries contributing to the dataset included Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia. From 2015 through 2020, the worldwide RSV for the categories of pet, dog and cat adoption peaked between April and May 2020, the early epidemic phase of the pandemic. These were significantly higher than the 5-year worldwide average RSV for all three categories (P = 0.001). Comparing to the same period in 2019, the RSV ratio (2020/2019) for both dog and cat adoption increased by up to 250%. Nonetheless, the RSV for dog adoption has been decreasing since July 2020 and returned to the 5-year average by December 2020. In contrast, the interest in cat adoption remained sustainably high, possibly reflecting the feline acclimation to indoor living. In conclusion, the global interest in pet adoptions surged in the early phase of the pandemic but not sustainable. With the launch of COVID-19 vaccines, there is a concern for separation anxiety and possible abandonment of these newly adopted pets when the owners would leave their homes for work in the future.","Ho, J.; Hussain, S.; Sparagano, O.",Frontiers in Veterinary Science,395,14

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with STEMI in the outbreak era (between January 23, 2020 and March 27, 2020), and the post era (between March 28, 2020, and July 31, 2020) in Suzhou Province, drawn from the China Chest Pain Center Database. RESULTS: 1965 STEMI admissions were enrolled. During the corresponding period of 2019 to the post COVID-19 era, there were a 53% and 38% fall in admissions in outbreak and the post era. There remained a gap in actual number of admissions at 306 and the predicted number that might be at 497. An estimated 26 deaths due to STEMI would have been caused by not seeking health care while no one died from COVID-19. The percentage of STEMI cases transferred by ambulance decreased from 9.3% to 4.2% (P=0.013). Door-to-balloon and the FMC-to-device median (q1, q3) time increased from 17.5 (10.0, 46.0) and 52.0 (12.0, 86.0) minutes to 34.0 (15.0, 48.0) and 63.0 (15.0, 94.0) minutes, respectively (p=0.001, p=0.005), and rate of PCI practice declined from 71.3% to 60.1% (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of public health restrictions in the post COVID-19 era is significant, and may lead to unexpected out-of-hospital deaths and compromised quality of STEMI care. Delay or absence in presentation in STEMI patients should be continuously considered to avoid the secondary disaster of the pandemic. System delay should be modifiable for reversing the worse clinical outcomes from the COVID-19 outbreak, by coordination measures with focus on the balance between timely PCI procedure and minimizing contamination of cardiac catheterization rooms.","Ma, Junxiong; Zhou, Suduo; Li, Na; Dong, Xuejie; Maimaitiming, Mailikezhati; Jin, Yinzi; Zheng, Zhi-Jie",Int J Clin Pract,395,21

The developmental origin of kidney DCs has been highly debated because of the large phenotypic overlap between macrophages and DCs in this tissue. METHODS: We used fate mapping, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and histo-cytometry to assess the origin and phenotypic and functional properties of renal DCs in healthy kidney and of DCs after cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury. RESULTS: Adult kidney contains at least four subsets of MPs with prominent Clec9a-expression history indicating a DC origin. We demonstrate that these populations are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct from each other. We also show these kidney MPs exhibit unique age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. Kidneys from newborn mice contain a prominent population of embryonic-derived MHCIInegF4/80hiCD11blow macrophages that express T cell Ig and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4) and MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK). These macrophages are replaced within a few weeks after birth by phenotypically similar cells that express MHCII but lack TIM-4 and MERTK. MHCII+F4/80hi cells exhibit prominent Clec9a-expression history in adulthood but not early life, indicating additional age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. In AKI, MHCIInegF4/80hi cells reappear in adult kidneys as a result of MHCII downregulation by resident MHCII+F4/80hi cells, possibly in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RNA sequencing further suggests MHCII+F4/80hi cells help coordinate the recruitment of inflammatory cells during renal injury. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct developmental programs contribute to renal DC and macrophage populations throughout life, which could have important implications for therapies targeting these cells.","Salei, Natallia; Rambichler, Stephan; Salvermoser, Johanna; Papaioannou, Nikos E; Schuchert, Ronja; Pakalniskyte, Dalia; Li, Na; Marschner, Julian A; Lichtnekert, Julia; Stremmel, Christopher; Cernilogar, Filippo M; Salvermoser, Melanie; Walzog, Barbara; Straub, Tobias; Schotta, Gunnar; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Schulz, Christian; Schraml, Barbara U",J Am Soc Nephrol,395,24

This study aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The multicenter study was conducted in 14 tertiary dermatology centers. Demographic data, treatment status, disease course, and cases of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with psoriasis using the immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS: Of 1827 patients included, the drug adherence rate was 68.2%. Those receiving anti-interleukin (anti-IL) drugs were more likely to continue treatment than patients receiving conventional drugs (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.181-1.895, p = .001). Disease worsening rate was 24.2% and drug dose reduction increased this rate 3.26 and drug withdrawal 8.71 times. Receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL drugs was associated with less disease worsening compared to conventional drugs (p = .038, p = .032; respectively). Drug withdrawal causes were 'unable to come' (39.6%), 'COVID concern' (25.3%), and 'physician's and patient's co-decision' (17.4%). Four patients had COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms. The incidence was 0.0022% while it was 0.0025% in the general population.

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the impact of disasters, including pandemics, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course. DESIGN: A systematic search was conducted in May 2020 using two electronic databases, EMBASE and Medline. All studies were screened in duplicate at title and abstract, and full-text level. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the association between a population-level or community disaster and cardiometabolic outcomes &#8805;1 month following the disaster. There were no restrictions on age, year of publication, country or population. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure (eg, type of disaster, region, year), cardiometabolic outcomes and measures of effect. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies were included, with 24 studies reporting the effects of exposure to disaster during pregnancy/childhood and 34 studies reporting the effects of exposure during adulthood. Studies included exposure to natural (n=35; 60%) and human-made (n=23; 40%) disasters, with only three (5%) of these studies evaluating previous pandemics. Most studies reported increased cardiometabolic risk, including increased cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality, diabetes and obesity, but not all. Few studies evaluated the biological mechanisms or high-risk subgroups that may be at a greater risk of negative health outcomes following disasters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that the burden of disasters extend beyond the known direct harm, and attention is needed on the detrimental indirect long-term effects on cardiometabolic health. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, these findings may inform public health prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of future cardiometabolic risk.

Despite global usage, uncertainty remains regarding plasma efficacy, as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided divergent evidence regarding the survival benefit of convalescent plasma. Here, we argue that during a global health emergency, the mosaic of evidence originating from multiple levels of the epistemic hierarchy should inform contemporary policy and healthcare decisions. Indeed, worldwide matched-control studies have generally found convalescent plasma to improve COVID-19 patient survival, and RCTs have demonstrated a survival benefit when transfused early in the disease course but limited or no benefit later in the disease course when patients required greater supportive therapies. RCTs have also revealed that convalescent plasma transfusion contributes to improved symptomatology and viral clearance. To further investigate the effect of convalescent plasma on patient mortality, we performed a meta-analytical approach to pool daily survival data from all controlled studies that reported Kaplan-Meier survival plots. Qualitative inspection of all available Kaplan-Meier survival data and an aggregate Kaplan-Meier survival plot revealed a directionally consistent pattern among studies arising from multiple levels of the epistemic hierarchy, whereby convalescent plasma transfusion was generally associated with greater patient survival. Given that convalescent plasma has a similar safety profile as standard plasma, convalescent plasma should be implemented within weeks of the onset of future infectious disease outbreaks.","Klassen, S.

It is suggested that excessive immune response in patients with COVID-19 could mimic this syndrome. Some COVID-19 autopsy studies have revealed the presence of haemophagocytosis images in bone marrow, raising the possibility, along with HScore parameters, of sHLH. AIM: Our objective is to ascertain the existence of sHLH in some patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We report the autopsy histological findings of 16 patients with COVID-19, focusing on the presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, obtained from rib squeeze and integrating these findings with HScore parameters. CD68 immunohistochemical stains were used to highlight histiocytes and haemophagocytic cells. Clinical evolution and laboratory parameters of patients were collected from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: Eleven patients (68.7%) displayed moderate histiocytic hyperplasia with haemophagocytosis (HHH) in bone marrow, three patients (18.7%) displayed severe HHH and the remainder were mild. All HScore parameters were collected in 10 patients (62.5%). Among the patients in which all parameters were evaluable, eight patients (80%) had an HScore >169. sHLH was not clinically suspected in any case. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the recommendation of some authors to use the HScore in patients with severe COVID-19 in order to identify those who could benefit from immunosuppressive therapies. The presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow tissue, despite not being a specific finding, has proved to be a very useful tool in our study to identify these patients.","Núñez-Torrón, Claudia; Ferrer-Gómez, Ana; Moreno Moreno, Esther; Pérez-Mies, Belen; Villarrubia, Jesús; Chamorro, Sandra; López-Jiménez, Javier; Palacios, J; Piris-Villaespesa, Miguel; García-Cosío, Mónica",J. clin. pathol,395,6

The prevalence of COVID-19 in orthopaedic populations will vary depending on the time and place where the sampling is performed. The idea that asymptomatic carriers play a role is generalizable but has not been studied in large populations of patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. We therefore evaluated this topic in one large, metropolitan city in a state that had the ninth-most infections in the United States at the time this study was completed (June 2020). This work was based on a screening and testing protocol that required all patients to be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in patients planning to undergo orthopaedic surgery in one major city, in order to provide other surgeons with a framework for assessing COVID-19 rates in their healthcare system? (2) How did patients with positive test results for COVID-19 differ in terms of age, sex, and orthopaedic conditions? (3) What proportion of patients had complications treated, and how many patients had a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days of surgery (recognizing that some may have been missed and so our estimates of event rates will necessarily underestimate the frequency of this event)? METHODS: All adult patients scheduled for surgery at four facilities (two tertiary care hospitals, one orthopaedic specialty hospital, and one ambulatory surgery center) at a single institution in the Philadelphia metropolitan area from April 27, 2020 to June 12, 2020 were included in this study. A total of 1295 patients were screened for symptoms, exposure, temperature, and oxygen saturation via a standardized protocol before surgical scheduling; 1.5% (19 of 1295) were excluded because they had COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, or recent travel based on the initial screening questionnaire, leaving 98.5% (1276 of 1295) who underwent testing for COVID-19 preoperatively. All 1276 patients who passed the initial screening test underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction before surgery. The mean age at the time of testing was 56 ± 16 years, and 53% (672 of 1276) were men. Eighty-seven percent (1106), 8% (103), and 5% (67) were tested via the Roche, Abbott, and Cepheid assays, respectively. All patients undergoing elective surgery were tested via the Roche assay, while those undergoing nonelective surgery received either the Abbott or Cepheid assay, based on availability. Patients with positive test results undergoing elective surgery had their procedures rescheduled, while patients scheduled for nonelective surgery underwent surgery regardless of their test results. Additionally, we reviewed the records of all patients at 30 days postoperatively for emergency room visits, readmissions, and COVID-19-related complications via electronic medical records and surgeon-reported complications. However, we had no method for definitively determining how many patients had complications, emergency department visits, or readmissions outside our system, so our event rate estimates for these endpoints are necessarily best-case estimates. RESULTS: A total of 0.5% (7 of 1276) of the patients tested positive for COVID-19: five via the Roche assay and two via the Abbott assay. Patients with positive test results were younger than those with negative results (39 ± 12 years versus 56 ± 16 years; p = 0.01). With the numbers available, we found no difference in the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 based on subspecialty area (examining the lowest and highest point estimates, respectively, we observed: trauma surgery [3%; 2 of 68 patients] versus hip and knee [0.3%; 1 of 401 patients], OR 12 [95% CI 1-135]; p = 0.06). No patients with negative preoperative test results for COVID-19 developed a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days postoperatively. Within 30 days of surgery, 0.9% (11 of 1276) of the patients presented to the emergency room, and 1.3% (16 of 1276) were readmitted for non-COVID-19-related complications. None of the patients with positive test results for COVID-19 preoperatively experienced complications. However, because some were likely treated outside our healthcare system, the actual percentages may be higher. CONCLUSION: Because younger patients are more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of disease, surgeons should emphasize the importance of taking proper precautions to prevent virus exposure preoperatively. Because the rates of COVID-19 infection differ based on city and time, surgeons should monitor the local prevalence of disease to properly advise patients on the risk of COVID-19 exposure. Further investigation is required to assess the prevalence in the orthopaedic population in cities with larger COVID-19 burdens.

Some of the biological effects of nicotine are well documented in in vitro and in vivo systems; however, data are scarce concerning the time-dependent changes on protein and phosphorylation events in response to nicotine. Here, we profiled the proteomes of SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines subjected to acute (15 min, 1 h and 4 h) or chronic (24 h, 48 h) nicotine exposures. We used sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) and quantified more than 9000 proteins and over 7000 phosphorylation events per cell line. Among our findings, we determined a decrease in mitochondrial protein abundance for SH-SY5Y, while we detected alterations in several immune pathways, such as the complement system, for A549 following nicotine treatment. We also explored the proposed association between smoking (specifically nicotine) and SARS-CoV2. Here, we found several host proteins known to interact with viral proteins that were affected by nicotine in a time dependent manner. This dataset can be mined further to investigate the potential role of nicotine in different biological contexts. SIGNIFICANCE: Smoking is a major public health issue that is associated with several serious chronic, yet preventable diseases, including stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and susceptibility to infection. Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different compounds, among which nicotine is the main addictive compound. The biological effects of nicotine have been reported in several models, however very little data are available concerning the temporal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in response to nicotine. Here, we provide a dataset exploring the potential role of nicotine on different biological processes over time, including implications in the study of SARS-CoV2.","Navarrete-Perea, José; Gygi, Steven P; Paulo, Joao A",J Proteomics,395,24

It is becoming increasingly important to understand teachers’ technology integration and distance learning adoption after a sudden implementation of the working-from- home policy as a precaution towards the further transmission of the virus. The present study examines the issues particularly regarding the used technologies, the process of distance learning, and the teachers’ distance learning adoption levels. This study was conducted using an online survey involving 572 teachers in Indonesia. The results reveal that teachers tend to use devices and applications for remote instruction that already they used for daily life, and global applications are more likely chosen by teachers for managing virtual classrooms rather than the local ones. The teachers stand on an enhancement level of technology integration thus yet integrate technology as a transformation of learning. Most teachers have immediately prepared for teaching remotely when the working-from-home policy has been implemented so that they can be categorised as early adopters of distance learning. Teachers’ agility in adopting distance learning during the crisis raises an optimistic signal to effectively adapt and adopt remote instruction to formal school environments in the future. Since the current study has only examined teachers in one country regardless of teaching subjects and school levels, a cross-national study on a specific subject and school level is needed in the next study. © 2021.

In this communication, we aimed to evaluate the significance of CD147 protein and the potential protective effect of melatonin that is mediated by this protein in COVID-19. CD147 is a glycoprotein that is responsible for the cytokine storm in the lungs through the mediation of viral invasion. Melatonin use previously was shown to reduce cardiac damage by blocking the CD147 activity. Hence, melatonin, a safe drug, may prevent severe symptoms, reduce symptom severity and the adverse effects of the other antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the use of melatonin, which is reduced in the elderly and immune-compromised patients, should be considered as an adjuvant through its CD147 suppressor and immunomodulatory effect.","Sehirli, Ahmet Ozer; Sayiner, Serkan; Serakinci, Nedime",Mol Biol Rep,395,1

The goal of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.70, p < 0.001). Additionally, BNP levels were also significantly higher in patients who died or were critically ill (WMD 0.45, 95% CI - 0.21-0.69, p < 0.001).

Whether the nature of the two groups is the same but in the spectrum of different diagnostic time points is not certain. METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who needed oxygen therapy from February to November 2020 were included in the study. The patients were divided into early and late groups based on the time when the oxygen requirement occurred. Basic and epidemiologic characteristics were compared. Clinical variables were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients needed oxygen therapy, 94 of whom were in the early group and 70 of whom were in the late group. The early and late groups had similar baseline characteristics except age (median age, 73 vs. 67 years), uncertain exposure history (50% vs. 31.4%) and the time from the onset of illness to admission (median, 5 vs. 2 days). Multivariate analysis showed that age > 65 years (OR, 4.65), symptom onset > 5 days (OR, 9.13) and several clinical manifestations, such as febrile sensation (OR, 6.01), dyspnea (OR, 30.0), C-reactive protein > 1 mg/dL (OR, 7.87) and chest X-ray abnormality (OR, 8.15), were predictive factors in the early group. The early group required more intensive care such as mechanical ventilation care, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and death (29.8% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Older age, especially > 65 years, and a delay of over 5 days from the onset of illness to admission were associated with early oxygen demand in COVID-19 patients.

Investigated experiences included exposure to COVID-19-related news, having being in close proximity to people with a COVID-19 diagnosis or with COVID-19-like symptoms, having being sick or having suffered COVID-19-like symptoms, having tested negative for COVID-19. METHODS: Adults from northern Italy (n = 326; M age = 29.86) provided cross-sectional data through an online survey during the nationwide lockdown period. Structural equation modelling analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Perceived and anticipated stigma, exposure to COVID-19 news, perceived threat and impact on material resources access were negatively and indirectly related to both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being via perceived COVID-19 psychological impact which served as a mediator. Perceived stigma was also directly and negatively related to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, whereas having tested negative for COVID diagnosis was positively and directly associated with eudaimonic well-being. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related stigma and appraisals can impair positive feelings about life as well as the pursuit of self-realization and the search for meaning in life. The findings highlight the importance of developing psychological preventive and rehabilitative interventions to help people cope with these risk factors.","Paleari, F Giorgia; Pivetti, Monica; Galati, Desirèe; Fincham, Frank D",Br. j. health psychol,395,27

We examined the epidemiological patterns of seven common respiratory viruses in children presenting to EDs with influenza-like illness (ILI). Additionally, we examined the co-occurrence of viral infections in the accompanying adults and risk factors associated with the acquisition of these viruses. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab were collected from children seeking medical care for ILI and their accompanying adults (Total N = 1315). Study sites included New York Presbyterian, Bellevue, and Tisch hospitals in New York City. PCR using a respiratory viral panel was conducted, and data on symptoms and medical history were collected. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 399 children (62.25%) and 118 (17.5%) accompanying adults. The most frequent pathogen detected was human rhinovirus (HRV) (28.81%). Co-infection rates were 14.79% in children and 8.47% in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza infections occurred more often in younger children. Influenza and HRV occurred more often in older children. Influenza and coronavirus were mostly isolated in winter and spring, RSV in fall and winter and HRV in fall and spring. Children with HRV were more likely to have history of asthma. Adults with the same virus as their child often accompanied &#8804; 2-year-old-positive children and were more likely to be symptomatic compared to adults with different viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses, while presenting the same suite of symptoms, possess distinct seasonal cycles and affect individuals differently based on a number of identifiable factors, including age and history of asthma.","Matienzo, Nelsa; Youssef, Mariam M; Comito, Devon; Lane, Benjamin; Ligon, Chanel; Morita, Haruka; Winchester, Arianna; Decker, Mary E; Dayan, Peter; Shopsin, Bo; Shaman, Jeffrey",Influenza other respir. viruses,395,16

While many scientists worldwide are trying to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of the disease and its relationship with other diseases, they are trying to find drugs that can treat Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It is reported that the incidence of COVID-19 increases in cardiovascular diseases and associated conditions such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension in studies. That is why a large number of scientists are now questioning the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) antagonists, angiotensin-2 (Ang-2) receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers), and ACEs in COVID-19 patients. When all these facts are considered together, their potential effects may be more significant. Some researchers stated that RAS inhibitors might amplify COVID-19 severity. Per the classical knowledge, ACE-2 regulates RAS by converting Ang-2 to angiotensin-(1-7), which has antioxidant, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and protective effects on many cell types, especially cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. Local and systemic RAS components such as ACE-2, ACE, and Ang-2 and their interactions are pretty complex. However, numerous reported RAS substrates and enzymes are synthesized intracellularly in many cell types. This review highlights that the intracellular RAS may have prominent roles in developing potential treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Çiçek, Zehra",Gülhane Tip Dergisi,395,26

Hence, this case study aims at assessing the changes in both parents and teacher's involvement and practices, respectively as perceived by students. Ten parents, their respective children from an intact class of Grade 8 students in a public high school were randomly selected as respondents of the study. Five teachers from the same grade levels were also interviewed. A validated interview questionnaire was used as guide to illicit responses from the respondents through Google Meet and personal messaging. Answers were transcribed and thematically analyzed though qualitative software Quirkos. Quirk size per themes were basis for tabulation and referred for further grouping per category. Results showed that material and emotional support of the parents were recognized as the primary parental involvement in the schooling of the child at home. Parents value to continue education and recognize the need to adapt in the new normal of schooling. Monitoring offline and online activities at home, teaching the concept, and building communication with the child are strategies employed to help understand science concept. Parents perceived communication with school through teachers for updates as the most important factor for them to execute their roles. Teachers are easy to deal with and can easily resolved problems regarding academic issues of the child however they are challenged with teacher's availability, attitudes, time constraints and internet connections. Teachers involved stakeholders, initiate, and reciprocate the communication stablished by parents through messaging and portal through social media platform but are confronted with parents and students who seldom goes online. The use of various learning materials and assessment delivered in various modalities are teachers' mechanism to strengthen science concept the way parents recognize teachers' pedagogic capabilities. Students highly appreciate actions taken both by parents and teachers and acknowledge the need for parental program to be beneficial. Internet connectivity, knowledge on the use of technology for distance learning and capacity on digital literacy are factors that limits the three group of respondents.

This trial aims to evaluate sofosbuvir and daclatasvir versus standard care for outpatients with mild COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial in outpatients with mild COVID-19. Patients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus hydroxychloroquine or a control arm receiving hydroxychloroquine alone. The primary endpoint of the trial was symptom alleviation after 7 days of follow-up. The secondary endpoint of the trial was hospital admission. Fatigue, dyspnoea and loss of appetite were investigated after 1 month of follow-up. This study is registered with the IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200403046926N1. RESULTS: Between 8 April 2020 and 19 May 2020, 55 patients were recruited and allocated to either the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir treatment arm (n = 27) or the control arm (n = 28). Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. There was no significant difference in symptoms at Day 7. One patient was admitted to hospital in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and four in the control arm, but the difference was not significant. After 1 month of follow-up, two patients reported fatigue in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and 16 in the control arm; P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir did not significantly alleviate symptoms after 7 days of treatment compared with control. Although fewer hospitalizations were observed in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm, this was not statistically significant. Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir significantly reduced the number of patients with fatigue and dyspnoea after 1 month. Larger, well-designed trials are warranted.","Roozbeh, Fatemeh; Saeedi, Majid; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Akbar; Merat, Shahin; Wentzel, Hannah; Levi, Jacob; Hill, Andrew; Shamshirian, Amir",J Antimicrob Chemother,395,16

In situ stabilization is an effective and low-cost method to remediate heavy metal-contaminated sediment. In this study, a red mud-based low-cost composite (RMM) was used to stabilize heavy metal-contaminated sediment. RMM was mixed with heavy metal-contaminated sediment at the doses of 0%, 1%, 3% and 5%. The CaCl2-extractable, DTPA-extractable, leachability (TCLP) and heavy metal fractions were analysed to evaluate the stabilization efficiency of RMM for heavy metals. The selected properties and microbial activities of the sediment were analysed to verify the safety of RMM to sediment. The results showed that RMM reduced the DTPA-, CaCl2- and TCLP-extractable heavy metals in sediment. At an RMM dose of 5%, DTPA-, CaCl2- and TCLP- extractable heavy metals were reduced by 7.60%, 72.34% and 69.24% for Pb; 18.20%, 76.7% and 23.57% for Cd; 32.7%, 96.50% and 49.64% for Zn; and 35.0%, 61.20% and 55.27% for Ni, respectively. TCLP- and DTPA-extractable Cu was reduced by 71.15% and 12.90%, respectively. In contrast, CaCl2-extractable Cu increased obviously after the application of RMM. RMM reduced the acid-soluble fraction of Zn by 6.99% and increased the residual fraction of Ni by 4.28%. However, the influence of RMM on the fractions of Pb, Cd and Cu was nonsignificant. In addition, the application of RMM increased the pH values of the sediment, and the microbial activity in the sediment was also obviously enhanced. These results indicated that RMM has great potential in the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated sediment.","Ma, Xiaoyu; Ren, Qiang; Zhan, Wenhao; Hu, Chao; Zhao, Mengke; Tian, Yuan; Liao, Qi; Yang, Zhihui; Wang, Yangyang",,395,26

OBJECTIVE: In this context, we decided to study certain consequences of the abundant cytokine release over the innate and adaptive immune systems, inflammation, and hemostasis, comparing mild and severe forms of COVID-19. METHODS: To accomplish these aims, we will analyze demographic characteristics, biochemical tests, immune biomarkers, leukocyte phenotyping, immunoglobulin profile, hormonal release (cortisol and prolactin), gene expression, thromboelastometry, neutralizing antibodies, metabolic profile, and neutrophil function (reactive oxygen species production, neutrophil extracellular trap production, phagocytosis, migration, gene expression, and proteomics). A total of 200 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups: mild/moderate or severe/critical forms of COVID-19. Blood samples will be collected at different times: at inclusion and after 9 and 18 days, with an additional 3-day sample for severe patients. We believe that this information will provide more knowledge for future studies that will provide more robust and useful clinical information that may allow for better decisions at the front lines of health care. RESULTS: The recruitment began in June 2020 and is still in progress. It is expected to continue until February 2021. Data analysis is scheduled to start after all data have been collected.

The visual analog scales were used to study difficulties related to maintaining self-isolation/social distancing, the intensity of information flow, and the extent of psychological stress. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess affective symptoms. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-squared-and Fisher exact tests. Mann-Whitney tests were used for numeric data. Spearman’s correlation were calculated for associations between self-isolation/social distancing and the perception thereof. Results. In total, 30.3 % of respondents experienced substantial difficulties in maintaining self-isolation/social distancing. Their proportion was higher among those frequently watching, reading or listening to news about COVID-19 (41.7 % vs. 20.0 %, р &lt; 0.001), and getting the information from online bloggers (42.9 % vs. 26.8 %, р = 0.03).

Conversely, waiting too long leads to losing elderly patients who could have been saved by ventilators. As age and sex are major determinants of mortality by Covid-19 and have the merit, in contrast to other priority criteria, of being immediately available to health professionals, the criterion is the minimization of the mean mortality rate weighted by age- and sex-specific life expectancies. The dynamics is a queuing process involving mortality and return home flows and competition between ages.

But the information about cardiac consequences of COVID-19 after recovery is limited. The aim of the study was comprehensive echocardiography assessment of right ventricular (RV) in patients recovered from COVID-19. This is a prospective, single-center study. After recovery from COVID-19, echocardiography was performed in consecutive 79 patients that attended follow-up visits from July 15 to November 30, 2020. According to the recovery at home vs hospital, patients were divided into two groups: home recovery (n = 43) and hospital recovery (n = 36). Comparisons were made with age, sex and risk factor-matched control group (n = 41). In addition to conventional echocardiography parameters, RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) and RV free wall strain (RV-FWS) were determined using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE). Of the 79 patients recovered from COVID-19, 43 (55%) recovered at home, while 36 (45%) required hospitalization. The median follow-up duration was 133 ± 35 (87-184) days. In patients recovered from hospital, RV-GLS and RV-FWS were impaired compared to control group (RV-GLS: -17.3 ± 6.8 vs. -20.4 ± 4.9, respectively [p = 0.042]; RV-FWS: -19.0 ± 8.2 vs. -23.4 ± 6.2, respectively [p = 0.022]).

We address the question which mechanism is more effective for prohibiting disease propagation in a connected network: adaptive clustering, which mimics self-isolation (SI) in local communities, or sharp instant clustering, which looks like frontiers closing (FC) between cities and countries? Since in reality cross-community connections always survive, we can wonder how efficient is the excitation (illness) propagation through the entire clustered network which has some density of inter-cluster connections. Crucial difference between SI- and FC-networks is as follows: SI-networks are""adaptively grown""under condition of maximization of small cliques in the entire network, while FC-networks are""instantly created""by \emph{ad hoc} imposed borders. We found that SI model has scale-free property for degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{\eta}$ with surprisingly small critical exponent $-2<\eta<-1$. Running the standard SIR model on clustered SI- and FC-networks, we demonstrate that the adaptive network clustering caused by self-isolation in communities prohibits the epidemic spread better than the clustering due to instant boundaries closing.","Valba, O.; Avetisov, V.; Gorsky, A.; Nechaev, S.",,395,24

Although asymptomatic cases are not unique to COVID-19, the high asymptomatic case rate raised many problems for developing effective public health interventions. The current modeling effort explored how asymptomatic transmission might impact pandemic responses in four key areas: isolation procedures, changes in reproduction rate, the potential for reduced transmission from asymptomatic cases, and social adherence to public health measures. A high rate of asymptomatic cases effectively requires large-scale public health suppression and mitigation procedures given that quarantine procedures alone could not prevent an outbreak for a virus such as SARS-CoV-2. This problem only becomes worse without lowering the effective reproduction rate, and even assuming the potential for reduced transmission, any virus with a high degree of asymptomatic transmission will likely produce a pandemic. Finally, there is a concern that asymptomatic individuals will also refuse to adhere to public health guidance. Analyses indicate that, given certain assumptions, even half of the population adhering to public health guidance could reduce the peak and flatten the curve by over 90%. Taken together, these analyses highlight the importance of taking asymptomatic cases into account when modeling viral spread and developing public health intervention strategies.","Biggs, Adam T; Littlejohn, Lanny F",Risk anal,395,10

The disease has affected more than 200 countries, and the measures that have been implemented to combat its spread, as there is still no vaccine or definitive medication, have been based on supportive interventions and drug repositioning. Brazil, the largest country in South America, has had more than 140,000 recorded deaths and is one of the most affected countries. Despite the extensive quantity of scientifically recognized information, there are still conflicting discussions on how best to face the disease and the virus, especially with regard to social distancing, preventive methods, and the use of medications. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the Brazilian population's basic knowledge about COVID-19 to demonstrate how Brazilians are managing to identify scientifically proven information. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. An original online questionnaire survey was administered from June 16 to August 21, 2020, across all five different geopolitical regions of the country (ie, the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South). The questionnaire was comprised of questions about basic aspects of COVID-19, such as the related symptoms, conduct that should be followed when suspected of infection, risk groups, prevention, transmission, and social distancing. The wrong questionnaire response alternatives were taken from the fake news combat website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Participants (aged &#8805;18 years) were recruited through social networking platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The mean distributions, frequencies, and similarities or dissimilarities between the responses for the different variables of the study were evaluated. The significance level for all statistical tests was less than .05. RESULTS: A total of 4180 valid responses representative of all the states and regions of Brazil were recorded. Most respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, getting an average of 86.59% of the total score with regard to the basic aspects of the disease. The region, education level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association (P<.001) with knowledge about the disease, which meant that women, the young, those with higher education levels, nonrecipients of social assistance, and more economically and socially developed regions had more correct answers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Brazilians with social media access have a good level of basic knowledge about COVID-19 but with differences depending on the analyzed subgroup. Due to the limitation of the platform used in carrying out the study, care should be taken when generalizing the study findings to populations with less education or who are not used to accessing social networking platforms.","Guimarães, Vinícius Henrique Almeida; de Oliveira-Leandro, Maísa; Cassiano, Carolina; Marques, Anna Laura Piantino; Motta, Clara; Freitas-Silva, Ana Letícia; de Sousa, Marlos Aureliano Dias; Silveira, Luciano Alves Matias; Pardi, Thiago César; Gazotto, Fernanda Castro; Silva, Marcos Vinícius; Rodrigues, Virmondes; Rodrigues, Wellington Francisco; Oliveira, Carlo Jose Freire",JMIR Public Health Surveill,395,18

This treatment can cause many severe cardiac side effects that makes us discuss its utility. The aim of this study is to describe the cardiovascular effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin by analyzing surface ECG in patients with COVID-19. This observational cohort study included Moroccan patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and were hospitalized in Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco between March 26 and April 20, 2020. Patients were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least ten days. We were interested in the effects of this combination on the electrocardiogram. A total of 118 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. QT interval prolongation was observed in 19% of patients under the treatment. Only 5 patients required discontinuation of treatment. The factors associated with QT prolongation are male gender (P value 0,043), age over 68 years (P value 0,09), cardiovascular comorbidity (P value 0,013), tisdale score ≥11 (P value &lt; 0,001), and a severe form of COVID-19 (P value &lt; 0,001). First degree atrioventricular block was observed in 2 patients. No serious rhythm or conduction disorders were observed in this study. QT prolongation is a real risk with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In the current context, it is necessary to select patients at high risk of severe rhythm disturbances that require closer ECG monitoring. Treatment should be discontinued if there are alarming signs such as QTc prolongation beyond 550 ms and the development of ventricular extrasystole or torsade de pointe.","El Ouarradi, Amal; Abdeladim, Salma; Oualim, Sara; Aniq Filali, Rita; Bensahi, Ilham; Elharass, Mahassine; Hafid, Sara; Tazi, Hamza; Naitlhou, Abdelhamid; Bouaiti, E.

Here, experiments with 18 pseudotyped viruses showed that the 501Y.V2 variants do not confer increased infectivity in multiple cell types except for murine ACE2-overexpressing cells, where a substantial increase in infectivity was observed. Notably, the susceptibility of the 501Y.V2 variants to 12 of 17 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was substantially diminished, and the neutralization ability of the sera from convalescent patients and immunized mice was also reduced for these variants. The neutralization resistance was mainly caused by E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor-binding domain of spike. The enhanced infectivity in murine ACE2-overexpressing cells suggests the possibility of spillover of the 501Y.V2 variants to mice. Moreover, the neutralization resistance we detected for the 501Y.V2 variants suggests the potential for compromised efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.","Li, Qianqian; Nie, Jianhui; Wu, Jiajing; Zhang, Li; Ding, Ruxia; Wang, Haixin; Zhang, Yue; Li, Tao; Liu, Shuo; Zhang, Mengyi; Zhao, Chenyan; Liu, Huan; Nie, Lingling; Qin, Haiyang; Wang, Meng; Lu, Qiong; Li, Xiaoyu; Liu, Junkai; Liang, Haoyu; Shi, Yi; Shen, Yuelei; Xie, Liangzhi; Zhang, Linqi; Qu, Xiaowang; Xu, Wenbo; Huang, Weijin; Wang, Youchun",Cell,395,23

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,481 adult breast cancer survivors who were active members of a large California integrated healthcare plan in 2020. We collected data on their breast cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, and demographic characteristics. We examined SARS-CoV-2 testing utilization between March 2020 and September 2020 by race or ethnicity, comorbidity, and other patient characteristics. We also examined the correlates of a having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of testing utilization and test positivity. RESULTS: Of these 22,481 women, 3,288 (14.6%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The cohort included 51.8% women of color. Of the 3,288 tested, 264 (8.0%) women had a positive test result. In multivariable analyses, Latinx survivors were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.34) to undergo testing than White survivors; however, Asian or Pacific Islander survivors were 16% less likely to get tested (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94). Compared to White survivors, Latinx survivors were 3.5 times (adjusted OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.52 to 4.77) and Asian or Pacific Islander or Other survivors were 2.2-fold (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.34) more likely to test positive. Being overweight (adjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.72) or obese (adjusted OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.98) were also strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. CONCLUSION: Even in an integrated healthcare system, Asian or Pacific Islander patients were less likely to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing than White survivors, but more likely to test positive. Additionally, Latinx ethnicity and high body mass index were strongly correlated with a greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity.","Haque, Reina; Chen, LieHong",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,395,24

CP exercise testing (CPET) is routinely used in clinical practice to diagnose CPD and assess prognosis; assess cardiovascular safety for rehabilitation; and delineate the physiological contributors to exercise intolerance and exertional fatigue. As such, CPET plays an important role in clinical assessments of convalescent COVID-19 patients as well as research aimed at understanding the long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the ventilatory expired gas analysis involved with CPET, the procedure is considered an aerosol generating procedure. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken by health care providers and exercise physiologists performing these tests. This paper provides recommendations for CPET testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations include indications for CPET; pre-screening assessments; precautions required for testing; and suggested decontamination protocols. These safety recommendations are aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during CPET.","Mihalick, Virginia L; Canada, Justin M; Arena, Ross; Abbate, Antonio; Kirkman, Danielle L",Prog. cardiovasc. dis,395,5
274519,274519,274519,Cardiac Involvement in Covid-19: Insights from a Safety Net Urban Hospital,18.476463,9.900058,2021,"BACKGROUND: Until now, no antiviral treatment has been proven to be effective for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The timing of oxygen therapy was considered to have a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with insufficient medical resources, but the evidence on the timing of oxygen therapy is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical charts review was carried out to collect the data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed in Tongji hospital, Wuhan from 30th December 2019 to 8th March 2020. In this study, the appropriate timing of oxygen therapy and risk factors associated with severe and fatal illness were identified and the effectiveness of antivirus on disease progression was assessed. Among 1362 patients, the prevalence of hypoxia symptoms was significantly higher in those patients with severe and fatal illness than in those with less severe disease. The onset of hypoxia symptoms was most common in the second to third week after symptom onset, and patients with critical and fatal illness experienced these symptoms earlier than those with mild and severe illness. In multivariable analyses, the risk of death increased significantly when oxygen therapy was started more than 2 days after hypoxia symptoms onset among critical patients (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.20 to 3.10). Compared to the critically ill patients without IFN-a, the patients who were treated with IFN-a had a lower mortality (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.39 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of oxygen therapy was associated with lower mortality among critical patients. This study highlighted the importance of early oxygen therapy after the onset of hypoxia symptoms. Our results also lend support to potentially beneficial effects of IFN&#945; on critical illness.","Long, Lu; Wu, Liang; Chen, Lang; Zhou, Daixing; Wu, Hongyu; Lu, Donghao; Li, Honglin; Duan, Xiaoxia; Han, Yutong; Li, Xianzhi; Wang, Qiuxia; Zhang, Jing",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,395,2

METHODS: Case-control study conducted March 15 to June 15, 2020. Cases were infants born to mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at delivery. The infant of non COVID-19 mother born before and after each case were selected as controls. RESULTS: Of 695 deliveries, 62 (8.9%) infants were born to COVID-19 mothers; 124 controls were selected. Among cases, 18.3% were preterm compared to 8.1% in controls (p=0.04). In preterm cases, birth weight was not significantly different between groups. However, there was a significantly higher proportion of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, need for respiratory support, suspected sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, feeding intolerance and longer length of stay (LOS) in preterm cases. Among term cases, birth weight and adverse outcomes were not significantly different between cases and controls except for more feeding intolerance in cases. All infants born to COVID-19 mothers were COVID-19 negative at 24 and 48 h of life. No infants expired during birth hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly, more infants of COVID-19 mothers were premature compared to controls. Preterm cases were more likely to have adverse outcomes despite having similar birth weight and gestational age. These differences were not seen among full term infants. Health care providers should anticipate the need for NICU care when a COVID-19 mother presents in labor.","Zgutka, Kinga; Prasanth, Kaninghat; Pinero-Bernardo, Shirley; Lew, Lily Q; Cervellione, Kelly; Rhythm, Rhythm; Rahman, Lubna; Dolmaian, Gigliola; Cohen, Lourdes",J Perinat Med,395,14

There is convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine has strong in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. A few small uncontrolled trials and several anecdotal reports have shown conflicting results of such drug therapy in COVID-19. However, the results of preliminary large-scale randomized controlled trials have failed to show any survival benefit of such drug therapy in COVID-19.

Methods and procedures We studied and treated 32 COVID-19 patients from 9/3 to 30/4/2020. The following nutritional targets were followed in all patients ⁃ start of enteral nutrition within 24/48 hours ⁃ protein target&gt; = 1.3 g / kg ⁃ Caloric target 20/25 kcal / kg ⁃ Use of enteral mixtures rich in whey protein ⁃ Daily monitoring of prealbumin Results We observed that the 95% of patients presented a significant increase in prealbumin values (figure1) All patients who achieved a prealbumin value &gt; 20 during hospitalization in ICU had a lower mortality.

Little is known, at the country level, where and how patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have been mostly affected. METHODS: Survey of the network of Nephrology centers using a simplified 17 items electronic questionnaire designed by Italian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Research Group. We used spatial epidemiology and geographical information systems to map SARS-CoV-2 spread among RRT patients in Italy. RESULTS: On April 9th 2020, all nephrology centers (n = 454) listed in the DialMap database were invited to complete the electronic questionnaire. Within 11 days on average, 365 centers responded (80.4% response rate; 2.3% margin of error) totaling 60,441 RRT patients. The surveyed RRT population included 30,821 hemodialysis (HD), 4139 peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 25,481 transplanted (Tx) patients respectively. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive RRT patients in Italy was 2.26% (95% CI 2.14-2.39) with significant differences according to treatment modality (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in HD (3.55% [95% CI 3.34-3.76]) than PD (1.38% [95% CI 1.04-1.78] and Tx (0.86% [95% CI 0.75-0.98]) (p < 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity across regions and along the latitude gradient (p < 0.001). In RRT patients the highest rate was in the north-west (4.39% [95% CI 4.11-4.68], followed by the north-east (IR 2.06% [1.79-2.36]), the center (0.91% [0.75-1.09]), the main islands (0.67% [0.47-0.93]), and the south (0.59% [0.45-0.75]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, among SARS-Cov-2 positive RRT patients the fatality rate was 32.8%, as compared to 13.3% observed in the Italian population as of April 23rd. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of the 60,441 surveyed RRT patients in Italy were SARS-Cov-2 positive and subsequently died during the exponential phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Infection risk and rates seems to differ substantially across regions, along geographical latitude, and by treatment modality.","Quintaliani, Giuseppe; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Di Napoli, Anteo; Nordio, Maurizio; Limido, Aurelio; Aucella, Filippo; Messa, Piergiorgio; Brunori, Giuliano",J Nephrol,395,26

To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them We show that the incidence of COVID-19 cases as of July 2020 can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates We then re-evaluate these findings in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in Madagascar through August 2020 This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of a growing health crisis If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar for the coming year, hence the importance of clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare","Evans, M.

It is estimated that in the US, 35,000-100,000 contact tracers will be hired (and trained) to talk to recently-infected individuals, understand who they have exposed to the virus, and encourage those exposed to self-quarantine. The Center for Disease Control recommends the use of motivational interviewing (MI) by contact tracers to encourage compliance with contact tracing/quarantine. Contact tracers need to sensitively communicate with COVID-19-exposed individuals who may also be experiencing other issues caused by the pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, grief, anger, intimate partner violence, health problems, food insecurity, and/or unemployment. Social workers are particularly prepared to address the mental health and other psychosocial problems that may be encountered in the tracing process. This article describes contact tracing, its use in other diseases, the role of MI, psychosocial issues that contact tracers may encounter, and how social work can respond to these needs. A sample dialogue of contact tracing using MI is presented with a discussion of the content and skills used in the process.","Hohman, Melinda; McMaster, Fiona; Woodruff, Susan I",Clin Soc Work J,395,16

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of CT in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral infections using a standardized reporting classification. METHODS: A total of 175 consecutive patients were retrospectively identified from a single tertiary-care medical center from March 15 to March 24, 2020, including 87 with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 and 88 with negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test, but positive respiratory pathogen panel. Two thoracic radiologists, who were blinded to RT-PCR and respiratory pathogen panel results, reviewed chest CT images independently and classified the imaging findings under 4 categories: ""typical"" appearance, ""indeterminate,"" ""atypical,"" and ""negative"" for pneumonia. The final classification was based on consensus between the readers. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 were older than patients with other viral infections (P=0.038). The inter-rater agreement of CT categories between the readers ranged from good to excellent, &#954;=0.80 (0.73 to 0.87). Final CT categories were statistically different among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups (P<0.001). CT ""typical"" appearance was more prevalent in the COVID-19 group (64/87, 73.6%) than in the non-COVID-19 group (2/88, 2.3%). When considering CT ""typical"" appearance as a positive test, a sensitivity of 73.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63%-82.4%), specificity of 97.7% (95% CI: 92%-99.7%), positive predictive value of 97% (95% CI: 89.5%-99.6%), and negative predictive value of 78.9% (95% CI: 70%-86.1%) were observed. CONCLUSION: The standardized chest CT classification demonstrated high specificity and positive predictive value in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral infections when presenting a ""typical"" appearance in a high pretest probability environment. Good to excellent inter-rater agreement was found regarding the CT standardized categories between the readers.","Borges da Silva Teles, Gustavo; Kaiser Uruhary Nunes Fonseca, Eduardo; Yokoo, Patricia; Marques Almeida Silva, Murilo; Yanata, Elaine; Shoji, Hamilton; Bastos Duarte Passos, Rodrigo; Caruso Chate, Rodrigo; Szarf, Gilberto",J. thorac imaging,395,4

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon. METHODS: To have an idea of the global changes in 5' and 3'-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by 'RBPmap' and 'RNA22 v2' respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue. RESULTS: We identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV-2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5'-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3'UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov-2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.","Mukherjee, Moumita; Goswami, Srikanta",PLoS One,395,19

Design/methodology/approach A review of the relevant literature on the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry, airports and tourism sector are undertaken to understand the link between them. The paper begins by explaining the effects of the pandemic on the aviation industry and discusses its impact in the Andalusian region. Furthermore, this study uses secondary data from IATA, AENA, EUROCONTROL, INE, OAG, UNTWO, etc., to support research results. Findings The results of the effects of the pandemic in Andalusia are being devastating and this destination is heavily dependent on tourism. The drastic drop in flight frequencies at airports during the pandemic has caused an average decrease of -65% in passenger arrivals at airports until October 2020 that is 23 million passengers, too many passengers for the Andalusian economy, which depends mainly on the tourism sector. Originality/value The study contributes toward assessing the COVID-19 effects on the aviation industry and tourist destinations. Both sectors will re-emerge in the medium term and at different speeds in different regions.

METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study with 5847 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. Patients were separated in two groups, with/without previous lung disease. Evaluation of factors associated with survival and secondary composite end-point such as ICU admission and respiratory support, were explored. RESULTS: 1,271 patients (22%) had a previous lung disease, mostly COPD. All-cause mortality occurred in 376 patients with lung disease (29.5%) and in 819 patients without (17.9%) (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with lung diseases had a worse 30-day survival (HR=1.78; 95%C.I. 1.58-2.01; p<0.001) and COPD had almost 40% mortality. Multivariable Cox regression showed that prior lung disease remained a risk factor for mortality (HR, 1.21; 95%C.I. 1.02-1.44; p=0.02). Variables independently associated with all-cause mortality risk in patients with lung diseases were oxygen saturation less than 92% on admission (HR, 4.35; 95% CI 3.08-6.15) and elevated D-dimer (HR, 1.84; 95% CI 1.27-2.67). Age younger than 60 years (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.21-0.65) was associated with decreased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Previous lung disease is a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Older age, male gender, home oxygen therapy, and respiratory failure on admission were associated with an increased mortality. Efforts must be done to identify respiratory patients to set measures to improve their clinical outcomes.","Signes-Costa, Jaime; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Soriano, Joan B; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Eid, Charbel Maroun; Romero, Rodolfo; Uribarri, Aitor; Fernández-Rozas, Inmaculada; Aguado, Marcos García; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel; Huang, Jia; Pepe, Martino; Cerrato, Enrico; Raposeiras, Sergio; Gonzalez, Adelina; Franco-Leon, Francisco; Wang, Lin; Alfonso, Emilio; Ugo, Fabrizio; García-Prieto, Juan Fortunato; Feltes, Gisela; Abumayyaleh, Mohammad; Espejo-Paeres, Carolina; Jativa, Jorge; Masjuan, Alvaro López; Macaya, Carlos; Carbonell Asíns, Juan A; Estrada, Vicente",Arch. bronconeumol.

A total of 44 of 112 (39.3%) surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 as detected by real-time PCR, suggesting extensive contamination, although all of the air samples were negative. In particular, in a single room occupied by an asymptomatic patient, four sites were SARS-CoV-2 positive, highlighting that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients do contaminate their surroundings and impose risks for others with close contact. Placement of COVID-19 patients in rooms with negative pressure may bring a false feeling of safety, and the importance of rigorous environment cleaning should be emphasized.IMPORTANCE Although it has been well recognized that the virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, can be acquired by exposure to fomites, surprisingly, the contamination of patients' surroundings by SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown, as there have been few studies.

Eleven patients who had been diagnosed with critically ill COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance, received invasive ventilation, and were finally successfully weaned from it, were enrolled in our study. Their presenting symptoms, comorbidity conditions, laboratory values, ICU course, ventilator parameters, treatments, and relative complications were recorded.Of 108 critically ill COVID-19 patients who received invasive ventilation, 11 patients who underwent tracheal extubation or terminal weaning were included. The mean age of the 11 patients was 52.8âyears (range, 38-70âyears), 8 (72.7%) were male, and 2 were health care workers. The median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 6.6âdays (range, 3-13âdays), and the median duration of IMV was 15.7âdays (range, 6-29âdays). All 11 patients presented with acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and received IMV, and 1 patient switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance. A lung-protective strategy with lower tidal volume ventilation and proper driving pressure is the main strategy of IMV. All patients had extrapulmonary manifestations, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, myocardial damage, and/or lymphopenia. Hospital-acquired infections occurred in 7 (63.6%) patients.Critical COVID-19 illness is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and subsequent dysfunction of other organs with a high mortality rate. Correct ventilation strategies and other clinical strategies to improve oxygenation based on the skilled trained group and the availability of equipment are the key methods to rescue lives.","Liu, Yulan; Xie, Wenjie; Meng, Yang; Sun, Lifang; Yan, Juanjuan; Dong, Weiguo; Zhou, Chenliang; Yu, Zhui",Medicine (Baltimore),395,26

Telerehabilitation approaches were mostly implemented during this lockdown for children with autistic problems (66.6%), stroke (12.9%), cerebral palsy (6.4%), learning disabilities (9.6%), Parkinson's diseases (1.6%), and other medical conditions (2.8%). 10% of therapists reported that they lost their job, and 76% reported that this lockdown affected their income negatively. Overall, 87.8% of therapists reported that mobile technology was very useful to overcome the stress due to COVID-19 related lockdown, social isolation, and social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown experiences made us rethink the current approach of therapy services into alternative method (mixed mode) delivery of occupational therapy practice, which is including the combined method of video-based (telerehabilitation) consultation and face to face intervention.","Ganesan, B; Fong, K N K; Meena, S K; Prasad, P; Tong, R K Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,395,23

Methods ¡¤ A moving average prediction limit (MAPL) method was established based on the moving average method. The previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic data was used to verify the practicability of the MAPL method for predicting epidemic trends and quantitative risk. By tracking the COVID-19 outbreak epidemic data publicly reported since January 16, 2020, the MAPL method was used for timely epidemic trend prediction and the risk classification. Results ¡¤ According to the MAPL analysis, the na-tional epidemic of COVID-19 peaked in early February 2020. After active prevention and control in early stages, the overall epidemic situation in the country showed a downward trend from mid-February to mid-March. Compared with Hubei Province, the number of new cases in non-Hubei region declined rapidly in mid-February, but then increased slightly. The analysis of imported cases since March showed that there was a medium to high level of epidemic import risk in the near future. It is recommended to take corresponding prevention and control measures to prevent the epidemic from spreading again. Conclusion ¡¤ The MAPL method can assist in judging the epidemic trend of emerging infectious diseases and predicting the risk levels in a timely manner. Each epidemic district may implement a differentiated precision prevention and control strategies according to the local classification of epidemic risk. Since March, attention should be paid to the prevention and control of imported risks.","He, Hao; He, Yun-Ting; Zhai, Jing; Wang, Xiao-Jin; Wang, Bing-Shun",J. Shanghai Jiaotong Univ. Med. Sci.,395,7

Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly recommended. However, the self-revival rate of nature shall continue during post-lockdown period and a master plan must be adapted by national and international (mostly political) bodies to revive the Mother Nature completely.","Paital, Biswaranjan",Sci Total Environ,395,10

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study we enrolled 1049 patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single Italian Center from 21 February to 20 March 2020 Evaluated risk factors (RFs) were: advanced age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Endpoint of the study was death from any cause. A multivariate logistic regression model was built using covariates that showed as statistically significant at univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 71.1 years (IQR: 59.1-80.5); 244 (72.2%) were males. Primary outcome occurred in 338 patients (32.2%). In decedents, median survival from Hospitalization was 6 (IQR: 3-10) days. 264 decedents had 1 RF, 120 had 2 RFs and 39 had &#8805;3 RFs.

Governments have since relaxed public health restrictions, which resulted in significant outbreaks, shifting the global epicenter of COVID-19 to India. Ongoing systematic public health surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to inform disease prevention policy to re-establish control over the pandemic within South Asia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to inform public health leaders about the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, how South Asia displays differences within and among countries and other global regions, and where immediate action is needed to control the outbreaks. METHODS: We extracted COVID-19 data spanning 62 days from public health registries and calculated traditional and enhanced surveillance metrics. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in South Asia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shifts in variables with a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Traditional surveillance metrics indicate that South Asian countries have an alarming outbreak, with India leading the region with 310,310 new daily cases in accordance with the 7-day moving average. Enhanced surveillance indicates that while Pakistan and Bangladesh still have a high daily number of new COVID-19 cases (n=4819 and n=3878, respectively), their speed of new infections declined from April 12-25, 2021, from 2.28 to 2.18 and 3.15 to 2.35 daily new infections per 100,000 population, respectively, which suggests that their outbreaks are decreasing and that these countries are headed in the right direction. In contrast, India's speed of new infections per 100,000 population increased by 52% during the same period from 14.79 to 22.49 new cases per day per 100,000 population, which constitutes an increased outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation of public health restrictions and the spread of novel variants fueled the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Asia. Public health surveillance indicates that shifts in policy and the spread of new variants correlate with a drastic expansion in the pandemic, requiring immediate action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Surveillance is needed to inform leaders whether policies help control the pandemic.","Welch, Sarah B; Kulasekere, Dinushi Amanda; Prasad, P V Vara; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren; White, Janine; Issa, Tariq Z; Culler, Kasen; Boctor, Michael J; Mason, Maryann; Oehmke, James Francis; Faber, Joshua Marco Mitchell; Post, Lori Ann",JMIR Public Health Surveill,395,16

The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge.","Belizário, J.

However, the potential risks associated with these drugs remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic disease taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. METHODS: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease taking DMARDs with or without long-term (> 6 months) HCQ treatment prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were selected consecutively. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the history of symptoms suggestive of the disease and/or serum IgG positivity. During statistical analysis, the risk of COVID-19 infection was calculated in rheumatic patients taking DMARDs versus controls, as well as in patients taking HCQ versus those who are not. The ORs and 95% CIs were also calculated. The participants in the control group were selected from individuals without RD. RESULTS: A total of 800 patients with RD and 449 controls were analyzed. COVID-19 infection was detected in 16.8% of rheumatic patients versus 17.6% of controls (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.7-1.28). The proportions of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users versus non-users were 15.3% and 18.1%, respectively (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61-1.26). These results remained unchanged after adjusting for all covariates using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that rheumatic patients taking DMARDs are not at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and that HCQ therapy has no influence on the risk of COVID-19 infection. Key points â¢ The risk of COVID-19 infection is not higher in patients with RD on DMARD therapy. â¢ The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users has not significant difference relative to non-users. â¢ Significant percent of RD patients taking DMARDs had asymptomatic infection. â¢ There was a positive association between leflunamide therapy and the risk of COVID-19 infection.","Yousefghahari, Behnaz; Navari, Sanaz; Sadeghi, Mahmoud; Soleimaniamiri, Shima; Soleimaniamiri, Mohammadjafar; Heidari, Behzad; Babaei, Mansour; Ghodrati, Kian; Guran, Ardeshir; Gholinia, Hemmat",Clin. rheumatol,395,16

Although numerous studies are conducted for the automatic detection of fake news, the majority tend to utilize deep neural networks to learn event-specific features for superior detection performance on specific datasets. However, the trained models heavily rely on the training datasets and are infeasible to apply to upcoming events due to the discrepancy between event distributions. Inspired by domain adaptation theories, we propose an end-to-end adversarial adaptation network, dubbed as MetaDetector, to transfer meta knowledge (event-shared features) between different events. Specifically, MetaDetector pushes the feature extractor and event discriminator to eliminate event-specific features and preserve required event-shared features by adversarial training. Furthermore, the pseudo-event discriminator is utilized to evaluate the importance of historical event posts to obtain partial shared features that are discriminative for detecting fake news. Under the coordinated optimization among the four submodules, MetaDetector accurately transfers the meta-knowledge of historical events to the upcoming event for fact checking. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results demonstrate that MetaDetector outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially when the distribution shift between events is significant. Furthermore, we find that MetaDetector is able to learn the event-shared features, and alleviate the negative transfer caused by the large distribution shift between events.","Ding, Yasan; Guo, Bin; Liu, Yan; Liang, Yunji; Shen, Haocheng; Yu, Zhiwen",,395,1

Given the pleiotropic downstream function of hC5a, it is logical to consider the hC5a or its precursors as potential drug targets, and thus, we have been rationally pursuing the idea of neutralizing the harmful effect of excessive hC5a, by implementing the repurposing strategies for FDA-approved drugs. Indeed, the proof of principle biophysical studies published recently is encouraging, which strongly supports the potential of this strategy. Considering BSA-carprofen as a reference model system, the current study further explores the inherent conformational plasticity of hC5a and its effect in accommodating more than one drug molecule cooperatively at multiple sites. The data generated by recruiting a battery of experimental and computational biology techniques strongly suggest that hC5a can sequentially accommodate more than one raloxifene molecule with an estimated Ki â¼ 0.5 µM and Ki â¼ 3.58 µM on its surface at non-analogous sites. The study hints at exploration of polypharmacology approach, as a new avenue for discovering synergistic drug molecule pairs, or drug molecules with 'broad-range' binding affinity for targeting the different 'hot spots' on hC5a, as an alternative combination therapy for possible management of the 'cytokine storm'-related inflammatory diseases, like COVID19.

DESIGN: A systematic review of the current knowledge on the effects of coronavirus infection on the cardiovascular system in humans was performed and results were summarized. METHODS: Databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on 20 March 2020. RESULTS: In total, 135 studies were included, involving severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 and other coronaviruses. Most were case reports, case series and cohort studies of poor to fair quality. In post-mortem examinations of subjects who died from infection, around half had virus identified in heart tissues in severe acute respiratory syndrome, but none in Middle East respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019. Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment. Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death. In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions. CONCLUSION: This review highlighted the ways in which coronaviruses affect cardiovascular function and interacts with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.","Ho, Jamie Sy; Tambyah, Paul A; Ho, Andrew Fw; Chan, Mark Yy; Sia, Ching-Hui",Eur J Prev Cardiol,395,1

The relationships of this preclinical finding with retinal thickness or reduced parafoveal vessel density have not been established. This study investigated the relationships of ganglion cell layer thickness with retinal thickness and parafoveal vessel density in patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, prospective study that used optical coherence tomography angiography to compare non-diabetic patients (group 1) with diabetic patients without retinopathy (group 2). Ganglion cell layer thickness, macular thickness, and parafoveal vessel density (central, inner, and complete) medians were compared between groups (Mann-Whitney U test), and their relationships were assessed in each group (Spearman Rho test). RESULTS: In total, 68 eyes were included in this study: 34 in group 1 and 34 in group 2. Ganglion cell layer thickness did not differ between groups in any sector. There were strong positive correlations between fields 2 (superior parafoveal), 3 (temporal parafoveal), and 4 (inferior parafoveal) of the optical coherence tomography macular thickness map and the ganglion cell layer thickness in all sectors in both groups. Central vessel density mean was lower in diabetic patients. In group 1 alone, thickness changes in the inferior and nasal inferior ganglion cell layer sectors were partially explained by inner vessel density (r2=0.32 and r2=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Mean ganglion cell layer thickness was not lower in diabetic patients without retinopathy than in non-diabetic patients. Moreover, it exhibited a substantial correlation with total macular thickness. Parafoveal vessel density decreased before ganglion cell layer thinning was observed.","Somilleda-Ventura, Selma A; Blanco-Hernández, Dulce M Razo; Ocampo-Moreno, Itzel; Lima-Gómez, Virgilio",Arq Bras Oftalmol,395,32

METHODS: This is a three repeated measure population-based cross-sectional study. We recruited community older men aged > 60 years in three periods of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, i.e., before the COVID-19 outbreak (2 July 2019-8 January 2020), between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 (23 June 2020-9 July 2020), and during the 3rd wave of COVID-19 (15 September 2020-29 September 2020). Participants reported detailed information on their physical activity habits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore actigraphs continuously for 7 days (168 h). The actigraph data were then transferred to four rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters: midline statistic of rhythm (MESOR), amplitude, acrophase and percent rhythm. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the association of period effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters. RESULTS: Among the 242 community older men, 106 (43.8%) of them were recruited before the COVID-19 outbreak, 66 (27.3%) were recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19, and 70 (28.9%) were recruited during the late phase of the 3rd wave of COVID-19. Compared with those recruited before COVID-19, participants recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 had lower physical activity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.03, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) =1.05-3.93), MESOR (AOR = 2.05, 95%CI = 1.01-4.18), and amplitude (AOR = 1.91, 95%CI = 0.95-3.83). There was no difference in physical activity or circadian rhythm parameters between subjects recruited before and during the late phase of the 3rd wave. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm for the community people may be short-term, indicating strong resilience of the community population. Although maintaining physical activity are encouraged for the older adults to sustain good health, a rebound in their physical activity may be a sign for the next wave of outbreak if insufficient social distancing and population protection are facilitated.","Lee, Priscilla Ming Yi; Huang, Bixia; Liao, Gengze; Chan, Chi Kuen; Tai, Lai-Bun; Tsang, Chun Yuk Jason; Leung, Chi Chiu; Kwan, Mei-Po; Tse, Lap Ah",BMC Public Health,395,33

This aid provides monthly payments to low-income or unemployed citizens, informal workers, or individual micro-entrepreneurs. An intricate set of criteria made too complex the identification of all citizens eligible for emergency aid, considering there is no an integrated database to which they could apply these criteria. Consequently, lots of people who fulfilled the criteria were not able to receive the aid, and lots of people who were not supposed to get it ended up receiving it. In this context, the goal of this opinion paper is to discuss the process effectiveness and which issues related to information management hindered the positive program impact. Additionally, a less complex but relevant case of Rio Grande do Sul State is discussed.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the imaging volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic across patient service locations and imaging modality types. METHODS: Imaging case volumes in a large health care system were retrospectively studied, analyzing weekly imaging volumes by patient service locations (emergency department, inpatient, outpatient) and modality types (x-ray, mammography, CT, MRI, ultrasound, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine) in years 2020 and 2019. The data set was split to compare pre-COVID-19 (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) periods. Independent-samples t tests compared the mean weekly volumes in 2020 and 2019. RESULTS: Total imaging volume in 2020 (weeks 1-16) declined by 12.29% (from 522,645 to 458,438) compared with 2019. Post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) revealed a greater decrease (28.10%) in imaging volumes across all patient service locations (range 13.60%-56.59%) and modality types (range 14.22%-58.42%). Total mean weekly volume in 2020 post-COVID-19 (24,383 [95% confidence interval 19,478-29,288]) was statistically reduced (P = .003) compared with 33,913 [95% confidence interval 33,429-34,396] in 2019 across all patient service locations and modality types. The greatest decline in 2020 was seen at week 16 specifically for outpatient imaging (88%) affecting all modality types: mammography (94%), nuclear medicine (85%), MRI (74%), ultrasound (64%), interventional (56%), CT (46%), and x-ray (22%).

A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a recent respiratory syndrome epidemic in humans. In December 2019, the sudden emergence of this new coronavirus and the subsequent severe disease it causes created a serious global health threat and hazards. This is in contrast to the two aforementioned coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 (in 2002) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV (in 2012), which were much more easily contained. The World Health Organization (WHO) dubbed this contagious respiratory disease an ""epidemic outbreak"" in March 2020. More than 80 companies and research institutions worldwide are working together, in cooperation with many governmental agencies, to develop an effective vaccine. To date, six authorized vaccines have been registered. Up till now, no approved drugs and drug scientists are racing from development to clinical trials to find new drugs for COVID-19. Wild animals, such as snakes, bats, and pangolins are the main sources of coronaviruses, as determined by the sequence homology between MERS-CoV and viruses in these animals. Human infection is caused by inhalation of respiratory droplets. To date, the only available treatment protocol for COVID-19 is based on the prevalent clinical signs.

The transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was previously identified as the essential protease that can cleave hemagglutinin of many subtypes of influenza virus and spike protein of coronavirus. Herein, we found that a guanine rich tract, capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex in the presence of potassium ions, in the promoter region of human TMPRSS2 gene was quite important for gene transcriptional activity, hence affecting its function. Furthermore, 7 new synthesized benzoselenoxanthene analogues were found to enable stabilizing such G-quadruplex. More importantly, compounds can down-regulate TMPRSS2 gene expression, especially endogenous TMPRSS2 protein levels, and consequently suppress influenza A virus propagation in vitro. Our results provide a new strategy for anti-influenza A virus infection by small molecules targeting the TMPRSS2 gene G-quadruplex and thus inhibiting TMPRSS2 expression, which is valuable for developing small molecule drugs against influenza A virus and also may be a potential candidate as anti- SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2) lead molecules.","Shen, Li-Wen; Qian, Man-Qing; Yu, Kai; Narva, Suresh; Yu, Fei; Wu, Yan-Ling; Zhang, Wen",Sci Rep,395,20

Suicidal ideation happens prior to the actual suicidal behaviour; thus, identifying the roots of suicidal ideation is vital. This study investigated the relationships between parental closeness, self-efficacy and suicidal ideation among adolescents in Malaysia. The mediation effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation was also examined. METHOD: A total of 684 school-going adolescents aged 14-17 years old were recruited via multistage cluster sampling. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Pearson's correlation analysis. The mediation model was tested using SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes. RESULTS: The results showed that mother closeness, father closeness and self-efficacy had significant negative correlation with suicidal ideation. Specifically, self-efficacy emerged as a partial mediator in the relation between mother closeness and suicidal ideation. Self-efficacy also fully mediated the relationship between father closeness and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings implied that mother closeness had stronger correlation with adolescents' suicidal ideation compared to father closeness, while self-efficacy plays an important role in the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation. Prevention and intervention efforts by practitioners dealing with adolescents' mental health issues, specifically on suicidal ideation, should seriously consider providing them with skills to enhance mother-adolescent relationship and their self-efficacy.","Wu, Shin Ling; Yaacob, Siti Nor",Child Adolesc Ment Health,395,23

The objective of this work was to evaluate whether peptides from S protein could cause negative impact in the aquatic animals. The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles/5 replicates of 10 animals) from species Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has been simulated with these peptides during 24 h of exposure in two concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL). The control group (""C"") was composed of tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers containing de-chlorinated water. Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and AChE activity were assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions in silico with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes. Aquatic particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 has cholinesterasic effect in P. cuvieri tadpoles.

Common types of respirators used in healthcare settings are filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Aims of this study were to examine the current attitudes and practices of HCWs regarding the selection and use of respiratory protection and determine the acceptability of a novel PAPR. METHODS: In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 HCWs from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants were fit tested with a lightweight tight-fitting half-facepiece PAPR (CleanSpace2&#8482; Power Unit, PAF-0034, by CleanSpace Technology®) using the TSI&#8482; Portacount quantitative fit test method. RESULTS: Interview results showed that HCWs had a limited role in the selection and use of facemasks and respirators and had been using the devices provided by the hospital. The majority of subjects had no knowledge of hospital policy for the use of facemasks and respirators, had not been trained on the use of respirators, and had not been fit tested previously. Compliance with the use of facemasks and respirators was perceived as being low and facemasks and respirators were typically used only for short periods of time.All 20 participants were successfully fit tested to the CleanSpace2&#8482; PAPR (overall geometric mean fit factor-6768). According to the exit surveys, CleanSpace2&#8482; PAPRs were easy to don (14/20) and doff (15/20) and comfortable to wear (14/20). Most participants believed that PAPRs provide higher protection, comfort and reusability over N95 FFR and can be used during pandemics and other high-risk situations. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs should be aware of infection control policies and training should be provided on the correct use of respiratory protective devices. PAPRs can be used in hospital settings to protect HCWs from certain highly infectious and emerging pathogens, however, HCWs require adequate training on storage, use, and cleaning of PAPRs.","Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly; Rawlinson, William D; Kunasekaran, Mohana; Macintyre, C Raina",Ann Work Expo Health,395,27

This paper examines a more spontaneous response to COVID-19 isolation: bread-porn. Taken literally, bread-porn is the competitive display of gratuitous pictures of home-baked bread across social media (particularly in the ‘west’), shared by people isolated at home. On the surface, such pictures perfunctorily depict bread;yet, it is argued that these pictures are more nuanced than that, and that the bread itself is almost immaterial. ‘COVID bread-porn’ was a jockeying for social standing and represented one of many unique, if temporary, forms of do-it-yourself (DIY) cultural currency while people were less able to access other extant systems of representational social stratification. The paper discusses the value and significance of the suffix ‘porn’ with respect to struggles to understand the extremities of new systems of value, by linking how temporary COVID culture fit into the flow of the cultural changes that preceded it. The paper argues that the world faced the COVID pandemic at a tumultuous time marked by liminality between historically ‘physical’ and emerging ‘cerebral’ cultural practices in many societies (i.e. the move from manufacturing to ‘knowledge’ economies). Thus, it situates bread-porn as an attempt to ‘win’ at isolation by demonstrating prowess with available domestic resources, and highlights the productive tension of bread-porn that extends and potentially resists the social imperatives of pandemic self-management.","Mohabeer, Ravindra N.",Cultural Studies,395,16

Unfortunately, the Nigeria media is awash with images of misuse and abuse of face masks by the public, government officials, and healthcare workers. Medical masks are used widely in community settings amid reported scarcity within healthcare facilities. It is observed that some people wear face masks on their chin and neck, and mask wearers give no attention to covering their mouth and nose, especially when talking. Used face masks are kept with personal belongings or disposed indiscriminately in public spaces, leading to self and environmental contamination. Inappropriate use and disposal of face masks in Nigeria could promote the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country and negate the country's efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In the implementation of the universal masking policy in Nigeria, federal and state governments ought to consider local applicability, feasibility, and sustainability, as well as identify and mitigate all potential risks and unintended consequences.

At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed).

Given the severity of COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for cooperation of people in the prevention and combat processes, understanding the public perspectives would be crucial and instructive. This study aimed to explore such perspectives towards the current pandemic among the Iranian. Indeed, we sought to provide a favorable platform for effective policies in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic through recognizing public expectations. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used an open-ended online questionnaire to investigate the common perspectives of the Iranian towards the response of government to COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were selected using snowball and convenient sampling techniques across the country. The collected data were analyzed and described using a thematic analysis. RESULTS: In general, 2547 participants agreed to participate in this study and completed the online questionnaire. According to the findings, the Iranian exhibited several expectations regarding the response of the government to COVID-19 pandemic. Three main themes were extracted based on these expectations: (1) health-related expectations, (2) policy-related expectations, and (3) Information-related expectations. In this study, a majority of participants highlighted the need to consider and follow-up the patients and their families, providing the financial and hygiene support during the pandemic, applying strict restrictions, and using close monitoring and controlling procedures. Furthermore, they mentioned that authorities and news agencies should observe the principals honesty and transparency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that people expect the government and other responsible institutions to minimize the burden of this pandemic through adopting effective policies. Also, they could help policy-makers become aware of the expectations of people and develop better strategies.","Zarei, Leila; Shahabi, Saeed; Sadati, Ahmad Kalateh; Tabrizi, Reza; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",BMC Public Health,395,30

Multiple data sources were used to construct four indicators for zip code tabulation areas: (1) pre-existing health condition, (2) barriers to accessing health care, (3) built environment risk, and (4) the CDC's social vulnerability. The assessment of the indicators finds that the most vulnerable neighborhoods are characterized by significant clustering of racial minorities. An overwhelming 73% of Blacks reside in the neighborhoods with the two highest levels of pre-existing health conditions. For the barriers to accessing health care indicator, 40% of Latinx reside in the highest vulnerability places. The built environment indicator finds that selected Asian ethnic groups (63%), Latinx (55%), and Blacks (53%) reside in the neighborhoods designated as high or the highest vulnerability. The social vulnerability indicator finds 42% of Blacks and Latinx and 38% of selected Asian ethnic group residing in neighborhoods of high vulnerability. The vulnerability indicators can be adopted nationally to respond to COVID-19. The metrics can be utilized in data-driven decision making of re-openings or resource distribution such as testing, vaccine distribution and other pandemic-related resources to ensure equity for the most vulnerable.","Ong, Paul M; Pech, Chhandara; Gutierrez, Nataly Rios; Mays, Vickie M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),395,2

Scientists and clinicians must acknowledge that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to attack the human body in multiple ways simultaneously and exploit any weaknesses of its host. A multipronged attack could potentially explain the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the diverse tactics of this virus to infect the human body is both critical and incredibly complex. Although patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have primarily presented with pulmonary involvement, viral invasion, and injury to diverse end organs is also prevalent and well documented in these patients, but has been largely unheeded. Human organs known for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, adrenals, brain, and testicles are examples of extra pulmonary tissues with confirmed invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Initial multiple organ involvement may present with vague signs and symptoms to alert health care professionals early in the course of COVID-19. Another example of an ongoing, yet neglected element of the syndromic features of COVID-19, are the reported findings of loss of smell, altered taste, ataxia, headache, dizziness, and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential for neural involvement. In this review, we further deliberate on the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the neurologic symptomology observed in COVID-19, the host-virus interaction, possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system, other neurologic considerations for patients with COVID-19, and a collective call to action.","Baig, Abdul Mannan; Sanders, Erin C",J. med. virol,395,4

A strategy for resuming elective surgery in four phases is proposed. Preoperative testing for COVID-19 infection is highly recommended. In any cases, COVID symptoms including fever and increased temperature should be constantly monitored until the day of surgery. Elective surgery should be postponed at the slightest suspicion of a COVID-19 infection.

However, this report did not mention chronic kidney disease (CKD) nor did it provide information on the relevance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or albuminuria. As the disease spread across the globe, information on larger populations with greater granularity on risk factors emerged. The recently published OpenSAFELY project analysed factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients. The picture that arose differs significantly from initial reports. For example, hypertension is not an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.89], but renal disease very much is. Dialysis (aHR 3.69), organ transplantation (aHR 3.53) and CKD (aHR 2.52 for patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) represent three of the four comorbidities associated with the highest mortality risk from COVID-19. The risk associated with CKD Stages 4 and 5 is higher than the risk associated with diabetes mellitus (aHR range 1.31-1.95, depending upon glycaemic control) or chronic heart disease (aHR 1.17). In another recent publication, the Global Burden of Disease collaboration identified that worldwide, CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, the distribution of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality appears to be different in patients with CKD when compared with the general population. The high prevalence of CKD in combination with the elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19 in CKD necessitates urgent action for this group of patients. This article defines essential action points (summarized in Box 1), among which is advocating the inclusion of CKD patients in clinical trials testing the efficacy of drugs and vaccines to prevent severe COVID-19.",,Nephrol Dial Transplant,395,9

Methods: A strategy consisting of phased relaxation of clinical comorbidity criteria was developed. Patients from the orthopaedic waiting list were selected according to these criteria and observed recommended preoperative isolation protocols. Surgery was performed at green sites (two local private hospitals) under the COVID-19 NHS contract. The first 100 consecutive patients that met the Phase 1 criteria and underwent surgery were included. In hospital and postoperative complications with specific enquiry as to development of COVID-19 symptoms or need and outcome for COVID-19 testing at 14 days and six weeks was recorded. Patient satisfaction was surveyed at 14 days postoperatively. Results: There were 54 females and 46 males (mean age 44 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 25.6 kg/m2). In all, 56 patients underwent major orthopaedic procedures. There were no exclusions. One patient had a postoperative positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test but had no typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection and no clinical sequelae. 99% of patients were satisfied with the process and 98% would recommend undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery in the study period. Conclusion: In an environment with appropriate infrastructure, patient selection, isolation, screening, and testing, elective orthopaedic surgery is safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated with high patient satisfaction. Further follow-up is required to establish that safety is maintained as the clinical restrictions are eased with the phased approach described.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-8:450-456.","Zahra, Wajiha; Dixon, Joseph W; Mirtorabi, Negin; Rolton, Daniel J; Tayton, Edward R; Hale, Peter C; Fisher, Warren J; Barnes, Richard J; Tunstill, Simon A; Iyer, Shabnam; Pollard, Tom C B",Bone Jt Open,395,7

Studies from China, where the virus first spread, have reported increased psychological strain in healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. Methods: Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. Results: Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that especially nurses working in COVID-19 wards are affected psychologically by the consequences of the pandemic. This might be due to a higher workload and longer time in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, compared to physicians.","Zerbini, Giulia; Ebigbo, Alanna; Reicherts, Philipp; Kunz, Miriam; Messman, Helmut",Ger Med Sci,395,1

One of the most serious manifestations of PD is gait instability, leading to falls and subsequent complications that can be debilitating, even fatal. Boxing therapy (BT) uses gait and balance exercises to improve ambulation in people with PD, though its efficacy has not yet been fully proven. METHODS: In the current longitudinal observational study, 98 participants with idiopathic PD underwent twice-weekly BT sessions. Primary outcome was self-reported falls per month;secondary outcomes were quantitative and semi-quantitative gait and balance performance evaluations. Statistical methods included segmented generalized estimating equation with an independent correlation structure, binomial distribution, and log link. RESULTS: The average number of self-reported falls per month per participant decreased by 87%, from 0.86 ± 3.58 prior to BT, to 0.11 ± 0.26 during BT. During the lockdown imposed by COVID-19, this increased to 0.26 ± 0.48 falls per month. Females and those &gt; 65 years old reported the greatest increase in falls during the lockdown period. Post-lockdown resumption of BT resulted in another decline in falls, to 0.14 ± 0.33. Quantitative performance metrics, including standing from a seated position and standing on one leg, largely mirrored the pattern of falls pre-and post-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: BT may be an effective option for many PD patients.","Horbinski, C.; Zumpf, K. B.; McCortney, K.; Eoannou, D.",,395,15

A decrement of the viral load was observed when previously infected cells were irradiated with all three tested wavelengths and relevant effects were registered especially at 48 hours post-infection, possibly suggesting that the blue light could interfere with the intracellular viral replication machinery.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory samples but also in blood, stool and urine. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dysregulated host response to this virus. We studied whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response. METHODS: A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill). Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene. The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%) compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p < 0.001). Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values. When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis. In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95%], p): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183-12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244-3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382-3.595], 0.001). Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM-CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated with critical illness in COVID-19. Viral RNA load in plasma correlates with key signatures of dysregulated host responses, suggesting a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the pathogenesis of this disease.","Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; González-Rivera, Milagros; Almansa, Raquel; Micheloud, Dariela; Tedim, Ana P; Domínguez-Gil, Marta; Resino, Salvador; Martín-Fernández, Marta; Ryan Murua, Pablo; Pérez-García, Felipe; Tamayo, Luis; Lopez-Izquierdo, Raúl; Bustamante, Elena; Aldecoa, César; Gómez, José Manuel; Rico-Feijoo, Jesús; Orduña, Antonio; Méndez, Raúl; Fernández Natal, Isabel; Megías, Gregoria; González-Estecha, Montserrat; Carriedo, Demetrio; Doncel, Cristina; Jorge, Noelia; Ortega, Alicia; de la Fuente, Amanda; Del Campo, Félix; Fernández-Ratero, José Antonio; Trapiello, Wysali; González-Jiménez, Paula; Ruiz, Guadalupe; Kelvin, Alyson A; Ostadgavahi, Ali Toloue; Oneizat, Ruth; Ruiz, Luz María; Miguéns, Iria; Gargallo, Esther; Muñoz, Ioana; Pelegrin, Sara; Martín, Silvia; García Olivares, Pablo; Cedeño, Jamil Antonio; Ruiz Albi, Tomás; Puertas, Carolina; Berezo, Jose Ángel; Renedo, Gloria; Herrán, Rubén; Bustamante-Munguira, Juan; Enríquez, Pedro; Cicuendez, Ramón",Crit Care,395,20

In response to a telephone survey, 126 older adults described perceived changes in physical and mental health, and adaptations in their everyday health behaviors. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions revealed that participants experienced changes in mental and physical health, reduced health service access, lower social engagement, and increased coping behaviors. Greater negative social impact of the pandemic was associated with higher levels of COVID-19 distress. Reduced mental health was significantly related to reductions in health service access, health changes, and fewer adaptive coping behaviors. Adaptive coping behaviors were helpful, just as reduced health access and social contact added risk for mental health problems. Suggestions were provided for alleviating mental health needs by increasing social contact and engaging in adaptive coping behaviors.","Scott, Judith M; Yun, Stacy W; Qualls, Sara H",Geriatr Nurs,395,1

Drone missions will increasingly rely on drone collaboration, which requires the drones to reduce communication complexity and be controlled in a decentralized fashion. Blockchain technology becomes a must in industrial applications because it provides decentralized data, accessibility, immutability, and irreversibility. Therefore, Blockchain makes data public for all drones and enables drones to log information concerning world states, time, location, resources, delivery data, and drone relation to all neighbors drones. This paper introduces decentralized independent multi-drones to accomplish the task collaboratively. Improving blockchain with a consensus algorithm can improve network partitioning and scalability in order to combat COVID-19. The multi-drones task is to combat COVID-19 via monitoring and detecting, social distancing, sanitization, data analysis, delivering goods and medical supplies, and announcement while avoiding collisions with one another. We discuss End to End (E2E) delivery application of combination blockchain and multi-drone in combating COVID-19 and beyond future pandemics.

Here, we use whole genome sequencing and statistical fine mapping in 7,491 critically-ill cases compared with 48,400 population controls to discover and replicate 22 independent variants that significantly predispose to life-threatening COVID-19.

Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating expression of multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in critical disease. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for genetic association analysis and enables detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease.

Time-sensitive management of cardiovascular emergencies such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has yet to be evaluated in the context of these new policies, particularly in so-called ""hot spot"" cities. METHODS: We evaluated the early impact of the pandemic on STEMI performance in the Greater Montreal Area. A total of 167 patients from 3 different study periods were included. Patients presenting in the lockdown period from mid-March to mid-May 2020 (Group C, 53 patients) were compared to those from mid-March to mid-May 2019 (Group A, 60 patients) and the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (Group B, 54 patients). RESULTS: The number of STEMI admissions was unaffected during the lockdown. However, significantly longer delays between symptom onset and first medical contact (FMC) were noted (Group C 189.0 IQR [70.0, 840.0] min vs. Group A 103.0 IQR [42.5, 263.0] min vs. Group B 91.0 IQR [38.0, 235.5 min], P = 0.007). In contrast, additional safety protocols do not appear to have significantly affected delays between FMC and first intracoronary device activation (Group C 102 IQR [73.0, 133.0] min vs. Group A 104 IQR [87.0, 146.0] min vs. Group B 99.5 IQR [80.0, 150.0] min, P = 0.37). Patients that presented during the outbreak were more likely to be unstable with a higher incidence of Killip classes II-IV compared to groups A and B (28.3% vs. 18.3% vs. 5.6% respectively, P = 0.008). Worse in-hospital outcomes were also noted with a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (Group A 5.0% vs. Group B 11.1% vs. Group C 22.6%, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, many patients appear to have been reluctant to present to hospitals. This was associated with more unstable STEMI presentations and worse in-hospital course. Importantly, the health care system appears able to ensure timely acute cardiac care while ensuring that COVID-19 protocols are respected.","Haddad, Kevin; Potter, Brian J; Matteau, Alexis; Gobeil, François; Mansour, Samer",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,395,5

In this work, we aimed to understand the immunological dynamics of severe COVID-19 patients with different degrees of illness, and upon long-term recovery. We analyzed immune cellular subsets and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody isotypes of 66 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Hospital Clinico Universidad de Chile, which were categorized according to the WHO ten-point clinical progression score. These included 29 moderate patients (score 4-5) and 37 severe patients under either high flow oxygen nasal cannula (18 patients, score 6), or invasive mechanical ventilation (19 patients, score 7-9), plus 28 convalescent patients and 28 healthy controls. Furthermore, six severe patients that recovered from the disease were longitudinally followed over 300 days. Our data indicate that severe COVID-19 patients display increased frequencies of plasmablasts, activated T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies compared to moderate and convalescent patients. Remarkably, within the severe COVID-19 group, patients rapidly progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show higher frequencies of plasmablasts, monocytes, eosinophils, Th1 cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients under high flow oxygen nasal cannula. These findings demonstrate that severe COVID-19 patients progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show a distinctive type of immunity. In addition, patients that recover from severe COVID-19 begin to regain normal proportions of immune cells 100 days after hospital discharge and maintain high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG throughout the study, which is an indicative sign of immunological memory. Thus, this work can provide a useful benchmark for improvement of disease outcomes.","Garcia-Gonzalez, Paulina; Tempio, Fabian; Fuentes, Camila; Merino, Consuelo; Vargas, Leonardo; Simon, Valeska; Ramirez, Mirliana; Rojas, Veronica; Tobar, Eduardo; Landskron, Glauben; Araya, Juan Pablo; Navarrete, Mariela; Bastias, Carla; Tordecilla, Rocio; Varas, Macarena; Maturana, Pablo; Marcoleta, Andres; Allende, Miguel; Naves, Rodrigo; Hermoso, Marcela; Salazar-Onfray, Flavio; Lopez, Mercedes; Bono, MarIa Rosa; Osorio, Fabiola",,395,14

It quickly spread and emerged as a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on society. As clinical research on this novel virus emerges, there is a limited amount of data that review clinical and laboratory predictors of severe disease. We present a case of a patient with severely elevated inflammatory markers who remained clinically stable during his hospital course. CASE DISCUSSION: A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency room with 11 days of persistent fevers and new-onset anterior chest tightness. He was admitted to the hospital due to a reported oxygen desaturation at home to 87% (taken by his spouse, a healthcare professional) and ambulatory oxygen desaturation down to 87%. He was noted to have severely elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and computed tomography pulmonary angiograph findings consistent with COVID-19. He remained on room air and clinically stable throughout his 3-day hospital course. While his C-reactive protein levels improved, his ferritin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate continued to elevate. He was discharged home and was symptom-free within 4 days of hospital discharge. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has proven to be a viral disease with a high transmission rate, that has caused over 100,000 deaths in the United States, thus far. The decision to admit a patient must balance the risks of transmission with the benefit of being readily available to provide urgent supportive care should the patient develop complications. Thus, there is a significant benefit to being able to predict poor outcomes. We performed a targeted review of the literature, focusing on clinical and laboratory predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19. Our case report and narrative review outline these findings within the context of our case.","Kwon, Edward; Whitlow, Nathan; Reed, Alexander",J Am Board Fam Med,395,16

Certain countries have managed to curtail COVID-19 crisis to some extent, however, a great majority still remains helpless in containing this outbreak. Rapidly evolving disease patterns and complex epidemiology of the COVID-19 necessitate a tailored approach by medical experts in dealing with this devastating outbreak. Similar to other medical disciplines, surgical associations and societies have developed a tailored approach of patients' selection and management plans with improvised endolaparoscopic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-essential and non-urgent surgical procedures are deferred till this outbreak is abated. Benefits of delaying elective and non-urgent surgery outweighs the risk of performing surgical procedures on patients with asymptomatic or active COVID-19 disease. Laparoendoscopic procedures increase the risk of aerosol exposure, disease transmission and contamination. Limiting the number of operating room personnel, use of disposable instruments, small trocar incisions, negative pressure environment, and setting energy devices at low modes can help reduce disease transmission during laparoendocsopic procedures. This write up sheds lights on the impact of the COVID-19, big data analytics of response of medical personnel in understanding and curtailing the disease process and the consensus guidelines for carrying out laparoscoendoscopic procedures.","Guraya, Salman Y",Int J Surg,395,22

WHO officially named the disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and declared it as pandemic on Mar 11, 2020. Globally, there are more than 3 million confirmed cases with nearly 200,000 deaths. Hence, we aimed to perform a systematic review and pooled analysis of the current published literature on COVID-19 to provide an insight on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. A systematic search of published peer-reviewed articles that reported cases with demographical and clinical features of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using MOOSE guidelines was conducted from December 1, 2019, to April 27, 2020, and 50 eligible articles were included for the final analysis. Review articles, opinion articles, and letters not presenting original data as well as studies with incomplete information were excluded. We included a total of 6635 patients from 50 articles, with 54.5 % being male. The predominant symptoms were fever (80.3%), cough (64.2%), and fatigue/myalgia (36.5%) and other symptoms including dyspnea, chest pain, and sore throat. We also found patients with GI symptoms like diarrhea (9.2%) and nausea/vomiting (5.2%). Comorbidities were found in 3,435 (51.7%) patients with the most common being hypertension (22.67%) followed by diabetes mellitus (12.78%). COVID-19 pandemic is not only leading a huge burden on health care facilities but significant disruption in the world society. Patients with coexisting comorbidities are at higher risk and need more utilization of health care resources.

Therefore, COVID-19-ARDS survivors requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were followed six months after discharge. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 6-min walk test (6MWT) and echocardiography were performed. Quality of life (QoL), depression and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. Patients were compared based on respiratory mechanics and CT-phenotype during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Eighteen patients were included (61 ± 7 years; ICU-stay: 34 ± 16 days; IMV: 30 ± 15 days). At follow-up (197 ± 15 days after discharge), PFTs did not reveal significant limitations (VC: 92 ± 16%; FEV1: 92 ± 20%; DLco/VA: 81 ± 16%). Cardiac systolic function was normal in all patients, but 50% of them had diastolic dysfunction. 6MWT was under the lower limit of normal in only two patients. Eight patients (44%) reported tiredness, six (33%) suffered from fatigue and one patient (6%) had depression and anxiety. Surprisingly, patients with worse respiratory mechanics during IMV reported fewer symptoms and less exertional dyspnea at follow-up. In conclusion, patients with COVID-19-ARDS have the possibility to fully recover regarding pulmonary function and exercise capacity, which seems to be independent of disease severity during ICU stay.","Daher, Ayham; Cornelissen, Christian; Hartmann, Niels-Ulrik; Balfanz, Paul; Müller, Annegret; Bergs, Ingmar; Aetou, Maria; Marx, Nikolaus; Marx, Gernot; Simon, Tim-Philipp; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Hartmann, Bojan; Kersten, Alexander; Müller, Tobias; Dreher, Michael",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),395,2

Currently, there is great interest to assess venous thrombosis prevalence, diagnosis, prevention, and management in patients with Covid-19. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in critically ill patients with Covid-19, using lower limbs venous ultrasonography screening. Methods: Since March 8 th, we enrolled 25 patients, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The presence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was systematically assessed by ultrasonography, between day 5 and 10 after admission. The data reported here are those available up until May 9 th2020. Results: The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 68±11 years, 64% were men. No patients had a history of VTE. During the ICU stay, 8 patients (32%) suffered from VTE; 6 (24%) proximal DVT, 5 (20%) pulmonary embolism. The rate of symptomatic VTE was 24%, while 8% of patients had screen-detected DVT. Only those patients with a documented VTE received a therapeutic anticoagulant regimen. As of May 9 th, 2020; 5 patients died (20%), 2 remain in the ICU (8%), and 18 were discharged (72%). Conclusions: In critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, DVT screening at day 5-10 of admission, yielded a 32% prevalence of VTE. 75% of events occurred before screening.

These measures have proven effective in mitigating outbreaks. As a greater fraction of the population becomes vaccinated, we need to understand what continued benefit, if any, proactive testing can contribute. Here, we address this problem with two distinct modeling approaches: a simple analytical model and a more simulation using the SEIRS+ platform. Both models indicate that proactive testing remains useful until a threshold level of vaccination is reached. This threshold depends on the transmissibility of the virus and the scope of other control measures in place. If a community is able to reach the threshold level of vaccination, testing can cease. Otherwise, continued testing will be an important component of disease control. Because it is usually difficult or impossible to precisely estimate key parameters such as the basic reproduction number for a specific workplace or other setting, our results are more useful for understanding general trends than for making precise quantitative predictions.","McGee, Ryan Seamus; Homburger, Julian R.; Williams, Hannah E.; Bergstrom, Carl T.; Zhou, Alicia Y.",,395,11

It proposes the more liberal use of viral testing for improving detection of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic fertility patients. It also argues that a negative test result on symptomatic individuals should not be over-relied upon for allowing the treatment to proceed.

Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptors allows the definition of residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S, up to 7 can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S interface. Of note, pigs and dogs, which are not infected or are not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with that from bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV-RaTG13) and pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) strain hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019 revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas Bat-CoV-RaTG13 exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibits seven changes relative to human ACE2, and a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon dogs, and civets, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not be especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide, and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear, and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes, indicating that the species barrier might be low. Exceptions are dogs and especially pigs, which revealed relatively low ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract. Monitoring of animals is necessary to prevent the generation of a new coronavirus reservoir. Finally, our analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not be specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","Zhai, Xiaofeng; Sun, Jiumeng; Yan, Ziqing; Zhang, Jie; Zhao, Jin; Zhao, Zongzheng; Gao, Qi; He, Wan-Ting; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",J. virol,395,6

As many real-world complex systems can be modeled as multilayer networks, the question of identifying important nodes in multilayer network has attracted much attention. Existing studies focus on the multilayer network structure, while neglecting how the structural and dynamical coupling of multiple layers influence the dynamical importance of nodes in the network. Here we investigate on this question in an information-disease coupled spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. Firstly, we explicitly reveal that three interlayer coupling factors, which are the two-layer relative spreading speed, the interlayer coupling strength and the two-layer degree correlation, significantly impact the spreading influence of a node on the contact layer. The suppression effect from the information layer makes the structural centrality on the contact layer fail to predict the spreading influence of nodes in the multiplex network. Then by mapping the coevolving spreading dynamics into percolation process and using the message-passing approach, we propose a method to calculate the size of the disease outbreaks from a single seed node, which can be used to estimate the nodes' spreading influence in the coevolving dynamics. Our work provides insights on the importance of nodes in the multiplex network and gives a feasible framework to investigate influential spreaders in the asymmetrically coevolving dynamics.","Zeng, Qi; Liu, Ying; Pan, Liming; Tang, Ming",,395,10

When asked to rate perceived comfort with video telehealth to deliver OT services, participants using video telehealth expressed greater comfort than nonusers, which was significant for 9 of the 13 interventions: activities of daily living (P&lt;.001), instrumental activities of daily living (P=.004), home safety (P&lt;.001), home exercise or therapeutic exercise (P&lt;.001), veteran or caregiver education (P&lt;.001), durable medical equipment (P&lt;.001), assistive technology (P&lt;.001), education and work (P=.04), and wheelchair clinic or seating and positioning (P&lt;.001). More than half (74/125, 59.2%) of those using video telehealth reported at least one barrier, with the most frequently endorsed being Inadequate space, physical locations and related equipment. Most (92/125, 73.6%) respondents using video telehealth reported at least one facilitator, with the most frequently endorsed facilitators reflecting respondent attitudes, including the belief that video telehealth would improve veteran access to care (77/92, 84%) and willingness to try innovative approaches (76/92, 83%). Conclusions: Most VHA OT survey respondents had not used video telehealth with older veterans. Users and nonusers were demographically similar. Differences in the percentages of respondents feeling comfortable with video telehealth for specific OT interventions suggest that some OT services may be more amenable to video telehealth. This, coupled with the primacy of respondent beliefs versus organizational factors as facilitators, underscores the need to gather clinicians’ attitudes to understand how they are driving the implementation of video telehealth.","Gately, Megan E.; Tickle-Degnen, Linda Voydetich Deborah J.; Ward, Nathan Ladin Keren Moo Lauren R.",JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies,395,10

In this study, data from a large hospital in central Italy was used to evaluate the impact of the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 infections in terms of the prevalence of symptomatic cases, symptom duration, and viral clearance timing. All vaccinated Healthcare Workers (HCWs) with positive RT-PCR by nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were divided into two cohorts (positive RT-PCR within day 12 and positive RT-PCR between day 13 and day 21 after first dose administration) and compared for the presence and duration of symptoms and the timing of viral clearance. The same variables were evaluated across HCWs with positive RT-PCR within 6 days after first dose administration and non-vaccinated HCWs with positive RT-PCR between 1 October 2020 and 28 February 2021. Eighteen HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR by NP swab from day 1 to day 12 after the 1st dose administration (incidence rate 6.2 × 10−4) and 5 HCWs from day 13 to day 21 (incidence rate 2.3 × 10−4). Symptom duration and viral clearance timing are significantly shorter in the cohort of HCWs with positive RT-PCR 12 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The administration of the first dose proved effective in reducing presence, symptom duration, and viral clearance even in HCWs vaccinated for less than 6 days. These results could have implications on public health and post-exposure prophylaxis.","Coppeta, Luca Balbi Ottavia Grattagliano Zaira Mina Grazia Genga Pietroiusti Antonio Magrini Andrea Bolcato Matteo Trabucco Aurilio Marco",Vaccines,395,24

A 24 years old patient, recently exposed to measles (unvaccinated), presented in the emergency department with severe agitation, compatible with an acute psychotic episode, during the measles epidemic which spread in Israel in 2018-2019. Upon hospital admission, strict isolation was instructed, yet, without compliance, probably due to the patient's status. Measles diagnosis was promptly confirmed. As measles transmission was eminent, public health measures were employed through immediate implementation of the section 15 of the Public Health Ordinance, allowing for compulsory short-term isolation. The patient's condition improved within a few days and the measures were no longer necessary. This measles case occurred in the pre-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic when use of a Public Health Ordinance was considered an extreme measure. This is in contrast to the current global use of Public Health laws to enforce strict quarantine and isolation on persons infected or potentially exposed to COVID-19. Nevertheless, minimizing infectious diseases transmission is a core function of public health law. Utilizing legal enforcement in circumstances of immediate public health hazard, such as nosocomial measles transmission, necessitates careful consideration. The integrative clinical and public health approach and prompt measures employed in this exceptional case, led to prevention of further infection spread.","Stein-Zamir, Chen; Abramson, Nitza; Sonnenfeld-Alroey, Hagit; Charnes, Jacob; Eckstein, Dana; Dienstag, Aryeh; Wolf, Dana; Moses, Allon E; Weiss, Yoram G",Isr J Health Policy Res,395,24

Little did we know that soon after Europe and the rest of the world (with Asia already earlier) would be in lock-down due to COVID-19. It has been a strange year. And now, at the start of 2021, the excitement of having a vaccine is tempered by the fact that everywhere mutants of the virus pop up. Although this was likely to occur, as also the influenza virus keeps mutating, it means that at the moment it is unclear as to whether the current situation of lock-downs and social distancing will remain for a longer period than we had anticipated and hoped for at the end of 2020 when it became clear that several vaccines were efficacious. Some studies have shown a role of the gut microbiota composition in disease severity, together with vitamin D, cholesterol and other factors. It was a hype to write a 'review' on gut microbiota and the effect on COVID-19, and also the board of Beneficial Microbes has received several submissions of so-called reviews on the topic. However, all of them were rejected, as they were mere speculations about how the gut microbiota might affect virus infection and disease severity, without any data whatsoever. However, there are some good studies out there that have shown that a proper gut microbiota may indeed influence disease severity, such as recently reviewed by Kim (2021). All in all, this may not be too surprising for the knowledgeable reader, as they would know that the microbiota plays a role in everything that can be wrong with us!","Venema, Koen",Benef Microbes,395,29

The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that the monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, and report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilizing CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding facilitates conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis confirms that incubation of spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope could be useful therapeutically, possibly in synergy with an antibody that blocks receptor attachment.","Huo, Jiandong; Zhao, Yuguang; Ren, Jingshan; Zhou, Daming; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Ginn, Helen M; Carrique, Loic; Malinauskas, Tomas; Ruza, Reinis R; Shah, Pranav N M; Tan, Tiong Kit; Rijal, Pramila; Coombes, Naomi; Bewley, Kevin R; Tree, Julia A; Radecke, Julika; Paterson, Neil G; Supasa, Piyada; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Screaton, Gavin R; Carroll, Miles; Townsend, Alain; Fry, Elizabeth E; Owens, Raymond J; Stuart, David I",Cell Host Microbe,395,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases up until 2 February 2021. The primary outcome was the poor outcome, a composite of mortality and severity. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe pneumonia or patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome/disease progression/need for intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation. The effect estimates were a mean difference between patients with and without a poor outcome in mg/dL and odds ratio (OR) per 1 mg/dL decrease in prealbumin level. The effect estimates were reported with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: Nine studies comprising of 2104 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with poor outcome have lower prealbumin level (mean difference -71.48 mg/dL [95% CI -93.74, -49.22], p<0.001; I2: 85.9%). Every 1 mg/dL decrease in prealbumin level was associated with 1% increase in poor outcome (OR 0.992 [0.987, 0.997], p=0.004, I2: 81.7%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between the prealbumin level and poor outcome varies with gender (male) (coefficient: 3.50, R2: 100%, p<0.001), but not age, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum prealbumin was associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Akbar, M R; Pranata, R; Wibowo, A; Lim, M A; Sihite, T A; Martha, J W",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,395,16

Microsoft Excel is used as the modeling platform because it's non-threatening to students and because it's widely available. Students develop finite difference models and implement them in the cells of preformatted spreadsheets following a guided-inquiry pedagogy that introduces new model parameters in a scaffolded step-by-step manner. That approach allows students to investigate the implications of new model parameters in a systematic way. Students fit the resulting models to reported cases-per-day data for the United States using least-squares techniques with Excel's Solver. Using their own spreadsheets, students discover for themselves that the initial exponential growth of COVID-19 can be explained by a simplified unlimited growth model and by the SIR model. They also discover that the effects of social distancing can be modeled using a Gaussian transition function for the infection rate coefficient and that the summer surge was caused by prematurely relaxing social distancing and then reimposing stricter social distancing. Students then model the effect of vaccinations and validate the resulting SIRV model by showing that it successfully predicts the reported cases-per-day data from Thanksgiving through February 14, 2021. The same SIRV model is then extended and successfully fits the fourth peak up to June 1, 2021, caused by further relaxation of social distancing measures. Finally, students extend the model up to the present day and successfully account for the appearance of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. The fitted model also predicts that the delta-variant peak will be comparatively short, and the cases-per-day data should begin to fall off in early September 2021 - counter to current expectations. This case study would make an excellent capstone experience for students interested in scientific modeling.","Nelson, Peter Hugo",,395,5

Canonical responses are composed of a short wave of plasmablasts (PBs) arising from EF sites, followed by GC producing somatically mutated memory B cells (MBC) and long-lived plasma cells. However, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity maturation can take place at both sites, and a substantial fraction of MBC are produced prior to GC formation. Infection responses range from GC responses that persist for months to persistent EF responses with dominant suppression of GCs. Here, we review the current understanding of the functional output of EF and GC responses and the molecular switches promoting them. We discuss the signals that regulate the magnitude and duration of these responses, and outline gaps in knowledge and important areas of inquiry. Understanding such molecular switches will be critical for vaccine development, interpretation of vaccine efficacy and the treatment for autoimmune diseases.","Elsner, Rebecca A; Shlomchik, Mark J",Immunity,395,11

The coagulation changes mimic but are not identical to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The vast majority of patients with COVID-19 do not meet the criteria for usual forms of DIC. In addition, there seem to be features of a strong local pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy and direct endothelial cell infection and injury by the virus that affect the coagulopathic response to severe COVID-19. It seems COVID-19 leads to a distinct intravascular coagulation syndrome that may need separate diagnostic criteria.","Levi, Marcel; Iba, Toshiaki",Intern. emerg. med,395,16

After providing historical and theoretical context, the authors analyse publicly reported time-series data from Russia and original survey data from Russia and Kyrgyzstan to assess the extent of Sino-phobic attitudes and their associations with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic variables. By also considering attitudes toward Americans and other national groups, the authors show that anti-Chinese sentiment, while high, does not exhibit especially pronounced tendencies. In Russia, nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment are key correlates of Sino-phobia. Additional survey research is necessary to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Sino-phobia and determine whether it hinders China-friendly policies, as some observers have suggested.

This study consisted of 54 individuals (36 female, 18 male) aged 60 years and over who had been diagnosed with AD. During the quarantine period, caregivers of the patients (child, spouse, relatives) who were confined to their homes were contacted by phone and administered a survey composed of questions for neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver burden. Patients' mean age was 77.18±6.96 years. The most worsening symptom was forgetfulness (35.2%) and agitation (24.1%). Incoherent speech, introversion, sleep disturbance, hallucinations, carry on with hobbies, reduced personal care, changes in appetite, and incontinence were less deteriorated. Of the caregivers, 61.1% thought that something terrible would happen to the patient, and 38.9% felt they could not find time for themselves. Drug rejection increased the burden twofold. Telemedicine methods, providing opportunities for the caregiver and the patient to walk outside, and giving medication that dissolves in the mouth or epidermal patches may be useful to prevent disease progression during the lockdown.","Helvaci Yilmaz, N.; Polat, B.; Ermis, A.; Hanoglu, L.",Journal of Experimental and Clinical Medicine (Turkey),395,27

Only 7 patients were treated, but with extraordinary results, opening a new strategy in COVID-19 therapy. Currently, no specific therapies against SARS-CoV-2 are available. The MSCs therapy outcomes reported, are striking, as these cells inhibit the over-activation of the immune system, promoting endogenous repair, by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7-99.4]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections. Level 3 PPE appears to reduce the risk of transmission to anaesthetists who are exposed to mildly symptomatic surgical patients.","Zhong, Qi; Liu, Yin Y; Luo, Qiong; Zou, Yu F; Jiang, Hai X; Li, Hui; Zhang, Jing J; Li, Zhen; Yang, Xin; Ma, Min; Tang, Li J; Chen, Ying Y; Zheng, Feng; Ke, Jian J; Zhang, Zong Z",Br J Anaesth,395,1

We assessed HCWs' willingness to be vaccinated and reasons underlying hesitancy. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey across 17 healthcare institutions. HCWs eligible for vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA) in December 2020 were invited to receive immunization. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of acceptance. Reasons for refusal among those who never intended to be vaccinated (ie, firm refusers) and those who preferred delaying vaccination (ie, vaccine hesitants) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 2,761 respondents (72% female, average age, 44), 2,233 (80.9%) accepted the vaccine. Physicians, environmental services workers and healthcare managers were more likely to accept vaccination compared to nurses. Male sex, age over 50, rehabilitation center workers, and occupational COVID-19 exposure were independently associated with vaccine acceptance by multivariate analysis. Factors for refusal included vaccine novelty, wanting others to receive it first, and insufficient time for decision-making. Among those who declined, 74% reported they may accept future vaccination. Vaccine firm refusers were more likely than vaccine hesitants to distrust pharmaceutical companies and to prefer developing a natural immunity by getting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy exists among HCWs. Our findings provide useful information to plan future interventions and improve acceptance.","Dzieciolowska, Stefania; Hamel, Denis; Gadio, Souleymane; Dionne, Maude; Gagnon, Dominique; Robitaille, Lucie; Cook, Erin; Caron, Isabelle; Talib, Amina; Parkes, Leighanne; Dubé, Ève; Longtin, Yves",Am. j. infect. control,395,16

Current research on Covid-19 is typically based on a single source of information, specifically on structured historical pandemic data. Other studies are exclusively focused on unstructured online retrieved insights, such as data available from social media. However, the combined use of structured and unstructured information is still uncharted. This paper aims at filling this gap, by leveraging historical as well as social media information with a novel data integration methodology. The proposed approach is based on vine copulas, which allow us to improve predictions by exploiting the dependencies between different sources of information. We apply the methodology to combine structured datasets retrieved from official sources and to a big unstructured dataset of information collected from social media. The results show that the proposed approach, compared to traditional approaches, yields more accurate estimations and predictions of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Ansell, Lauren; Valle, Luciana Dalla",,395,12

We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP), and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83·6%), detected first on March 2nd, although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1, 68·2% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T ('Basel cluster'), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the 'Basel cluster', some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, showing several introduction events from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages, such as the first (B.1.1), did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases, with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires, to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations, as well as travel history, to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first reported in China, with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts. The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection. The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible. The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days. The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first. Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate.

On the other hand, higher sedentary time during the pandemic period can have deleterious effects. The objective of this study was to compare physical activity levels, sedentary time, and sleep parameters during the pre-COVID period and the COVID-19 pandemic period in young badminton athletes. Methods: Fifteen young badminton athletes were evaluated during a pre-COVID period (July 2019) and during the COVID-19 period (July 2020). Sleep parameters, physical activity level, and sedentary time were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer. Participants wore the accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 7 days consecutively. In addition, the average of each sleep parameter [time in bed and total sleep time in hours per day, sleep efficiency (%), wake after sleep onset (WASO, total per day), and sleep latency (minutes per day)] was reported over the 7-day period. Results: Athletes presented increased sedentary time (pre-COVID = 7.0 ± 1.1 vs.COVID-19 = 8.9 ± 1.9 h/day, p = 0.004, d = 1.30) and significant decreases in the total PA observed in counts per day (pre-COVID = 2,967,064.4 ± 671,544.1 vs. COVID-19 = 1,868,210.2 ± 449,768.4 counts/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.99), time in vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 7.7 ± 0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.1 ± 1.2 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.56), and time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 8.1 ± 0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.5 ± 1.3 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.48). There were no significant differences for time in light and moderate PA or in sleep parameters (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Young badminton athletes presented increased sedentary time, and decreased total physical activity, time in MVPA, and time in vigorous activities during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID period, however, there were no significant differences in sleep parameters.","da Silva Santos, Arilene Maria; Rossi, Fabrício Eduardo; Dos Santos Nunes de Moura, Helton Pereira; de Sousa Junior, Antonio Valdeci Marreiro; Machado, Dionis C D; Neves, Lucas Melo; Brito, Aldeni Silva; Moura, Pedro; Monteiro, Paula Alves; Freitas Junior, Ismael Forte; Dos Santos, Marcos Antonio Pereira; Ribeiro, Sérgio Luiz Galan",Sport Sci Health,395,1

We compared the SARS-CoV-2 samples purified by two consecutive chromatographic procedures (size exclusion chromatography [SEC], followed by ion-exchange chromatography [IEC]) with samples purified by ultracentrifugation. The samples prepared using SEC and IEC retained more spikes on the surface than the ones prepared using ultracentrifugation, as confirmed by TEM and AFM. TEM showed that the spike (S) proteins were in the pre-fusion conformation. Notably, the S proteins could be recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies. Analytical TEM showed that the inactivated virions retained nucleic acid. Altogether, we demonstrated that the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions retain the structural features of native viruses and provide a prospective vaccine candidate.","Bagrov, Dmitry V.; Glukhov, Grigory S.; Moiseenko, Andrey V.; Karlova, Maria G.; Litvinov, Daniil S.; Zaitsev, Petr А Kozlovskaya Liubov I.; Shishova, Anna A.; Kovpak, Anastasia A.; Ivin, Yury Y.; Piniaeva, Anastasia N.; Oksanich, Alexey S.; Volok, Viktor P.; Osolodkin, Dmitry I.; Ishmukhametov, Aydar A.; Egorov, Alexey M.; Shaitan, Konstantin V.; Kirpichnikov, Mikhail P.; Sokolova, Olga S.",Microscopy Research and Technique,395,20

Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19 using a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. METHODS: We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 µg or 50 µg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 µg or 50 µg) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 µg vaccine (n=20), or the 50 µg vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 32·6 (SD 9·4) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 µg vaccine (n=150), or 50 µg vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 µg vaccine (n=150), or 50 µg vaccine (n=150). The mean age of participants was 43·5 (SD 9·2) years. In both phase 1 and phase 2, adverse events reported within 30 days after vaccination were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in most cases (phase 1: six [60%] of ten participants in the placebo group, 14 [70%] of 20 in the 25 µg group, and 18 [90%] of 20 in the 50 µg group; phase 2: 37 [25%] of 150 in the two-dose placebo group, 43 [29%] of 150 in the two-dose 25 µg group, 50 [33%] of 150 in the two-dose 50 µg group, 47 [31%] of 150 in the three-dose placebo group, 72 [48%] of 150 in the three-dose 25 µg group, and 65 [43%] of 150 in the three-dose 50 µg group). In phase 1, two (10%) grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in the 50 µg group. In phase 2, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported by 18 participants (four [3%] in the two-dose 25 µg vaccine group, two [1%] in the two-dose 50 µg vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, four [3%] in the three-dose 25 µg vaccine group, and six [4%] in the three-dose 50 µg vaccine group), and 11 were considered vaccine related (two [1%] in the two-dose 25 µg vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 µg vaccine group, one [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, two [1%] in the three-dose 25 µg vaccine group, and five [3%] in the three-dose 50 µg vaccine group); seven participants reported serious adverse events (one [1%] in the two-dose 25 µg vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 µg vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, one [1%] in the three-dose 25 µg vaccine group, and two [1%] in the three-dose 50 µg vaccine group), but none was considered vaccine related. In phase 2, on the two-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the second dose were 76% (114 of 150 participants) in the 25 µg group and 72% (108 of 150) in the 50 µg group; on the three-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the third dose were 97% (143 of 148 participants) in the 25 µg group and 93% (138 of 148) in the 50 µg group. In the two-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the second dose were 17·7 (95% CI 13·6-23·1) in the 25 µg group and 14·1 (10·8-18·3) in the 50 µg group. In the three-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the third dose were 102·5 (95% CI 81·8-128·5) in the 25 µg group and 69·1 (53·0-90·0) in the 50 µg group. INTERPRETATION: The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 appears to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 and 2 trials support the use of the 25 µg dose in a three-dose schedule in an ongoing phase 3 trial for large-scale evaluation of ZF2001's safety and efficacy.

The humoral immune response (HIR) of patients with cancer against SARS-CoV-2 is not well characterized. To better understand it, we conducted a serological study of hospitalized patients with cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a unicentric, retrospective study enrolling adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a central hospital from March 15 to June 17, 2020, whose serum samples were quantified for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain or spike protein IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies. The aims of the study were to assess the HIR to SARS-CoV-2; correlate it with different cancer types, stages, and treatments; clarify the interplay between the HIR and clinical outcomes of patients with cancer; and compare the HIR of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with and without cancer. RESULTS: We included 72 SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects (19 with cancer, 53 controls). About 90% of controls revealed a robust serological response. Among patients with cancer, a strong response was verified in 57.9%, with 42.1% showing a persistently weak response. Treatment with chemotherapy within 14 days before positivity was the only factor statistically shown to be associated with persistently weak serological responses among patients with cancer. No significant differences in outcomes were observed between patients with strong and weak responses. All IgG, IgM, IgA, and total Ig antibody titers were significantly lower in patients with cancer compared with those without. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of patients with cancer develop a proper HIR. Recent chemotherapy treatment may be associated with weak serological responses among patients with cancer. Patients with cancer have a weaker SARS-CoV-2 antibody response compared with those without cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These results place the spotlight on patients with cancer, particularly those actively treated with chemotherapy. These patients may potentially be more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, so it is important to provide oncologists further theoretical support (with concrete examples and respective mechanistic correlations) for the decision of starting, maintaining, or stopping antineoplastic treatments (particularly chemotherapy) not only on noninfected but also on infected patients with cancer in accordance with cancer type, stage and prognosis, treatment agents, treatment setting, and SARS-CoV-2 infection risks.","Esperança-Martins, Miguel; Gonçalves, Lisa; Soares-Pinho, Inês; Gomes, Andreia; Serrano, Marta; Blankenhaus, Birte; Figueiredo-Campos, Patrícia; Catarina-Marques, Ana; Castro-Barbosa, Ana; Cardoso, Ana; Antunes-Meireles, Pedro; Atalaia-Barbacena, Henrique; Gaspar, Pedro; Howell-Monteiro, Patrícia; Pais-de-Lacerda, António; Mota, Catarina; Veldhoen, Marc",Oncologist,395,20

In this review, we narrated the available data, from credible publishers, regarding the possible role of polyphenols and natural extracts-containing polyphenols in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their immune-boosting properties. It was revealed that polyphenols could be considered as promising biologically active substances for the prevention of COVID-19. The underlying potential mechanism behind this action is mostly due to the antiviral activities and the immune-regulation functions of polyphenols against COVID-19-infections. Antivirus polyphenolic-based medications can mitigate SARS-CoV-2-enzymes, which are vital for virus duplication and infection. It was also found that triterpenoid, anthraquinone, flavonoids, and tannins are possible keys to scheming antiviral therapies for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-proteases. The identified pharmacophore structures of polyphenols could be utilized in the explanation of novel anti-COVID-19 designs. The advantage of using mixtures containing polyphenols is related to the high-safety profile without having major side-effects, but further randomized controlled trials are required in the upcoming studies.","Mehany, Taha; Khalifa, Ibrahim; Barakat, Hassan; Althwab, Sami A; Alharbi, Yousef M; El-Sohaimy, Sobhy",Food Biosci,395,20

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools. Recently devised CRISPR-technologies represent the unprecedented opportunity to reshape epidemiological surveillance and molecular diagnostics.","Kostyusheva, Anastasiya; Brezgin, Sergey; Babin, Yurii; Vasilyeva, Irina; Glebe, Dieter; Kostyushev, Dmitry; Chulanov, Vladimir",Methods (S.

However, these drugs may have side effects such as hearing loss. This study aimed to describe the hearing function in SLE patients using antimalarials. Secondarily, this study aimed to investigate whether SLE causes hearing loss and if there are any serological or clinical aspects of this diseases associated with inner ear damage. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study included 84 individuals (43 SLE patients and 41 controls) with audiometry and tympanometry tests. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and treatment profiles of SLE patients were extracted from the charts. RESULTS: SLE patients had more sensorineural hearing loss than controls (23.2% vs. 0; P = .001). Pure-tone averages in SLE patients using antimalarials and not using antimalarials were similar (8.75 vs. 8.75; P = .63). At 8,000 Hz, antimalarial dug nonusers performed worse than users (10.00 vs. 22.50; P = .03). Tympanometry was normal in all participants.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C), with symptoms similar to Kawasaki syndrome, was described in young minors testing positive for COVID-19. The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined MIS-C as occurring in <21-year-olds, triggering hundreds of PubMed-listed papers. However, postpubertal adolescents are no longer children biologically; the term MIS-C is misleading. Furthermore, MIS also occurs in adults, termed MIS-A by the CDC. Acute and delayed inflammations can be triggered by COVID-19. The 18th birthday is an administrative not a biological age limit, whereas the body matures slowly during puberty. This blur in defining children leads to confusion regarding MIS-C/MIS-A. United States and European Union (EU) drug approval is handled separately for children, defined as <18-year-olds, ascribing non-existent physical characteristics up to the 18th birthday. This blur between the administrative and the physiological meanings for the term child is causing flawed demands for pediatric studies in all drugs and vaccines, including those against COVID-19. Effective treatment of all conditions, including COVID-19, should be based on actual physiological need. Now, the flawed definition for children in the development of drugs and vaccines and their approval is negatively impacting prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in minors. This review reveals the necessity for redefining pediatric age groups to rapidly establish recommendations for optimal prevention and treatment in minors.","Rose, Klaus; Grant-Kels, Jane M; Ettienne, Earl B; Tanjinatus, Oishi; Striano, Pasquale; Neubauer, David",,395,18

This qualitative study explored barriers and enablers for the implementation of these measures in German dental practices. METHODS: Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted in November/December 2020 (purposive/snowball sampling). The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capabilities, Opportunities and Motivations influencing Behaviors model (COM-B) were used to guide interviews. Mayring's content analysis was employed to analyze interviews. RESULTS: All dentists (28-71 years, 4/8 female/male) had implemented infection control measures. Measures most frequently not adopted were FFP2 masks, face shields (impractical), the rotation of teams (insufficient staffing) and the avoidance of aerosol-generating treatments. Dentists with personal COVID-19 experience or those seeing themselves as a role model were more eager to adopt measures. We identified 34 enablers and 20 barriers. Major barriers were the lack of knowledge, guidelines and recommendations as well as limited availability and high costs of equipment. Pressure by staff and patients to ensure infection control was an enabler. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists are motivated to implement infection control measures, but lacking opportunities limited the adoption of certain measures. Policy makers and equipment manufacturers should address these points to increase the implementation of infection control measures against COVID-19 and potential future pandemics.","Müller, Anne; Melzow, Florentina Sophie; Göstemeyer, Gerd; Paris, Sebastian; Schwendicke, Falk",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),395,33

This paper reports a study that analysed selected 'COVID art forms' through arts and health and critical health psychology frameworks. Art forms produced between March and July 2020, and available in the public sphere - traditional media, social media and public spaces - were collated. The data consisted of comedy, cartoons, songs, murals and textile designs. Three key functions emerged from analysis: health promotion (comedy, cartoons, songs); disease prevention (masks); and improving the aesthetics of the healthcare environment (murals). Textile designs performed broader socio-cultural functions of memorialising and political advocacy. Similar to earlier HIV/AIDS and Ebola arts interventions in other African countries, these Ghanaian COVID art forms translated public health information on COVID-19 in ways that connected emotionally, created social awareness and improved public understanding. However, some art forms had limitations: for example, songs that edutained using fear-based strategies or promoting conspiracy theories on the origins and treatment of COVID-19, and state-sponsored visual art that represented public health messaging decoupled from socio-economic barriers to health protection. These were likely to undermine the public health communication goals of behaviour modification.

We assessed confirmed COVID-19 cases at an SNF impacted by COVID-19 in the United States to identify early indications of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We performed retrospective reviews of electronic health records for residents with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during February 28-March 16, 2020. Records were abstracted for comorbidities, signs and symptoms, and illness outcomes during the 2 weeks before and after the date of positive specimen collection. Relative risks (RRs) of hospitalization and death were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 118 residents tested among approximately 130 residents from Facility A during February 28-March 16, 2020, 101 (86%) were found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. At initial presentation, about two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2-positive residents had an abnormal vital sign or change in oxygen status. Most (90.2%) symptomatic residents had elevated temperature, change in mental status, lethargy, change in oxygen status, or cough; 9 (11.0%) did not have fever, cough, or shortness of breath during their clinical course. Those with change in oxygen status had an increased relative risk (RR) of 30-day mortality [51.1% vs 29.7%, RR 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.0]. RR of hospitalization was higher for residents with underlying hepatic disease (1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2) or obesity (1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1); RR of death was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings reinforce the critical role that monitoring of signs and symptoms can have in identifying COVID-19 cases early. SNFs should ensure they have a systematic approach for responding to abnormal vital signs and oxygen saturation and consider ensuring common signs and symptoms identified in Facility A are among those they monitor.","Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Bardossy, Ana C; Currie, Dustin W; Schwartz, Noah G; Zacks, Rachael L T; Chow, Eric J; Dyal, Jonathan W; Ali, Hammad; Kay, Meagan; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Clark, Shauna; Sykes, Kaitlyn; Jernigan, John A; Honein, Margaret A; Clark, Thomas A; Stone, Nimalie D; Reddy, Sujan C; Rao, Agam K",J Am Med Dir Assoc,395,32

The effective implementation of this online learning method depends on various factors affecting learners' satisfaction. The current study examines the relationship between learners' satisfaction on distance learning and factors (online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, fear of COVID-19) that impact students' remote learning experience among undergraduate engineering students in Jordanian public and private universities. Data was collected via an online survey measuring students' baseline of distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 which was distributed between June to August 2020. The participants in this study were 505 undergraduate engineering students (353 males, 152 females) who were mostly Jordanian (92.6%) with an average age of 21 (SD = 1.86). There were 298 participants from public universities (59%) and 207 from private universities (41%). Findings reported a significant gap between public and private universities students' distance learning satisfaction, online learning self-efficacy, and anxiety level while the students' scores on fear of COVID-19 was insignificant. Students in private universities were also reported to have higher baseline rates for all the constructs involved in this study. Furthermore, the online learning self-efficacy scores significantly predicted the distance learning satisfaction level among undergraduate engineering students when other constructs were treated as a constant. The findings of this study offer important implications for instructors in considering self-efficacy skills when working with undergraduate students. Limitations and recommendations for future research were also outlined. © 2021 IEEE.","Al-Tarawneh, L.; Al-Nasah, M.; Awwad, F.

The aim of this review is to shed the light on a possible mechanism by which HCQ can defeat the COVID-19, a disease characterized by the WHO as a pandemic. Literatures from Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar were cast-off to search the literature data. The keywords used are antimalarial agent, COVID-19, Hydroxychloroquine, SARS-CoV-2 and Zinc sulfate. The review summarizes the benefits of using HCQ against COVID-19 through exploiting the ability of this antimalarial agent in ameliorating the body immunity, inhibiting and/or delaying the viral glycosylation by increasing the pH inside the host cell and also via suppressing the viral transcription and replication through the formation of a complex structure after binding with zinc. We concluded that these interfering properties of HCQ support human immunity to fight against the progression of COVID-19. We hypothesize that the therapeutic efficiency of HCQ against the COVID-19 can be enhanced by the concurrent administration of zinc sulfate.","Mousa, Y. J.; Mahmood, M. B.; Isihak, F.

This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by a cohort of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) after a seven-week period of lockdown measures, and to analyze serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels as a potential predictor of distress severity. METHODS: Fifty-nine remitted MDD and fifty-three euthymic BD patients were enrolled. An online dedicated survey was administered to obtain lockdown-related information and to evaluate COVID-19 related distress by using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Patients' medical records were reviewed to collect sociodemographic and clinical data, including serum 25(OH)D levels dosed in the three months preceding the outbreak. A multivariate general linear model was adopted to test the effect of factors of interest on psychological distress. RESULTS: In our sample (nâ¯=â¯112), 29 subjects (25.9 %) reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 35 (31.2 %) and 48 (42.9 %) displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood of psychological distress, respectively. Low serum 25(OH)D levels (pâ¯=â¯0.005) and MDD diagnosis (pâ¯=â¯0.001) specifically predicted the severity of psychological distress. Living alone during the lockdown, a longer duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in subjects with COVID-19 related distress. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum 25(OH)D levels and MDD diagnosis predicted an increased vulnerability to the stressful impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that vitamin D may represent a biological factor mediating the psychological response to stress in individuals with affective disorders and provide further insight into tailoring intervention strategies.","Di Nicola, Marco; Dattoli, Luigi; Moccia, Lorenzo; Pepe, Maria; Janiri, Delfina; Fiorillo, Andrea; Janiri, Luigi; Sani, Gabriele",Psychoneuroendocrinology,395,24

The pairing-dubbed happy hypoxia but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia-is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology. This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals. It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia. These mechanisms include the way dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, the way the prevailing carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) blunts the brain's response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve. Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for patients with hypoxemia free of dyspnea are operating in the dark, placing vulnerable patients with COVID-19 at considerable risk. In conclusion, features of COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.","Tobin, Martin J; Laghi, Franco; Jubran, Amal",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,395,1

In times of scarcity, patient prioritization based on non-medical considerations might be necessary. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to pilot test a survey to elicit public opinions on the relative importance of non-medical considerations in priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU in times of crisis. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment was used to collect social preferences for priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The six attributes were patient age, profession, guardianship, risk-conscious behavior on a societal level, health-conscious behavior, and expected ICU length of stay. The data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model. Interactions between the age and profession of the respondents and the age and profession of the patient profiles were considered. RESULTS: The mean (± standard deviation) age of respondents was 35.9 ± 14.5 years. In all, 70% of respondents indicated that medical and/or non-medical considerations should play a role in prioritizing patients for the ICU, whereas 15% agreed with a ""first come, first served"" strategy and the remaining 15% had no opinion. Respondents deemed risk-conscious behavior on a societal level to be the most important non-medical factor that should be used to prioritize patients in phase three of the framework, garnering an attribute importance (AI) of 31.2%, followed by patient age (AI 16.3%) and health-conscious behavior (AI 16.0%). ICU length of stay had the lowest impact on patient prioritization for ICU admittance (AI 10.9%). Younger and older respondents attached more importance to age than respondents in the middle age group and indicated a stronger preference to prioritize patients in their own age group (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate the relative importance members of the public attach to responsible societal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next phase of the study, we will elicit the perspectives of a representative sample of the Dutch population.

However, trauma admissions are not scheduled and cannot be postponed. There is a paucity of information available on continuing trauma care during the pandemic. The study purpose was to describe multicenter trauma care process changes made during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive survey summarized the response to the COVID-19 pandemic at six Level I trauma centers. The survey was completed in 05/2020. Questions were asked about personal protective equipment, ventilators, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and negative pressure rooms. Data were summarized as proportions. RESULTS: The survey took an average of 5 days. Sixty-seven percent reused N-95 respirators; 50% sanitized them with 25% using ultraviolet light. One hospital (17%) had regional resources impacted. Thirty-three percent created ventilator allocation protocols. Most hospitals (83%) designated more beds to the ICU; 50% of hospitals designated an ICU for COVID-19 patients.

The study explored vaccination attitudes and hesitancy with regard to seasonal influenza and the anticipated Covid-19 vaccines among healthcare professionals and students. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires were distributed through electronic mail to healthcare professionals working in Malta's Health Division, at University of Malta, and in community pharmacies, and to members of Malta College of Family Doctors. Results: The response rate was 18.60% (n = 1802). The percentages of those who took the influenza vaccine last year (2019) and who will take it this year (2020) increased across professionals, highest for family doctors and lowest for trainees in family medicine. The proportion of those likelier to take the Covid-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Both family doctor trainees and nurses showed the highest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were mostly related to insufficient knowledge, although pharmacists (community, academic and students) were concerned about the rapid approval of the vaccine. Conclusion: An increase in influenza vaccine uptake is expected in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Of concern is the hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccine particular within healthcare professionals, a cohort expected to be insightful and potential role models for the community. The associated hesitancy for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy, which brings forward the need for healthcare professionals to be engaged in education, vaccination policies and administration in order to ensure compliance.

Considering the prior growth of the aviation industry and to meet the Paris Agreement's 2-degree Celsius target, aircraft emissions must be reduced rather than simply offset. This Perspective discusses the role of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a more transformative energy resource to decarbonize airlines. The opportunities and challenges in the development of SAF are reviewed to analyze how governments and airlines can move forward. Although airlines struggle with decreased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline sector can fuel both sustainable flights and economic recovery if governments can harness this unprecedented time to allocate stimulus funds to support SAF. Promoting SAF uptake during this challenging time requires robust, multi-stakeholder partnerships between governments, airlines, airports, fuel producers, and investors. This Perspective overviews several potential measures to promote SAF including policy and regulations, financing contracts, research and development, business-to-business incentives, and business-to-consumer incentives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Santos, K.; Delina, L.",Energy Research and Social Science,395,1

Using chimeric viruses and antibody-selected viral mutants, we show that multiple neutralizing epitopes, within and outside the viral receptor binding domain (RBD), are variably targeted by polyclonal plasma antibodies and coincide with sequences that are enriched for diversity in natural SARS-CoV-2 populations. By combining plasma-selected spike substitutions, we generated synthetic polymutant spike proteins that resisted polyclonal antibody neutralization to a similar degree as currently circulating variants of concern (VOC). Importantly, by aggregating VOC-associated and plasma-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike are sufficient to confer near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescents and mRNA vaccine recipients. Strikingly however, plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination, neutralized this highly resistant SARS-CoV-2 polymutant, and also neutralized diverse sarbecoviruses. Thus, optimally elicited human polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be resilient to substantial future SARS-CoV-2 variation and may confer protection against future sarbecovirus pandemics.","Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Rutkowska, Magdalena; Poston, Daniel; Silva, Justin Da; Zhang, Fengwen; Bednarski, Eva; Cho, Alice; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Gaebler, Christian; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C.; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D.",,395,16

Direct oral anticoagulants have failed to show non-inferiority compared to vitamin K antagonists for the prevention of major thrombotic events. Antiphospholipid antibodies are often found in patients with acute COVID-19 but clear evidence supporting an association between these antibodies and the risk of thrombotic events, including stroke and cerebral venous thrombosis, is still lacking.

The comparative performance of psychotherapies for suicidality is unclear because few head-to-head clinical trials have been conducted. Objective: To compare the efficacy of psychotherapies for the treatment of self-harm and suicidality among children and adolescents. Data Sources: Four major bibliographic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase) were searched for clinical trials comparing psychotherapy with control conditions from inception to September 2020. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials comparing psychotherapies for suicidality and/or self-harm with control conditions among children and adolescents were included after a blinded review by 3 independent reviewers (A.B., M.P., and J.W.). Data Extraction and Synthesis: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed for data abstraction, and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate study-level risk of bias. Data abstraction was performed by 1 reviewer (A.B.) and confirmed by 2 independent blinded reviewers (J.W. and M.P.). Data were analyzed from October 15, 2020, to February 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were dichotomized self-harm and retention in treatment. The secondary outcomes were dichotomized all-cause treatment discontinuation and scores on instruments measuring suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. Effect sizes were pooled using frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis models to generate summary odds ratios (ORs) and Cohen d standardized mean differences (SMDs). Negative Cohen d SMDs or ORs less than 1 indicated that the treatment reduced the parameter of interest relative to the control condition (eg, signifying a beneficial association with suicidal ideation). Results: The systematic search generated 1272 unique records. Of those, 44 randomized clinical trials (5406 total participants; 4109 female participants [76.0%]) from 49 articles were selected (5 follow-up studies were merged with their primary clinical trials to avoid publication bias). The selected clinical trials spanned January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2020. The median duration of treatment was 3 months (range, 0.25-12.00 months), and the median follow-up period was 12 months (range, 1-36 months). None of the investigated psychotherapies were associated with increases in study withdrawals or improvements in retention in treatment compared with treatment as usual. Dialectical behavioral therapies were associated with reductions in self-harm (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.64) and suicidal ideation (Cohen d SMD, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.23) at the end of treatment, while mentalization-based therapies were associated with decreases in self-harm (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.97) and suicidal ideation (Cohen d SMD, -1.22; 95% CI, -2.18 to -0.26) at the end of follow-up. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of high risk of bias overall, heterogeneity, publication bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Conclusions and Relevance: Although some psychotherapeutic modalities appear to be acceptable and efficacious for reducing self-harm and suicidality among children and adolescents, methodological issues and high risk of bias prevent a consistent estimate of their comparative performance.","Bahji, Anees; Pierce, Matthew; Wong, Jennifer; Roberge, Johanne N; Ortega, Iliana; Patten, Scott",JAMA Netw Open,395,20

Photochromic indicators (PCIs) can accurately measure UV-C dose on nonplanar surfaces, but often saturate below doses required to decontaminate porous, multilayered textiles such as N95s. Here, we investigate the use of optical attenuators to extend PCI dynamic range while maintaining a near-ideal angular response - critical for accurate measurements when UV-C is uncollimated. Through an analytical model, we show that tuning attenuator refractive index, attenuation coefficient, and thickness can extend dynamic range, but compromises ideal angular response unless the attenuator is an ideal diffuser. To demonstrate this tradeoff empirically, we pair PCIs with model specular (floated borosilicate) and diffuse (polytetrafluoroethylene) attenuators, characterize the angular response, and evaluate on-N95 UV-C dose measurement accuracy of each PCI-attenuator stack in a UV-C decontamination system. While both borosilicate and polytetrafluoroethylene increase PCI dynamic range>4$\times$, both attenuators introduce angle-dependent transmittance, which causes location-dependent underestimation of UV-C dose. The PCI-borosilicate and PCI-polytetrafluoroethylene stacks underreport true on-N95 dose by 1) 14.7% and 3.6%, respectively, on a surface near-normal to the array of source lamps, and 2) 40.8% and 19.8%, respectively, on a steeply sloped location. Overall, we demonstrate that while planar optical attenuators can increase PCI dynamic range, verification of near-ideal angular response is critical for accurate UV-C dose measurement.","Su, Alison; Geldert, Alisha; Grist, Samantha M.; Herr, Amy E.",,395,16

In this paper, we present feasible solutions for detecting and labeling infected tissues on CT lung images of such patients. Two structurally-different deep learning techniques, SegNet and U-NET, are investigated for semantically segmenting infected tissue regions in CT lung images. METHODS: We propose to use two known deep learning networks, SegNet and U-NET, for image tissue classification. SegNet is characterized as a scene segmentation network and U-NET as a medical segmentation tool. Both networks were exploited as binary segmentors to discriminate between infected and healthy lung tissue, also as multi-class segmentors to learn the infection type on the lung. Each network is trained using seventy-two data images, validated on ten images, and tested against the left eighteen images. Several statistical scores are calculated for the results and tabulated accordingly. RESULTS: The results show the superior ability of SegNet in classifying infected/non-infected tissues compared to the other methods (with 0.95 mean accuracy), while the U-NET shows better results as a multi-class segmentor (with 0.91 mean accuracy). CONCLUSION: Semantically segmenting CT scan images of COVID-19 patients is a crucial goal because it would not only assist in disease diagnosis, also help in quantifying the severity of the illness, and hence, prioritize the population treatment accordingly. We propose computer-based techniques that prove to be reliable as detectors for infected tissue in lung CT scans. The availability of such a method in today's pandemic would help automate, prioritize, fasten, and broaden the treatment of COVID-19 patients globally.","Saood, Adnan; Hatem, Iyad",BMC Med Imaging,395,24

Purpose was further classified into the following categories: news, general information, self-diagnosis, contact tracing, notices to contacts, notification of close cases, awareness, helplines, monitoring of clinical parameters, recording of symptoms and treatment, and messaging with health care professionals. RESULTS: We identified 114 apps on the investigated platforms. Of these, 62/114 (54.4%) were on Android and 52/114 (45.6%) were on iOS. Of the 114 apps, 37 (32.5%) were developed in Europe, 32 (28.1%) in Asia, and 30 (26.3%) in North America. The most frequent languages were English (65/114, 57.0%), Spanish (34/114, 29.8%), and Chinese (14/114, 12.3%). The most common categories were health and well-being/fitness apps (41/114, 41.2%) and medicine apps (43/114, 37.7%). Of the 114 apps, 113 (99.1%) were free. The mean time between the date of the analysis and the date of the last update was 11.1 days (SD 11.0). Overall, 95 of the 114 apps (83.3%) were intended for the general population, 99 apps (7.9%) were intended for health professionals, and 3 apps (2.6%) were intended for both. Regarding the type of developer, 64/114 apps (56.1%) were developed by governments; 42/114 (64.1%) were developed by national governments, and 23/114 (35.9%) were developed by regional governments. The apps with the highest number of downloads (100,000+) were developed by governments (P=.13), except for the World Health Organization app (500,000+). The purposes of the apps available in Western languages (107/114, 93.9%) were determined; the most common purposes were general information about COVID-19 (66, 64.0%), COVID-19 news (53, 51.0%), recording of symptoms (53, 51.0%), and contact tracing (51, 47.7%). More than one purpose was identified for 99/107 apps (92.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper offers a comprehensive and unique review of all available COVID-19 apps. Governments have adopted these tools during the pandemic, and more than half of the apps were developed by government agencies. The most common purposes of the apps are providing information on the numbers of infected, recovered, and deceased patients, recording of symptoms, and contact tracing.","Collado-Borrell, Roberto; Escudero-Vilaplana, Vicente; Villanueva-Bueno, Cristina; Herranz-Alonso, Ana; Sanjurjo-Saez, Maria",J Med Internet Res,395,24

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19), outbreak has become the first pandemic of the 21st century and is the deadliest pandemic after the 1918 Spanish Flu. Except, the two previous epidemics, SARS-CoV (2002 epidemic, China) and MERS-CoV (2012 epidemic, Middle Eastern region), CoVs are known the world over as the mild pathogens of humans and animals. Despite several measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic, it has affected more than 210 countries and regional territories distressing more than 5.3 million people and claiming nearly 0.34 million lives globally. Several findings point towards the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the humans through animals, especially the wild animals of the Chinese live seafood wet market. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is another example of diseases originating from the human-animal interface and spreading through international borders causing global health emergencies. Most of the countries around the globe are stumbling due to the COVID-19 pandemic with severe threats and panic among the mass population. World Health Organization (WHO), international and national health authorities are working with excessive efforts for effective and impactful interventions to contain the virus. It is significant to comprehend the inclination of these viruses to jump between different species, and the establishment of infection in the entirely new host, identification of significant reservoirs of coronaviruses. Several animal species such as cats, dogs, tiger, and minks have been confirmed to get SARS-CoV-2 infections from COVID-19 infected person. Laboratory investigations point out those cats are the most susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2, and it can evidence with clinical disease. The studies carried out on animal's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 further support the human-to-animal spread of the virus. In this review, we focus on addressing COVID-19 infections in domestic and wild animals.","Vinodh Kumar, O. R.; Ramkumar,; Pruthvishree, B. S.; Pande, Tripti; Sinha, D. K.; Singh, B.

To examine this question and to help clarify the possible risk, we analyzed 14 wind instruments, first qualitatively by making airflows visible while playing, and second quantitatively by measuring air velocity at three distances (1, 1.5, 2 m) in the direction of the instruments' bells. Measurements took place with wind instrumentalists of the Bamberg Symphony in their concert hall. Our findings highlight that while playing, no airflows escaping from any of the wind instruments-from the bell with brass instruments or from the mouthpiece, keyholes or bell with woodwinds-were measurable beyond a distance of 1.5 m, regardless of volume, pitch or what was played. With that, air velocity while playing corresponded to the usual value of 1 m/s in hall-like rooms. For air-jet woodwinds, alto flute and piccolo, significant air movements were seen close to the mouthpiece, which escaped directly into the room.","Spahn, Claudia; Hipp, Anna Maria; Schubert, Bernd; Axt, Marcus Rudolf; Stratmann, Markus; Schmölder, Christian; Richter, Bernhard",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),395,16

Transient production of spike in both human embryonic kidney (HEK) and CHO cells mediated by polyethyleneimine was increased significantly (up to 10.9-fold) by a reduction in culture temperature to 32°C to permit extended duration cultures. Based on these data GS-CHO pools stably producing spike trimer under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were cultured in hypothermic conditions with combinations of bioactive small molecules to increase yield of purified spike product 4.9-fold to 53 mg/L. Purification of recombinant spike by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography initially yielded a variety of co-eluting protein impurities identified as host cell derived by mass spectrometry, which were separated from spike trimer using a modified imidazole gradient elution. Purified CHO spike trimer antigen was used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from patient cohorts previously tested for viral infection by polymerase chain reaction, including those who had displayed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms.

However, recent implants and technique advances may allow for improvement in outcomes. Our institution has developed novel graft constructs and techniques for reconstructions with preclinical data supporting clinical use. Our study purpose was to assess clinical outcomes after reconstruction for MKLI using our constructs and techniques. Overall success rate, failure/revision rates, return to work (RTW)/return to sports (RTS) rates, and complications were evaluated testing the hypothesis that novel methods would be associated with clinical benefits with respect to applications and outcomes compared with historical results. We reviewed a single-surgeon, longitudinal database of 42 patients who underwent multiligament reconstruction at our institution using these techniques for at least two-ligament injuries. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at a minimum 1-year follow-up. Among these patients, 33 patients (mean age of 28.9 years, mean body mass index (BMI) of 33.2 kg/m2, mean follow-up of 14.2 months) were included for outcomes analyses. With the definition of success as having a VAS score of less than or equal to 2 without revision/salvage surgery due to recurrent/residual instability or arthritis, overall success rate was 88% (29/33). The mean VAS scores improved from 5 ± 2 to 2 ± 2. The mean preoperative PROMIS mental health score was 36.2 ± 7, general health was 33.5 ± 6, pain was 62.7 ± 8, and physical function score was 29.4 ± 3. At the final follow-up, PROMIS MH was 50.2 ± 10, GH was 44.4 ± 9, pain was 54.3 ± 9, and PF was 42.6 ± 8.4. Return to work rate was 94% (31/33), and 52% (17/33) of patients were able to RTS at any level. Our results demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes associated with a primary success rate of 88% and RTW rate of 94%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 9.5% of cases and revision and failure rates were 9% and 3%, respectively. Our initial results suggest that multiligament reconstructions using novel graft constructs and techniques are safe and effective and can be considered an appropriate option for reconstruction of the full clinical spectrum of MLKIs.","Lee, John Hee-Young; Cook, James L; Wilson, Nichole; Rucinski, Kylee; Stannard, James P",J. knee surg,395,16

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 1262 participants. The Covid-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS) were used to measure outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were constructed to determine risk factors for coronaphobia. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between C19P-S and JSS. RESULTS: The following risk factors were found to be associated with coronaphobia: gender, marital status, presence of chronic disease, staying home, and sleep disturbances. Female gender (OR = 2.23 and OR = 2.12), being married (OR = 1.31 and OR = 1.45), chronic disease status (OR = 1.39 and OR = 1.27), staying home (OR = 1.72 and OR = 1.35) and sleep disturbances (OR = 2.63 and OR = 2.49) were found to be associated with the likelihood of having a higher coronaphobia score (p < 0.05). Weak positive correlations were found between C19P-S and its subscales and JSS scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Female gender, being married, having chronic diseases, staying home, and having sleep disturbances were found to be risk factors for having high coronaphobia scores. Moreover, the severity of coronaphobia was associated with sleep disturbances. These results should be considered in the management of coronaphobia.","Karaaslan, Yasemin; Mete, Oguzhan; Karadag, Mehmet; Ozer Kaya, Derya; Toprak Celenay, Seyda",Sleep Med,395,14

Quite appropriately, the pandemic has been declared a non-traditional security (NTS) threat in many countries in Europe and Asia. Beyond its detrimental effect on public health, COVID-19 is testing the international resolve to cooperate and represents a particularly tricky challenge to regionalism. Due to the nature of pandemics, regional pandemic management is imperative. However, the two most successful regional organisations, the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have not been able to match the resolve of their individual member states, and there is a substantial gap between timely and robust national pandemic management and inadequacy at the regional level. This is a paradox that merits further investigation. To what extent and why diverged early national and early regional responses to COVID-19? This article identifies a causal relationship between robust national pandemic management as a result of early securitisation and ensuing paralysis on regional level, a process which I call the 'selffulfilling prophecy of realism'-a vicious cycle of national self-help responses paralysing regional cooperation. This article contributes early to the impact of COVID-19 on regionalism by analysing EU and ASEAN pandemic management efforts, investigating what has hindered or facilitated successful regional cooperation and identifying room for meaningful interregionalism.","Kliem, Frederick",Asia Eur J,395,7

This has inspired new drugs able to decrease insulin requirements. For instance, human amylin (hIAPP) is a small hormone cosecreted by pancreatic ß-cells with insulin to which is a synergistic partner. However, the high amyloidogenicity of hIAPP precluded it as a therapeutics and led to the design of pramlintide (sIAPP), a chimeric analogue with substitutions (A25P, S28P, and S29P) inherited from the aggregation-resistant rat isoform (rIAPP). Despite sIAPP advantages, it still shares with hIAPP a poorly soluble profile at physiological pH that hampers its mixture with insulin. Recent improvements, as charge-enhanced mutants, have been proposed. For instance, sIAPP+ was screened in silico by purely microcanonical thermostatistical methods and adds to sIAPP an S20R mutation to uplift its solubility. This suggests that such physically inspired computational approach may also be auspicious on devising effective coformulations of insulin with amylin analogues. In this seminal attempt, we make comparative multicanonical simulations of regular acting human insulin coformulated with hIAPP, sIAPP, or sIAPP+. To assess the respective physicochemical stabilities against aggregation, we characterize the structural-phase transitions through the microcanonical thermodynamic formalism and evaluate their time lags using the classical nucleation theory. These results are then correlated with estimates of solvation free energies, modeled by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and structural propensities. Experimental essays are compared to our simulations and support our methodology.","Frigori, Rafael B; Rodrigues, Fabio",J Mol Model,395,16

This review synthesizes the available data and provides a framework for optimal management of stroke patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection and eligible to reperfusion treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Reorganization of health services has led to the conversion of stroke units and relocation of stroke staff to COVID units. During the pandemic surge, there has been a general decline of stroke presentations, increased time delays, and reduced activity across all areas of stroke care, specifically the delivery of acute treatment. Moreover, COVID-19 patients seem to have a worse outcome despite prompt recanalization. Periprocedural monitoring studies are needed in these patients to target a more adequate therapy. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized the ability of stroke centers to provide timely assessment and acute therapies such as reperfusive treatments. Yet, as stroke remains a medical emergency, efforts to maintain stroke teams and safe provision of highly effective stroke treatments should be prioritized despite healthcare systems reorganization. This can be accomplished through the activation of telestroke networks, protected stroke pathways, 24/7 open-access high-quality stroke centers, and stroke awareness programs.","Baracchini, Claudio; Pieroni, Alessio",Curr. opin. neurol,395,16

However, health proposal repetition and its perceived efficacy also influence the behavior intention toward the proposal, which has not yet been confirmed in the COVID-19 context. The present study examined whether the extended parallel process model (EPPM) could be generalized to a naturalistic context like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored how repetition of a health proposal is involved with the EPPM. In this study, two groups of participants were exposed to the same health proposal related to COVID-19, where one group was exposed once and another group twice. Participants then filled out a questionnaire consisting of items concerning behavior intention and adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables. Although the results showed that behavior intention is predicted by perceived efficacy, no significant influence of perceived threat was detected. Furthermore, no significant effect of repetition was found toward either response efficacy or perceived susceptibility. These findings indicate that to promote health compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more efficient to focus on health proposals' perceived efficacy rather than the disease's perceived threat. For future health communication research, the present study suggests improved analysis strategies and repeated manipulation of messages.","Yang, J.; Wu, X.; Sasaki, K.; Yamada, Y.",PeerJ,395,16

The abrupt onset of the COVID-19 pandemic left educational institutions scrambling to adapt curricula to distance modalities. With projected effects lasting through the 2020–2021 academic year, this problem will not go away soon. Analysis of the literature has elucidated the costs and benefits of, as well as obstacles to, the implementation of e-learning, with a focus on undergraduate physics education. Physics faculty report that a lack of time to learn about research-driven innovation is their primary barrier to implementing it. In response, this paper is intended to help physics lecturers and lab instructors re-think their courses now that distance learning is far more prevalent due to the pandemic. This paper serves as an all-in-one guide of recommendations for successful distanced educational practices, with an emphasis on smartphones and social media. These technologies were chosen for their utility in a virtual environment. Additionally, this paper can be used as a resource for university administrators to adapt to the changing needs associated with new teaching modalities.","O039,; Brien, Daniel J.",American Journal of Physics,395,13

Common approaches such as pooling datasets and applying standard statistical learning methods can result in poor out-of-study prediction performance when datasets are heterogeneous. Theoretical and applied work has shown $\textit{multi-study ensembling}$ to be a viable alternative that leverages the variability across datasets in a manner that promotes model generalizability. Multi-study ensembling uses a two-stage $\textit{stacking}$ strategy which fits study-specific models and estimates ensemble weights separately. This approach ignores, however, the ensemble properties at the model-fitting stage, potentially resulting in a loss of efficiency. We therefore propose $\textit{optimal ensemble construction}$, an $\textit{all-in-one}$ approach to multi-study stacking whereby we jointly estimate ensemble weights as well as parameters associated with each study-specific model. We prove that limiting cases of our approach yield existing methods such as multi-study stacking and pooling datasets before model fitting. We propose an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm to optimize the proposed loss function. We compare our approach to standard methods by applying it to a multi-country COVID-19 dataset for baseline mortality prediction. We show that when little data is available for a country before the onset of the pandemic, leveraging data from other countries can substantially improve prediction accuracy. Importantly, our approach outperforms multi-study stacking and other standard methods in this application. We further characterize the method's performance in simulations. Our method remains competitive with or outperforms multi-study stacking and other earlier methods across a range of between-study heterogeneity levels.","Loewinger, Gabriel; Nunez, Rolando Acosta; Mazumder, Rahul; Parmigiani, Giovanni",,395,21

The strategy carried out by the Malaysian government has proved the effectiveness to contain and flattened the COVID-19 curve with full tactical lockdown. Under normal circumstances the monitoring and prediction of COVID-19 curve would be very difficult, hence an indicator of success would be necessary to carry out. That contributes to the result of basic Reproduction Number (R0). R0 is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease. All these can be monitored with an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) compartmental model. The objective of SEIR model is to monitor the COVID-19 projection in order to study the effectiveness of the strategy carried out by the Malaysian government. Several parameters have to take into consideration, the R0, early detection indicator ξr, transmission rate β(t) and strength factor (k), in order to determine the effectiveness of the control strategy. The methodology strategy is to model the population of Malaysian people who were susceptible to the disease multiplying by single or more infected person, then moved them to different compartment called exposed, then the confirmed cases reported will be considered as infectious and finally removed compartment is the people who are freed from the virus (either death or alive). Earlier analysis has shown that with the rapid test strategy carried out by the Malaysian Government, R0 has significantly reduce to less the 1 by early April 2020.","Mohamed, R.; Mohdnopiah, Z.; Ali, R.

We measure the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities (RH); median estimated virus half-life is >24 hours at 10C and 40% RH, but ~1.5 hours at 27C and 65% RH. Our mechanistic model uses fundamental chemistry to explain why inactivation rate increases with increased temperature and shows a U-shaped dependence on RH. The model accurately predicts existing measurements of five different human coronaviruses, suggesting that shared mechanisms may affect stability for many viruses. The results indicate scenarios of high transmission risk, point to mitigation strategies, and advance the mechanistic study of virus transmission.","Morris, Dylan H; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Gamble, Amandine; Rossine, Fernando W; Huang, Qishen; Bushmaker, Trenton; Fischer, Robert J; Matson, M Jeremiah; Van Doremalen, Neeltje; Vikesland, Peter J; Marr, Linsey C; Munster, Vincent J; Lloyd-Smith, James O",eLife (Cambridge),395,16

In preparation for the management of health care personnel that are likely to be infected, we looked in to the data collected during the Influenza pandemic in 2009, caused by a novel strain of H1N1 influenza called swine flu. The care of healthcare personnel in our institution, who had an acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) during that period was routed through a single channel using a uniform protocol. We retrospectively analysed the available data, during the initial four months of the pandemic, to draw lessons from it. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence, clinical profile and risk factors of swine flu among health care personnel during the pandemic of 2009 in a tertiary care hospital in South India. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study enrolled all the health care personnel including students of a tertiary care institution in South India, who presented with an AFRI between June to August, the initial four months of the swine flu pandemic of 2009. The clinical profile and risk factors were extracted. The results of the RT PCR for swine flu was obtained. Prevalence in each demographic group was calculated and compared. Characteristics of those with swine flu were compared with those who turned negative for the swine flu. RESULTS: The prevalence of all AFRI and only swine flu among health care personnel during the study period was 18 per thousand and 8.7 per thousand respectively. Highest prevalence of swine flu was found among students and office staff. After adjusting for confounding factors, hyperthermia at presentation was significantly higher {OR = 1.97; 95% CI (1.01-3.76)} among those who tested positive for swine flu as compared with those with other AFRI's. Only 2.5% of the entire AFRI group required admission and there was no mortality. CONCLUSION: Health care personnel are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Our study demonstrated that students and office staff were the most susceptible. Unprotected exposure to unknown infectious patients and relatives is likely to have been an important factor. Though the mode of transmission is similar, compared to H1N1, COVID-19 is associated with different comorbidities and has significantly higher mortality.

Technological solutions are a complement that can help citizens to be informed about the risk in their environment. Although measures such as contact traceability have been successful in some countries, their use raises some societal concerns. The current challenge is how to track people infected by coronaviruses that can spread the disease. How can this be done while maintaining privacy? This paper proposes a variation of the consensus processes in networks to collaboratively build a risk map by sharing information with trusted contacts. These contacts are the people we would notify of being infected: close relatives, colleagues at work, or friends. The information spreads in an aggregate way through the network. When the process converges, each participant has the risk value calculated for the different zones. The structure of the connections among close contacts generates a network that allows the process to work correctly with barely 20% of the population involved, instead of the values estimated for the tracking apps, which need 60% participation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Rebollo, M.; Carrascosa, C.; Palomares, A.","1st International Workshop on Trustworthy AI – Integrating Learning, Optimization and Reasoning, TAILOR 2020 held as a part of European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2020",395,16

A physical examination revealed disorganized speech, distorted orientation, and agitation. All laboratory tests, including drug screening and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, were normal. After excluding all the other causes of acute psychosis, favipiravir treatment was discontinued, antipsychotic treatment was started, and the patient was admitted to the psychiatric ward. The symptoms resolved on the second day of hospitalization. Although acute viral illness does seldomly cause psychosis in patients with increased inflammatory response, in the presented case, none of the inflammatory markers were positive, and acute psychosis was attributed to the loading dose of favipiravir.

To this model we add a rate at which individuals are tested, and once an infectious individual tests positive it is isolated and each of their contacts are traced and tested independently with some fixed probability. If such a traced individual tests positive it is isolated, and the contact tracing is iterated. This model is analysed using large population approximations, both for the early stage of the epidemic when the""to-be-traced components""of the epidemic behaves like a branching process, and for the main stage of the epidemic where the process of to-be-traced components converges to a deterministic process defined by a system of differential equations. These approximations are used to quantify the effect of testing and of contact tracing on the effective reproduction numbers (for the components as well as for the individuals), the probability of a major outbreak, and the final fraction getting infected. Using numerical illustrations when rates of infection and natural recovery are fixed, it is shown that Test-and-Trace strategy is effective in reducing the reproduction number. Surprisingly, the reproduction number for the branching process of components is not monotonically decreasing in the tracing probability, but the individual reproduction number is conjectured to be monotonic as expected. Further, in the situation where individuals also self-report for testing, the tracing probability is more influential than the screening rate (measured by the fraction infected being screened).","Zhang, Dongni; Britton, Tom",,395,1

Employment status is a major factor determining the amount of physical activity performed. Our purpose was to understand how employment status affects physical activity and sitting time. METHODS: Between April 13 and May 4, 2020, 735 full-time employed individuals responded to a survey investigating daily life and overall health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported how much physical activity they had performed in the last 7 days. Multiple linear regressions were performed for physical activity and sitting time. RESULTS: Physical activity was not associated with employment status. An interaction effect between hours worked and employment status was found for sitting time. CONCLUSIONS: Employment status was not related to physical activity; however, it did affect the amount of time spent sitting, with nonessential employees sitting more and working more hours than essential employees. Because greater amounts of daily total sitting time have been associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, it is important that increased sitting time be attenuated by greater physical activity.","Lindsey, Bryndan W; Boolani, Ali; Merrigan, Justin J; Cortes, Nelson; Caswell, Shane V; Martin, Joel R",J Phys Act Health,395,1

RESEARCH QUESTION: What street reallocation interventions were implemented, and what were the socio-spatial equity patterns? METHODS: We collected data on street reallocations (interventions that expand street space for active transportation or physical distancing) from April 1 to August 15, 2020 from websites and media. For each city, we summarized length of street reallocations (km) and described implementation strategies and communications. We assessed socio-spatial patterning of interventions by comparing differences in where interventions were implemented by area-level mobility, accessibility, and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Two themes motivated street reallocations: supporting mobility, recreation, and physical distancing in populous areas, and bolstering COVID-19 recovery for businesses. The scale of responses ranged across cities, from Halifax adding an additional 20% distance to their bicycle network to Kelowna closing only one main street section. Interventions were located in downtown cores, areas with high population density, higher use of active transportation, and close proximity to essential destinations. With respect to socio-demographics, interventions tended to be implemented in areas with fewer children and areas with fewer visible minority populations. In Victoria, the interventions were in areas with lower income populations and higher proportions of Indigenous people. CONCLUSION: In this early response phase, some cities acted swiftly even in the context of massive uncertainties. As cities move toward recovery and resilience, they should leverage early learnings as they act to create more permanent solutions that support safe and equitable mobility.","Fischer, Jaimy; Winters, Meghan",Can J Public Health,395,1

This has been attributed to changes in instantaneous neuronal states determining the system's excitability. Yet the spatio-temporal organization of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we test whether variability in stimulus-evoked activity can be interpreted within the framework of criticality, which postulates dynamics of neural systems to be tuned towards the phase transition between stability and instability as is reflected in scale-free fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity. Using a novel non-invasive approach in 33 male human participants, we tracked instantaneous cortical excitability by inferring the magnitude of excitatory post-synaptic currents from the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential. Fluctuations of cortical excitability demonstrated long-range temporal dependencies decaying according to a power law across trials - a hallmark of systems at critical states. As these dynamics covaried with changes in pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), we establish a mechanistic link between ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability and argue that the co-emergence of common temporal power laws may indeed originate from neural networks poised close to a critical state. In contrast, no signatures of criticality were found in subcortical or peripheral nerve activity. Thus, criticality may represent a parsimonious organizing principle of variability in stimulus-related brain processes on a cortical level, possibly reflecting a delicate equilibrium between robustness and flexibility of neural responses to external stimuli.Significance StatementVariability of neural responses in primary sensory areas is puzzling, as it is detrimental to the exact mapping between stimulus features and neural activity. However, such variability can be beneficial for information processing in neural networks if it is of a specific nature, namely if dynamics are poised at a so-called critical state characterized by a scale-free spatio-temporal structure. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a link between signatures of criticality in ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability, which fills the long-standing gap between two major directions of research on neural variability: The impact of instantaneous brain states on stimulus processing on the one hand and the scale-free organization of spatio-temporal network dynamics of spontaneous activity on the other.","Stephani, T; Waterstraat, G; Haufe, S; Curio, G; Villringer, A; Nikulin, V V",J. neurosci,395,20

Areas addressed include a brief history of the COVID-19 viral pandemic, a description of the virus, the regulatory response to the pandemic, the screening of employees, the persistence of the virus on inanimate surfaces, cleaning and disinfection of manufacturing facilities, the use of GMP-mandated personal protective equipment to counter the spread of the disease, the role of air changes in viral clearance, and approaches to risk assessment and mitigation. Biological medicinal products have a great record of safety, yet the cell cultures used for production can be susceptible to viruses, and contamination events have occurred. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 for it ability to replicate in various mammalian cell lines used for biopharmaceutical manufacturing suggests that the virus poses a low risk and any contamination would be detected by currently used adventitious virus testing. The consequences of the potential virus exposure of manufacturing processes as well as the effectiveness of mitigation efforts are discussed. The pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, traversing many geographies and companies that range from large multinationals to mid- and small-size operations. This paper recommends practices that can be adopted by all companies, irrespective of their size, geographic location, or position in the supply chain.","Cundell, T; Guilfoyle, D; Kreil, T R; Sawant, A",PDA J Pharm Sci Technol,395,23

One population that might benefit from telehealth are individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Although FXS is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability, it is nonetheless a low incidence disorder. Individuals with FXS and their families are involved in research studies, clinical trials and receive interventions - many of which are only offered in a few locations in the United States and thus, not easily accessible to many families. The current project explored the feasibility of using telehealth procedures to collect multimodal behavioural and psychological assessment data from these families. METHODS: Participation in the current study involved online surveys, measures of physiological indices of stress, live interviews and observations of mother-child interactions conducted via distance videoconferencing using the family's own technology when possible. Across all modes of data collection, we obtained information regarding the feasibility of participating entirely via distance by documenting missing data as well as each mother's overall impression of participating via distance. RESULTS: Our telehealth procedures were successfully implemented across a wide range of technology platforms with limited difficulty, and we documented little missing data due to technology-related challenges. Perhaps most importantly, however, our sample of mothers reported high satisfaction with participating via distance. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that a wide range of services and types of assessments may be amenable to telehealth procedures. Further, the findings have immediate applications as the field shifts towards telehealth due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Bullard, Lauren; Harvey, Danielle; Abbeduto, Leonard",J Telemed Telecare,395,17

We were interested to learn how the constraints of sequential lockdowns and social distancing measures had affected inpatients in a mental health setting, many of whom were already contending with significant restrictions on their freedom.MethodWe conducted structured interviews with 24 service users across the Low Secure and Locked Rehabilitation Division at St Andrews Healthcare Northampton. We interviewed male and female inpatients with diverse diagnoses including emotionally unstable personality disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia and offending behaviours. All participants were detained under the Mental Health Act throughout the pandemic. Service users were asked the following questions:1) Mental healthParticipants reported a decline in mood.2) Changing relationshipsService users reported that relationships with loved ones in the community had suffered from lack of contact and missing significant life events, however several participants felt that their relationships with peers had strengthened.3) Delivery of careResponses were split on the increased reliance on technology to replace face-to-face interaction between patients and team members, with some respondents reporting this as 'less intimidating', while others found this ‘isolating’. Respondents reported reduced contact with MDT members and delays to recovery and step-down placements due to decreased leave.4) RoutineRespondents reported an increase in free time throughout the pandemic. Some used this to develop hobbies whereas others reported becoming ‘lazy’ and expressed disappointment with the lack of exercise provision.ConclusionThe pandemic has had significant emotional and psychological effects on society as a whole, but perhaps no group has been more affected than detained patients who have had their lives restricted to a massive degree. This group has been largely marginalised by government guidelines which often fail to consider individuals living in large group settings. By learning from the experiences of these service users we can adapt our practices to alleviate these issues in any future lockdowns and ensure our practices are the least restrictive possible.","Watson, Emily Rowles Samuel",BJPsych Open,395,6

480611,480611,480611,Resuscitation and Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Reappraisal,18.301153,12.453448,2021,"Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an established cardiac side effect of a wide range of medications and represents a significant concern for drug safety. The rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ currents, mediated by channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) and KCNQ1 + KCNE1, respectively, are two main currents responsible for ventricular repolarization. The common cause for drugs to induce LQTS is through impairing the hERG channel. For the recent emergence of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, several drugs have been investigated as potential therapies; however, there are concerns about their QT prolongation risk. Here, we studied the effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir on hERG channels. Our results showed that although chloroquine acutely blocked hERG current (IhERG), with an IC50 of 3.0 µM, hydroxychloroquine acutely blocked IhERG 8-fold less potently, with an IC50 of 23.4 µM. Azithromycin and remdesivir did not acutely affect IhERG When these drugs were added at 10 µM to the cell culture medium for 24 hours, remdesivir increased IhERG by 2-fold, which was associated with an increased mature hERG channel expression. In addition, these four drugs did not acutely or chronically affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels. Our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work demonstrates that, among off-label potential COVID-19 treatment drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, the former two drugs block hERG potassium channels, whereas the latter two drugs do not. All four drugs do not affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1. As hERG and KCNQ1 + KCNE1 are two main K+ channels responsible for ventricular repolarization, and most drugs that induce long QT syndrome (LQTS) do so by impairing hERG channels, these data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns.","Szendrey, Mark; Guo, Jun; Li, Wentao; Yang, Tonghua; Zhang, Shetuan",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,395,8

BACKGROUND: Ambiguity in ever-evolving knowledge on how to provide care during COVID-19. Remaining safe has created a sense of urgency, which has in turn created the need for organizations to quickly alter their operational plans and protocols to support measures that increase capacity and establish a culture of safe care and clear communication. However, no known study has described communication in nursing practice during COVID-19. METHODS: Utilizing qualitative descriptive methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 100 nurse participants from May to September 2020 and recorded for thematic analysis. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ), a 32-item checklist, were used to ensure detailed and comprehensive reporting of this qualitative study protocol. FINDINGS: Study participants shared descriptions of how effective communication positively impacted patient care and nursing practice experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The thematic network analyses identified the importance of effective communication across three levels: (1) organizational leadership, (2) unit leadership and (3) nurse-to-nurse communication. Within this structure, three organizing themes, essential to effective communication, were described including (a) presence, (b) education and (c) emotional support. CONCLUSION: Examining existing crisis communication policies and procedures across healthcare organizations is imperative to maintain highly relevant, innovative, and data-driven policies and strategies that are fundamental to preserving quality patient care and supporting optimal nursing practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Effective communication is critical to support nurses through extended periods of crisis. COVID-19 represents a unique contemporary challenge to the nursing workforce given the high stress and prolonged strain it has created for both human and healthcare supply resources. There is value in nurses' presence at local, unit level and organizational leadership levels to convey critical information that directly informs leadership decision-making during unprecedented emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Simonovich, Shannon D; Spurlark, Roxanne S; Badowski, Donna; Krawczyk, Susan; Soco, Cheryl; Ponder, Tiffany N; Rhyner, Debi; Waid, Rachel; Aquino, Elizabeth; Lattner, Christina; Mueller Wiesemann, Lucy; Webber-Ritchey, Kashica; Li, Suling; Tariman, Joseph D",Int. nurs. rev,395,16

However, engaging in these behaviors depends on the perception of the threat posed by the illness. Previous research shows the importance of illness perception in the case of communicable and non-communicable diseases, showing that they can change depending on the severity and risk attributed to them. Objective Compare the illness perception and the practice of preventive and exposure behavior based on the severity and the risk attributed to COVID-19 at the end of phase 1 and the beginning of phase 2 of the pandemic in Mexico. Method By means of a chain sampling, a comparative study was conducted in which an evaluation battery was disseminated through e-mail and social networks. Results It was found that evaluating COVID-19 as a serious disease and perceiving oneself as being at risk of contracting it had small and moderate effects on the perception of the consequences of the illness (r = .34; r = .26), emotional impact (r = .32; r = .25), personal control (r = .24) and engagement in preventive (r = .05), and exposure behaviors (r = .07; r = .07). Discussion and conclusion This article shows the relevance of the perceptual variables that impact concern due to the social and emotional consequences of COVID-19, as well as those that encourage preventive behaviors and the minimization of exposure behavior.","Lugo-González, Isaías Vicente; Fernández-Vega, Margarita; Reynoso-Erazo, Leonardo; Becerra-Gálvez, Ana Leticia; Pérez-Bautista, Yuma Yoaly",Salud ment,395,26

METHODS: We reviewed in vitro, animal model, and clinical studies of candidate anti-coronavirus compounds and placed extracted data in an online relational database. RESULTS: As of August 2020, the Coronavirus Antiviral Research Database (CoV-RDB; covdb.stanford.edu) contained over 2800 cell culture, entry assay, and biochemical experiments, 259 animal model studies, and 73 clinical studies from over 400 published papers. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV account for 85% of the data. Approximately 75% of experiments involved compounds with known or likely mechanisms of action, including monoclonal antibodies and receptor binding inhibitors (21%), viral protease inhibitors (17%), miscellaneous host-acting inhibitors (10%), polymerase inhibitors (9%), interferons (7%), fusion inhibitors (5%), and host protease inhibitors (5%). Of 975 compounds with known or likely mechanism, 135 (14%) are licensed in the U.S. for other indications, 197 (20%) are licensed outside the U.S. or are in human trials, and 595 (61%) are pre-clinical investigational compounds. CONCLUSION: CoV-RDB facilitates comparisons between different candidate antiviral compounds, thereby helping scientists, clinical investigators, public health officials, and funding agencies prioritize the most promising compounds and repurposed drugs for further development.","Tzou, Philip L; Tao, Kaiming; Nouhin, Janin; Rhee, Soo-Yon; Hu, Benjamin D; Pai, Shruti; Parkin, Neil; Shafer, Robert W",Viruses,395,14

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of thromboembolism in mild/moderate cases of COVID-19. All of the patients had normal coagulation tests and none had any overt thrombotic complications. Our findings indicate that it is important to screen the thrombotic status of cases with mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Between 11 June and 8 July 2020, 23 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 pneumonia consented to having computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CPTA) and computed tomography venography (CTV) scans of the lungs and extremity veins. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was also performed in all patients for screening. The incidence, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging features, and prognosis, of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) were analyzed and compared with those of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia without VTE. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (82.6%) had VTE, mainly distal limb thrombosis. Only one of the VTE patients was positive when screened by DUS; the other VTE patients were negative by DUS. All of the mild/moderate patients with VTE were screened by CTPA + CTV. Blood tests for inflammatory, coagulation, and biochemical, parameters were all within the normal range, except for WBC and LDH. CONCLUSIONS: When using CTV screening for DVT, we found that the incidence of thrombosis in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 markedly increased to 82.6% (19/23). Screening for thrombosis is therefore important in patients with COVID-19. CTV is more sensitive than DUS for the detection of thrombosis.

Our algorithms guarantee that they provide a complete and exact result for every individual, without exceeding $1/0.99$ times the number of tests the optimal strategy would require. This threshold is arbitrary: algorithms closer to the optimal bound can be described, however their complexity increases, making them less practical. Moreover, the way the algorithms process input samples leads to some individuals' status to be known sooner, thus allowing to take urgency into account when assigning individuals to tests.","Brier, 'Eric; Dervishi, Megi; G'eraud-Stewart, R'emi; Naccache, David; Yifrach-Stav, Ofer",,395,2

BACKGROUND: Work Engagement and Sense of Coherence can help professionals to cope with work-related psychological distress due to the harsh conditions of the COVID-19 working environment. METHODS: cross-sectional observational study of 1459 healthcare professionals. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analyzed with descriptive and multiple linear regression methods. RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p<0.001) were identified between all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with each other, and both negatively with psychological distress. So, healthcare professionals, despite presenting psychological distress, perceive their work satisfactorily and positively despite the severity of the situation and the harsh conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Sense of coherence and work engagement are protective factors against psychological distress. Preventive measures for professionals should go through the dimensionalization of the problem and the adaptation of practical measures for daily management.","Domínguez-Salas, Sara; Gómez-Salgado, Juan; Guillén-Gestoso, Carlos; Romero-Martín, Macarena; Ortega-Moreno, Mónica; Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos",J. nurs. manag,395,21

One of the major consequences has been the development of proximity tourism in outdoor spaces less conducive to the spread of the virus. From a study preceding this pandemic, this article seeks to better understand the experiences lived by domestic tourists when they visited protected natural parks in their country. Beyond the health risks, it analyses the dimensions and the influences of experiences lived in these parks by French domestic tourists (n = 500) using Pine and Gilmore's 4Es model (1999). From a literature on the tourism experiences for domestic tourists adapted to natural parks and a critical review on the use and validation of Oh et al.'s scale (2007) in tourism, a structural equation model and a nested SEM show the positive relationship between three dimensions of the 4Es on the arousal and memory outcomes. Theoretically and methodologically speaking, this study extends the 4Es model in the direction of low arousal and mundane experiences for domestic tourists in protected natural parks, and questions Oh, Fiore, and Jeoung (2007) scale through the number of items, the use of EFA and the removal of the aesthetics dimension. This research can help managers of protected natural parks adapt their domestic tourists' experience offer during health crisis by implementing specific marketing strategies for low arousal and mundane experiences with more outdoor activities and digital services.","Lebrun, Anne-Marie Su Che-Jen Bouchet Patrick",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,395,16

To reduce their facial pressure ulcer risk, prophylactic dressings can be used; however, the biomechanical efficacy of this intervention has not been studied yet. We, therefore, evaluated facial soft tissue exposures to sustained mechanical loads in a prone position, with versus without multi-layered silicone foam dressings applied as tissue protectors at the forehead and chin. We used an anatomically realistic validated finite element model of an adult male head to determine the contribution of the dressings to the alleviation of the sustained tissue loads. The application of the dressings considerably relieved the tissue exposures to loading. Specifically, with respect to the forehead, the application of a dressing resulted in 52% and 71% reductions in soft tissue exposures to effective stresses and strain energy densities, respectively. Likewise, a chin dressing lowered the soft tissue exposures to stresses and strain energy densities by 78% and 92%, respectively.

Treatment recommendations must consider this risk for elderly and vulnerable cancer patients. We re-analyzed trials in elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients, incorporating COVID-19 risk, in order to provide a quantitative framework for comparing different radiation (RT) fractionation schedules on patient outcomes. METHODS: We extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) for 1,321 patients from Kaplan-Meier curves from five randomized trials on treatment of elderly GBM patients including available subanalyses based on MGMT methylation status. We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks). Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate. RESULTS: Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens. Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios. In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable. In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic. In elderly GBM patients, our results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT and highlight the utility of MGMT methylation status in decision-making in pandemic scenarios. Our quantitative framework can serve as a model for assessing COVID-19 risk associated with treatment across neuro-oncology.","Tabrizi, Shervin; Trippa, Lorenzo; Cagney, Daniel; Tanguturi, Shyam; Ventz, Steffen; Fell, Geoffrey; Wen, Patrick Y; Alexander, Brian M; Rahman, Rifaquat",Neuro oncol,395,24

METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we enrolled people with confirmed COVID-19 from 44 hospitals in Wuhan and Sichuan, China, between 18 January and 30 March 2020. We extracted demographics, clinical, laboratory data and consciousness level (as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score) from medical records. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, structural equation modelling and survival time analysis to compare people with different progressions of impaired consciousness. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,143 people (average age 51.3 ± standard deviation 17.1-year-old; 50.3% males), of whom 76 died. Increased mortality risk was identified in people with GCS score between 9 and 14 (hazard ratio (HR) 46.76, p < .001) and below 9 (HR 65.86, p < .001). Pathway analysis suggested a significant direct association between consciousness level and death.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical activity levels of individuals and assess the effects of physical activity on quality of life, depression and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This cross-sectional study were included 2301 participants aged 20-75 years. The data were collected through the Google Forms web survey platform by the virtual snowball sampling method. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors were analyzed using possible factors identified in previous analyses by multinomial logistic regression analysis. Hosmer-Lemeshow and Omnibus tests were used to evaluate the logistic regression model and coefficients. Results: The mean weekly energy consumption of the participants was 875±1588 MET-min, and only 6.9% were physically active enough to maintain their health. There was a weak positive relationship between physical activity levels and quality of life, while there was a weak negative relationship between physical activity levels, depression and anxiety (p<0.05). In the multinomial logistic regression model established for comparison of physically active and inactive participants, general health status and physical health status variables were statistically significant (p<0.05). However, relationships between psychological status, social relationships and environment scores, Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusions: Results showed that physical activity programs should be included in guidelines as an integrative approach to pandemic management.

Among the aerosol generating procedures, bronchoscopy in particular is an indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic tool that comes with a high risk of infection. Therefore, national societies have issued guidance statements. However, the individual ability of bronchoscopy units to follow these recommendations is largely unknown. Methods: We conducted a nationwide survey from 1 April 2020 to 7 April 2020 to which 218 German endoscopy units, 105 solely bronchoscopy and 113 interdisciplinary, responded. The survey was distributed electronically via the German Respiratory Society. Results: While 17% of units did not cancel any interventions, 16% cancelled &gt;80% of their interventions. 73% were unable to completely separate high-risk patients. Most procedural measures, such as risk stratification in patients (95%), training to handle COVID-19 patients and personal protective equipment (PPE) (91%), risk adapted use of PPE (85%) and self-monitoring for staff (84%) were adopted well. Unit managers expected shortages in PPE (74%), staff shortages (68%) and severe financial losses (63%). Conclusion: In the short-term, PPE shortages are perceived to be the most imminent threat to bronchoscopic activity as a whole. In this era of uncertainty, sound evidence to guide bronchoscopy units and an international concerted effort are urgently needed to formulate recommendations on facts and adapted to local conditions as described in this study.","Heidemann, Clara S.; Garbe, Jakob; Damm, Marko; Walter, Steffen; Michl, Patrick; Rosendahl, Jonas; Darwiche, Kaid; Eisenmann, Stephan",ERJ Open Res.,395,26

In this analogy, the three different populations of infection models correspond to three chemical species. Areal densities emerge as the key variables, thus capturing the effect of spatial density. We derive expressions for the kinetics of the infection rates and for the important parameter R0, that include areal density and its spatial distribution. Coupled with mobility the model allows the study of various effects. We first present results for a batch reactor, the chemical process equivalent of the SIR model. Because density makes R0 a decreasing function of the process extent, the infection curves are different and smaller than for the standard SIR model. We show that the effect of the initial conditions is limited to the onset of the epidemic. We derive effective infection curves for a number of cases, including a back-and-forth commute between regions of low and high R0 environments. We then consider spatially distributed systems. We show that diffusion leads to traveling waves, which in 1-D geometries propagate at a constant speed and with a constant shape, both of which are sole functions of R0. The infection curves are slightly different than for the batch problem, as diffusion mitigates the infection intensity, thus leading to an effective lower R0. The dimensional wave speed is found to be proportional to the product of the square root of the diffusivity and of an increasing function of R0, confirming the importance of restricting mobility in arresting the propagation of infection. We examine the interaction of infection waves under various conditions and scenarios, and extend the wave propagation analysis to 2-D heterogeneous systems.","Ramaswamy, Harisankar; Oberai, Assad A; Yortsos, Yannis C",,395,7

OBJECTIVE: To study the seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Jordan, at various points of time and as the pandemic evolves in the community. METHODS: In total, 1374 blood donor samples, from three groups, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin antibodies. In the first group, samples from 734 individuals (from donations made between January and June 2020) were tested in June. In the second group, 348 individuals were tested in September 2020. The third group of 292 individuals was tested in February 2021. A qualitative assay was used for testing (specificity 99.8%, sensitivity 100%). RESULTS: The first two groups, from January-June and September 2020, when confirmed Covid-19 cases numbered between several hundred and 3000, showed a seroprevalence rate of 0% (95% CI 0.00-0.51%). The third group (early February 2021), when the number of confirmed cases had reached 100 times that of September 2020, revealed a seroprevalence of 27.4% (95% CI 22.5-32.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A dramatic rise in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was seen among healthy blood donors in Jordan, in parallel with widespread intracommunity transmission of the disease. This information is useful for assessing the degree of herd immunity, and provides for better understanding of the pandemic.","Sughayer, Maher A; Mansour, Asem; Al Nuirat, Abeer; Souan, Lina; Ghanem, Mohammad; Siag, Mahmoud",Int J Infect Dis,395,20

In clinical studies of TSPO, the ligand total distribution volume, VT, is frequently the reported outcome measure. Since VT is the sum of the ligand specific (VS) and non-displaceable binding (VND), differences in VND across subjects and groups will have an impact on VT. Methods: Here, we used a recently developed method for simultaneous estimation of VND (SIME) to disentangle contributions from VND and VS. Data from four previously published 11C-PBR28 PET studies were included: (i) before and after a lipopolysaccharide challenge (8 subjects), (ii) in alcohol use disorder (14 patients, 15 controls), (iii) in first-episode psychosis (16 patients, 16 controls), and (iv) in Parkinson's disease (16 patients, 16 controls). In each dataset, regional VT estimates were obtained with a standard two-tissue compartment model, and brain-wide VND was estimated with SIME. VS was then calculated as VT-VND. VND and VS were then compared across groups, within each dataset. Results: A lower VND was found for individuals with alcohol use disorder (34%, P = 0.00084) and Parkinson's disease (34%, P = 0.0032), when compared to their corresponding controls. We found no difference in VND between first-episode psychosis patients and their controls, and the administration of lipopolysaccharide did not change VND. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that in TSPO PET studies, non-displaceable binding can differ between patient groups and conditions and should therefore be taken into account.","Laurell, Gjertrud Louise; Plavén-Sigray, Pontus; Jucaite, Aurelija; Varrone, Andrea; Cosgrove, Kelly P; Svarer, Claus; Knudsen, Gitte Moos; Ogden, R Todd; Zanderigo, Francesca; Cervenka, Simon; Hillmer, Ansel T; Schain, Martin",J. nucl. med,395,1

We aim to identify risk factors specific to each state of COVID-19 progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection through death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 648,202 participants from the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-). We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (&#8804;0.1). As of August 10, 2020, 5,929 individuals were SARS-CoV-2 positive and among those, 1,463 (25%) were hospitalized, 579 (10%) were in ICU, and 398 (7%) died. We observed a lower risk in women vs. men for ICU and mortality (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.48 (0.30-0.76) and 0.59 (0.31-1.15), respectively) and a higher risk in Black vs. Other race patients for hospitalization and ICU (OR (95%CI): 1.53 (1.32-1.77) and 1.63 (1.32-2.02), respectively). We observed an increased risk of all COVID-19 disease states with older age and BMI &#8805;35 vs. 20-24 kg/m2. Renal failure, respiratory failure, morbid obesity, acid-base balance disorder, white blood cell diseases, hydronephrosis and bacterial infections were associated with an increased risk of ICU admissions; sepsis, chronic skin ulcers, acid-base balance disorder and acidosis were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, higher BMI, males and patients with a history of respiratory, kidney, bacterial or metabolic comorbidities experienced greater COVID-19 severity. Future studies to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with these phenotype clusters and COVID-19 are warranted.","Song, Rebecca J; Ho, Yuk-Lam; Schubert, Petra; Park, Yojin; Posner, Daniel; Lord, Emily M; Costa, Lauren; Gerlovin, Hanna; Kurgansky, Katherine E; Anglin-Foote, Tori; DuVall, Scott; Huffman, Jennifer E; Pyarajan, Saiju; Beckham, Jean C; Chang, Kyong-Mi; Liao, Katherine P; Djousse, Luc; Gagnon, David R; Whitbourne, Stacey B; Ramoni, Rachel; Muralidhar, Sumitra; Tsao, Philip S; O039,; Donnell, Christopher J; Gaziano, John Michael; Casas, Juan P; Cho, Kelly",PLoS One,395,22

However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Here, we report a panel of cross-reactive antibodies against MHC-II, NK1.1, CD3, CD21, CD27, and immunoglobulin (Ig), that allows flow cytometry analysis of B, T and NK cell populations in two different fruit-eating bat species namely, Pteropus alecto and E. spelaea. Results confirmed predominance of T cells in the spleen and blood of bats, as previously reported by us. However, the percentages of B cells in bone marrow and NK cells in spleen varied greatly between wild caught P. alecto bats and E. spelaea colony bats, which may reflect inherent differences of their immune system or different immune status. Other features of bat B cells were investigated. A significant increase in sIg(+) B cell population was observed in the spleen and blood from LPS-injected bats but not from poly I:C-injected bats, supporting T-independent polyclonal B cell activation by LPS. Furthermore, using an in vitro calcium release assay, P. alecto B cells exhibited significant calcium release upon cross-linking of their B cell receptor.

The effects of filter microstructures and ambient air flows on droplet dispersion by sneezing are investigated by a fully coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian computational modeling with a micro-to-macroscale bridging approach. Materials that are commonly applied to face masks are modeled to generate two different virtual masks with various levels of filtration efficiency, and the leakage percentages through the unsealed nose and cheek areas were set to 11% and 25%, respectively. The droplet propagation distance was simulated with and without mask wearing in still and windy conditions involving head wind, tail wind, and side wind. The results demonstrate that wearing a face mask reduces the transmittance distance of droplets by about 90%–95% depending on the mask type; nonetheless, the droplets can be transmitted to distances of 20–25 cm in the forward direction even with mask-wearing. Thus, a social distance of at least 20 cm between people would help to prevent them from becoming exposed to ejected droplets. This study is significant in that important aspects of mask materials, in this case the porous microstructure-dependent filtration efficiency and permeability under varied ambient flow conditions, were considered for the first time in an evaluation of the barrier performance against droplet transmittance through a multiphase computational fluid dynamics simulation of air-droplet interaction and turbulence flow dynamics.","Lee, Kyeongeun; Oh, Jungtaek; Kim, Dongwhan; Yoo, Jinbok; Yun, Gun Jin; Kim, Jooyoun",Phys Fluids (1994),395,1

However, classifying, enumerating, and planning the PHW is challenging. Existing PHW taxonomies and enumerations focus on the existing workforce, and largely ignore workforce competition for public health graduates (PHGs). Such efforts also do not utilize real time data to assess rapid changes to the employment landscape, like those caused by COVID‐19. A job postings analysis can inform workforce planning and educational program design alike. To identify occupations and industries currently seeking PHGs and contrast them with existing taxonomies, authors matched existing PHW taxonomies to standardized occupational classification codes, then compared this with 38,533 coded, US job postings from employers seeking Master's level PHGs from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020. Authors also analysed 24,516 postings from March 2019 to October 2019 and compared them with 24,845 postings from March 2020 to October 2020 to assess changing employer demands associated with COVID‐19. We also performed schema matching to align various occupational classification systems. Job postings pre‐COVID and during COVID show considerable but changing demand for PHGs in the US, with 16%–28% of postings outside existing PHW taxonomies, suggesting labour market competition which may compound PHW recruitment and retention challenges.","Krasna, Heather; Czabanowska, Katarzyna; Beck, Angela; Cushman, Linda F.; Leider, Jonathon P.",Int J Health Plann Manage,395,20

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed using convenience sampling to obtain a sample of healthcare workers. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect the information of the basic characteristics, workload, and the health condition. Burnout, coping style, anxiety, and depression were measured by specific scales. Multiple logistic regression model was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety or depression. RESULTS: There were 902 questionnaires received between February 9, 2020 and February 11, 2020. The proportion of healthcare workers with symptoms of moderate/severe anxiety and moderate/severe depression were 16.63% and 18.29%, respectively. There were 24.50% healthcare workers experiencing moderate/severe anxiety and depression at the same time. The increased workload, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, having done specific test(s) related to COVID-19, having family member needs to be taken care of, negative coping style, and job burnout were the independent risk factors of anxiety. Furthermore, the increased workload, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, having done specific test(s) related to COVID-19, negative coping style, and job burnout were the independent risk factors of depression. CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the mental health of frontline healthcare workers at the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Taking steps to reduce the intensity of the work and burnout will be effective to stabilize the mental state of them.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between immune-inflammatory index and mortality in PSI IV-V patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of COVID-19 patients from Feb. to Apr. 2020 in the Zhongfa Xincheng Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Patients who presented high severity of COVID-19-related pneumonia were enrolled for further analysis according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) tool. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified at initial research. The survival analysis revealed that mortality of the PSI IV-V cohort was significantly higher than the PSI I-III group (p = 0.0003). The overall mortality in PSI IV-V patients was 32.1% (9/28). The fatal cases of the PSI IV-V group had a higher level of procalcitonin (p = 0.022) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.033) compared with the survivors. Procalcitonin was the most sensitive predictor of mortality for the severe COVID-19 population with area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78, higher than the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (0.75) and total lymphocyte (0.68) and neutrophil (0.67) counts. CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may potentially be effective predictors for mortality in PSI IV-V patients with COVID-19.

On 14 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Spain in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection.

In March 2020, the Australian Government introduced telehealth services to ensure that people more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not delay routine care from their general practitioners. Evidence about patients’ experience of telehealth and its impact on patient care is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the experience with telehealth by Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients from nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide (May–June 2020). Participants were identified by their regular doctor as being at high risk of poor health outcomes. Interviews sought participants’ perspectives and experiences about telehealth services in the general practice setting during COVID-19, and the value of offering continued telehealth services post pandemic. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a coding structure developed based on deductive codes derived from the research questions and any additional concepts that emerged inductively from interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed satisfaction with telehealth including convenient and timely access to general practice services. Yet, participants identified challenges including difficulties in expressing themselves and accessing physical exams. Prescription renewal, discussing test results and simple follow-ups were the most common reasons that telehealth was used. Telehealth was mainly via phone that better suited those with low digital literacy. Participants indicated that an existing doctor-patient relationship was important for telehealth services to be effective. Subjects believed that telehealth services should be continued but needed to be combined with opportunities for face-to-face consultations after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of telehealth supported access to general practice including chronic disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, telehealth in Australia is likely to have a stronger place in primary healthcare policy and practice and an increased acceptance amongst patients.

The aim of this paper is to examine the variation in consumption patterns and in nutrient composition of aquatic foods in the Pacific, to help improve understanding of their contribution to food and nutrition security. For this examination we analysed nutrient composition data and trade data from two novel region-specific databases, as well as consumption data from national and village level surveys for two Melanesian case studies, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands. Results demonstrated that consumption depends on availability and the amount and type of aquatic food consumed, and its contribution to nutrition security varies within different geographic and socio-demographic contexts. More data is needed on locally relevant species and consumption patterns, to better inform dietary guidelines and improve public health both now and into the future.

Although antibodies remain the only natural host-derived defense mechanism capable of completely preventing infection, as products, they compete against inexpensive therapeutics such as antibiotics, small molecule inhibitors and active vaccines. The continued discovery in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) field of leads with broadened cross neutralization of viruses and demonstrable synergy of antibody with antibiotics for bacterial diseases, clearly show that innovation remains. The commercial success of mAbs in chronic disease has not been paralleled in infectious diseases for several reasons. Infectious disease immunotherapeutics are limited in scope as endemic diseases necessitate active vaccine development. Also, the complexity of these small markets draws the interest of niche companies rather than big pharmaceutical corporations. Lastly, the cost of goods for mAb therapeutics is inherently high for infectious agents due to the need for antibody cocktails, which better mimic polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and prevent antigenic escape. In cases where vaccine or convalescent populations are available, current polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations (pIgG), with modern and highly efficient purification technology and standardized assays for potency, can make economic sense. Recent innovations to broaden the potency of mAb therapies, while reducing cost of production, are discussed herein. On the basis of centuries of effective use of Ab treatments, and with growing immunocompromised populations, the question is not whether antibodies have a bright future for infectious agents, but rather what formats are cost effective and generate safe and efficacious treatments to satisfy regulatory approval.","Berry, Jody D.; Gaudet, Ryan G.",N Biotechnol,395,31

As decision makers are considering the recommendations they should evaluate how to provide the most efficient protection strategies with minimum costs. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. METHODS: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. RESULTS: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.","Mukerji, Shohini; MacIntyre, C.

Evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected on particulate matter (PM), and COVID-19 cases are correlated with levels of air pollutants. However, the mechanisms of PM involvement in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. Here, we found that PM exposure increased the expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in several epithelial cells and increased the adsorption of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Instillation of PM in a hACE2 mouse model significantly increased the expression of ACE2 and Tmprss2 and viral replication in the lungs. Furthermore, PM exacerbated the pulmonary lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hACE2 mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PM is an epidemiological factor of COVID-19, emphasizing the necessity of wearing anti-PM masks to cope with this global pandemic.","Zhu, Teng-Yu; Qiu, Huan; Cao, Qi-Qi; Duan, Zi-Lei; Liu, Feng-Liang; Song, Tian-Zhang; Liu, Yang; Fang, Ya-Qun; Wu, Guang-Ming; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Ding, Wen-Jun; Lai, Ren; Jin, Lin",Zool Res,395,1

We collected students’ work assignments and products from 2016 to 2020 and reviewed them to identify distinctive trends common to all years. We found that there was a curse of knowledge (ie, difficulties to imagine the state of mind of not knowing when knowing something) among students. Students strongly embraced the adage “knowledge is power” and underestimated the difficulties lay audiences face. Their writing was somewhat dogmatic, whereby experts imparted privileged knowledge to ignorant non-experts. However, it is well known that merely imparting knowledge often does not work to educate lay audiences about making better decisions.

The occurrence of trans-placental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression placentas from 101 women who delivered between February 7 and May 15, 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19 positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence. INTERPRETATION: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbaeur cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.","Facchetti, Fabio; Bugatti, Mattia; Drera, Emma; Tripodo, Claudio; Sartori, Enrico; Cancila, Valeria; Papaccio, Marta; Castellani, Roberta; Casola, Stefano; Boniotti, Maria Beatrice; Cavadini, Patrizia; Lavazza, Antonio",EBioMedicine,395,2

A total of 46 participants joined the course, and 22 participants, on average, attended each session. Radiation oncologists and medical physicists from 11 US and international institutions prepared and provided lectures for each topic covered in the course. Confidence surveys of 15 practical competencies were administered to participants before and after the course. Competencies focused on HDR commissioning, shielding, treatment planning, radiobiology, and applicators. Pre- and post-program surveys of provider confidence, measured by 5-point Likert scale, were administered and compared. RESULTS: Forty-six participants, including seven chief medical physicists, 16 senior medical physicists, five radiation oncologists, and three dosimetrists, representing nine countries attended education sessions. Reported confidence scores, both aggregate and paired, demonstrated increases in confidence in all 15 competencies. Post-curriculum score improvement was statistically significant (P < .05) for paired respondents in 11 of 15 domains. Absolute improvements were largest for confidence in applicator commissioning (2.3 to 3.8, P = .009), treatment planning system commissioning (2.2 to 3.9, P = .0055), and commissioning an HDR machine (2.2 to 4.0, P = .0031).

METHODS: Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3–89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1–71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2–52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3–27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1–9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6–18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1–6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5–1.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6–13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7–10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6–3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9–8.6 %).

In the absence of a safe and effective cure or vaccine during the first ten months of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world implemented these social-isolation strategies and other NPIs to reduce COVID-19 transmission. But, individuals and public perceptions play a crucial role in the success of any social-isolation measure. Thus, in spite of governments’ initiative to use NPIs to combat COVID-19 in many countries, individual choices rendered social-isolation unsuccessful in some of these countries. This resulted in huge outbreaks that imposed a substantial (morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, economic, etc.) toll on human lives. In particular, human choices pose serious challenges to public health strategic decision-making in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. To unravel the impact of this behavioral response to social-isolation on the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a model framework that integrates COVID-19 transmission dynamics with a multi-strategy evolutionary game approach of individual decision-making. We use this integrated framework to characterize the evolution of human choices in social-isolation as the disease progresses and public health control measures such as mandatory lockdowns are implemented. Analysis of the model illustrates that SD plays a major role in reducing the burden of the disease compared to SQ. Parameter estimation using COVID-19 incidence data, as well as different lockdown data sets from India, and scenario analysis involving a combination of Voluntary-Mandatory implementation of SQ and SD shows that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the type of isolation, and the time and period of implementation of the selected isolation measure during the outbreak.","Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Goel, Palak; Kutor, Daniel; Bhattacharyya, Samit",J Theor Biol,395,21

The study includes over 17,000 participants from six healthcare systems in North Carolina who submitted over 49,000 serology results. The purpose of this study is to use these serology data to estimate the cumulative proportion of the North Carolina population that has either been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developed a measurable humoral response to vaccination. Methods Adult community residents were invited to participate in the study between April 2020 and February 2021. Demographic information was collected and daily symptom screen was completed using a secure, HIPPA-compliant, online portal. A portion of participants were mailed kits containing a lateral flow assay to be used in-home to test for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. The cumulative proportion of participants who tested positive at least once during the study was calculated. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to illustrate the probability of seroconversion over time up to December 20, 2020 (before vaccines available). A separate analysis was performed to describe the influence of vaccines during an extended period through February 15, 2021. Results 17,688 participants contributed at least one serology result. Approximately two-thirds of the population were female and almost three-quarters were between 30 and 64 years of age. The average number of serology test results submitted per participant was 3.0 ({+/-}1.9). At December 20, 2020, the overall probability of seropositivity in the CCRP population was 32.6%. At February 15, 2021 the probability among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers was 49% and 83%, respectively. An inflection upward in the probability of seropositivity was demonstrated around the end of December, suggesting an influence of vaccinations, especially for healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers, those in the oldest age category (60+ years) were 38% less likely to have seroconverted by February 15, 2021. Conclusions Results of this study suggest more North Carolina residents may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the number of documented cases as determined by positive RNA or antigen tests. The influence of vaccinations on seropositivity among North Carolina residents is also demonstrated. Additional research is needed to fully characterize the impact of seropositivity on immunity and the ultimate course of the pandemic.","Williamson, J. C.; Wierzba, T.

In particular, the emergence of several variants with greater infectivity and resistance to current vaccines has motivated the development of a vaccine that elicits a broadly neutralizing immune response against all variants. In this study, we used a nanoparticle‐based vaccine platform for the multivalent display of the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike (S) protein, the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Multiple copies of RBD were conjugated to the SpyCatcher‐mi3 protein nanoparticle to produce a highly immunogenic nanoparticle‐based vaccine. RBD‐SpyCatcher‐mi3 vaccines elicited broadly cross‐reactive antibodies that recognized the spike proteins of not just an early isolate of SARS‐CoV‐2, but also three SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern as well as SARS‐CoV‐1. Moreover, immunization elicited high neutralizing antibody titers against an early isolate of SARS‐CoV‐2 as well as four variants of concern, including the delta variant. These results reveal the potential of RBD‐SpyCatcher‐mi3 as a broadly protective vaccination strategy.","Halfmann, Peter J.; Castro, Ana; Loeffler, Kathryn; Frey, Steven J.; Chiba, Shiho; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Kane, Ravi S.",Bioeng Transl Med,395,1

With such urgency, researchers experience methodological challenges to maintain the rigour and transparency of their work. With this in mind, we offer reflections on our recent experience of undertaking a rapid Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis (QES). METHODS: This process paper, using a reflexive approach, describes a rapid QES prepared during, and in response to, the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: This paper reports the methodological decisions we made and the process we undertook. We place our decisions in the context of guidance offered in relation to rapid reviews and previously conducted QESs. We highlight some of the challenges we encountered in finding the balance between the time needed for thoughtfulness and comprehensiveness whilst providing a rapid response to an urgent request for evidence. CONCLUSION: The need for more guidance on rapid QES remains, but such guidance needs to be based on actual worked examples and case studies. This paper and the reflections offered may provide a useful framework for others to use and further develop.","Biesty, Linda; Meskell, Pauline; Glenton, Claire; Delaney, Hannah; Smalle, Mike; Booth, Andrew; Chan, Xin Hui S.; Devane, Declan; Houghton, Catherine",Syst Rev,395,1

The experts, economists, policymakers, and the governments expressed their pledges and determinations to adapt and mitigate climate change. Policymakers and governments have started adopting green growth and development strategies. The progress moves further to achieve green economic efficiency (GEE) to achieve economic, social, and environmental development. One of the major challenges has been promulgating and strictly implementing environmental regulations and policies vis-à-vis green growth and development. China, having the second largest economy, has started its voyage to achieve GEE. However, there are multiple challenges on the way to the green economy. The objective of the present stud is to analyze environmental regulation and GEE in China using fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis. To serve this purpose, the study identifies 5 alternative strategies to achieve GEE while considering 10 criteria and 48 sub-criteria in the context of environmental regulations in China. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to rank criteria and sub-criteria to the goal. The Fuzzy VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method has been used to rank the alternative strategies of GEE. The proposed model unveiled resource efficiency and green purchasing as the best strategy to achieve GEE in the Chinese economy followed by local production. The study provides a comprehensive insight into the green development process to achieve GEE in the Chinese economy in the post-COVID-19 world.","Yao, Shuangliang",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,395,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve efficacy of screening COVID-19 infected patients using chest X-ray images with the help of a developed deep convolutional neural network model (CNN) entitled nCoV-NET. METHODS: To train and to evaluate the performance of the developed model, three datasets were collected from resources of “ChestX-ray14”, “COVID-19 image data collection”, and “Chest X-ray collection from Indiana University,” respectively. Overall, 299 COVID-19 pneumonia cases and 1,522 non-COVID 19 cases are involved in this study. To overcome the probable bias due to the unbalanced cases in two classes of the datasets, ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG architectures were re-trained in the fine-tuning stage of the process to distinguish COVID-19 classes using a transfer learning method. Lastly, the optimized final nCoV-NET model was applied to the testing dataset to verify the performance of the proposed model. RESULTS: Although the performance parameters of all re-trained architectures were determined close to each other, the final nCOV-NET model optimized by using DenseNet-161 architecture in the transfer learning stage exhibits the highest performance for classification of COVID-19 cases with the accuracy of 97.1 %. The Activation Mapping method was used to create activation maps that highlights the crucial areas of the radiograph to improve causality and intelligibility. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the proposed CNN model called nCoV-NET can be utilized for reliably detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images to accelerate the triaging and save critical time for disease control as well as assisting the radiologist to validate their initial diagnosis.","Polat, Çağín; Karaman, Onur; Karaman, Ceren; Korkmaz, Güney; Balcı, Mehmet Can; Kelek, Sevim Ercan",Journal of X-ray science and technology,395,24

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we studied patients with COVID-19 referred to Sina Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from February 20 to May 14, 2020. Patients with either a positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction test of swab specimens or high clinical suspicion according to the World Health Organization interim guidance were included. We accurately divided all patients into two groups based on diabetes affection and followed-up patients with DM based on incurring death, severe COVID-19, and in-hospital complications. RESULTS: We enrolled 574 patients with COVID-19 in the final analysis, of whom 176 (30.7%) patients had DM. In this study, 104 (18.1%) patients deceased, and 380 (66.2%) patients incurred severe COVID-19. We found that COVID-19 patients with DM had a significantly higher mortality rate (P value<0.001), severe disease (P value<0.001), and in-hospital complications (all P values<0.05). Besides that, in patients with DM, admission temperature (odds ratio (OR): 1.69, P value: 0.024), oxygen saturation (OR: 0.92, P value: 0.004), and urea (OR: 1.01, P value: 0.048) were independent risk indicators of in-hospital mortality. In addition, subgroup analysis of diabetic patients based on admission glucose level showed significant differences between these groups regarding acute cardiac injury (P value: 0.044) and acute liver injury (P value: 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DM admitted with lower oxygen saturation, elevated temperature, and higher urea are more susceptible to progress to more severe COVID-19 and poor prognosis. This indicates a necessity for more precise care during hospitalization for these patients.

Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25–44, 45–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205 639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21 447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1·39% (95% credible interval 1·04–1·77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65–74 and ≥75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0·116% (0·0729–0·148) for those aged 25–44 years and 0·939% (0·729–1·19) for those aged 45–64 years versus 4·87% (3·37–6·89) for those aged 65–74 years and 14·2% (10·2–18·1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6·72% (5·52–8·01) for those aged 65–74 years and 19·1% (14·7–21·9) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

A limited number of human H5N1 infections have been reported from Vietnam and Thailand, with a mortality rate approaching 70%. Deaths have occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The main presenting features were fever, pneumonitis, lymphopenia, and diarrhea. Notably, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and coryza were absent. The H5N1 strains are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, which can be used for treatment and prophylaxis. The widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. The threat of a future pandemic from avian influenza is real. Adequate surveillance, development of vaccines, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic influenza planning are important.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA has been detected in stool samples of approximately 50% of COVID-19 individuals. Fecal calprotectin is a marker of gastrointestinal inflammation in the general population. AIM: To investigate if fecal calprotectin correlates with SARS-CoV-2 intestinal shedding in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Disease Unit (University Hospital of Trieste, Italy) from September to November 2020 were consecutively enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for quantification of fecal calprotectin (normal value < 50 mg/kg) and SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inter-group differences were determined between patients with and without diarrhea and patients with and without detection of fecal SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We enrolled 51 adults (40 males) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Ten patients (20%) presented with diarrhea. Real-time-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in stools was positive in 39 patients (76%), in all patients with diarrhea (100%) and in more than two thirds (29/41, 71%) of patients without diarrhea. Obesity was one of the most common comorbidities (13 patients, 25%); all obese patients (100%) (P = 0.021) tested positive for fecal SARS-CoV-2. Median fecal calprotectin levels were 60 mg/kg [interquartile range (IQR) 21; 108]; higher fecal calprotectin levels were found in the group with SARS-CoV-2 in stools (74 mg/kg, IQR 29; 132.5) compared to the group without SARS-CoV-2 (39 mg/kg, IQR 14; 71) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: High fecal calprotectin levels among COVID-19 patients correlate with SARS-CoV-2 detection in stools supporting the hypothesis that this virus can lead to bowel inflammation and potentially to the ‘leaky gut’ syndrome.","Zerbato, Verena; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Jaracz, Anna Wladyslawa; Gobbo, Ylenia; Luppino, Diego; Macor, Paolo; Segat, Ludovica; Koncan, Raffaella; D'Agaro, Pierlanfranco; Valentini, Michael; Crocé, Lory Saveria; Ruscio, Maurizio; Luzzati, Roberto",World J Gastroenterol,395,21

The present study aims to describe the prevalence of food insecurity among adults and households with children living in the United States during the pandemic. METHODS: This study utilized social media as a recruitment platform to administer an original online survey on demographics and COVID-related food insecurity. The survey was disseminated through an advertisement campaign on Facebook and affiliated platforms. Food insecurity was assessed with a validated six-item United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module, which was used to create a six-point numerical food security score, where a higher score indicates lower food security. Individual-level participant demographic information was also collected. Logistic regressions (low/very-low compared with high/marginal food security) were performed to generate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95%CIs for food insecurity and select demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Advertisements reached 250,701 individuals and resulted in 5,606 complete surveys. Overall, 14.7% of participants self-identified as having low or very low food security in their households, with higher prevalence (17.5%) among households with children. Unemployment (AOR:1.76, 95%CI:1.09–2.80), high school or lower education (AOR:2.25, 95%CI:1.29–3.90), and low income (AOR[$30,000-$50,000]:5.87, 95%CI:3.35–10.37; AOR[< $30,000]:10.61, 95%CI:5.50–20.80) were associated with higher odds of food insecurity in multivariable models among households with children (and the whole sample). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate exacerbation of food insecurity during the pandemic. The study will be instrumental in guiding additional research and time-sensitive interventions targeted towards vulnerable food insecure subgroups.","Parekh, Niyati; Ali, Shahmir H.; O’Connor, Joyce; Tozan, Yesim; Jones, Abbey M.; Capasso, Ariadna; Foreman, Joshua; DiClemente, Ralph J.",Nutr J,395,1

It finds that the pandemic had an overall significant and negative impact on the stock prices of firms listed on SSE, SZSE and ChiNext. However, such impact appeared to be heterogeneous across industries, affecting listed firms in industries such as pharmaceutical and telecommunications positively, but those in services industries such as accommodation, catering, and commercial services negatively. Apparently, a crisis for some had been an opportunity for others. In addition, this paper seeks to understand the micro mechanism behind the heterogeneity of pandemic shock from the perspective of firms’ financial position. It finds that listed firms with higher debt level were hit harder, whereas those with more net cash flow had displayed higher resilience against the blow of the pandemic. However, the opposite pattern is found among those listed on ChiNext and in industries severely devastated by the pandemic. These findings have policy implications in terms of preventing systemic financial risks and facilitating recovery during pandemic-induced economic downturns.

Despite the tremendous scientific efforts, mainly focused on the development of vaccines, identification of potent and efficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics still represents an unmet need. Remdesivir, an anti-Ebola drug selected from a repurposing campaign, is the only drug approved, so far, for the treatment of the infection. Nevertheless, WHO in later 2020 has recommended against its use in COVID-19.

All the molecules were screened by an enzymatic assay on M(pro) and, then, cellular activity was evaluated using Vero cells viral infection model. The cellular screening disclosed compounds 29 and 34 as in-vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitors at non-toxic concentrations (0.32 < EC(50) < 5.98 μM). To rationalize these results, additional in-vitro assays were performed, focusing on papain like protease (PL(pro)) and spike protein (SP) as potential targets for the synthesized molecules. This pharmacological workflow allowed the identification of compound 29, as a dual acting SARS-CoV-2 proteases inhibitor featuring micromolar inhibitory potency versus M(pro) (IC(50) = 1.72 μM) and submicromolar potency versus PL(pro) (IC(50) = 0.67 μM), and of compound 34 as a selective SP inhibitor (IC(50) = 3.26 μM).","Di Sarno, Veronica; Lauro, Gianluigi; Musella, Simona; Ciaglia, Tania; Vestuto, Vincenzo; Sala, Marina; Scala, Maria Carmina; Smaldone, Gerardina; Di Matteo, Francesca; Novi, Sara; Tecce, Mario Felice; Moltedo, Ornella; Bifulco, Giuseppe; Campiglia, Pietro; Gomez-Monterrey, Isabel M.; Snoeck, Robert; Andrei, Graciela; Ostacolo, Carmine; Bertamino, Alessia",Eur J Med Chem,395,20

Using novel data we collected from 2078 Australian residents during April to July 2020, we show that experiencing a labour market shock during the pandemic is associated with a 29% lower level of perceived financial wellbeing, on average. Unconditional quantile regressions indicate that lower levels of financial wellbeing are present across the entire distribution, except at the very top. Distribution analyses indicate that the labour market shocks are also associated with higher levels of inequality in financial wellbeing.

Compounding this threat is the near certainty that novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential will emerge in years to come. Pan-coronavirus drugs – agents active against both SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses – would address both threats. A strategy to develop such broad-spectrum inhibitors is to pharmacologically target binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are highly conserved in other known coronaviruses, the assumption being that any selective pressure to keep a site conserved across past viruses will apply to future ones. Here, we systematically mapped druggable binding pockets on the experimental structure of fifteen SARS-CoV-2 proteins and analyzed their variation across twenty-seven α- and β-coronaviruses and across thousands of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients. We find that the two most conserved druggable sites are a pocket overlapping the RNA binding site of the helicase nsp13, and the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, both components of the viral replication-transcription complex. We present the data on a public web portal (https://www.thesgc.org/SARSCoV2_pocketome/) where users can interactively navigate individual protein structures and view the genetic variability of drug binding pockets in 3D.","Yazdani, Setayesh; De Maio, Nicola; Ding, Yining; Shahani, Vijay; Goldman, Nick; Schapira, Matthieu",bioRxiv,395,26

We aimed to assess the status of HTP use among pregnant women in Japan and explore the association of HTP use with HDP and LBW. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data from the Japan ‘COVID-19 and Society’ Internet Survey study, a web-based nationwide survey. PARTICIPANTS: We investigated 558 postdelivery and 365 currently pregnant women in October 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on HDP and LBW was collected from the postdelivery women’s Maternal and Child Health Handbooks (maternal and newborn records). We estimated the age-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of ever HTP smokers for HDP and LBW and compared them with those of never HTP smokers in a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of ever and current HTP use were 11.7% and 2.7% in postdelivery women and 12.6% and 1.1% in currently pregnant women, respectively. Among currently pregnant women who were former combustible cigarette smokers, 4.4% (4/91) were current HTP smokers. Among postdelivery women, ever HTP smokers had a higher HDP incidence (13.8% vs 6.5%, p=0.03; age-adjusted OR=2.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.53) and higher LBW incidence (18.5% vs 8.9%, p=0.02; age-adjusted OR=2.36, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.87). CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, the incidence of ever HTP use exceeded 10% among pregnant women, and HTP smoking may be associated with maternal and neonatal risks.","Zaitsu, Masayoshi; Hosokawa, Yoshihiko; Okawa, Sumiyo; Hori, Ai; Kobashi, Gen; Tabuchi, Takahiro",BMJ Open,395,1

Small molecule inhibitors that reverse disease severity have proven difficult to discover. One of the key approaches that has been widely applied in an effort to speed up the translation of drugs is drug repurposing. A few drugs have shown in vitro activity against Ebola virus and demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Most notably the RNA polymerase targeting remdesivir demonstrated activity in vitro and efficacy in the early stage of the disease in humans. Testing other small molecule drugs that are active against Ebola virus would seem a reasonable strategy to evaluate their potential for SARS-CoV-2. We have previously repurposed pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine (from malaria, influenza, and antiprotozoal uses, respectively) as inhibitors of Ebola and Marburg virus in vitro in HeLa cells and of mouse adapted Ebola virus in mouse in vivo. We have now tested these three drugs in various cell lines (VeroE6, Vero76, Caco-2, Calu-3, A549-ACE2, HUH-7 and monocytes) infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses (including MHV and HCoV 229E). The compilation of these results indicated considerable variability in antiviral activity observed across cell lines. We found that tilorone and pyronaridine inhibited the virus replication in A549-ACE2 cells with IC(50) values of 180 nM and IC(50) 198 nM, respectively. We have also tested them in a pseudovirus assay and used microscale thermophoresis to test the binding of these molecules to the spike protein. They bind to spike RBD protein with K(d) values of 339 nM and 647 nM, respectively. Human C(max) for pyronaridine and quinacrine is greater than the IC(50) hence justifying in vivo evaluation. We also provide novel insights into their mechanism which is likely lysosomotropic.","Puhl, Ana C.; Fritch, Ethan James; Lane, Thomas R.; Tse, Longping V.; Yount, Boyd L.; Sacramento, Carol Queiroz; Tavella, Tatyana Almeida; Costa, Fabio Trindade Maranhão; Weston, Stuart; Logue, James; Frieman, Matthew; Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Pearce, Kenneth H.; Hurst, Brett L.; Andrade, Carolina Horta; Levi, James A.; Johnson, Nicole J.; Kisthardt, Samantha C.; Scholle, Frank; Souza, Thiago Moreno L.; Moorman, Nathaniel John; Baric, Ralph S.; Madrid, Peter; Ekins, Sean",bioRxiv,395,1

Our objective was to describe characteristics of telestroke consultations among a national sample of telestroke sites on one of the most commonly used common vendor platforms, prior to the COVID-19 public health emergency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial telestroke vendor provided data on all telestroke consultations by two specialist provider groups from 2013-2019. Kendall's τ β nonparametric test was utilized to assess time trends. Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between hospital consult utilization and alteplase use adjusting for hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Among 67,736 telestroke consultations to 132 spoke sites over the study period, most occurred in the emergency department (90%) and for stroke indications (final clinical diagnoses: TIA 13%, ischemic stroke 39%, hemorrhagic stroke 2%, stroke mimics 46%). Stroke severity was low (median NIHSS 2, IQR 0–6). Alteplase was recommended for 23% of ischemic stroke patients. From 2013 to 2019, times from ED arrival to NIHSS, CT scan, imaging review, consult, and alteplase administration all decreased (p<0.05 for all), while times from consult start to alteplase recommendation and bolus increased (p<0.01 for both). Transfer was recommended for 8% of ischemic stroke patients. Number of patients treated with alteplase per hospital increased with increasing number of consults and hospital size and was also associated with US region in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Longer duration of hospital participation in the network was associated with shorter hospital median door-to-needle time for alteplase delivery (39 min shorter per year, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Among spoke sites using a commercial telestroke platform over a seven-year time horizon, times to consult start and alteplase bolus decreased over time. Similar to academic networks, duration of telestroke participation in this commercial network was associated with faster alteplase delivery, suggesting practice improves performance.","Zachrison, Kori S.; Sharma, Richa; Wang, Yulun; Mehrotra, Ateev; Schwamm, Lee H.",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,395,16

Objectives: We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, computed tomography images, and treatments of patients with COVID-19 from three different cities in China. Methods: A total of 476 patients were recruited from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020, at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Anhui. The patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) according to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China. Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of comorbidities was higher in the severe (46.3%) and critical (67.1%) groups than in the moderate group (37.8%). More patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the moderate group than in the severe and critical groups. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group than in the moderate group. More patients received antiviral agents within the first 4 days in the moderate group than in the severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids in the critical and severe groups. Patients >75 years old had a significantly lower survival rate than younger patients. Conclusions: Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of patients with severe or critical illness. There was a significant difference in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers among patients with different severities of disease. Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan. Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

Both drugs can alter cardiac electrophysiology and have been associated with drug-induced arrhythmias. Meanwhile, sympathetic activation is commonly observed during systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., in SARS-CoV-2 infection) and may influence the electrophysiological effects of CQ and AZM. Here, we investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on proarrhythmic properties of CQ and AZM using detailed in silico models of ventricular electrophysiology. Concentration-dependent alterations in ion-channel function were incorporated into the Heijman canine and O’Hara-Rudy human ventricular cardiomyocyte models. Single and combined drug effects on action-potential (AP) properties were analyzed using a population of 1,000 models accommodating inter-individual variability. Sympathetic stimulation was simulated by increasing pacing rate and experimentally validated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in ion-channel function. In the canine ventricular model at 1 Hz pacing, therapeutic doses of CQ and AZM (5 and 20 μM, respectively) individually prolonged AP duration (APD) by 33 and 13%. Their combination produced synergistic APD prolongation (+161%) with incidence of proarrhythmic early afterdepolarizations in 53.5% of models. Increasing the pacing frequency to 2 Hz shortened APD and together with 1 μM ISO counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. No afterdepolarizations occurred following increased rate and simulated application of ISO. Similarly, CQ and AZM individually prolonged APD by 43 and 29% in the human ventricular cardiomyocyte model, while their combination prolonged APD by 76% without causing early afterdepolarizations. Consistently, 1 μM ISO at 2 Hz pacing counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. Increasing the I(Ca,L) window current produced afterdepolarizations, which were exacerbated by ISO. In both models, reduced extracellular K(+) reduced the repolarization reserve and increased drug effects. In conclusion, CQ- and AZM-induced proarrhythmia is promoted by conditions with reduced repolarization reserve. Sympathetic stimulation limits drug-induced APD prolongation, suggesting the potential importance of heart rate and autonomic status monitoring in particular conditions (e.g., COVID-19).","Sutanto, Henry; Heijman, Jordi",Front Physiol,395,20

Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed. Methods: We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. Results: Combined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 g/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 g/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek.

Application of a combination of differential gene expression, weighted gene correlation network, pathway and spatial deconvolution analysis stratified the sampled regions into five distinct groups according to degree of alveolar damage, levels of cytotoxic inflammation and innate activation, epithelial reorganization, and fibrosis. Integrative network analysis of the identified groups revealed the presence of proliferating CD8 T and NK cells in severely damaged areas along with signatures of cytotoxicity, interferon signalling and high expression of immune cell chemoattractants (including CXCL9/10/11 and CCL2). Areas of milder damage were marked by innate immune signalling (including TLR response, IL-1, IL-6) together with signatures of antigen presentation, and fibrosis.

The effectiveness of applying these techniques varies widely, and pollutant removal efficiency is usually determined in controlled laboratory environments which may not be realized in practice. Some air cleaners are largely ineffective, and some produce harmful by-products. To summarize what is known regarding the effectiveness of fan-driven air cleaning technologies, a state-of-the-art review of the scientific literature was undertaken by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from Europe, North America, and Asia with expertise in air cleaning, aerosol science, medicine, chemistry and ventilation. The effects on health were not examined. Over 26,000 articles were identified in major literature databases; 400 were selected as being relevant based on their titles and abstracts by the first two authors, who further reduced the number of articles to 160 based on the full texts. These articles were reviewed by the panel using predefined inclusion criteria during their first meeting. Additions were also made by the panel. Of these, 133 articles were finally selected for detailed review. Each article was assessed independently by two members of the panel and then judged by the entire panel during a consensus meeting. During this process 59 articles were deemed conclusive and their results were used for final reporting at their second meeting. The conclusions are that: (1) None of the reviewed technologies was able to effectively remove all indoor pollutants and many were found to generate undesirable by-products during operation. (2) Particle filtration and sorption of gaseous pollutants were among the most effective air cleaning technologies, but there is insufficient information regarding long-term performance and proper maintenance. (3) The existing data make it difficult to extract information such as Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), which represents a common benchmark for comparing the performance of different air cleaning technologies. (4) To compare and select suitable indoor air cleaning devices, a labeling system accounting for characteristics such as CADR, energy consumption, volume, harmful by-products, and life span is necessary. For that purpose, a standard test room and condition should be built and studied. (5) Although there is evidence that some air cleaning technologies improve indoor air quality, further research is needed before any of them can be confidently recommended for use in indoor environments.","Zhang, Yinping; Mo, Jinhan; Li, Yuguo; Sundell, Jan; Wargocki, Pawel; Zhang, Jensen; Little, John C.; Corsi, Richard; Deng, Qihong; Leung, Michael H.K.; Fang, Lei; Chen, Wenhao; Li, Jinguang; Sun, Yuexia",Atmos Environ (1994),395,8

RESULTS: Twenty one full-term pregnant patients were reviewed (median age 29 years), and no patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and died during the treating progress. According to our review, all the cases were infected by human to human transmission, and the most common symptoms at onset of illness were cough in 17 (80.95%), fatigue in 10 (47.62%), fever in 7 (33.33%), expectoration in 1 (4.76%), and only one patient (4.76%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 10 days (interquartile range 7 –2 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 1 day (interquartile range 1–2 days). CONCLUSIONS: As of February 29, 2020, all the patients who were full-term pregnancy combined with COVID-2019 were cured and delivered successfully, and all the newborns were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there were no evidence of mother-to-child transmission.","Chen, Yanfen; Bai, Jun",Arch Gynecol Obstet,395,21

This study was designed to compare the effects of different collection methods (unstimulated or stimulated by chewing paraffin, forepart or midstream) on salivary flow rate, concentrations and secretion rates of steroids in saliva. METHODS: Whole-saliva samples were collected from 10 systemically and orally healthy participants, whose forepart and midstream segments of saliva were collected under unstimulated and stimulated conditions, with the salivary flow rate of each sample recorded. The concentrations and secretion rates of salivary steroids including testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and progesterone were measured by ELISA, with the multiple of change calculated. RESULTS: The results indicated mechanical stimulation used in collection of saliva samples could affect concentrations and secretion rates of steroids, whereas forepart and midstream segments had little differences in levels of salivary steroids, which effects could be partly influenced by individual specificity. The asynchronism in change of secretion rate of steroids with that of salivary flow rate might play an important role during this course. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we suggested to use the same collection method throughout one analytical study on salivary steroids or in longitudinal observations to ensure the comparability of the saliva samples collected.

This study focuses on the social dilemma experienced by health care professionals and ways in which an interdisciplinary approach could be developed. RESULTS: Based on Gaertner and Dovidio’s Common Ingroup Identity Model, a number of questionnaires were designed and tested; with PROGRESS, the relation between collaboration and common goal was assessed, mediated by decategorization, recategorization, mutual differentiation and knowledge sharing. This study confirms the Common Ingroup Identity Model stating that common goals stimulate collaboration. Decategorization and mutual differentiation proved to be significant in this relationship; recategorization and knowledge sharing mediate this relation. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the Common Ingroup Identity Model theory helps us to understand how health care professionals perceive the One Health initiative and how they can intervene in this process.

Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","Wang, Wen; Lin, Xian-Dan; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Holmes, Edward C.; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",bioRxiv,395,16

We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as “the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months” or “the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days”. We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications. For example, based on the model in Lombardy, Italy, achieving less than 100 deaths per day and 10000 total deaths within 100 days requires 441.7% more vaccination control effort than achieving less than 1000 deaths per day and 50000 total deaths within 100 days.","Xu, Zhe; Wu, Bo; Topcu, Ufuk",PLoS One,395,5

These genetic factors, some of which are associated with blood type, may account for variations in observed responses to COVID-19. Hence, assessments of these genetic differences and blood type could provide possible benefits in gauging patients’ risks of disease acquisition and prioritising allocation of interventions or vaccines, if supplies are limited. The media has widely reported these findings, and people online are now discussing their blood type and its possible effects on their COVID-19 risks, but several ethical concerns arise. Individuals possessing genetic variants or blood types associated with lower risk may engage in ‘risk compensation’, erroneously assuming that they can protect themselves less, and hence less frequently wearing masks or washing hands. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians, hospitals, patients, policymakers, members of the public, testing companies and others may well consider these factors in making critical prevention/treatment decisions. Researchers, providers and others should thus begin to address these concerns. Increased awareness and education aimed at providers, patients, family members, public health officials, political leaders and the public-at-large are critical. Attitudinal research is vital to examine how providers, patients and the public understand these findings. Ethical frameworks and guidelines are needed, addressing whether such genetic information should be incorporated into decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources—including hospital and ICU beds, ventilators, medications (eg, remdesivir) and vaccines—and if so, how.","Klitzman, Robert",J Med Ethics,395,20

We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice. Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge= 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death=28). All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values. The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively. As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (<500), CD3+T-cell (<200), CD4+ T-cell (<100), CD8+ T-cell (<100) and B-cell (<50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19. The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively. Conclusion We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness. The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.","XU, Bo; FAN, Cun-yu; WANG, An-lu; ZOU, Yi-long; YU, Yi-han; HE, Cong; XIA, Wen-guang; ZHANG, Ji-xian; MIAO, Qing",J Infect,395,1

Increasing mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome have severely impacted the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines to combat the virus. However, the new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their evolutionary characteristics are not fully understood. Host cellular components such as the ACE2 receptor, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), microRNAs, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), 18s rRNA, and the 7SL RNA component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) interact with various structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Several of these viral proteins are currently being examined for designing antiviral therapeutics. In this review, we discuss current advances in our understanding of various host cellular components targeted by the virus during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also summarize the mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome that directs the evolution of new viral strains. Considering coronaviruses are rapidly evolving in humans, this enables them to escape therapeutic therapies and vaccine-induced immunity. In order to understand the virus’s evolution, it is essential to study its mutational patterns and their impact on host cellular machinery.

Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-naïve CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Our method identifies proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier and passes them to a kernel-density estimator (KDE) for sampling points from the density distribution. We then compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as ‘elbows’. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-naïve CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through topological data analysis which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or in the presence of large batch effects. Author summary Identifying differences between cytometry data seen as a point cloud can be complicated by random variations in data collection and data sources. We apply persistent homology used in topological data analysis to describe the shape and structure of the data representing immune cells in healthy donors and COVID-19 patients. By looking at how the shape and structure differ between healthy donors and COVID-19 patients, we are able to definitively conclude how these groups differ despite random variations in the data. Furthermore, these results are novel in their ability to capture shape and structure of cytometry data, something not described by other analyses.","Mukherjee, Soham; Wethington, Darren; Dey, Tamal K.; Das, Jayajit",bioRxiv,395,5

There have been reports of eosinophilic infiltration of all esophageal layers in patients with achalasia. However, a routine endoscopic biopsy of the muscular layer is usually not feasible. We evaluate the safety and efficacy of muscle layer biopsy during per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) as well as the prevalence of eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa and muscular layer in patients with achalasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All enrolled patients had diagnosed achalasia and had simultaneous biopsies of the muscular layer at the middle esophagus and distal esophageal sphincter as well as the mucosal layer of the proximal and distal esophagus during POEM. All POEM procedures took place from August 2018 to December 2018 or September 2019 to November 2019. Various demographic, disease-related, and procedure-related data were collected from chart review. Eosinophilic infiltration in the biopsy specimen was examined. KEY RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients (65% female, age range: 21–84) with a pre-procedure Eckardt score of >6 were enrolled during the study period, with the duration of their achalasia ranging from 1 to 32 years. Eighteen patients had clinical symptomatic improvement after POEM, as defined by an Eckardt score <3. Endoscopic examination did not reveal any signs of eosinophilic esophagitis. Pathologic examination of biopsies revealed eosinophilic infiltration in three of 20 patients (15%) in the distal esophageal mucosa (all <15 eosinophils/HPF) and none in the proximal esophageal mucosa. There was no eosinophilic infiltration in the distal esophageal sphincter and the middle esophageal muscle. No complication was noted due to muscle biopsy. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Submucosal tunneling during POEM provides a safe access for direct esophageal muscle biopsy. This is the first report of the simultaneous biopsy of the esophageal mucosa and muscle in patients with achalasia. Contrary to all previously published studies, the association of esophageal eosinophilic infiltration and achalasia was not observed in this small sample study. Based on our findings, immune or autoimmune reaction rather than direct eosinophilic infiltration in the muscle is more likely the cause of achalasia.","Chen, Huimin; Calderon, Lucie F.; Shah, Rushikesh; Zheng, Wei; Xia, Liang; Wang, Wei; Li, Lianyong; Li, Baiwen; Xue, Yue; Keilin, Steve; Cai, Qiang",Dig Dis Sci,395,1

Urologists are operating at a fraction of normal volume to conserve personal protective equipment and prevent viral spread. Many residency programs have organized rotating skeleton crews to perform clinical duties while a portion of residents work from home. In some regions, urology residents have been deployed to emergency rooms, intensive care units, and medical floors to care for COVID-19 patients. With these interruptions in urologic education, many questions remain about how residents will proceed with their clinical and didactic training. During these unprecedented times, many residencies have transitioned their didactic sessions to video-based platforms, allowing educators to reach larger numbers of learners. This perspective addresses how innovative virtual education programs created during the pandemic can be developed into a national video-based curriculum for urology residents, incorporating both didactics and surgical skill training.","Tabakin, Alexandra L.; Patel, Hiren V.; Singer, Eric A.",J Surg Educ,395,16

This retrospective study evaluated the clinical characteristics of severe CRS (sCRS, grade 3–4) induced by severe COVID-19 (40 patients) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy as a comparator (41 patients). Grade 4 CRS was significantly more common in the COVID-19 group (15/40 (35.7%) vs. 5/41 (12.2%), P = 0.008). The CAR-T group had more dramatic increase in cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Interestingly, COVID-19 group had significantly higher levels for TNF-α (31.1 pg/ml (16.1–70.0) vs. 3.3 (1.8–9.6), P < 0.001) and lg viral loads were correlated with lg IL-6 (R(2) = 0.101; P < 0.001) and lg IL-10 (R(2) = 0.105; P < 0.001). The independent risk factor for COVID-19-related sCRS was hypertension history (OR: 4.876, 95% CI: 2.038–11.668; P < 0.001). Our study demonstrated that there were similar processes but different intensity of inflammatory responses of sCRS in COVID-19 and CAR-T group. The diagnose and management of severe COVID-19-related sCRS can learn lessons from treatment of sCRS induced by CAR-T therapy.","Hong, Ruimin; Zhao, Houli; Wang, Yiyun; Chen, Yu; Cai, Hongliu; Hu, Yongxian; Wei, Guoqing; Huang, He",Bone Marrow Transplant,395,28

We hypothesized that residential racial segregation constrains African Americans’ spatial mobility when the whole population is locked down but increases their need for moving under reopening orders. METHODS: We employ a Black/White dissimilarity index as our independent variable and county-level mobility ratios as our dependent variable. Using generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data, we analyzed the effects of Black/White segregation on population mobility by counties across the United States from March 8 to August 7, 2020 under two different COVID-19 related policy conditions: lockdown and reopening. FINDINGS: While higher county-wide levels of segregation were significantly associated with decreased mobility under lockdown and stay-at-home orders, we found that this relationship between segregation and mobility dissipated under reopening orders. INTERPRETATIONS: Investigating the effects of health policy without considering differing effects due to structural racism will likely ignore complexities that may create unintended consequences of health policy. Our conclusions suggest African Americans may face structural limitations to effective social distancing as evidenced by higher rates of mobility after reopening policies go into effect.","White, Alexandre; Hao, Lingxin; Yu, Xiao; Thorpe, Roland J.",EClinicalMedicine,395,22

Using the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as a backdrop, this online survey experiment (N = 393) examined the effect of jargon use across three different topics that varied in situational urgency: COVID-19 (high urgency), flood risk (low urgency), and federal emergency policy (control). Results revealed that although the use of jargon led to more difficult processing and reduced persuasion for the two less-urgent topics (flood risk, emergency policy), there was no effect of jargon in the COVID-19 condition. Theoretically, these findings suggest that the motivation to process information is an important moderator for crisis communication in particular and science communication in general. Practically, these findings suggest that science communicators, during times of crisis, do not need to ""dumb down"" their language in the same way they should during non-crises.","Shulman, Hillary C.; Bullock, Olivia M.",PLoS One,395,1

Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for many regions. Less attention has been given to the age distributions of serious medical interventions administered to COVID-19 patients, which could reveal sources of potential pressure on the healthcare system should SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increase, and could inform mass vaccination strategies. The aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 patient age and serious outcomes of the disease, beyond fatalities alone. METHODS: We analysed 277,555 known SARS-CoV-2 infection records for Ontario, Canada, from 23 January 2020 to 16 February 2021 and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: The distribution of hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 60–90, whereas deaths are concentrated in ages 80+. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known infection reaches a maximum of 27.8% at age 80 (95% CI 26.0%–29.7%). The probability of survival given hospitalization is nearly 100% for adults younger than 40, but declines substantially after this age; for example, a hospitalized 54-year-old patient has a 91.7% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 88.3%–94.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant need for hospitalization in middle-aged individuals and young seniors. This need is not captured by the distribution of deaths, which is heavily concentrated in very old ages. The probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 is lower than is generally perceived for patients over 40. If acute care capacity is exceeded due to an increase in COVID-19 prevalence, the distribution of deaths could expand toward younger ages. These results suggest that vaccine programs should aim to prevent infection not only in old seniors, but also in young seniors and middle-aged individuals, to protect them from serious illness and to limit stress on the healthcare system.","Papst, Irena; Li, Michael; Champredon, David; Bolker, Benjamin M.; Dushoff, Jonathan; D.

Las complicaciones en UCI fueron frecuentes, principalmente infecciones y eventos trombóticos. Tuvimos una mortalidad relativamente baja del 15,5% Background and objectives: There is limited information on outcome, complications and treatments of critically ill Covid-19 patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study is to describe the clinical ICU course, treatments used, complications and outcomes, of critically ill Covid-19 patients admitted in seven ICUs in Galicia region during the 2020 March-April pandemic peak. Methods: Between March 21 and April 19, 2020, we evaluated critically ill Covid-19 patients admitted to the ICU of Anesthesia of seven hospitals in Galicia, northwestern Spain. Outcome, complications, and treatments were monitored until May 6, 2020, the final date of follow-up. Results: A total of 97 critically ill Covid-19 patients were included. During ICU stay, mechanical ventilation became necessary in 80 (82.5%) patients, and tracheostomy in 22 (22.7%) patients. Prone position was used frequently in both intubated (67.5%) and awake (27.8%) patients. Medications consisted of antivirals agents (92.7%), corticosteroids (93.8%), tocilizumab (57.7%), and intermediate or high doses of anticoagulants (83.5%).

There is limited experience with the in‐hospital initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acute HF (AHF) with or without diabetes. EMPULSE is designed to assess the clinical benefit and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients hospitalized with AHF. METHODS: EMPULSE is a randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled multinational trial comparing the in‐hospital initiation of empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) with placebo. Approximately 500 patients admitted for AHF with dyspnoea, signs of fluid overload, and elevated natriuretic peptides will be randomized 1:1 stratified to HF status (de‐novo and decompensated chronic HF) to either empagliflozin or placebo at approximately 165 sites across North America, Europe and Asia. Patients will be enrolled regardless of ejection fraction and diabetes status and will be randomized during hospitalization and after stabilization (between 24 h and 5 days after admission), with treatment continued up to 90 days after initiation. The primary outcome is clinical benefit at 90 days, consisting of a composite of all‐cause death, HF events, and ≥5 point change from baseline in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score (KCCQ‐TSS), assessed using a ‘win‐ratio’ approach. Secondary outcomes include assessments of safety, change in KCCQ‐TSS from baseline to 90 days and change in natriuretic peptides from baseline to 30 days. CONCLUSION: The EMPULSE trial will evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for AHF.","Tromp, Jasper; Ponikowski, Piotr; Salsali, Afshin; Angermann, Christiane E.; Biegus, Jan; Blatchford, Jon; Collins, Sean P.; Ferreira, João Pedro; Grauer, Claudia; Kosiborod, Mikhail; Nassif, Michael E.; Psotka, Mitchell A.; Brueckmann, Martina; Teerlink, John R.; Voors, Adriaan A.",Eur J Heart Fail,395,16

As the empirical evidence for this claim is lacking, this study tested the hypothesis that extraversion moderates the relationship between the stringency of COVID-19 protective measures and depressive symptoms. Our results were based on survey data from 93,125 respondents collected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 20–April 6, 2020) across 47 countries and publicly available data on measure stringency. Findings demonstrate that extraversion moderates the relationship between measure stringency in the early days of the pandemic and depressive symptoms. For introverts, measure stringency has a negative effect on depressive symptoms, while for extraverts, it has a positive, but non-significant effect on depressive symptoms. This study suggests that, although stringent measures generally help people to worry less and feel safer, the lifestyle associated with such measures feels more natural to introverts than to extraverts.","Wijngaards, Indy; Sisouw de Zilwa, Sophie C.

The development of vaccines has taken one year, which is why it is necessary to investigate whether some already‐existing alternatives that have been successfully developed in recent years can mitigate the pandemic's advance. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have proved effective in antiviral action. Thus, in this review, several in vitro and in vivo studies of the effect of AgNPs on viruses that cause respiratory diseases are analyzed and discussed to promote an understanding of the possible interaction of AgNPs with SARS‐CoV‐2. The study focuses on several in vivo toxicological studies of AgNPs and a dose extrapolation to humans to determine the chief avenue of exposure. It can be concluded that the use of AgNPs as a possible treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 could be viable, based on comparing the virus' behavior to that of similar viruses in in vivo studies, and that the suggested route of administration in terms of least degree of adverse effects is inhalation.

DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Studies evaluating patients on chronic invasive mechanical ventilation in different care settings. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS and Scopus databases from inception to March 27, 2020. Studies reporting mortality outcomes of patients ≥18 years of age on chronic invasive mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and other care settings were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Sixty studies were included in the systematic review. Mortality rates ranged from 13.7% to 77.8% in ICUs (n = 17 studies), 7.8%–51.0% in non-ICUs including step-down units and inpatient wards (n = 26 studies), and 12.0%–91.8% in home or nursing home settings (n = 19 studies). Age was associated with mortality in all care settings. Weaning rates ranged from 10.0% to 78.2% across non-ICU studies. Studies reporting weaning as their primary outcome demonstrated higher success rates in weaning. Home care studies reported low incidences of ventilator failure. None of the studies reported ventilator malfunction as the primary cause of death. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality outcomes across various settings were disparate due to methodological and clinical heterogeneity among studies. However, there is evidence to suggest non-ICU venues of care as a comparable alternative to ICUs for stable, chronically ventilated patients, with the additional benefit of providing specialized weaning programs. By synthesizing the global data on managing chronically ventilated patients in various care settings, this study provides health care systems and providers alternative venue options for the delivery of prolonged ventilatory care in the context of limited ICU resources.","Sison, Stephanie M.; Sivakumar, Gayathri K.; Caufield-Noll, Christine; Greenough, William B.; Oh, Esther S.; Galiatsatos, Panagis",Heliyon,395,16

Adequate food loss and waste (FLW) management has been proposed as an approach to meet these objectives. The main hypothesis of this study is to consider that the “strong fluctuations and short-term changes” on eating habits may have major consequences on potential FLW generation and management, as well as on GHG emissions, all taking into account the nutritional and the economic cost. Due to the exceptional lockdown measures imposed by the Spanish government, as a consequence of the emerging coronavirus disease, COVID-19, food production and consumption systems have undergone significant changes, which must be properly studied in order to propose strategies from the lessons learned. Taking Spain as a case study, the methodological approach included a deep analysis of the inputs and outputs of the Spanish food basket, the supply chain by means of a Material Flow Analysis, as well as an economic and comprehensive nutritional assessment, all under a life cycle thinking approach. The results reveal that during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no significant adjustment in overall FLW generation, but a partial reallocation from extra-domestic consumption to households occurred (12% increase in household FLW). Moreover, the economic impact (+11%), GHG emissions (+10%), and the nutritional content (−8%) complete the multivariable impact profile that the COVID-19 outbreak had on FLW generation and management. Accordingly, this study once again highlights that measures aimed at reducing FLW, particularly in the household sector, are critical to make better use of food surpluses and FLW prevention and control, allowing us to confront future unforeseen scenarios.","Aldaco, R.; Hoehn, D.; Laso, J.; Margallo, M.; Ruiz-Salmón, J.; Cristobal, J.; Kahhat, R.; Villanueva-Rey, P.; Bala, A.; Batlle-Bayer, L.; Fullana-i-Palmer, P.; Irabien, A.; Vazquez-Rowe, I.",Sci Total Environ,395,21

Eventually, five (16.1%) patients were discharged, of whom four cases (12.9%) readmitted. Five (16.1%) patients remained ICU hospitalized at the report time and 12 (38.7%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Macrovascular arterial/venous thrombosis is identified in almost half of COVID-19 patients with bowel ischemia. Overall mortality in COVID-19 patients with GI ischemia and radiologically evident mesenteric thrombotic occlusion was 38.7% and 40%, retrospectively.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Rafiee, Faranak; Kavandi, Hadiseh; Goudarzi, Sogand; Heidari, Firouzeh; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,395,20

METHODS Using a kiosk-based survey method at the XXX we remotely assayed PAK of Australians through their interaction with the kiosk. The surveys we used had five and seven multiple answer questions and were analyzed using standard comparative approaches. We also made comparisons based on gender and on age group for many of the questions. RESULTS Our analyses indicate that there is a lack of general understanding of the role of microbes in everyday life among Australians. In addition, we detected some basic misunderstandings about antibiotics. While 80% of the respondents identified penicillin as an antibiotic, up to 30% of the respondents wrongly identified aspirin, Tylenol, valium and Benadryl as antibiotics. We also detected a general lack of knowledge about hand washing hygiene and probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS Our results from around 700 Australian respondents can serve as a baseline for further PAK assessment of Australians. PAK of Australians with respect to microbes and hand washing hygiene is poor therefore public education is needed. This study should stimulate a better roadmap for public education about microbes, antibiotics, probiotics and hygiene. SO WHAT?: With the recent spread of SARS-Cov2 and the ensuing Covid19 pandemic and the continuing rise in antimicrobial resistance the need for assessment PAK of microbes and infectious disease has become acute.","DeSalle, Rob; Wikins, Jared; Kennett, Rod",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,395,20

In the past 10 years, numerous studies have shown that infected individuals have a significantly higher incidence of mental and physical health problems and are more prone to exhibiting the adverse effects of various diseases. METHODS: A cross-sectional internet study was performed on a population of 4499 (786 Toxoplasma-infected) participants and looked for factors which positively or negatively affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and likelihood of a severe course of COVID-19. RESULTS: Logistic regression and partial Kendall correlation controlling for sex, age, and size of the place of residence showed that latent toxoplasmosis had the strongest effect on the risk of infection (OR = 1.50) before sport (OR = 1.30) and borreliosis (1.27). It also had the strongest effect on the risk of severe course of infection (Tau = 0.146), before autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, male sex, keeping a cat, being overweight, borreliosis, higher age, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Toxoplasmosis augmented the adverse effects of other risk factors but was not the proximal cause of the effect of cat-keeping on higher likelihood of COVID infection and higher severity of the course of infection because the effect of cat-keeping was also observed (and in particular) in a subset of Toxoplasma-infected respondents (Tau = 0.153). Effects of keeping a cat were detected only in respondents from multi-member families, suggesting that a cat could be a vector for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a family. CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasmosis is currently not considered a risk factor for COVID-19, and Toxoplasma-infected individuals are neither informed about their higher risk nor prioritised in vaccination programs. Because toxoplasmosis affects a large segment of the human population, its impact on COVID-19-associated effects on public health could be considerable.

It has spread rapidly around the globe since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The causative virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the World Health Organization (WHO) named the new epidemic disease Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The incidence of COVID-19 continues to increase with more than three million confirmed cases and over 244,000 deaths worldwide. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. Therefore, in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, the implementation of precautions and hygienic measures will be essential to control and to minimize human transmission of the virus.

Some antihypertensive drugs affect ACE2 expression or activity (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]), suggesting use of other hypertensives might be preferable, such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Given the limited evidence, the International Society of Hypertension does not support such a policy. METHODS: We used a Mendelian randomization study to obtain unconfounded associations of antihypertensives, instrumented by published genetic variants in genes regulating target proteins of these drugs, with immune (lymphocyte and neutrophil percentage) and inflammatory (tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNF‐α]) markers in the largest available genome‐wide association studies. RESULTS: Genetically predicted effects of ACE inhibitors increased lymphocyte percentage (0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35, 1.22), decreased neutrophil percentage (−0.64, 95% CI −1.09, −0.20) and possibly lowered TNF‐α (−4.92, 95% CI −8.50, −1.33). CCBs showed a similar pattern for immune function (lymphocyte percentage 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.36; neutrophil percentage −0.23, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.08) but had no effect on TNF‐α, as did potassium‐sparing diuretics and aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilator antihypertensives. ARBs and other classes of hypertensives had no effect on immune function or TNF‐α. CONCLUSION: Varying effects of different classes of antihypertensives on immune and inflammatory markers do not suggest antihypertensive use based on their role in ACE2 expression, but instead suggest investigation of the role of antihypertensives in immune function and inflammation might reveal important information that could optimize their use in SARSCoV‐2.","Zhao, Jie V.; Schooling, C.

METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 15 to June 15, 2020 in five tertiary eye care hospitals in South India to assess the KAP towards COVID-19. Each of the hospitals belonged to one of the three different zones assigned in India based on number of infections. Red zones represent hotspots and orange/green zones represent regions with medium and lower caseloads, respectively. A validated questionnaire was administered through telephone and responses were recorded on a Google form. RESULTS: Out of the total (n = 6119) participants, 3081 were from hospitals in green zone, 2110 from the orange zone, and 928 from red zone. Majority of participants were above 50 years of age (42%) and 15.54% were illiterate. The mean (percentage) scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice were 21.26 (82%), 9.37 (92%), and 10.32 (86%), respectively. KAP among patients more than 50 years of age and in illiterate individuals was significantly less (P < 0.01) when compared with all other groups. Participants from red zone had a significantly better attitude (P < 0.01) compared to other centers. CONCLUSION: Although the overall KAP regarding COVID-19 disease was robust (above 80% in all categories) in our participants, the high risk elderly population (>50 years) and illiterate individuals had a significantly lower KAP. These are populations in which education should be emphasized and appropriately delivered as a way to reduce COVID-19 risk.","Christy, Josephine S; Kaur, Kirandeep; Gurnani, Bharat; Hess, Olivia M; Narendran, Kalpana; Venugopal, Anitha; Anuja, J; Manohar, Divya; Raman, Ramalakshmi; Venkatesh, Rengaraj",Indian J Ophthalmol,395,20

It also activates surface proteins of many viruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furin inhibitors effectively suppress viral replication and thus are promising antiviral therapeutics with broad application potential. Polybasic substrate-like ligands typically trigger conformational changes shifting furin’s active site cleft from the OFF-state to the ON-state. Here, we solved the X-ray structures of furin in complex with four different arginine mimetic compounds with reduced basicity. These guanylhydrazone-based inhibitor complexes showed for the first time an active site-directed binding mode to furin’s OFF-state conformation. The compounds undergo unique interactions within the S1 pocket, largely different compared to substrate-like ligands. A second binding site was identified at the S4/S5 pocket of furin. Crystallography-based titration experiments confirmed the S1 site as the primary binding pocket. We also tested the proprotein convertases PC5/6 and PC7 for inhibition by guanylhydrazones and found an up to 7-fold lower potency for PC7. Interestingly, the observed differences in the K(i) values correlated with the sequence conservation of the PCs at the allosteric sodium binding site. Therefore, OFF-state-specific targeting of furin can serve as a valuable strategy for structure-based development of PC-selective small-molecule inhibitors.","Dahms, Sven O.; Haider, Tanja; Klebe, Gerhard; Steinmetzer, Torsten; Brandstetter, Hans",ACS Chem Biol,395,20

A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. OBJECTIVE: To understand people's COVID‐19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID‐19 and attitudes towards a COVID‐19 vaccine. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In‐depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants discussed a wide range of COVID‐19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localized and empathetic response to counter misinformation. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify COVID‐19 priority topics important to Bradford citizens and decision makers.","Lockyer, Bridget; Islam, Shahid; Rahman, Aamnah; Dickerson, Josie; Pickett, Kate; Sheldon, Trevor; Wright, John; McEachan, Rosemary; Sheard, Laura",Health Expect,395,24

A genuinely sustainable society is one that initiates developments in sustainable ways. The development of a genuinely sustainable society is supported by its citizens who think and act according to a recognized code of conduct - the sustainable culture. Similar to other forms of culture, sustainable culture of a society is not static, but changes over time. The changes found in a sustainable culture are reflections of the status of sustainability in a society and these changes should be measured from time to time. The resulting measurement gives very important information for decision-makers, in the government and in the private sector, to examine the magnitude of changes that have taken place in a given period of time. The results will also enable them to review and adjust policies in order to better accommodate changes according to the trends of society. This paper provides a method – the T-model, to investigate and measure the extent of change of sustainable culture through two extensive surveys among participants of the construction industry of Hong Kong. The change in sustainable culture is reflected by the change in attitude and practice among construction participants, this can be found in their performance in project development, design and construction operations. The data of these changes are collected and converted to numerical scores. The T-model synthesized these scores and revealed the change of sustainable culture within the specific study time frame.","Yip Robin, C.P.; Poon, C.S.",J Environ Manage,395,26

Significant progress has been achieved with the use of biologic treatments, which specifically block pro-inflammatory molecules involved in the disease pathogenesis. The most commonly used biologics in JIA are monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins targeting interleukins 1 (IL-1) and 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Several biomarkers have been investigated in JIA. Aims: To assess the level of evidence available regarding the role of biomarkers in JIA related to guiding clinical and therapeutic decisions, providing disease prognostic information, facilitating disease activity monitoring and assessing biologic treatment response in JIA, as well as propose new strategies for biologic therapy-related biomarker use in JIA. Methods: We searched PubMed for relevant literature using predefined key words corresponding to several categories of biomarkers to assess their role in predicting and assessing biologic treatment response and clinical remission in JIA. Results: We reviewed serological, cellular, genetic, transcriptomic and imaging biomarkers, to identify candidates that are both well-established and widely used, as well as newly investigated in JIA on biologic therapy. We evaluated their role in management of JIA as well as identified the unmet needs for new biomarker discovery and better clinical applications. Conclusion: Although there are no ideal biomarkers in JIA, we identified serological biomarkers with potential clinical utility. We propose strategies of combining biomarkers of response to biologics in JIA, as well as routine implementation of clinically acceptable imaging biomarkers for improved disease assessment performance.","Choida, Varvara; Hall-Craggs, Margaret; Jebson, Bethany R.; Fisher, Corinne; Leandro, Maria; Wedderburn, Lucy R.; Ciurtin, Coziana",Front Pharmacol,395,33

After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents. METHODS: We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded. Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later. Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic. RESULTS: Twenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive. Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.","Arons, Melissa M.; Hatfield, Kelly M.; Reddy, Sujan C.; Kimball, Anne; James, Allison; Jacobs, Jesica R.; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C.; Oakley, Lisa P.; Tanwar, Sukarma; Dyal, Jonathan W.; Harney, Josh; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M.; Methner, Mark; Paul, Prabasaj; Carlson, Christina M.; McLaughlin, Heather P.; Thornburg, Natalie; Tong, Suxiang; Tamin, Azaibi; Tao, Ying; Uehara, Anna; Harcourt, Jennifer; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C.; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Montgomery, Patty; Stone, Nimalie D.; Clark, Thomas A.; Honein, Margaret A.; Duchin, Jeffrey S.; Jernigan, John A.",N Engl J Med,395,1

The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful ‘force multiplier’ allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool – ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance. In the longer term it may have the potential to improve compliance with International Health Regulations, be adapted for future emergencies, and contribute to global health security.","Mellor, Nicholas; Horton, Hetty; Luke, David; Meadows, Jon; Chatterjee, Arunangsu; Gale, Thomas",Procedia Engineering,395,26

Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID‐19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS presentations in COVID‐19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the CNS features between 1 January 2020 and 20 April 2020. The data of selected studies were screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using STATA statistical software. The study protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020184456). RESULTS: Of 2,353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11,687 patients after screening. Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of COVID‐19 was headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%–10.82%), dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%–8.22%), and impaired consciousness (1.90%, 95%CI: 1.0%–2.79%).

For Radiation Oncology departments in Brazil, this contingency has become even more complex due to the significant impact observed in different sectors of society, the large number of cases and deaths by COVID-19. This study estimated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian Radiation Oncology departments and the coping measures used in the country. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Brazilian Radiotherapy Society (SBRT) developed a questionnaire with 14 questions, sent to all heads of Radiation Oncology departments in the country, between May and June 2020. These data were evaluated regarding cases confirmed and deaths by COVID-19 in epidemiological week 28, on July 11, 2020. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six questionnaires from different regions were answered, representing 44% of the country’s services. A drop in the number of patients was observed in 61% of services. This drop was observed both in patients from the public and supplementary private health insurance systems. Regarding patients and employees with COVID-19, we observe that services that primarily treat SUS patients reported significantly fewer cases of the disease. About half of the services had collaborators and patients during radiotherapy with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19.

The evolutionary mechanisms governing the persistence and emergence of new norovirus strains in human populations are unknown. Primarily organized by sequence homology into two major human genogroups defined by multiple genoclusters, the majority of norovirus outbreaks are caused by viruses from the GII.4 genocluster, which was first recognized as the major epidemic strain in the mid-1990s. Previous studies by our laboratory and others indicate that some noroviruses readily infect individuals who carry a gene encoding a functional alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT2) and are designated “secretor-positive” to indicate that they express ABH histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), a highly heterogeneous group of related carbohydrates on mucosal surfaces. Individuals with defects in the FUT2 gene are termed secretor-negative, do not express the appropriate HBGA necessary for docking, and are resistant to Norwalk infection. These data argue that FUT2 and other genes encoding enzymes that regulate processing of the HBGA carbohydrates function as susceptibility alleles. However, secretor-negative individuals can be infected with other norovirus strains, and reinfection with the GII.4 strains is common in human populations. In this article, we analyze molecular mechanisms governing GII.4 epidemiology, susceptibility, and persistence in human populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Phylogenetic analyses of the GII.4 capsid sequences suggested an epochal evolution over the last 20 y with periods of stasis followed by rapid evolution of novel epidemic strains. The epidemic strains show a linear relationship in time, whereby serial replacements emerge from the previous cluster. Five major evolutionary clusters were identified, and representative ORF2 capsid genes for each cluster were expressed as virus-like particles (VLPs). Using salivary and carbohydrate-binding assays, we showed that GII.4 VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding patterns have changed over time and include carbohydrates regulated by the human FUT2 and FUT3 pathways, suggesting that strain sensitivity to human susceptibility alleles will vary. Variation in surface-exposed residues and in residues that surround the fucose ligand interaction domain suggests that antigenic drift may promote GII.4 persistence in human populations. Evidence supporting antigenic drift was obtained by measuring the antigenic relatedness of GII.4 VLPs using murine and human sera and demonstrating strain-specific serologic and carbohydrate-binding blockade responses. These data suggest that the GII.4 noroviruses persist by altering their HBGA carbohydrate-binding targets over time, which not only allows for escape from highly penetrant host susceptibility alleles, but simultaneously allows for immune-driven selection in the receptor-binding region to facilitate escape from protective herd immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the surface-exposed carbohydrate ligand binding domain in the norovirus capsid is under heavy immune selection and likely evolves by antigenic drift in the face of human herd immunity. Variation in the capsid carbohydrate-binding domain is tolerated because of the large repertoire of similar, yet distinct HBGA carbohydrate receptors available on mucosal surfaces that could interface with the remodeled architecture of the capsid ligand-binding pocket. The continuing evolution of new replacement strains suggests that, as with influenza viruses, vaccines could be targeted that protect against norovirus infections, and that continued epidemiologic surveillance and reformulations of norovirus vaccines will be essential in the control of future outbreaks.","Lindesmith, Lisa C; Donaldson, Eric F; LoBue, Anna D; Cannon, Jennifer L; Zheng, Du-Ping; Vinje, Jan; Baric, Ralph S",PLoS Med,395,1

The VP1 protein of BTV is the viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for the replication of the viral genome. Currently there is no structural information available for VP1. By manual alignment of BTV, Reovirus and other viral RdRps we have generated a model for the structure of VP1, the RdRp of BTV. The structure can be divided into three domains: an N‐terminal domain, a C‐terminal domain, and a central polymerase domain. Mutation of the putative catalytic site in the central polymerase domain by site‐directed mutagenesis abrogated in vitro replicase activity. Each of the domains was expressed individually and subsequently partially purified to obtain direct evidence for the location of polymerase activity and the nucleoside triphosphate binding site. The nucleoside triphosphate binding site was located by showing that CTP only bound to the full‐length protein or to the polymerase domain and not to either of the other two domains. None of the domains had catalytic activity when tested individually or in tandem but when all three domains were mixed together the RdRp activity was reconstituted. This is the first report of the reconstitution of a functional viral RdRp in vitro from individual domains. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 86: 83–94, 2007.

One important question is whether the pandemic curtailed the use of addiction treatment and the extent to which telehealth was able to mitigate access barriers. METHODS: To begin to answer this question, we conducted a survey of specialty addiction treatment providers in California from June 2020 through July 2020. The survey focused specifically on provider organizations that served Medicaid beneficiaries. RESULTS: Of the 133 respondents, 50% reported a decrease in patients since the stay-at-home order in March 2020, with the largest decline among new patients, and 58% said more patients were relapsing. Eighty-one percent of providers said that telemedicine use had increased since the stay-at-home order. Most said that telemedicine had moderately (48%) or completely (30%) addressed access barriers. CONCLUSION: More efforts are needed to ensure that patients, and in particular new patients, receive addiction treatment during public health emergencies.","Henretty, Kristen; Padwa, Howard; Treiman, Katherine; Gilbert, Marylou; Mark, Tami L",Subst Abuse,395,14

The first step in combating these pathogens is to get a timely and accurate diagnosis at an affordable cost. Many kinds of diagnostics have been developed, such as pathogen culture, biochemical tests and serological tests, to help detect and fight against the causative agents of diseases. However, these diagnostic tests are generally unsatisfactory because they are not particularly sensitive and specific and are unable to deliver speedy results. Nucleic acid-based diagnostics, detecting pathogens through the identification of their genomic sequences, have shown promise to overcome the above limitations and become more widely adopted in clinical tests. Here we review some of the most popular nucleic acid-based diagnostics and focus on their adaptability and applicability to routine clinical usage. We also compare and contrast the characteristics of different types of nucleic acid-based diagnostics.","Yu, Albert Cheung-Hoi; Vatcher, Greg; Yue, Xin; Dong, Yan; Li, Mao Hua; Tam, Patrick H.

However, its functional impact remains unknown. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of biological cardiac injury on myocardial functions in patients with COVID-19. 31 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (CoV+) and 16 controls (CoV−) were prospectively included in this observational study. Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and myocardial function assessed by transthoracic echocardiography were collected and analysed in CoV+ with (TnT+) and without (TnT−) elevation of troponin T levels and compared with CoV−. Among CoV+, 13 (42%) exhibited myocardial injury. CoV+/TnT + patients were older, had lower diastolic arterial pressure and were more likely to have hypertension and chronic renal failure compared with CoV+/TnT−. The control group was comparable except for an absence of biological inflammatory syndrome. Left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain were not different among the three groups. There was a trend of decreased myocardial work and increased peak systolic tricuspid annular velocity between the CoV− and CoV + patients, which became significant when comparing CoV− and CoV+/TnT+ (2167 ± 359 vs. 1774 ± 521%/mmHg, P = 0.047 and 14 ± 3 vs. 16 ± 3 cm/s, P = 0.037, respectively). There was a decrease of global work efficiency from CoV− (96 ± 2%) to CoV+/TnT− (94 ± 4%) and then CoV+/TnT+ (93 ± 3%, P = 0.042).

Does such an age-prosociality relationship occur during the COVID-19 pandemic, or might the pandemic—as a stressor that may differently influence young and older adults— create a boundary condition on the relationship? If so, can empathy, a well-known prosocial disposition, explain the age-prosociality relationship? The present study investigated these questions and whether the target (distant- compared to close-others) of prosocial behaviors differs by age. METHOD: Participants completed a series of surveys on dispositional empathy and prosocial behaviors for a study assessing their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 330 participants (ages 18-89) from the USA who completed all of the surveys included in the present analyses. RESULTS: Age was positively related to greater prosocial during the pandemic. Although empathy was positively associated with individuals’ prosociality, it did not account for the age-prosociality association. Interestingly, increasing age was associated with greater prosocial behaviors towards close-others (i.e., family, friends).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anticomplementary activity was evaluated from hemolytic assays through the classical pathway (CP) and the alternative pathway (AP) of complement system in vitro. Compounds were isolated using bioactivity-guided fractionation and tested in vitro for their complement-inhibiting properties on the CP and AP. HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS was used to assign the isolated compounds in the five ingredient herbs. RESULTS: 15 compounds, including chlorogenic acid (1), rutin (2), hyperoside (3), p-hydroxyacephenone (4), scopoletin (5), quercitrin (6) (3R,4R,6S)-3,6-dihydroxy-1-menthene (7), acaciin (8), scoparone (9), luteolin (10), quercetin (11), apigenin (12), acacetin (13), aristolactam (14), and apigenin-7,4′-dimethyl ether (15) were isolated and identified.

Methods Thirty-three patients indicated for RTSA were monitored preoperatively, three, and 12 months postoperatively. Inertial measurement units were placed on the sternum and upper arm of the operative limb, recording humeral motion relative to the torso for the duration of a waking day. Elevation events (EE)/hour, EE/hour greater than 90°, time spent above 90°, and activity intensity were calculated and compared between time points. Patient-reported outcome measures were also collected at all time points. Results At three (P=0.040) and 12 (P=0.010) months after RTSA, patients demonstrated a significantly greater number of EE/hour greater than 90° compared to preoperatively. There were no significant differences (P≥0.242) in the amount of time spent at different elevation angles at any time point, or in arm activity intensity. Overall, 95% of the day was spent at elevation angles less than 60° and 90% of the day in a low or moderate intensity state. Pearson correlations demonstrated relationships between forward elevation and the number of EE/hour (r=0.395, P=0.001) and the number of EE/hour greater than 90° (r=0.493, P<0.001).

In this study, we show that reducing the levels of expression of CtsW reduces viral titers for different subtypes of IAV, and we map the target step of CtsW requirement to viral entry. Using a set of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CtsW, we demonstrate that knockdown of CtsW results in a decrease of IAV nucleoprotein accumulation in the nuclei of infected cells at 3 h postinfection. Assays specific for the individual stages of IAV entry further show that attachment, internalization, and early endosomal trafficking are not affected by CtsW knockdown. However, we detected impaired escape of viral particles from late endosomes in CtsW knockdown cells. Moreover, fusion analysis with a dual-labeled influenza virus revealed a significant reduction in fusion events, with no detectable impact on endosomal pH, suggesting that CtsW is required at the stage of viral fusion. The defect in IAV entry upon CtsW knockdown could be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type CtsW but not by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CtsW, suggesting that the proteolytic activity of CtsW is required for successful entry of IAV. Our results establish CtsW as an important host factor for entry of IAV into target cells and suggest that CtsW could be a promising target for the development of future antiviral drugs.","Edinger, Thomas O.; Pohl, Marie O.; Yángüez, Emilio; Stertz, Silke",mBio,395,17

The SymptoMScreen (SyMS) is a patient-reported questionnaire for measuring symptom severity in different domains affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been thoroughly evaluated in NMOSD. The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SyMS in a sample of patients with NMOSD. METHODS: A non-interventional, cross-sectional study in adult subjects with NMOSD (Wingerchuk 2015 criteria) was conducted at 13 neuroimmunology clinics applying the SyMS. A non-parametric item response theory procedure, Mokken analysis, was performed to assess the underlying dimensional structure and scalability of items and overall questionnaire. All analyses were performed with R (v4.0.3) using the mokken library. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were studied (mean age: 47.5 ± 15 years, 80% female, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score: 3.0 [interquartile range 1.5, 4.5]). Symptom severity was low (median SyMS score: 19.0 [interquartile range 10.0, 32.0]). The SyMS showed a robust internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.90 [95% confidence interval 0.86, 0.93]) and behaved as a unidimensional scale with all items showing scalability coefficients > 0.30. The overall SyMS scalability was 0.45 conforming to a medium scale according to Mokken’s criteria. Fatigue and body pain were the domains with the highest scalability coefficients. The SyMS was associated with disability (rho: 0.586), and physical and psychological quality of life (rho: 0.856 and 0.696, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The SyMS shows appropriate psychometric characteristics and may constitute a valuable and easy-to-implement option to measure symptom severity in patients with NMOSD.","Meca-Lallana, José E.; Maurino, Jorge; Pérez-Miralles, Francisco; Forero, Lucía; Sepúlveda, María; Calles, Carmen; Martínez-Ginés, María L.; González-Suárez, Inés; Boyero, Sabas; Romero-Pinel, Lucía; Sempere, Ángel P.; Meca-Lallana, Virginia; Querol, Luis; Costa-Frossard, Lucienne; Prefasi, Daniel; Gómez-Ballesteros, Rocío; Ballesteros, Javier",PLoS One,395,28

The current therapeutic options against the COVID-19 include repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins. Antibody-based therapeutics carry a lot of promise, and there are several of these candidates for COVID-19 treatment currently being investigated in the preclinical and clinical research stages around the world. The viral spike protein (S protein) appears to be the main target of antibody development candidates, with the majority being monoclonal antibodies. Several antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein include LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01. These neutralizing antibodies will treat COVID-19 and possibly future coronavirus infections.

Socio-environmental measures implemented as Ireland s prudent response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic represented, in effect, a national lockdown and have possibly influenced the health and wellbeing of pregnant women and unborn infants. Cumulative impact of such socio-environmental factors operating contemporaneously on PTB has never been assessed before. Methods: Regional PTB trends of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in one designated health area of Ireland over two decades were analysed. Poisson regression and rate ratio analyses with 95% CI were conducted. Observed regional data from January to April 2020 were compared to historical regional and national data and forecasted national figures for 2020. Results: Poisson regression analysis found that the regional historical VLBW rate per 1000 live births for January to April, 2001 to 2019 was 8.18 (95% CI: 7.21, 9.29). During January to April 2020, an unusually low VLBW rate of just 2.17 per 1000 live births was observed. The rate ratio of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.21, 11.75), p = 0.022, estimates that for the last two decades there was, on average, 3.77 times the rate of VLBW, compared to the period January to April 2020 during which there is a 73% reduction. National Irish VLBW rate for 2020 is forecasted to be reduced to 400 per 60,000 births compared to historical 500 to 600 range. Conclusion: An unprecedented reduction in PTB of VLBW infants was observed in one health region of Ireland during the COVID-19 lockdown. Potential determinants of this unique temporal trend reside in the summative socio-environmental impact of the COVID-19 dictated lockdown. Our findings, if mirrored in other regions that have adopted similar measures to combat the pandemic, demonstrate the potential to evaluate these implicated interdependent behavioural and socio-environmental modifiers to positively influence PTB rates globally.","Philip, R.

It is a threat to the pig industry as it lowers production and significantly impacts on livelihoods. ASF has no cure and a vaccine against it is yet to be developed. Outbreaks continue to be reported in Africa and Asia, where the setting of the pig value chain (farm, market, and slaughter practices) coupled with the risky behaviors of actors, contribute to persistence of the virus in pig populations. The role of these factors in the epidemiology of the disease is reviewed with a focus on smallholder pig systems in Africa. Biosecurity at the farm level is particularly emphasized, and factors influencing its adoption highlighted. Socio-cultural factors and weaknesses at the disease control policy level are critical and should not be ignored. Gender and equity are important aspects and ought to be considered in discussions to improve the sector.

A secondary objective was to describe the rate of favorable clinical response in patients with bloodstream infections (BSI) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-BSI) receiving ceftaroline. Overall, 200 patients were included in the study. Most of them had COVID-19 (83%, 165/200) and were hospitalized in medical wards (78%, 155/200). Included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were given empirical ceftaroline in the suspicion of bacterial co-infection or superinfection.

While many patients experience mild to moderate symptoms, severely affected patients often progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Specific to COVID-19, abnormal coagulability appears to be a principal instigator in the progression of disease severity and mortality. In this report we summarize a case of COVID-19 in which extreme thrombophilia led to patient demise. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old man in New York presented to the hospital 14 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient site. His initial presenting symptoms included sore throat, headache, fever, and diarrhea. He was brought in by his wife after developing sudden onset confusion and dysarthria. The patient’s clinical picture, which was unstable on presentation, further deteriorated to involve significant desaturations, generalized seizure activity, and cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation. Upon return to spontaneous circulation, the patient required intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor increases. Comprehensive workup uncovered coagulopathy with multiple thrombotic events involving the brain and lungs as well as radiographic evidence of severe lung disease. In the face of an unfavorable clinical picture, the family opted for comfort care measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this case report on a 67-year-old-man with COVID-19, we present an account of extreme hypercoagulability that led to multiple thrombotic events eventually resulting in the man’s demise. Abnormal coagulation 14 days from positive testing raises the question of whether outpatients with COVID-19 should be screened for hypercoagulability and treated with prophylactic anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents.","Shawkat, Ahmed; Merrell, Eric T.; Fadel, Ghada A.; Amzuta, Ioana; Amin, Hossam; Shah, Amish J.; Habeb, Hanan; Aiash, Hani",Am J Case Rep,395,20

It significantly simplifies the long-term process of clinical drug evaluation, since the drug being tested has already been approved for another condition. One example of drug repositioning involves cardiac glycosides (CGs), which have, for a long time, been used in heart medicine. Moreover, it has been known for decades that CGs also have great potential in cancer treatment and, thus, many clinical trials now evaluate their anticancer potential. Interestingly, heart failure and cancer are not the only conditions for which CGs could be effectively used. In recent years, the antiviral potential of CGs has been extensively studied, and with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this interest in CGs has increased even more. Therefore, here, we present CGs as potent and promising antiviral compounds, which can interfere with almost any steps of the viral life cycle, except for the viral attachment to a host cell. In this review article, we summarize the reported data on this hot topic and discuss the mechanisms of antiviral action of CGs, with reference to the particular viral life cycle phase they interfere with.","Škubník, Jan; Bejček, Jiří; Pavlíčková, Vladimíra Svobodová; Rimpelová, Silvie",Molecules,395,19

However, the environmental consequences associated with the temporary shutdown and recovery of industrial and commercial activities are still not fully understood. Using the well-known carbon footprint (CF) indicator, this paper provides a comprehensive estimation of environmental effects due to the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown measures in Italy. Our aim was to quantify the CF associated with the consumption of energy by any economic activity and region in Italy during the lockdown, and then compare these environmental burdens with the CF calculated for analogous periods from 2015 to 2019 (~March and April). Complementarily, we also conducted a scenario analysis to estimate the post-lockdown CF impact in Italy. A consumption-based approach was applied according to the principles of the established Life Cycle Assessment method. The CF was therefore quantified as a sum of direct and indirect greenhouse gases (GHGs) released from domestically produced and imported energy metabolism flows, excluding the exports. Our findings indicate that the CF in the lockdown period is ~−20% lower than the mean CF calculated for the past. This means avoided GHGs in between ~5.6 and ~10.6 Mt CO2e. Results further suggest that a tendency occurs towards higher impact savings in the Northern regions, on average ~230 kt CO2e of GHGs avoided by province (against ~110–130 kt CO2e in central and Southern provinces). Not surprisingly, these are the utmost industrialized areas of Italy and have been the ones mostly affected by the outbreak. Despite our CF estimates are not free of uncertainties, our research offers quantitative insights to start understanding the magnitude generated by such an exceptional lockdown event in Italy on climate change, and to complement current scientific efforts investigating the relationships between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19.","Rugani, Benedetto; Caro, Dario",Sci Total Environ,395,32

A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been affecting almost all nations around the world. Most infected patients who have been admitted to intensive care units show SARS signs. In this study, we aimed to achieve a better understanding of pathological alterations that take place during the novel coronavirus infection in most presumed affected organs. Methods. We performed postmortem core needle biopsies from lung, heart, and liver on 7 deceased patients who had died of coronavirus disease 2019. Prepared tissue sections were observed by 2 expert pathologists. Results. Diffuse alveolar damage was the main pathologic finding in the lung tissue samples. Patients with hospitalization durations of more than 10 days showed evidence of organization. Multinucleated cells in alveolar spaces and alveolar walls, atypical enlarged cells, accumulation of macrophages in alveolar spaces, and congestion of vascular channels were the other histopathologic alteration of the lung. None of our heart biopsy samples met the criteria for myocarditis. Liver biopsies showed congestion, micro- and macro-vesicular changes, and minimal to mild portal inflammation, in the majority of cases. Conclusions. Similar to the previous coronavirus infection in 2003, the main pathologic finding in the lung was diffuse alveolar damage with a pattern of organization in prolonged cases. The SARS-CoV-2 infection does not cause myocarditis, and the ischemia of myocardium is the most probable justification of the observed pathologic changes in the heart. Liver tissue sections mostly showed nonspecific findings; however, ischemia of the liver can be identified in some cases.","Beigmohammadi, Mohammad Taghi; Jahanbin, Behnaz; Safaei, Masoomeh; Amoozadeh, Laya; Khoshavi, Meysam; Mehrtash, Vahid; Jafarzadeh, Bita; Abdollahi, Alireza",Int J Surg Pathol,395,8

Here, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with solid and hematological cancers and concomitant Covid‐19 at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in a Covid‐19 hotspot area in Germany. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single center cohort study of 39 patients with hematological and solid cancers who were hospitalized at the University Hospital Freiburg for Covid‐19. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models we compared time to severe events and overall survival to an age‐matched control cohort of 39 patients with confirmed Covid‐19 without a cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: In the cancer cohort 29 patients had a diagnosis of a solid tumor, and 10 had a hematological malignancy. In total, eight patients (21%) in the cancer and 14 patients (36%) from the noncancer cohort died during the observation period. Presence of a malignancy was not significantly associated with survival or time to occurrence of severe events. Major influences on mortality were high IL‐6 levels at Covid‐19 diagnosis (HR = 6.95, P = .0121) and age ≥ 65 years (HR = 6.22, P = .0156). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to an age‐matched noncancer cohort, we did not observe an association between a cancer diagnosis and a more severe disease course or higher fatality rate in patients with Covid‐19.

In this paper, we discuss how open technology approaches - including data sharing, visualization, and tooling - can address the COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic. Methods : In response to the call for participation in the 2020 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on Medical Informatics and the Pandemic, the IMIA Open Source Working Group surveyed recent works related to the use of Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) for this pandemic. Results : FLOSS health care projects including GNU Health, OpenMRS, DHIS2, and others, have responded from the early phase of this pandemic. Data related to COVID-19 have been published from health organizations all over the world. Civic Technology, and the collaborative work of FLOSS and open data groups were considered to support collective intelligence on approaches to managing the pandemic. Conclusion : FLOSS and open data have been effectively used to contribute to managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and open approaches to collaboration can improve trust in data.","Kobayashi, Shinji; Falcón, Luis; Fraser, Hamish; Braa, Jørn; Amarakoon, Pamod; Marcelo, Alvin; Paton, Chris",Yearb Med Inform,395,22

Human sera reacting in the DID test neutralized the infectivity of the bovine coronaviruses to indices of 2.5 to > 5. Nineteen of 40 DID-negative, heat-inactivated sera had neutralizing indices of 1 to 3.0. Human serum with neutralizing and DID antibodies produced juxtanuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence identical to that of bovine immune serum in cells infected with the bovine coronavirus. Antibodies in human and bovine sera interacted with the peplomeres of the bovine coronavirus, matting and bridging them, when present in excess, and facilitated formation of large viral aggregates when present in equivalent concentrations. Complement added to the virus-antibody complexes did not alter specifically the morphology of single, antibody-laden viral particles or viral particles in aggregates. Evidence of the transmission of coronavirus from experimentally inoculated calves to man, with ensuing gastroenteritis, was found by electron microscopic tracing of the coronavirus and its virus-antibody complexes.","Storz, J.; Rott, R.",Med Microbiol Immunol,395,16

There is an urgent need for enhanced continuity of specialized care involving effective aftercare interventions and relapse prevention strategies in order to improve the long-term outcome for patients with AN. METHODS: SUSTAIN is a multi-center, prospective, randomized-controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a novel post-inpatient aftercare intervention for patients with AN as compared to optimized treatment-as-usual (TAU-O). The SUSTAIN aftercare intervention is based on the cognitive-interpersonal maintenance model of AN and specifically tailored to achieve sustained recovery in AN following inpatient treatment. The SUSTAIN aftercare intervention comprises 20 treatment sessions over eight months and will be predominantly delivered via videoconference to overcome discontinuity of care. TAU-O refers to routine outpatient psychotherapy as generally offered in the German health care system. A total number of 190 patients receiving inpatient or day-hospital treatment for AN will be randomized and assessed over a 14-month period following randomization including a 6 months follow-up. Minimum Body Mass Index (BMI) is 15 kg/m(2) at trial inclusion. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in BMI between baseline (T0) and end of treatment (T2) adjusted for baseline BMI. Key secondary outcomes comprise eating disorder and general psychopathology, quality of life, proportion of relapse and of weight restoration, and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The results of the present trial will provide evidence if the novel aftercare intervention fosters sustained recovery in patients affected by severe courses of AN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The SUSTAIN trial was prospectively registered on November 18, 2020, under the registration number DRKS00023372 at the German Clinical Trials Register (https://www.drks.de/drks_web/) which is an acknowledged primary register of the World Health Organization (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/).

Almost all dental procedures carry a high infection risk for providers and patients due to the spread of aerosols. As a consequence, public health agencies and professional associations have issued guidelines for enhanced infection control and personal protection equipment and have also limited care to urgent or emergency services. However, there is no dental service concept for pandemic disaster preparedness or response that might be applied. Moreover, pathways to dental care provision in a post-pandemic future with persisting risks are needed. We propose Safer Aerosol-Free Emergent Dentistry (SAFER Dentistry) as one approach to dental services during and emerging from the pandemic. The concept's starting point is the identification of the most common patient needs. The next step is to replace common treatments addressing the most frequent needs with alternative interventions involving a lower infection risk because they do not generate aerosols. SAFER Dentistry is innovative, avoids risk, and responds to the requirements of a pandemic and post-pandemic emergency where the risk of airborne disease transmission remains high. SAFER Dentistry thereby ensures continuity of dental services while protecting providers and patients from infectious pathogens. Moreover, SAFER Dentistry allows dental service providers to remain operational and generate income even under pandemic conditions. Potential implementation and policy options for SAFER Dentistry include universal availability without co-payments by patients and a uniform bundled payment scheme for providers to simplify budgeting, reimbursement, and administration during a pandemic. Adaptations and adjustments of the concept are possible and encouraged as long as the principle of avoiding aerosol-generating procedures is maintained.","Benzian, Habib; Niederman, Richard",Front Med (Lausanne),395,26

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.","De la Fuente, Carlos I.; Guadagnin, Eliane Celina; Kunzler, Marcos Roberto; Carpes, Felipe P.",Adv Physiol Educ,395,15

The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views. It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented.

Viral recognition by TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) has been proven to be cell-type specific. Triggering of TLRs with selected ligands can be beneficial against some viral infections. Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells that express TLRs and have a key role in the innate and adaptive immunity against viruses. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that cause acute and chronic infections and can productively infect macrophages. Investigation of the interplay between CoVs and PRRs is in its infancy. We assessed the effect of triggering TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 with selected ligands on the susceptibility of the J774A.1 macrophage cell line to infection with murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, [MHV]). Stimulation of TLR2, TLR4, or TLR7 did not affect MHV production. In contrast, pre-stimulation of TLR3 with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) hindered MHV infection through induction of IFN-β in macrophages. We demonstrate that activation of TLR3 with the synthetic ligand poly I:C mediates antiviral immunity that diminishes (MHV-A59) or suppresses (MHV-JHM, MHV-3) virus production in macrophages.","Mazaleuskaya, Liudmila; Veltrop, Rogier; Ikpeze, Nneka; Martin-Garcia, Julio; Navas-Martin, Sonia",Viruses,395,6

There have been few publications about this specific patient population, especially in Switzerland. This study aims to provide an overview of emergency presentations of adolescents between 16–18 years of age when compared to adults and focuses on their principle complaints. Methods: We conducted a single-centre, retrospective, cross-sectional study of all patients aged 16 years and older presenting to the adult ED at the University Hospital (Inselspital) in Bern, Switzerland, from 2013 to 2017. This analysis gives an overview of emergency presentations of adolescents between 16–18 years of age in this time period and compares their consultation characteristics to those of adult patients. Results: Data of a total of 203,817 patients who presented to our adult ED between 2013 and 2017 were analysed. Adolescents account for 2.5% of all emergency presentations. The number of ED presentations in the reviewed time period rose for adults (+2368, 95% CI: 1695, 3041, p = 0.002 consultations more per year; +25% comparing 2013 with 2017), while adolescent presentations did not significantly increase (p = 0.420). In comparison to adult patients, adolescents presented significantly more often during the night (39.1% vs. 31.5%, p < 0.001), as walk-ins (54.2% vs. 44.9%, p < 0.001), or with less highly acute complaints at triage (21% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). They were more likely to be discharged (70.8% vs. 52.2%, p < 0.001). We found a significant association between the two age groups and principle complaints. In comparison to adults, trauma and psychiatric problems were significantly more common among adolescents. Conclusions: Our data showed that complaints in adolescent patients under 18 years of age significantly differ from those in older patients. The artificial age cut-off therefore puts this vulnerable population at risk of receiving inadequate diagnostic testing and treatment adapted only for adults. Additional studies are needed on the reasons adolescents and young adults seek ED care, as this could lead to improvements in the care processes for this vulnerable population.","Brockhus, Lara Aurora; Bärtsch, Martina; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis K.; Keitel, Kristina; Klukowska-Rötzler, Jolanta; Müller, Martin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,395,23

Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a few or many non-specific symptoms or may be asymptomatic. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical features and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 characteristics of children screened for COVID-19 at the pediatric emergency department in Vilnius during the first 3 months (March–May) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive for 0.6% (8/1348) of all screened children and for 0.9% (7/811) of symptomatic patients, more among children with fever and cough (2.6%, 4/154). There were also COVID-19 cases among children without cough but with other respiratory symptoms (0.5%, 2/409) or gastrointestinal symptoms (1.2%, 3/257). Only one child with positive SARS-CoV-2 did not meet COVID-19 clinical criteria—he presented with vomiting and dehydration only. All COVID-19 cases (n = 8) had a contact with a confirmed COVID-19 family member. There were no COVID-19 cases among children without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or among asymptomatic children. Conclusion: Screening for COVID-19 in children is exceptionally challenging due to the diverse and non-specific symptoms of infection they present. Testing strategies should not only focus on the typical COVID-19 symptoms of fever or cough, but also include other symptoms, especially gastrointestinal symptoms, which are also important. The greatest attention should be paid to known exposure to SARS-CoV-2, especially in family clusters. Screening of asymptomatic children with no known exposure should be weighed for medical necessity and cost-effectiveness.","Stacevičienė, Indrė; Burokienė, Sigita; Steponavičienė, Aušra; Vaičiūnienė, Daiva; Jankauskienė, Augustina",Eur J Pediatr,395,2

A Population Study of Public Perception,18.408915,10.158646,2021-07-02,"Introduction: Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in universities across the United States highlight the difficulties in containing the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. While research has shown that mitigation strategies such as frequent student testing, contact tracing, and isolation of confirmed and suspected cases can detect early outbreaks, such mitigation strategies may have limited effectiveness if large outbreaks occur. A phased reopening is a practical intervention to limit early outbreaks, conserve institutional resources, and ensure proper safety protocols are in place before the return of additional students to campus. Methods: We develop dynamic compartmental transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the impact of a phased reopening and pre-arrival testing on minimizing outbreaks (measured by daily infections) and conserving university resources (measured by isolation bed capacity). We assume that one-third of the student population returns to campus each month as part of the phased reopening, and that pre-arrival testing removes 90% of infections at the semester start. We assume an on-campus population of N = 7500, an active COVID-19 prevalence of 2% at baseline, and that 60% of infected students require isolation for an average period of 11 days. We vary the reproductive number (Rt) between 1.25 and 4 to represent the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies throughout the semester, where Rt is constant or improving throughout the semester (ranging from 4 to 1.25). Results: Compared to pre-arrival testing only or neither intervention, phased reopening with pre-arrival testing reduced peak daily infections by 6% and 18% (Rt=1.25), 44% and 48% (Rt=2.5), 63% and 64% (Rt=4), and 72% and 74% (improving Rt), respectively, and reduced the proportion of on-campus beds needed for isolation from 10%-25% to 5%-9% across different values of Rt. Conclusion: Phased reopening with pre-arrival testing substantially reduces the peak number of daily infections throughout the semester and conserves university resources compared to strategies involving the simultaneous return of all students to campus. Phased reopenings allow institutions to improve safety protocols, adjust for factors that drive outbreaks, and if needed, preemptively move online before the return of additional students to campus, thus preventing unnecessary harm to students, institutional faculty and staff, and local communities.","Rennert, Lior; Kalbaugh, Corey; McMahan, Christopher; Shi, Lu; Colenda, Christopher C",,395,16

Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs’ Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of β2-β3 and 2-β5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5’ end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication. Here, we describe a counterintuitive mechanism of action of N-NTD based on molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic modelling of the experimental melting activity of N-NTD. This data impacts directly in the understanding of the way N protein acts in the cell and will guide future experiments.","Caruso, Ícaro P.; Sanches, Karoline; Da Poian, Andrea T.; Pinheiro, Anderson S.; Almeida, Fabio C.

This study assesses the rate and magnitude of this trend from breast-imaging standpoint. Materials and Methods: Participants undergoing breast-imaging, in whom isolated axillary-lymphadenopathy was detected were questioned regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to the ipsilateral arm. Patients’ and imaging characteristics were statistically compared. In order to perform a very short-term follow-up, twelve healthy vaccinated medical staff-members, underwent axillary-ultrasound shortly after the second dose, and follow-up. Results: Axillary-lymphadenopathy attributed to vaccination was found in 163 women undergoing breast-imaging, including BRCA-carriers. During the study, number of detected lymphadenopathies increased by 394% (p=0.00001) in comparison with previous two consecutive years. Mean cortical-thickness of abnormal lymph-nodes after second dose vaccination was 5±2 mm. Longer lymph-node diameter after second vaccination was noted (from 15±5 mm, to 18±6 mm, p=0.005). In the subgroup of medical staff members, following trends were observed: in patients with positive antibodies, lymph-node cortical-thickness was larger than patients with negative serology (p=0.03); lymph-node cortical-thickness decreased in 4-5 weeks follow-up (p=0.007). Lymphadenopathy was evident on mammography in only 49% of cases. Discussion: Vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy is an important phenomenon with great impact on breast-imaging clinic workload. Results suggest the appearance of cortical thickening shortly after both doses. Positive serology is associated with increased lymph-node cortical-thickness. In asymptomatic vaccinated women with ipsilateral axillary-lymphadenopathy as the only abnormal finding, radiological follow-up is probably not indicated. BRCA-carriers, although at higher risk for breast-cancer, should probably receive the same management as average-risk patients.","Faermann, Renata; Nissan, Noam; Neiman, Osnat Halshtok; Shalmon, Anat; Gotlieb, Michael; Yagil, Yael; Samoocha, David; Friedman, Eitan; Sklair-Levy, Miri",Acad Radiol,395,20

Recent studies showed multiple (anthropo)zoonotic transmission events between humans and mink on these farms. Mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from The Netherlands and Denmark contain multiple substitutions in the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Molecular modeling showed that these substitutions increase the mean binding energy, suggestive of potential adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the mink angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. These substitutions could possibly also impact human ACE2 binding affinity as well as humoral immune responses directed to the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in humans. We wish to highlight these observations to raise awareness and urge for the continued surveillance of mink (and other animal)-related infections.","Welkers, Matthijs R A; Han, Alvin X; Reusken, Chantal B E M; Eggink, Dirk",Virus Evol,395,20

Although a number of G and P genotypes have been identified in porcine GARs, few attempts have been made to study the molecular epidemiology of these viruses associated with diarrhea outbreaks within a farm over an extended period of time. Here, we investigated the molecular characteristics of GARs that caused four outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year. G and P genotyping of GARs detected at each outbreak demonstrated genetic diversity in this farm as follows: G9P[23] was detected at the first outbreak, G9P[13]/[22] and G9P[23] at the second, G3P[7] at the third, and G9P[23], G5P[13]/[22], and P[7] combined with an untypeable G genotype at the fourth. Sequence analysis of the detected GARs revealed that such genetic diversity could have resulted not only from the introduction of new GAR strains, but also from gene reassortment between GAR strains within the farm. Further, the GAR strain carrying the untypeable G genotype was shown to be a novel porcine GAR bearing a new G26 genotype, as confirmed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.","Miyazaki, Ayako; Kuga, Kazufumi; Suzuki, Tohru; Kohmoto, Mariko; Katsuda, Ken; Tsunemitsu, Hiroshi",Vet Res,395,19

Currently, the most validated diagnosis test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) is in shortage in most developing countries, which may increase infection rates and delay important preventive measures. The objective of this study was to predict the risk of positive COVID-19 diagnosis with machine learning, using as predictors only results from emergency care admission exams. We collected data from a sample of 235 adult patients from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 17 to 30 of March, 2020, of which 102 (43%) received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 from RT-PCR tests. Five machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained on a random sample of 70% of the patients, and performance was tested on new unseen data (30%). The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16). In conclusion, we found that targeted decisions for receiving COVID-19 tests using only routinely-collected data is a promising new area with the use of machine learning algorithms.","Batista, Andre Filipe de Moraes; Miraglia, Joao Luiz; Donato, Thiago Henrique Rizzi; Chiavegatto Filho, Alexandre Dias Porto",,395,32
