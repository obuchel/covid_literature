12578,Scenario-Based Verification of Uncertain MDPs,2020-04-17,"Although current literature about the “cure versus care” issue tends to promote a patient-centered approach, the disease-centered approach remains the prevailing model in practice. The perceived dichotomy between the two approaches has created a barrier that could make it difficult for medical students and physicians to integrate psychosocial aspects of patient care into the prevailing disease-based model. This article examines the influence of the formal and hidden curricula on the perception of these two approaches and finds that the hidden curriculum perpetuates the notion that “cure” and “care” based approaches are dichotomous despite significant changes in formal curricula that promote a more integrated approach. The authors argue that it is detrimental for clinicians to view the two approaches as oppositional rather than complementary and attempt to give recommendations on how the influence of the hidden curriculum can be reduced to get a both-cure-and-care-approach, rather than an either-cure-or-care-approach.","Choudhury, Divya; Nortjé, Nico",HEC Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439629/,635

34756,Modified Binary Tree in the Fast PIES for 2D Problems with Complex Shapes,2020-06-15,"With the increasing popularity of personal assistant systems, it is crucial to build a chatbot that can communicate with humans and assist them to complete different tasks. A fundamental problem that any chatbots need to address is how to rank candidate responses based on previous utterances in a multi-turn conversation. A previous utterance could be either a past input from the user or a past response from the chatbot. Intuitively, a correct response needs to match well with both past responses and past inputs, but in a different way. Moreover, the matching process should depend on not only the content of the utterances but also domain knowledge. Although various models have been proposed for response matching, few of them studied how to adapt the matching mechanism to utterance types and domain knowledge. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptive response matching network (ARM) to better model the matching relationship in multi-turn conversations. Specifically, the ARM model has separate response matching encoders to adapt to different matching patterns required by different utterance types. It also has a knowledge embedding component to inject domain-specific knowledge in the matching process. Experiments over two public data sets show that the proposed ARM model can significantly outperform the state of the art methods with much fewer parameters.","Wang, Disen; Fang, Hui",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298192/,635
34919,A Comparison of Generalized Stochastic Milevsky-Promislov Mortality Models with Continuous Non-Gaussian Filters,2020-05-23,"Feature selection is an important preprocessing step in pattern recognition. In this paper, we presented a new feature selection approach in two-class classification problems based on information theory, named minimum Distribution Similarity with Removed Redundancy (mDSRR). Different from the previous methods which use mutual information and greedy iteration with a loss function to rank the features, we rank features according to their distribution similarities in two classes measured by relative entropy, and then remove the high redundant features from the sorted feature subsets. Experimental results on datasets in varieties of fields with different classifiers highlight the value of mDSRR on selecting feature subsets, especially so for choosing small size feature subset. mDSRR is also proved to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in most cases. Besides, we observed that the mutual information may not be a good practice to select the initial feature in the methods with subsequent iterations.","Zhang, Yu; Lin, Zhuoyi; Kwoh, Chee Keong",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302551/,635
34920,From Population to Subject-Specific Reference Intervals,2020-05-23,"The Van der Waals (VdW) equation of state is a popular generalization of the law of ideal gases proposed time ago. In many situations, it is convenient to compute the characteristic curves of the VdW equation of state, called binodal and spinodal curves. Typically, they are constructed through data fitting from a collection of data points represented in the two-dimensional pressure-volume plane. However, the resulting models are still limited and can be further enhanced. In this paper, we propose to extend this polynomial approach by using a rational function as a fitting function. In particular, we consider a rational free-form Bézier curve, which provides a global approximation to the shape of the curve. This rational approach is more flexible than the polynomial one owing to some extra parameters, the weights. Unfortunately, data fitting becomes more difficult as these new parameters have also to be computed. In this paper we address this problem through a powerful nature-inspired swarm intelligence method for continuous optimization called the bat algorithm. Our experimental results show that the method can reconstruct the characteristic curves with very good accuracy.","Campuzano, Almudena; Iglesias, Andrés; Gálvez, Akemi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302552/,635

This fact creates the need for the design of logistic-train-fleet-oriented, distributed and scalability-robust control policies ensuring deadlock-free operations. The paper presents a solution to a multi-item and multi-depot vehicle routing and scheduling problem subject to fuzzy pick-up and delivery transportation time constraints. Since this type of problem can be treated as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem, a solution to it can be determined using both computer simulation and analytical ordered-fuzzy-numbers-driven calculations. The accuracy of both approaches is verified based on the results of multiple simulations. In this context, our contribution consists of proposing an alternative approach that allows avoiding time-consuming computer simulation-based calculations of logistic train fleet schedules.","Bocewicz, Grzegorz; Banaszak, Zbigniew; Smutnicki, Czeslaw; Rudnik, Katarzyna; Witczak, Marcin; Wójcik, Robert",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302809/,635

These receptors have an important role in the transduction of extracellular signals into intracellular sites in response to diverse stimuli. They enable fungi to coordinate cell function and metabolism, thereby promoting their survival and propagation, and sense certain fundamentally conserved elements, such as nutrients, pheromones, and stress, for adaptation to their niches, environmental stresses, and host environment, causing disease and pathogen virulence. This chapter highlights the role of GPCRs in fungi in coordinating cell function and metabolism. Fungal cells sense the molecular interactions between extracellular signals.

35017,Microtubule Biomechanics and the Effect of Degradation of Elastic Moduli,2020-05-25,"A multitude of medical products are being developed and produced as part of efforts to tackle COVID-19. They are varied in nature and range from test kits to tracing apps, protective equipment, ventilators, medicines and, of course, vaccines. The design, testing and manufacture of many of these products differs from production in normal times due to the urgency of the situation and the rapid increase in demand created by the pandemic. This article considers the legal issues arising as a result of the production of emergency products, particularly from a products liability perspective. To what extent do existing concepts under the European Product Liability Directive, such as defect, causation and the various defences, permit the pandemic to be taken into account when a Court is considering issues of liability? What is the impact on liability of the modified regulatory regime? In light of that discussion, the case for alternative responses is examined from a comparative and European perspective, including the issue of Government indemnities for the manufacturers of products, legal exemptions from liability and alternative no-fault compensation schemes.","FAIRGRIEVE, Duncan; FELDSCHREIBER, Peter; HOWELLS, Geraint; PILGERSTORFER, Marcus",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302949/,635
35083,Multilevel Monte Carlo with Improved Correlation for Kinetic Equations in the Diffusive Scaling,2020-05-25,"In the face of endless cyberattacks, many researchers have proposed machine learning-based network anomaly detection technologies. Traditional statistical features of network flows are manually extracted and rely heavily on expert knowledge, while classifiers based on statistical features have a high false-positive rate. The communications between different hosts forms graphs, which contain a large number of latent features. By combining statistical features with these latent features, we can train better machine learning classifiers. Therefore, we propose a novel network anomaly detection method that can use latent features in graphs and reduce the false positive rate of anomaly detection. We convert network traffic into first-order and second-order graph. The first-order graph learns the latent features from the perspective of a single host, and the second-order graph learns the latent features from a global perspective. This feature extraction process does not require manual participation or expert knowledge. We use these features to train machine learning algorithm classifiers for detecting network anomalies. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results show that our approach allows for better learning of latent features and improved accuracy of anomaly detection. In addition, our method has the ability to detect unknown attacks.","Xiao, Qingsai; Liu, Jian; Wang, Quiyun; Jiang, Zhengwei; Wang, Xuren; Yao, Yepeng",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303711/,635
36275,The Program Generation in the Software Package QextNewEdition,2020-06-06,"INTRODUCTION: Influenza viruses specifically, A and B mainly contribute to seasonal outbreaks that occur globally. However, due to limited diagnostics for influenza there is little data regarding clinical outcomes of patients with H1N1 pneumonia in our region. Our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with H1N1 pneumonia at a tertiary care facility in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients admitted with influenza pneumonia from November 2017 to February 2018 at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Patient characteristics were compared between influenza A H1N1 and other types of influenza using multivariable logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis for factors associated with mortality in H1N1 Pneumonia was performed. RESULTS: Out of 497 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 172 fulfilled the criteria for Influenza like illness (ILI). 88 patients had PCR confirmed Influenza pneumonia of whom n = 57 (65%) had Influenza A H1N1. The mean age of patients 53.5 years (SD: 17.3) and 60% were male. The overall mortality from Influenza in this study was 15.9% (n = 14); out of these 11 (78.5%) had Influenza A H1N1. Multivariable analysis showed that the increase in length of hospital admission was significantly associated with H1N1 Influenza A infection (OR: 1.47 CI: 1.2–1.8). Factors associated with mortality showed that presence of ARDS, Septic shock and multi-organ failure was highly significantly associated with death (p-value < 0.001) along with deranged liver function tests (p-value 0.01) and presence of nosocomial infection (p-value 0.027). CONCLUSION: Influenza A H1N1 is associated with greater length of stay compared with infection due to other types of Influenza and mortality in H1N1 Pneumonia was found to be associated with presence of nosocomial infection among several other factors which may have implications given higher rates in a low-middle income country.","Hussain, Mujahid; Nasir, Nosheen; Irfan, Muhammad; Hasan, Zahra",Pneumonia (Nathan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7335362/,635

The present article brings out an innovative chamber, which is used for collection of throat, or nasal swabs/samples for diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected persons. The chamber, called COVid SAmple Collection Kiosk (COVSACK), eliminates the transmission of the deadly virus to the health care personnel while collecting the sample. The kiosk is designed based on CFD simulations for effective spread of disinfectant in fine droplet form, built with a lightweight composite that is sustainable in extreme weather conditions and the kiosk can be easily sanitized within 3 min after sample collection. The chamber is first positioned in ESI Hospital, Hyderabad, and other hospitals and diagnostics centres across India, extensively being used for testing the COVID-19 patients at a faster rate, with a drastic reduction in use of personal protection equipment (PPE).

36280,Variable Ordering Selection for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition with Artificial Neural Networks,2020-06-06,"Loss of forest cover, rise in human populations and fragmentation of habitats leads to decline in biodiversity and extinction of large mammals globally. Elephants, being the largest of terrestrial mammals, symbolize global conservation programs and co-occur with humans within multiple-use landscapes of Asia and Africa. Within such shared landscapes, poaching, habitat loss and extent of human–elephant conflicts (HEC) affect survival and conservation of elephants. HEC are severe in South Asia with increasing attacks on humans, crop depredation and property damage. Such incidents reduce societal tolerance towards elephants and increase the risk of retaliation by local communities. We analyzed a 2-year dataset on crop depredation by Asian elephants (N = 380) events in North Bengal (eastern India). We also explored the effect of landscape, anthropogenic factors (area of forest, agriculture, distance to protected area, area of human settlements, riverine patches and human density) on the spatial occurrence of such incidents.Crop depredation showed a distinct nocturnal pattern (22.00–06:00) and majority of the incidents were recorded in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Results of our spatial analysis suggest that crop depredation increased with an increase in the area of forest patches, agriculture, presence of riverine patches and human density. Probability of crop depredation further increased with decreasing distance from protected areas. Villages within 1.5 km of a forest patch were most affected. Crop raiding incidents suggest a deviation from the “high-risk high-gain male biased” foraging behavior and involved proportionately more mixed groups (57%) than lone bulls (43%). Demographic data suggest that mixed groups comprised an average of 23 individuals with adult and sub adult females, bulls and calves. Crop depredation and fatal elephant attacks on humans were spatially clustered with eastern, central and western parts of North Bengal identified as hotspots of HEC. Our results will help to prioritize mitigation measures such as prohibition of alcohol production within villages, improving condition of riverine patches, changing crop composition, fencing agriculture fields, implement early warning systems around protected areas and training local people on how to prevent conflicts.","Naha, Dipanjan; Dash, Suraj Kumar; Chettri, Abhisek; Roy, Akashdeep; Sathyakumar, Sambandam",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7335499/,635
36284,Classification of Linear Codes by Extending Their Residuals,2020-06-06,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To better understand the impact of obesity and cardiovascular diseases on influenza A infection. RECENT FINDINGS: This infection could have detrimental outcomes in obese patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as an increased risk, length of hospitalization, disease severity, morbidity, and mortality. Nevertheless, there also might be some cardioprotective benefits associated with influenza vaccination, such as a reduced mortality, hospitalization, and acute coronary syndromes, in patients with coronary heart disease and/or heart failure. SUMMARY: Obesity negatively impacts immune function and host defense. Recent studies report obesity to be an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following infection. Obese patients might need special considerations in the treatment; however, there is not enough evidence to fully comprehend the mechanisms behind the reduced immunocompetence when influenza A infection occurs. Future studies should focus on special consideration treatments when the patients have not been vaccinated and have cardiovascular diseases.","Gutiérrez-Spillari, Lucia; Palma M., Geovani; Aceituno-Melgar, Jorge",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7335730/,635

The virus dissociates ferrous ion from the porphyrin ring of heme of haemoglobin—thus hampering the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lung and tissue. The toxic effect of ferrous (Fe(2+)) ions and carbon dioxide causes lung damage giving rise to severe respiratory distress and an often observed clotting disorder. Serum ferritin level is increased along with the rise of serum LDH, d-dimer, serum IL-6 and cardiac troponin. Associated leukocytosis, occasional lymphocytopenia and radiological changes of the lung are the pathological hallmarks of the disease.

This is because the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis have themselves become overlaid or layered-upon a pre-existing set of concerns regarding the performance, efficiency and capacity of democratic political structures. The aim of this article is to try and understand and warn against what might be termed a rather odd form of cross-contamination whereby the cynicism, negativity and frustration concerning politicians, political processes and political institutions that existed before the coronavirus outbreak is allowed to direct, define and automatically devalue how democratic structures are subsequently judged in terms of how they responded to the challenge.

But how to extract keyphrases precisely and effectively is still a challenge. The mainstream methods are supervised learning methods and graph-based methods. Generally, the effects of supervised methods are better than unsupervised methods. However, there are many problems in supervised methods such as the difficulty in obtaining training data, the cost of labeling and the limitation of the classification function trained by training data. In recent years, the development of the graph-based method has made great progress and its performance of extraction is getting closer and closer to the supervised method, so the graph-based method of keyphrase extraction has got a wide concern from researchers. In this paper, we propose a new model that applies the three-way decision theory to graph-based keyphrase extraction model. In our model, we propose algorithms dividing the set of candidate phrases into the positive domain, the boundary domain and the negative domain depending on graph-based attributes, and combining candidate phrases in the positive domain and the boundary domain qualified by graph-based attributes and non- graph-based attributes to get keyphrases.

However, even though collecting BT data is subject to random noise and may result in substantial measurement errors, there is an absence of rigorous procedures for validating the quality of the inferred BT social networks. This paper presents a methodology for inferring and validating BT-based social networks based on parameter optimization algorithm and social network analysis (SNA). The algorithm performs edge inference in a brute-force search over a given BT data set, for deriving optimal BT social networks by validating them with predefined ground truth (GT) networks. The algorithm seeks to optimize a set of parameters, predefined considering some reliability challenges associated to the BT technology itself. The outcomes show that optimizing the parameters can reduce the number of BT data false positives or generate BT networks with the minimum amount of BT data observations. The subsequent SNA shows that the inferred BT social networks are unable to reproduce some network characteristics present in the corresponding GT networks. Finally, the generalizability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying the algorithm on external BT data sets, while obtaining comparable results.","Simoski, Bojan; Klein, Michel C.A.; Araújo, Eric Fernandes de Mello; van Halteren, Aart T.; van Woudenberg, Thabo J.; Bevelander, Kirsten E.; Buijzen, Moniek; Bal, Henri",Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00779-020-01435-x.pdf,635

Gender resentment reduces trust in female political leaders and thus decreases compliance with government policy and recommendations. Using data from SafeGraph and the 2016 American National Election Study, we demonstrate that the effect of stay-at-home policies on social distancing is reduced when gender resentment increases in states with female leaders.

38087,Software Verification with PDR: An Implementation of the State of the Art,2020-03-13,"With increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, multimorbid patients have become commonplace in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (neuro-ICU), offering unique management challenges. By reducing physiological reserve and interacting with one another, chronic comorbidities pose a greatly enhanced risk of major postoperative medical complications, especially cardiopulmonary complications, which ultimately exert a negative impact on neurosurgical outcomes. These premises underscore the importance of perioperative optimization, in turn requiring a thorough preoperative risk stratification, a basic understanding of a multimorbid patient’s deranged physiology and a proper appreciation of the potential of surgery, anesthesia and neurocritical care interventions to exacerbate comorbid pathophysiologies. This knowledge enables neurosurgeons, neuroanesthesiologists and neurointensivists to function with a heightened level of vigilance in the care of these high-risk patients and can inform the perioperative neuro-ICU management with individualized strategies able to minimize the risk of untoward outcomes. This review highlights potential pitfalls in the intra- and postoperative neuro-ICU period, describes common preoperative risk stratification tools and discusses tailored perioperative ICU management strategies in multimorbid neurosurgical patients, with a special focus on approaches geared toward the minimization of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and unplanned reintubation.","Algahtani, Rami; Merenda, Amedeo",Neurocritical Care,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12028-020-01072-5.pdf,635

38090,Partial Order Reduction for Deep Bug Finding in Synchronous Hardware,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: Infant cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass results in decreased circulating alkaline phosphatase that is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. Bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase infusion represents a novel therapy for post-cardiac surgery organ injury. However, the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and bovine-intestinal alkaline phosphatase infusion on tissue-level alkaline phosphatase activity/expression are unknown. METHODS: Infant pigs (n = 20) underwent cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest followed by four hours of intensive care. Seven control animals underwent mechanical ventilation only. Cardiopulmonary bypass/deep hypothermic circulatory arrest animals were given escalating doses of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase infusion (0-25 U/kg/hr.; n = 5/dose). Kidney, liver, ileum, jejunum, colon, heart and lung were collected for measurement of tissue alkaline phosphatase activity and mRNA. RESULTS: Tissue alkaline phosphatase activity varied significantly across organs with the highest levels found in the kidney and small intestine. Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest resulted in decreased kidney alkaline phosphatase activity and increased lung alkaline phosphatase activity, with no significant changes in the other organs. Alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression was increased in both the lung and the ileum. The highest dose of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase resulted in increased kidney and liver tissue alkaline phosphatase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in alkaline phosphatase activity after cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase delivery are tissue specific. Kidneys, lung, and ileal alkaline phosphatase appear most affected by cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and further research is warranted to determine the mechanism and biologic importance of these changes.","Khailova, Ludmila; Robison, Justin; Jaggers, James; Ing, Richard; Lawson, Scott; Treece, Amy; Soranno, Danielle; Osorio Lujan, Suzanne; Davidson, Jesse A.",J Inflamm (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7422466/,635
38091,Safe Decomposition of Startup Requirements: Verification and Synthesis,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus-associated encephalopathy (IAE) can lead to neurological sequela and mortality among children. Therefore, instant recognition and therapeutic intervention for IAE are crucial. In some clinical subtypes of IAE, steroid pulse therapy might be beneficial, especially when it is administered in the early phase. However, early identification of patients who may benefit from steroid pulse therapy is sometimes difficult. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of early steroid pulse therapy among children with IAE. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we used a national database that covers half of the acute care inpatients across Japan to identify inpatients aged ≤ 18 years with a diagnosis of IAE between July 2010 and March 2017. Unfavorable outcome was defined as a composite outcome of sequela including Japan Coma Scale ≥ 10 at discharge, requiring tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, enteral tube feeding, rehabilitation at discharge, or in-hospital death. Propensity score matching was performed to compare unfavorable outcome and in-hospital mortality between patients with and without steroid pulse therapy within 2 days of admission. RESULTS: Among 692 patients included in the study, the mean age was 5.8 years, and 55.8% were male. The overall in-hospital mortality was 1.3%, and the proportion of the unfavorable outcome was 15.0%. We observed no significant difference in the unfavorable outcome between matched patients (168 patients in each group) with and without early steroid pulse therapy (13.7% vs 8.3%; P = 0.16) or in-hospital mortality (0.6% vs 1.2%; P = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe the effectiveness of early steroid pulse therapy on patient outcomes among children with IAE in our study population including all clinical subtypes of IAE. Further studies considering severity of illness are warranted to determine whether steroid pulse therapy is beneficial, especially for specific clinical subtypes of IAE.","Hatachi, Takeshi; Michihata, Nobuaki; Takeuchi, Muneyuki; Matsui, Hiroki; Fushimi, Kiyohide; Yasunaga, Hideo",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7422675/,635
38093,Multi-agent Safety Verification Using Symmetry Transformations,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: The specific role of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene polymorphisms in emotional support seeking, related to social norms and culturally normative behavior, has been discussed in several studies. Evidence on the association between aggression and OXTR polymorphisms has also been reported. The goal of the current study was to analyze the effect of the OXTR rs53576 polymorphism, prenatal testosterone effect (second-to-fourth digit ratio, or 2D:4D), and culture on aggression assessed with the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ). METHODS: The data were collected in Russia and Tanzania and included seven ethnic groups of European, Asian, and African origin. The total sample included 1705 adults (837 males, 868 females). All the subjects were evaluated with the BPAQ. As a measure of prenatal androgenization, the second and fourth digits were measured directly from hand, and the digit ratios were calculated. All the participants provided buccal samples, from which genomic DNA was extracted, and the OXTR gene rs53576 polymorphism was genotyped. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0; the alpha level for all analyses was set at 0.05. RESULTS: The ethnic group factor was the most significant predictor of ratings on BPAQ (medium effect size for physical aggression, anger and hostility scales, and low for verbal aggression). To study the effect of sex, the OXTR polymorphism, and prenatal androgenization, we conducted the z-score transformation for BPAQ scales and 2D:4D for each ethnic group and pooled these data into new z-score variables. According to the GLM analysis after leveling the effects of culture (z-transformation), all four scales of BPAQ demonstrated association with sex (main effects), with men scoring higher on physical and verbal aggression and women scoring higher on anger and hostility. Anger and hostility scales were also associated with OXTR polymorphism and 2D:4D of the right hand. The lowest levels of anger and hostility were observed in individuals with the AA genotype, especially in men. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that both oxytocin (OXTR gene polymorphism) and fetal testosterone (2D:4D) may significantly affect emotional (anger) and cognitive (hostility) aggression in humans, given the leveling the role of culture.","Butovskaya, Marina; Rostovtseva, Victoria; Butovskaya, Polina; Burkova, Valentina; Dronova, Daria; Filatova, Vasilisa; Sukhodolskaya, Eugenia; Vasiliev, Vasiliy; Mesa, Tania; Rosa, Araceli; Lazebny, Oleg",J Physiol Anthropol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427763/,635

38102,Automated Verification of Parallel Nested DFS,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: The amphibian, non-vascular, gametophyte-dominant, bio-indicator class, bryophytes; with their wide ranges of habitat have attained importance due to their promising medicinal attributions and therapeutic role; mostly aided by presence of aromatic bibenzyl and bisbybenzyl class of compounds. Bibenzyls are steroidal ethane derivatives, resembling the structural moiety of bioactive dihydro-stilbenoids or iso-quinoline alkaloids. These stress triggered secondary metabolites are the by-products of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Different classes of bryophytes (Bryophyta, Marchantiophyta and Anthocerotophyta) possess different subtypes of bibenzyls and dimeric bisbibenzyls. Among the liverwort, hornwort and mosses, former one is mostly enriched with bibenzyl type constituents as per the extensive study conducted for phytochemical deposit. Considering macrocyclic and acyclic group of bibenzyls and bisbybenzyls, generally marchantin type compounds are reported vividly for significant biological activity that includes neuro-nephro-cardio-protection besides anti-allergic, anti-microbial, anti-apoptotic and cytotoxic activities studied on in-vitro and in-vivo models or on cell lines. RESULT: The critical analysis of reported chemical and pharmaceutical attributions of bibenzyls and bis-bibenzyls yielded detailed report on this compound class along with their application, mode of action, natural source, techniques of synthesis, extraction procedure, isolation and characterization. Further, the structure activity relationship studies and bioactivity of bibenzyls derived from non-bryophytic origin were also summarized. CONCLUSION: This review encompasses prospective biological application of botanical reservoir of this primarily ignored, primeval land plant group where recent technical advances has paved the way for qualitative and quantitative isolation and estimation of novel compounds as well as marker components to study their impact on environment, as bio-control agents and as key leads in future drug designing.

38103,Automated and Sound Synthesis of Lyapunov Functions with SMT Solvers,2020-03-13,"The aim of this study was to evaluate, through qPCR, the prevalence of parasitemia in sick kennel dogs naturally infected by canine leishmaniasis. An evaluation of daily changes of the parasitic load in peripheral blood was also performed. A comprehensive clinical examination and the collection of several samples (blood, lymph node, skin, and conjunctiva) were performed in 140 dogs living in an endemic area. Among these, only the dogs with clinically evident leishmaniasis were enrolled (39/140; 27.9%). Twelve (30.8%) out of 39 showed parasitemia, with a low load (median: 4 Leishmania/ml) despite a high lymph node parasite load (median: 4000 Leishmania/ml) and high IFAT titers (≥ 1:640). Seven sick dogs were sampled every 4 h for 6 times during a 24-h period, in order to obtain light- and dark-span samples. Only one (14.3%) out of the seven serial sampled dogs showed Leishmania DNA in the peripheral blood in two samples (2/42; 4.8%). Surprisingly, Leishmania DNA was also detected in the peripheral blood of asymptomatic dogs, negative to both serology and PCR performed on samples other than blood (6/101; 5.9%). The present study confirms that in canine leishmaniasis parasitemia is uncommon and even transitory. Even if recommended, microscopic examination is confirmed as a low sensitivity method with a lower diagnostic utility in canine leishmaniasis than qPCR. Moreover, circulating Leishmania DNA can be found even in healthy dogs. This finding is important in clinical practice because in endemic areas it suggests a transfusion risk and a possible transmission to the vector.","Di Pietro, Simona; Crinò, Chiara; Falcone, Annastella; Crupi, Rosalia; Francaviglia, Francesco; Vitale, Fabrizio; Giudice, Elisabetta",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429123/,635

Towards this objective, we study and analyze the temporal growth pattern of COVID-19 infection and death counts in various states of India. Our analysis up to August 4, 2020, shows that several states (namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal) have reached [Formula: see text] power-law growth, while Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh exhibit linear growth. Delhi has reached [Formula: see text] phase and may flatten in the coming days. However, some states have deviated from the universal pattern of the epidemic curve. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan show a gradual rise in the power-law regime, which is not the usual trend. Also, Bihar, Karnataka, and Kerala are exhibiting a second wave. In addition, we report that initially, the death counts show similar behavior as the infection counts. Later, however, the death growth rate declines as compared to the infection growth due to better handling of critical cases and increased immunity of the population. These observations indicate that except Delhi, most of the Indian states are far from flattening their epidemic curves.","Asad, Ali; Srivastava, Siddharth; Verma, Mahendra K.",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474332/,635

Operators have discovered the advantages of virtualization technology in terms of flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and availability. Applications range from network and embedded devices to big data centers and cloud computing. Trusted Computing technology can be employed to protect the integrity of a system by leveraging a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and remote attestation. Existing research on remote attestation of virtualized environments differs in scalability, resource consumption, and provided security guarantees. While some approaches scale at large and use the TPM efficiently, they are way more intrusive, requiring changes to hypervisor and Virtual Machine (VMs). Others render entirely impractical with an increasing number of VMs, caused by the TPM being the bottleneck. In this paper we analyze existing work on remote attestation for virtualized environments and discuss benefits as well as shortcomings. We identify an approach that provides adequate security and is easy to implement but is prone to relay attacks. We improve that approach by developing countermeasures, while maintaining existing security guarantees. Our contribution requires only minimal changes to the hypervisor system, keeping existing attestation protocols intact. We implement and evaluate on production-grade hardware, and compare our improved attestation approach with the most sophisticated alternative approach. With performance measurements and further evaluations we show that our solution outperforms the other approach for a small number of VMs, as used in network devices and embedded systems.","Eckel, Michael; Fuchs, Andreas; Repp, Jürgen; Springer, Markus",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978993/,635

In this chapter, a variety of the prevention tools available to, and utilised by, gay men are reviewed. The long-standing policy of condom use is discussed, and the potential shortcomings of a prevention policy based exclusively on condom use are outlined. This chapter also considers alternative prevention approaches deployed by some gay men, such as ‘serosorting’ and strategic sexual positioning. The importance of both HIV and STI testing as part of effective HIV prevention is illustrated. Furthermore, key developments in HIV prevention, such as post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment as prevention, are examined. Emerging prevention approaches, such as the use of microbicides and male circumcision, as well as the quest for an HIV vaccine are outlined. In this chapter, it is argued that all of these approaches have merits, that none is without its shortcomings and, therefore, that ‘combination prevention’ is key to eliminating HIV transmissions.","Jaspal, Rusi; Bayley, Jake",HIV and Gay Men,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981533/,635

Second, we aim to understand the conditions which determine whether governments are responsive to public opinion on defence and foreign affairs issues. Our evidence comes from an unrivalled database of several hundred public opinion surveys, conducted over eight decades, which have gauged opinion on a huge array of issues. In this concluding chapter we revisit these questions and discuss the driving factors of public opinion.","Chubb, Danielle; McAllister, Ian","Australian Public Opinion, Defence and Foreign Policy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981539/,635

These tempos are emotionally engaging and contagious. They can signify complications and entanglements and open up possibilities of regressive slides. The classical conceptualization refers to the possibility that domestic regression can link up with external surroundings and draw in its major actors, thereby escalating the hostilities between them. For Thucydides, the circumstances of war were one “grand movement”—kinesis megiste.

It refers to different mechanisms highlighted throughout the book. The focus is on interim measures. The subject matters discussed concern obstacles to compliance and state pressure to control the practices developed by different adjudicators, protection gaps and suggested measures to enhance the protective potential of interim measures. Two of those suggested measures in the preceding contributions are to increase specificity and to make sure there is follow-up. This chapter reflects on these and then zooms in on the third measure suggested: increasing the normative legitimacy of interim measures. Normative legitimacy is important for social legitimacy and, thereby, for the protective potential of interim measures. While the criticisms expressed by states often serve merely as excuses for non-compliance, rather than constitute real concerns, it is nonetheless important to discuss how adjudicators can enhance the normative legitimacy of their decisions on interim measures. This chapter brings together aspects of normative legitimacy suggested by the various authors in the previous chapters. Legitimacy aspects discussed are the purpose of interim measures, the authority of adjudicators to take them and the legal status of interim measures, the fairness of the decision-making, avoiding prejudgment, ensuring transparency, sufficiency of the evidence and staying within the scope.","Rieter, Eva",Urgency and Human Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981557/,635

By referring to selected acute/chronic injury-induced disorders including traumatic brain injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney and liver injury, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic hepatitis (→ cirrhosis), the emerging pathogenetic role of DAMPs and suppressing DAMPs (SAMPs) is outlined by quoting recently published reports from the literature. In particular, the impact of DAMPs on promotion of organ-specific hyperinflammation, chronic nonresolving inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as the potential properties of SAMPs in resolving organ-specific inflammation are highlighted. The chapter ends up with the discussion on DAMPs and SAMPs as future essential diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and therapeutics. For example, in patients with organ-specific injuries, the continuous determination of a “DAMPs/SAMPs ratio” may provide individual information about the severity of the injury, their possible remote effects, and early signs of either controlled healing or uncontrolled disease-causing processes. Finally, the therapeutic imperative is discussed, interpreted as a blockade/elimination of DAMPs and/or administration of SAMPs to prevent an injury-induced hyperinflammatory state (e.g., acute organ failure) or chronic nonresolving inflammatory state (e.g., chronic organ failure).","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981564/,635

Scientific approaches like LCA presents obstacles and opportunities to non-specialists, including designers. The self-preservation instinct is typically hardwired into each individual. This genetic predisposition to avoid certain risks that loom large in our consciousness both safeguards the continuation of our species and blinds us to less visible and possibly much greater threats. Media outlets play to the natural human reliance on heuristics and implicit biases. The confusion a “post-fact” world creates serves to maintain the status quo by perpetually calling into question well-established facts and stalling fruitful debate. Spectacular headlines provoke irrational fears that distract from other, more statistically likely threats. Rhetorical techniques frame facts. Denialism is intended to create paralysis. More information is not necessarily better, if it is derived from sources that only confirm sociopolitical biases rather than challenging them. It is important to acknowledge contextual headwinds operating at the largest scales in society before blithely applying a targeted set of analytical techniques to measure environmental impacts in a design project. Before presenting the “how-to” of integrating a data-driven approach to sustainable design decisions, however, it is important to recognize that facts in one domain are not always enough to persuade a decision-maker. Attributional LCA may improve process-based decisions without requiring wholesale recanting of firmly held world views.

Fear of SARS-CoV-2 and the countermeasures introduced across the country have left much of the economy in tatters and produced well over 40 million newly unemployed. Many existences, difficult even before this global crisis, have become untenable. Pictures of long lines in front of food banks made international headlines. America, one of the richest societies in the world, is in deep trouble. With economic pain comes civil unrest. Demonstrations, often violent, are paralysing cities across the nation. Triggered by the death of George Floyd in a police incident on the streets of Minneapolis, citizens are expressing deep frustration with not only unequal treatment by law enforcement but also the deteriorating socio-economic situation of many communities. The income gap in America is one of the most pronounced among OECD nations; areas like Los Angeles are experiencing unprecedented numbers of homeless people; staggering differences in the quality of health care are having a measurable impact on the life expectancy of citizens; and spending cuts for public education are coming under judicial scrutiny and putting courts at loggerheads with the executive and legislative branches of government in states like Kansas or Kentucky. This contribution describes the constitutional parameters that shape these dramatic developments and define economic existence in the United States of America. It highlights the very limited protection provided for the essential core of human life (food, water, housing and health care), education or other socio-economic entitlements under both the federal and state constitutions, and contrasts these findings with the elaborate system of statutory social welfare programs that many Americans believe should determine the country’s identity but are today under siege in light of budgetary constraints and an increasingly partisan political landscape. The challenges of allocating dwindling public resources to competing needs, problems created by the internal migration of citizens seeking a better future in other parts of the country, tensions caused by significant economic differences between the component parts of a federal system, and America’s strained relationship with the international community and global approaches to poverty and development are related themes that feature in this analysis. America, so the conclusion, lacks constitutional consensus about what society must provide in terms of individual socio-economic security. Leaving this decision to the ebb and flow of political majorities is likely to further increase wealth disparity, put considerable pressure on the country’s democratic institutions, waste valuable human potential and risk alienating citizens that have lost trust in the ability of the system to provide sufficient opportunity for personal development.","Fedtke, Jörg",The Fight Against Poverty and the Right to Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981580/,635

However, the rapid spread of COVID-19 in almost all the major cities has raised several questions on the efficacy of urban densification. The objective of this paper is to understand this dynamic interplay between crowding and virus incidence. The research seeks to explain the impact of crowding parameters (population, net and gross density, street crowding, indoor crowding) on the spread of the contagion, together with the confounding explanatory variables (government policies, socioeconomic and environmental characteristics). The study is based on two metropolitan cities of India, namely Mumbai and Bengaluru, which are the hotspots of the infection. At a time when there is a huge debate of compact cities versus sprawling cities, the results are favorable towards densification as the study reveals that other crowding variables have a much higher correlation with the infection transmission than density. In fact, density follows a sub-linear relationship with transmission rate and after a threshold density;the transmission rate is almost independent of the population density. The findings show that contrary to popular belief, dense cities are resilient to pandemics.","Panda, Sudha Ray S. S.",Journal of Urban Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jum.2021.08.002,635

165265,The cost of harvesting process in teak community forest during the covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates a link between iron metabolism and COVID-19 clinical progression, supporting the use of iron and inflammatory parameters as relevant biomarkers to predict patients' outcomes. METHODS: We evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with variable clinical pictures, from September to November 2020. Of these, 127 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 176 tested negative. Iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission and, in a subgroup of patients, throughout hospitalization. Demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were assigned into 5 groups according to disease severity. RESULTS: Serum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. Conversely, the levels of interleukin(IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were increased in COVID-19-positive patients. The lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. Iron levels negatively correlated with IL-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis. Serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were higher in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients but did not correlate with disease severity. Longitudinal determinations of iron and ferritin made in a subgroup of patients (n=23) revealed highly variable results. CONCLUSIONS: Serum iron is the simplest laboratory test to be implemented as a predictor of disease progression in hospitalized acute COVID-19-positive patients. Variation of ferritin with time should be revisited in larger cohorts.","Moreira, A. C.; Teles, M. J.; Silva, T.; Bento, C. M.; Alves, I. S.; Pereira, L. C.; Guimaraes, J.

To perform an interim analysis of epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 related to contacts and secondary cases of infection in the Russian Federation. Materials and methods. We analyzed 190,856 primary COVID-19 cases and 146,996 people who had been in contact with them. We used some data of monitoring performed by the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing in January–June 2020. We characterized the foci of infection and people who had contacts with primary COVID-19 cases and secondary cases of infection. Results. Just over half (50.02%) of study participants who had contacts with COVID-19 contacted with primary patients with mild disease, whereas 45.40% of individuals contacted with patients with moderate disease and 4.58% of individuals had contacts with patients with severe disease. Patients with mild COVID-19 interacted with more people, which resulted in a greater number of secondary cases of infection. The highest proportion of both primary COVID-19 patients and people who had contact with COVID- 19 was observed in the age group of 41–64 years (44.42% and 44.51%, respectively). Approximately one third of COVID-19 patients and people who had contact with COVID-19 were 18 to 40 years old (30.20% and 34.21% respectively). The proportions of children aged 0–6 years and 7–17 years among COVID-19 patients were 2.70% and 4.02%, respectively;the same proportions among those who had contact with COVID-19 cases were 1.94 and 3.13%, respectively. Household contacts were the most common ways of COVID-19 transmission in all age groups. Patients aged between 40 and 64 years played the most significant role in the transmission of this infection in different foci. Individuals from this age group comprised 42.02% of patients infected in social institutions, 43.40% of those who had household contacts, and 47.70% of those infected at work. Conclusion. Patients with mild and moderate disease aged 18 to 64 years had the highest number of contacts and, therefore, caused the highest number of secondary cases of infection. Household contacts played the most important role in COVID-19 transmission in all age groups. Among people aged 18 to 64 years, COVID-19 transmission at work was also important. In all foci of infection, the majority of patients were in the age group of 40–64 years. Our findings can be used to optimize the preventive measures for COVID-19. © 2021, Dynasty Publishing House.

Our objective was to determine barriers for young adults with CHD actively missing from cardiac care and to re-engage them in care. Methods: Retrospective single-center cohort study of cardiology clinic patients ages 15-21 years with CHD between 2012-2019 for patients actively missing from care (>12 months beyond requested clinic follow-up). We conducted prospective interviews, offered clinic scheduling information and recorded cardiac follow-up. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariable, and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of 1053 CHD patients, 33% (n=349) were actively missing. Of those missing, 58% were male and median age was 17 yrs (IQR 16-19). Forty-six percent were Non-Hispanic White, 33% Hispanic, and 9% Black. Moderately complex CHD was in 71%, and 62% had private insurance. Patients with simple CHD, older age at last encounter (18-21), and scheduled follow-up >12 months from last encounter were more likely to be actively missing. Interviews were completed by 125 patients/parents (36%). Lack of cardiac care was reported in 52%, and common barriers included: insurance (33%), appointment scheduling (26%), and unknown ACHD center care (15%). Roughly half (55%) accepted appointment information, yet only 3% successfully returned. Conclusions: Many patients require assistance beyond CHD knowledge to maintain and re-engage in care. Future interventions should include scheduling assistance, focused insurance maintenance, understanding where to obtain ACHD care, and educating on need for lifelong care.","Moore, J. A.; Sheth, S.

168341,"Covid-19 is impact to air quality transformation based on Landsat: a case from Makassar City, Indonesia",2021,"The perception of the pass-through of oil price shocks on the real and financial spheres has undergone considerable evolution with the emergence of a literature devoted to the sources of oil price fluctuations. This perception is also found to evolve over time depending on market expectations, structural changes or crises. Focusing on the specific case of the US, this paper investigates the time-varying effects of oil price shocks on financial intermediation (credit market) and inflation as a transmission channel. Monthly data are used for a period that encompasses the recent Covid-19 pandemic crisis. Prior to the construction of a time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression stochastic volatility (TVP-SVAR-SV), a structural VAR (SVAR) model is estimated to disentangle oil price shocks in four shocks: oil supply, aggregate demand, domestic demand and oil-specific demand shocks. The results underscore the increasing response of financial intermediation to oil supply, aggregate demand and oil specific demand shocks since the shale revolution. In addition, the response of credit markets to aggregate demand shocks during the covid-19 pandemic is different from that observed during the subprime crisis. It appears also that the response of inflation influence the reaction of the credit market to aggregate and domestic demand shocks.","Boufateh, Talel Saadaoui Zied",Energy Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105535,635

However, gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients suggests that the gut may present another viral target organ. Disease development and severity is dependent on viral interaction with two cell surface human proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and on antiviral response which may lead to systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Understanding the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pathology of the disease will be greatly enhanced by the development of appropriate animal models. Laboratory mice have been the mainstay of therapeutic and vaccine development, however, the virus does not grow in wild type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ACE2. As there are known differences between immune response in laboratory mice and humans we evaluated the response of human gut developed as xenografts and host mouse gut following systemic LPS injections as a hyperinflammation model system. The orthologous gene expression levels in the mouse and human gut were highly correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient: 0.28–0.76) and gene set enrichment analysis of significantly upregulated human and mouse genes revealed that a number of inflammatory and immune response pathways are commonly regulated in the two species. However, species differences were also observed, most importantly, in the inflamed human gut but not in the mouse gut, there was clear upregulation of mRNAs coding for TMPRSS2, ADAM17 and for RIG-I-like receptors, which are involved in the recognition of viruses and in antiviral innate immune response. Moreover, using species-specific immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated the expression and localization of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins, which are essential elements of the molecular machinery that enables SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in human gut cells. Our findings demonstrate that the intestinal immune response to inflammation in humans and mice are generally very similar. However, certain human-specific diseases, such as COVID-19, can only be successfully studied in an experimental model of human tissue, such as the gut xenograft.","Morris, Lorna; Nisim-Eliraz, Einat; Schouten, Iftach; Bergey, François; Dyer, Nigel; Momiji, Hiroshi; Nir, Eilam; Marsiano, Noga; Tezerji, Raheleh Sheibani; Yagel, Simcha; Rosenstiel, Philip; Rand, David; dos Santos, Vitor A.P.

Some of its benefits include decreased dependency on the expertise of a supervisor, freedom, and equality. In this article, we outline the benefits of peer supervision between a dramatherapist and a family therapist and how their common roots based on creativity and action-based approaches could be used remotely to enhance the goals of peer supervision. We discuss how we utilised such methods and more specifically role reversal in a virtual space during the first Covid-19 lockdown to facilitate the process of peer supervision and understand better the needs and perspective of the client. We propose that incorporating creative and spontaneous methods such as role reversal in a virtual peer supervision environment can potentially enhance the supervisory alliance and therapeutic practice.","Iordanou, Christiana Rapanou Spyridoula",Dramatherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/02630672211030187,635

We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation, or psychosis associated with hydroxychloroquine as used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods New user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and US). RA patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30-day) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation, and hospitalization for psychosis. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate database-specific calibrated hazard ratios (HR), with estimates pooled where I2<40%. Results 918,144 and 290,383 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, respectively, were included. No consistent risk of psychiatric events was observed with short-term hydroxychloroquine (compared to sulfasalazine) use, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.96 [0.79-1.16] for depression, 0.94 [0.49-1.77] for suicide/suicidal ideation, and 1.03 [0.66-1.60] for psychosis. No consistent long-term risk was seen, with meta-analytic HRs 0.94 [0.71-1.26] for depression, 0.77 [0.56-1.07] for suicide/suicidal ideation, and 0.99 [0.72-1.35] for psychosis. Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine as used to treat RA does not appear to increase the risk of depression, suicide/suicidal ideation, or psychosis compared to sulfasalazine. No effects were seen in the short or long term. Use at higher dose or for different indications needs further investigation.","Lane, J. C. E.; Weaver, J.; Kostka, K.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Abrahao, M.

171497,The coincidence of dengue and Covid-19 in pandemic: Report of cases,2021,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has contaminated millions of people, resulting in high fatality rates. Recently emerging artificial intelligence technologies like the convolutional neural network (CNN) are strengthening the power of imaging tools and can help medical specialists. CNN combined with other sensors creates a new solution to fight COVID-19 transmission. This paper presents a novel method to detect coughs (an important symptom of COVID-19) using a K-band continuous-wave Doppler radar with most popular CNNs architectures: AlexNet, VGG-19, and GoogLeNet. The proposed method has cough detection test accuracy of 88.0% using AlexNet CNN with people 1 m away from the microwave radar sensor, test accuracy of 80.0% with people 3 m away from the radar sensor, and test accuracy of 86.5% with a single mixed dataset with people 1 m and 3 m away from the radar sensor. The K-band radar sensor is inexpensive, completely camera-free and collects no personally-identifying information, allaying privacy concerns while still providing in-depth public health data on individual, local, and national levels. Additionally, the measurements are conducted without human contact, making the process proposed in this work safe for the investigation of contagious diseases such as COVID-19. The proposed cough detection system using microwave radar sensor has environmental robustness and dark/light-independence, unlike traditional cameras. The proposed microwave radar sensor can be used alone or in group with other sensors in a fusion sensor system to create a robust system to detect cough and other movements, mainly if using CNNs.","Chuma, E.

The cumulative total number of infected persons as a function of elapsed time has been fitted with power law to find the scaling exponent ({gamma}). The reduction in {gamma} in different countries signals the reduction in the growth of infection, possibly, due to long-term Government intervention. The extent of infection and reproduction rate R_0 of the same are also examined using Farr's law and IDEA model. The new cases per day with time assume Gaussian bell shaped curve, obeying the rule that faster rise follows faster decay. In India and Singapore, the peak of the bell shaped curve is still elusive. It is found that, till date, countries such as Denmark and India implementing sooner lockdown have underwent lower number of new cases of infection. Daily variation shows, R_0 of all the countries is reducing, ushering in fresh hopes to combat COVID-19.

Tracking these events across a birth cohort during their first five years, we demonstrate that >80% of infectious events indeed involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) towards dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change in NPM frequently precedes the appearance of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. In non-sensitized children these events are associated only with “transient wheeze” that resolves after age three. In contrast, in children developing early allergic sensitization, they are associated with ensuing development of persistent wheeze, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype. This suggests underlying pathogenic interactions between allergic sensitization and antibacterial mechanisms.","Teo, Shu Mei; Tang, Howard HF; Mok, Danny; Judd, Louise M; Watts, Stephen C; Pham, Kym; Holt, Barbara J.; Kusel, Merci; Serralha, Michael; Troy, Niamh; Bochkov, Yury A; Grindle, Kristine; Lemanske, Robert F; Johnston, Sebastian L; Gern, James E; Sly, Peter D; Holt, Patrick G; Holt, Kathryn E; Inouye, Michael",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/222190,635

172058,COVID-19 Testing Pipeline: Lesson Learned,2021,"Purpose To characterise the mechanical and neuromuscular response of lower limb muscles in subjects undergoing Whole Body Vibration (WBV) at different frequencies while holding two static postures. Methods Twenty-five participants underwent WBV at 15, 20, 25 and 30 Hz while holding a static ‘hack squat’ and on ‘fore feet’ posture. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and soft tissue accelerations were collected from Gastrocnemius Lateralis (GL), Soleus (SOL) and Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscles. Results Only specific WBV settings led to a significant increase in muscle contraction. Specifically, the WBV-induced activation of SOL and GL was maximal in fore-feet and in response to higher frequencies. Estimated displacement at muscle bellies revealed a resonant pattern never highlighted before. After stimulation starts, muscle oscillation reaches a peak followed by a drop and a further stabilisation (few seconds after the peak) that suggests the occurrence of a neuromuscular activation to reduce the vibration-induced oscillation. Conclusion Lower leg muscles need a response time to tune to a vibratory stimulation, which discourages the use of dynamic exercises on vibrating platforms. To maximize calf muscle response to WBVs, a stimulation frequency in the range of 25-30 Hz and an ‘on fore feet’ posture are recommended.","Rigoni, Isotta; Bonci, Tecla; Bifulco, Paolo; Fratini, Antonio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.31.458312,635

The patient claimed that she was the coronavirus and, as such, she was a common topic of conversation in both television and social media, and the reported deaths caused by COVID-19 were her own doing. As a result of this, the patient was asking doctors to kill her in order to save everyone else affected by the virus. After evaluation, a diagnosis of Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder was considered. The patient was initially treated with paliperidone, but due to hyperprolactinemia and menstrual changes this was switched to aripiprazole. Symptoms remitted fully after 21 days of treatment, and six months later no recurrences have been described.ConclusionsThis case illustrates the potential of the coronavirus pandemic outbreak as a new delusional topic.

172904,Colchicine reduces the degree of inflammation in COVID-19 patients,2021,"The induction of interferon-stimulated genes by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, is a critical host defence to fight virus infections. Here, a highly expressed poxvirus protein 018 is shown to inhibit IFN-induced signalling by binding the SH2 domain of STAT1 to prevent STAT1 association with an activated IFN receptor. Despite the presence of additional inhibitors of IFN-induced signalling, a poxvirus lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 Å crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a mechanism for a high-affinity, pTyr-independent mode of binding to an SH2 domain. Furthermore, the STAT1 binding motif of 018 shows sequence similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which like 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. Taken together, these results provide detailed mechanistic insight into a potent mode of STAT1 antagonism, found to exist in genetically diverse virus families.","Talbot-Cooper, Callum; Pantelejevs, Teodors; Shannon, John P.; Cherry, Christian R.; Au, Marcus T.; Hyvönen, Marko; Hickman, Heather D.; Smith, Geoffrey L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.17.452491,635
173137,Nandong as a culture-based effort to overcome food security toward COVID-19 pandemic situation in Simeulue Island,2021,"The subcutaneous space has been shown to be a suitable site for islet transplantation, however an abundance of islets is required to achieve normoglycemia, often requiring multiple donors. The loss of islets is due to the hypoxic conditions islets experience during revascularization, resulting in apoptosis. Therefore, to reduce the therapeutic dosage required to achieve normoglycemia, pre-vascularization of the subcutaneous space has been pursued. In this study, we highlight a biomaterial-based approach using a methacrylic acid copolymer coating to generate a robust pre-vascularized subcutaneous cavity for islet transplantation. We also devised a simple, but not-trivial, procedure for filling the cavity with an islet suspension in collagen. We show that the pre-vascularized site can support a marginal mass of islets to rapidly return streptozotocin-induced diabetic SCID/bg mice to normoglycemia. Furthermore, immunocompetent Sprague Daley rats remained normoglycemia for up to 70 days until they experienced graft destabilization as they outgrew their implants. This work highlights methacrylic acid-based biomaterials as a suitable pre-vascularization strategy for the subcutaneous space that is scalable and doesn’t require exogenous cells or growth factors. Summary In this study methacrylic acid copolymer coated tubes generated a robust vascular response in the subcutaneous space, which was critical to support islet transplantation in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. More importantly, the subcutaneous pre-vascularization approach using this copolymer coating was scalable into a larger allogeneic rat model and returned animals to normoglycemia for up to 70 days. This platform highlights the potential of a scalable biomaterial approach for pre-vascularization of the subcutaneous space in larger animal models.","Vlahos, Alexander E.; Talior-Volodarsky, Ilana; Kinney, Sean M.; Sefton, Michael V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.172148,635

As one of the main implementations of desktop virtualization, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is popular and widely used in corporate remote work. A VDI user can connect to and use a virtual machine in a remote data center by logging in with a username and password using any device anywhere with Internet access. VDI has mobile convenience but is at risk of password leakage and insider threat. Traditional authentication methods, such as password and PIN, cannot withstand these threats. This work presents a keystroke-based continuous user authentication based on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network and embedding mechanism in deep learning to defend against such risks. It verifies the current user's identity based on the user's typing behavior continuously and non-invasively. We implement it on SPICE VDI and evaluate its performance and deployment feasibility on a public keystroke dataset - the Clarkson II dataset, which collected in uncontrolled and natural settings.

Technological advancements, such as ultrasonic haptic devices, are now able to ‘touch without touching’, claiming this is virtual touch. An initial aim of the study was to investigate subjective intensity and pleasantness ratings of ultrasound stimulation and the influence of top-down factors using the Touch Experience and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ). Self-reported intensity and pleasantness ratings were measured in response to ultrasound stimuli. A second aim was to record from individual low threshold mechanoreceptors using the technique of microneurography in an attempt to determine which mechanoreceptors are activated by ultrasound stimulation of the skin. The major findings here were that microneurography found SAI and SAII units did not respond to ultrasound stimuli; intensity and pleasantness ratings were significantly different between age groups. Ultrasound can produce a variety of sensations with varying intensity and pleasantness ratings. A limitation of the study was the unexpected force difference generated between modulations.

N-chlorotaurine (NCT) is a long-lived oxidant generated in activated cells of the innate immune system, namely neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes and monocytes. NCT acts as an antiseptic agent that can be synthesised chemically and showed good tolerability when inhaled via a nebulizer (1). NCT demonstrated rapid in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2, influenza A viruses, and RSV as well as for C. albicans, E. dermatitidis, P. aeruginosa and MRSA (2,3). Methods: We evaluated 10 patients with CF who inhaled 5 ml of 1% NCT via a nebulizer twice daily. Results: All 10 patients tolerated the inhalation well. The duration of inhalation was between 4 weeks and 3 years. Targeted pathogens were S. apiospermum, A. xylosoxidans, P. aeruginosa, MRSA and SARS-CoV-2. Patients improved clinically after starting to inhale 1% NCT (Sputum production, sputum color, exacerbation rate, need for intravenous antibiotics, expectoration). Conclusions: NCT is a safe, well-tolerated, endogenous, inhaled substance with broad-spectrum activity against pathogens supported by anti-inflammatory properties. It might be a significant step forward for treatment of multiresistant bacteria and fungi. In addition, NCT has a high activity against COVID-19 and other viral infections of the lower airways.

However, additional studies are required to facilitate interpretation of results, including how antibody levels impact immunity and disease course. Methods: In this study, a total of 968 subjects were tested for IgG antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed analytic specificity using 656 plasma samples from healthy donors, 49 sera from patients with rheumatic disease, and 90 specimens from individuals positive for PCR-based respiratory viral panel. One-hundred seventy-three cases of confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 were tested for IgG. A subgroup of 37 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for nucleocapsid-specific IgM antibody using an in-house developed microarray method. Antibody levels were compared between disease severity groups. Results: All specificity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0/656, 0%). Cross reactivity was not detected in specimens with antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor, or cases with previous diagnosis of viral infection including human coronavirus. Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression. Virus-specific IgM was positive in a higher proportion of cases less than 3 days from symptom onset. No association was observed between mild and severe disease course with respect to IgG and IgM levels. Conclusions: The studied SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay had 100% specificity and no adverse cross-reactivity.

179337,Indonesian household demand for essential animal proteins and their pattern of price volatility during the Covid-19 season,2021,"Passenger disembarkation takes place in the confined space of the aircraft cabin. Boarding can be regulated to a certain extent, but this does not apply to disembarking at the end of a flight. COVID-19 constraints require that cabin procedures not only be operationally efficient but also effectively reduce the risk of virus transmission to passengers. We have developed a new mathematical model that accounts for these conflicting goals. We used an already improved seat assignment for passenger groups (e.g., families or couples) and implemented a genetic algorithm that generates improved disembarkation sequences. Our use cases show a significant 40% reduction in disembarkation time when physical spacing between passenger groups is required to comply with pandemic regulations. To inform passenger groups about the disembarkation sequence, we propose to activate the cabin lights at the seats in a dedicated way. Thus, our developed methodology could already be applied to actual airline operations.

We should select those lifestyles to reduce the risk of contact with the virus and getting COVID-19 as well as to lead a normal life. It is believed that basic medical scientists could play an important role in identifying the most appropriate lifestyles by considering the characteristics of the virus and the desires of different social groups. They could also provide the best answers to the countless questions concerning how to live peacefully, considering the novel COVID-2019. © 2020, Middle East Journal of Rehabilitation and Health Studies.

180004,Challenges faced by Construction Organizations during Covid-19 Era,2021,"The Delta and Kappa variants of SARS-CoV-2 co-emerged in India in late 2020, with the Delta variant underlying the resurgence of COVID-19, even in countries with high vaccination rates. In this study, we assess structural and biochemical aspects of viral fitness for these two variants using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), ACE2-binding and antibody neutralization analyses. Both variants demonstrate escape of antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain, an important immune hotspot for neutralizing epitopes. Compared to wild-type and Kappa lineages, Delta variant spike proteins show modest increase in ACE2 affinity, likely due to enhanced electrostatic complementarity at the RBD-ACE2 interface, which we characterize by cryo-EM. Unexpectedly, Kappa variant spike trimers form a novel head-to-head dimer-of-trimers assembly, which we demonstrate is a result of the E484Q mutation. The combination of increased antibody escape and enhanced ACE2 binding provides an explanation, in part, for the rapid global dominance of the Delta variant.","Saville, James W.; Mannar, Dhiraj; Zhu, Xing; Srivastava, Shanti S.; Berezuk, Alison M.; Demers, Jean-Philippe; Zhou, Steven; Tuttle, Katharine S.; Sekirov, Inna; Kim, Andrew; Li, Wei; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Subramaniam, Sriram",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.02.458774,635
181445,The Application of Tactical Urbanism in Public Space on COVID-19 Transmission Prevention,2021,"Considering the increased prevalence of influenza infections in the cold season and the pandemic evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the medical staffs are facing potential viral co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. Both viruses belong to the category of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, having common structural features, causing a similar immune response, with a related mode of transmission and with both respiratory and general symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses cause contagious infections and the protective measures against them are the same: wearing masks in crowded spaces, proper hand hygiene and avoiding crowded places. Co-infections with influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 virus involve additional precautions regarding the therapeutic and evolution approach. Studies show that patients who have been vaccinated against influenza have developed milder forms of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In elderly patients, increased influenza vaccination coverage has shown to be associated with a decrease in mortality rate and also reduced the heavy impact of double infection. The Influenza vaccine can trigger early immune mechanisms in order to facilitate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its clearance. Influenza vaccination should now be seen, more than ever, as a strategy to combat the growing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially in vulnerable populations (elderly and people with associated comorbidities). © 2020 Raluca Ioana Dospinescu Arcana et al., published by Sciendo 2020.","Arcana, R.

201343,COVID-19: crisis or new opportunities time for the agricultural sector of Ukraine,2021,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic treatment of women with severe defect of a Cesarean section (CS) scar and Cesarean scar syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in 11 women who were treated for Cesarean scar syndrome. Ultrasound examinations were performed transvaginally 1 day before surgery and 6 months after laparoscopy in all women. Clinical data were registered 1 day before laparoscopy and 6 months after laparoscopy. RESULTS Of these 11 women, total dehiscence of the CS scar was present in 72.7% (8/11) of the women. Before laparoscopy, all 11 women had severe defect of the CS scar (DRC ≤0.25); however, 6 months after laparoscopy, 81.8% (9/11) of women still had severe defect of the CS scar. Mean thickness of the CS scar, measured 1 day before and 6 months after laparoscopy in all 11 women, was 0.3±0.4 mm and 1.3±1.0 mm, respectively. Accordingly, no significant differences were observed in the mean CS scar thickness (p=0.101). After laparoscopy, 63.6% (7/11) of women were fully asymptomatic, and among the remaining 4, the most common complications were dyspareunia in 36.4% (4/11, p=0.005), pelvic pain in 27.3% (3/11, p=0.014), and dysmenorrhea in 18.2% (2/11, p=0.01), and best results after laparoscopy were achieved for postmenstrual spotting in 18.2% (2/11, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Improvement of women's health after laparoscopy does not necessarily mean improvement of CS scar sonomorphology. Surgery should be offered only to women with symptoms of the Cesarean scar syndrome.","Dosedla, Erik; Calda, Pavel",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829760/,635
202066,The features of mortgage lending in Russia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Apelin is a bioactive peptide known as the ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Diverse active apelin peptides exist under the form of 13, 17 or 36 amino acids, originated from a common 77-amino-acid precursor. Both apelin and APJ mRNA are widely expressed in several rodent and human tissues and have functional effects in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Apelin has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cardiovascular functions, fluid homeostasis, vessel formation and cell proliferation. More recently, apelin has been described as an adipocyte-secreted factor (adipokine), up-regulated in obesity. By acting as circulating hormone or paracrine factor, adipokines are involved in physiological regulations (fat depot development, energy storage, metabolism or eating behavior) or in the promotion of obesity-associated disorders (type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dysfunctions). In this regard, expression of apelin gene in adipose tissue is increased by insulin and TNFalpha. This review will consider the main roles of apelin in physiopathology with particular attention on its role in energy balance regulation and in obesity-associated disorders.","Carpéné, C; Dray, C; Attané, C; Valet, P; Portillo, M P; Churruca, I; Milagro, F I; Castan-Laurell, I",Journal of physiology and biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18457011/,635
202067,The features of mortgage lending in Russia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the foremost respiratory pathogen in newborns and claims millions of lives annually. However, there has been no methodical study of the pathway(s) of entry of RSV or its interaction with nonrespiratory tissues. We and others have recently established a significant association between allergic conjunctivitis and the presence of RSV in the eye. Here we adopt a BALB/c mouse model and demonstrate that when instilled in the live murine eye, RSV not only replicated robustly in the eye but also migrated to the lung and produced a respiratory disease that is indistinguishable from the standard, nasally acquired RSV disease. Ocularly applied synthetic anti-RSV small interfering RNA prevented infection of the eye as well as the lung. RSV infection of the eye activated a plethora of ocular cytokines and chemokines with profound relevance to inflammation of the eye. Anticytokine treatments in the eye reduced ocular inflammation but had no effect on viral growth in both eye and lung, demonstrating a role of the cytokine response in ocular pathology. These results establish the eye as a major gateway of respiratory infection and a respiratory virus as a bona fide eye pathogen, thus offering novel intervention and treatment options.","Bitko, Vira; Musiyenko, Alla; Barik, Sailen",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17050596/,635

202347,Development strategy of SMEs in the new normal era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A literature review,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to measure the efficacy of ionic-iodine polymer complex [1] for clinical and radiological improvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. TRIAL DESIGN: The trial will be closed label, randomized and placebo-controlled with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio and superiority framework. PARTICIPANTS: All PCR confirmed COVID-19 adult patients including non-pregnant females, with mild to moderate disease, will be enrolled from Shaikh Zayed Post-Graduate Medical Complex, Ali Clinic and Doctors Lounge in Lahore (Pakistan). Patients with any pre-existing chronic illness will be excluded from the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: In this multi-armed study ionic-iodine polymer complex with 200 mg of elemental iodine will be given using three formulations to evaluate efficacy. Patients will be receiving either encapsulated iodine complex of 200 mg (arm A), iodine complex syrup form 40 ml (arm B), iodine complex throat spray of 2 puffs (arm C) or empty capsule (arm D) as placebo; all three times a day. All the 4 arms will be receiving standard care as per version 3.0 of the clinical management guidelines for COVID-19 established by the Ministry of National Health Services of Pakistan. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes will be viral clearance with radiological and clinical improvement. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and HRCT chest scans will be done on the admission day and then after every fourth day for 12 days or till the symptoms are resolved. RT-PCR will only be shown as positive or negative while HRCT chest scoring will be done depending on the area and severity of lung involvement [2]. Time taken for the alleviation of symptoms will be calculated by the number of days the patient remained symptomatic. 30-day mortality will be considered as a secondary outcome. RANDOMISATION: Stratification for initial COVID-19 status (or days from initial symptoms as a proxy), age groups, gender, baseline severity of symptoms and co-morbidities will be used to ensure that the study arms remain balanced in size for the 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization will be done using the lottery method. As patients are being admitted at different times, they will be recruited after obtaining their voluntary written informed consent following all standard protocols of the infection, control and disinfection. BLINDING (MASKING): This is a quadruple (participants, care providers, investigators and outcomes assessors) blinded study where only the study's Primary Investigator will have information about the arms and their interventions. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 200 patients will be randomized into four groups with three experimental and one placebo arm. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version Number is 2.3 and it is approved from IRB Shaikh Zayed Hospital with ID SZMC/IRB/Internal0056/2020 on July 14th, 2020. The recruitment is in progress. It was started on July 30, 2020, and the estimated end date for the trial is August 15, 2021.

214364,Framing COVID-19 by an anglophone newspaper outlet,2021,"Purpose: To provide evidence-based recommendations for patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), who had their knee surgery postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Cochrane Central databases were systematically reviewed for studies reporting outcomes of home-based treatments for knee OA. Due to between-study differences in treatment strategy and reporting methods the results were not pooled and findings of the current review were presented in a narrative manner. Results: The comprehensive literature search yielded 33 eligible studies that were included in this review. Management is performed at home and consists of exercise, proper nutrition, physical therapy and use of corrective and assistive orthotics. Virtual education on self-management strategies should be part of coping with knee OA. Initiating an exercise programme involving gymnastics, stretching, home cycling and muscle strengthening is highly recommended. Obese patients are encouraged to set weight loss goals and adopt a healthy diet. Potential benefits but weak evidence has been shown for the use of knee braces, sleeves, foot orthotics or cushioned footwear. Walking aids may be prescribed, when considered necessary, along with the provision of instructions for their use. Conclusion: When bridging the time to rescheduled surgery, it is essential to use appropriate home-based tools for the management of knee OA if pain is to be reduced and need for analgesics or opioid use is to be diminished while maintaining or even improving the functioning and avoiding further limitation of range of motion and subsequent muscular atrophies. Finally, none of these treatments may completely substitute for the life-changing effect of a total knee arthroplasty in patients with severe knee OA. Hence, the subsequent goal is to gradually and safely reinstate elective surgery.","Karasavvidis, Theofilos; Hirschmann, Michael T.; Kort, Nanne P.; Terzidis, Ioannis; Totlis, Trifon",J. Exp.

236787,"The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on rice market performance in Java, Indonesia",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive economic shock across the world due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period, when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level. The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9% in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero, and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters).","Martin, Amory; Markhvida, Maryia; Hallegatte, Stéphane; Walsh, Brian",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,,635

Nasal high-flow therapy could possibly increase the spreading of exhalates from patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether nasal high-flow therapy affects the range of the expiratory plume compared with spontaneous breathing. DESIGN: Interventional experiment on single breaths of a healthy volunteer. SETTING: Research laboratory at the Bauhaus-University Weimar. SUBJECTS: A male subject. INTERVENTIONS: Videos and images from a schlieren optical system were analyzed during spontaneous breathing and different nasal high-flow rates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The maximal exhalation spread was 0.99, 2.18, 2.92, and 4.1 m during spontaneous breathing, nasal high-flow of 20 L/min, nasal high-flow of 40 L/min, and nasal high-flow of 60 L/min, respectively. Spreading of the expiratory plume in the sagittal plane can completely be blocked with a surgical mask. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal high-flow therapy increases the range of the expiratory air up to more than 4 meters. The risk to pick up infectious particles could be increased within this range. Attachment of a surgical mask over the nasal high-flow cannula blocks the expiratory airstream.","Dellweg, Dominic; Kerl, Jens; Gena, Amayu Wakoya; Alsaad, Hayder; Voelker, Conrad",Crit Care Med,,635

246980,Growing public distrust towards the Indonesian Government for lack of response to COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"BACKGROUND: The speed and reach of the COVID-19 pandemic has created special scenarios to be considered, such as those in where patients who meet criteria for hospitalization due to moderate/severe disease cannot be hospitalized due to economic constraints and saturation of national health systems. The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of a severe COVID-19 patient managed at home in a developing country, and to discuss some of the available guidelines and potential therapeutic options for this type of cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female seeking medical attention through teleconsultation presents with profound dyspnea, oppressive chest pain, fatigue, episodic hallucinations, and difficulty sleeping, for what she originally sought medical attention at an ER but could not be admitted due to saturation of the health system. A positive PCR test for COVID-19, and a CT scan of the chest showing bilateral consolidations with ground-glass opacities confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was managed at home, with corticosteroids, nitazoxanide and a single dose of 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin. Colchicine was added at the third day of treatment. Standard oxygen therapy through nasal cannula was also recommended. Daily follow-ups were established to monitor for signs of clinical improvement. Two weeks later from the initial consultation the patient presents marked improvement in her symptoms, as well as in her CT scan, which prompted in discontinuation of the medications and the oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There are several limitations in this report regarding the clinical data and the management, but such limitations do also reflect the state of emergency and the chaos that resides in the health care systems of developing nations. For the ambulatory care of COVID-19 patients, several aspects of disease management may differ from current guidelines and basic requirements may represent a huge challenge to cover. Further research is needed to assist physicians in the daily clinical decision making, to optimize patient outcomes, and to reduce the probability of adverse scenarios of patients with COVID-19 managed in the ambulatory setting.","Chérrez-Ojeda, Ivan; Vanegas, Emanuel; Felix, Miguel",BMC Infect Dis,,635

292576,Perceived benefits and constraints in urban farming practice during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although it is becoming evident that individual's immune system has a decisive influence on SARS-CoV-2 disease progression, pathogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to profile the host transcriptome of COVID-19 patients from nasopharyngeal samples along with virus genomic features isolated from respective host, and a comparative analyses of differential host responses in various SARS-CoV-2 infection systems. RESULTS: Unique and rare missense mutations in 3C-like protease observed in all of our reported isolates. Functional enrichment analyses exhibited that the host induced responses are mediated by innate immunity, interferon, and cytokine stimulation. Surprisingly, induction of apoptosis, phagosome, antigen presentation, hypoxia response was lacking within these patients. Upregulation of immune and cytokine signaling genes such as CCL4, TNFA, IL6, IL1A, CCL2, CXCL2, IFN, and CCR1 were observed in lungs. Lungs lacked the overexpression of ACE2 as suspected, however, high ACE2 but low DPP4 expression was observed in nasopharyngeal cells. Interestingly, directly or indirectly, viral proteins specially non-structural protein mediated overexpression of integrins such as ITGAV, ITGA6, ITGB7, ITGB3, ITGA2B, ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGA9, ITGA4, ITGAE, and ITGA8 in lungs compared to nasopharyngeal samples suggesting the possible way of enhanced invasion. Furthermore, we found comparatively highly expressed transcription factors such as CBP, CEBP, NFAT, ATF3, GATA6, HDAC2, TCF12 which have pivotal roles in lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Even though this study incorporates a limited number of cases, our data will provide valuable insights in developing potential studies to elucidate the differential host responses on the viral pathogenesis in COVID-19, and incorporation of further data will enrich the search of an effective therapeutics.","Islam, Abul Bashar Mir Md Khademul; Khan, Md Abdullah-Al-Kamran; Ahmed, Rasel; Hossain, Md Sabbir; Kabir, Shah Md Tamim; Islam, Md Shahidul; Siddiki, A M A M Zonaed",J Transl Med,,635

This includes three out of seventeen (17.6%) cats and one out of fifty-nine (1.7%) dogs that were positive by RT-PCR and sequencing, with the virus successfully isolated from the respiratory swabs of one cat and one dog. Whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from all four PCR-positive animals were unique variants grouping with genomes circulating among people with COVID-19 in Texas. Re-sampling showed persistence of viral RNA for at least 25 d-post initial test. Additionally, seven out of sixteen (43.8%) cats and seven out of fifty-nine (11.9%) dogs harbored SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies upon initial sampling, with relatively stable or increasing titers over the 2-3 months of follow-up and no evidence of seroreversion.

347548,The impact of COVID-19 on the performance of food clusters MSMEs in Surabaya,2021,"Rishirilides are a group of PKS II secondary metabolites produced by Streptomyces bottropensis Gö C4/4. Biosynthetic studies in the past have elucidated early and late steps of rishirilide biosynthesis. This work is aiming to solve the remaining steps in the rishirilide biosynthesis. Inactivation of the cyclase gene rslC3 in Streptomyces bottropensis resulted in an interruption of rishirilide production. Instead, accumulation of the tricyclic aromatic galvaquinones was observed. Similar results were observed after deletion of rslO4. Closer inspection into RslO4 crystal structure in addition to site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that RslO4 might be responsible for quinone formation on the third ring. The RslO1 three-dimensional structure shows a high similarity to FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenases such as the epoxy-forming MsnO8 which acts with the flavin reductase MsnO3 in mensacarcin biosynthesis in the same strain. The high sequence similarity between RslO2 and MsnO3 suggests that RslO2 provides RslO1 with reduced FMN to form an epoxide that serves as substrate for RslO5.","Alali, Ahmad; Zhang, Lin; Li, Jianyu; Zuo, Chijian; Wassouf, Dimah; Yan, Xiaohui; Schwarzer, Philipp; Günther, Stefan; Einsle, Oliver; Bechthold, Andreas",Mol. biotechnol,,635

349380,The sustainability challenges of the poultry industry during pandemic Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has affected worldwide sports competitions and training in both amateur and professional leagues. We thus aimed to investigate changes in different training modalities in elite and amateur football players following COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we applied a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 20 items to quantify and classify time spent at standard training methods in 47 professional and 54 amateur football players from 12 Austrian clubs before and during lockdown. Additionally, McLean score was calculated to assess perceived training fatigue. RESULTS: Weekly amount of training time at endurance exercises (cycling) increased in both professional (37.5 [IQR 46.5] min/week vs. 187.5 [IQR 127.5] min/week, p<0.001), and amateur players (0.0 [IQR 45.0] min/week vs. 37.5 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p=0.015) during COVID-19 lockdown. Time on diverse muscle strengthening workouts was significantly elevated in both cohorts. Total training time at ball declined for professionals (from 472.5 [IQR 150] min/week to 15.0 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p<0.001) and amateurs (from 337.5 [IQR 285] min/week to 0.0 [IQR 37.5] min/week, p<0.001). Videoguided training was intensified in both groups (p<0.001 each). Location shifted from football fields and gyms to home and outdoors. Overall McLean score remained unchanged in amateurs (p=0.42) while elite players showed a trend towards an increase (p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown compromised football training, especially training concepts with ball. Consequently, resulting changes in exercise loads and muscular burden might impact susceptibility for injuries and impair performances especially in amateur players, especially as they lacked training supervision and professional training plans. Minimum effective dose of training workload in order to maintain endurance- and neuromuscular-related performance parameters should be prescribed.","Schüttler, Dominik; Hamm, Wolfgang; Krammer, Simone; Steffen, Julius; Deuster, Eileen; Lauseker, Michael; Egger, Florian; Meyer, Tim; Brunner, Stefan",J. sports med. phys. fit,,635

353215,Bringing Artificial Intelligent to Jakarta Monitoring Covid-19 Outbreak,2021,"Enhanced community surveillance is a key pillar of the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include preappointment and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centers across Scotland invited asymptomatic-screened patients aged over 5 y to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardized Viral Transport Medium-containing test kits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/email with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. Over a 13-wk period (from August 3, 2020, to October 31, 2020), 4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these, 22 (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.5%-0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing infection prevention control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as health care team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues. Dental settings are a valuable location for public health surveillance.","Conway, D I; Culshaw, S; Edwards, M; Clark, C; Watling, C; Robertson, C; Braid, R; O039,; Keefe, E; McGoldrick, N; Burns, J; Provan, S; VanSteenhouse, H; Hay, J; Gunson, R",J Dent Res,,635

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPPE on ERCP success parameters compared to standard PPE (SPPE). METHODS: ERCP procedures were evaluated retrospectively and ERCP outcomes were compared for similar time periods as before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were cannulation time, number of cannulation attempts, cannulation success rate, difficult cannulation rate, undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rate, ERCP-related adverse events, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty ERCP procedures were examined. One hundred and fifty-nine procedures were excluded due to missing data, previous sphincterotomy or altered anatomy. Of the final eligible sample size of 221 ERCPs, 93 were performed using SPPE and 128 were performed under EPPE. Indications of ERCP and demographic parameters were similar between groups. The majority of the ERCP cases included were for benign biliary obstruction of common bile duct stones (88.7%). No significant differences were detected in overall technical success (91.4% vs 92.2%, p = 0.832), cannulation success rates (94.6% vs 96.8%, p = 0.403), cannulation times (median times of both groups were 3 min, p = 0.824), difficult cannulation rates (37.6% vs 33.6%, p = 0.523), undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rates (29% vs 22.7%, p = 0.593), number of cannulation attempts (2.80 vs 2.71, p = 0.731), ERCP-related adverse events (9.7% vs 10.9%, p = 0.762), and length of hospital stay (6.63 vs 6.92 days, p = 0.768) between SPPE and EPPE groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Biliary obstructions of common bile duct stones were the major indication of ERCP in the current study. The use of EPPE had no negative effects on ERCP performance in this patient group.

Local realities and resources were key driving factors impacting workflow changes, including for pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry service (PCLPS) providers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the early changes implemented by 22 PCLPSs from the United States and Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding similarities and differences in adaptations made to PCLPS care delivery can inform best practices and future models of care. METHODS: A 20-point survey relating to PCLPS changes during the COVID-19 pandemic was sent to professional listservs. Baseline hospital demographics, hospital and PCLPS workflow changes, and PCLPS experience were collected from March 20 to April 28, 2020, and from August 18 to September 10, 2020. Qualitative data were collected from responding sites. An exploratory thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data that were not dependent on predetermined coding themes. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: Twenty-two academic hospitals in the United States and Canada responded to the survey, with an average of 303 beds/hospital. Most respondents (18/22) were children's hospitals. Despite differences in regional impact of COVID-19 and resource availability, there was significant overlap in respondent experiences. Restricted visitation to one caregiver, use of virtual rounding, ongoing trainee involvement, and an overall low number of COVID-positive pediatric patients were common. While there was variability in PCLPS care delivery occurring virtually versus in person, all respondents maintained some level of on-site presence. Technological limitations and pediatric provider preference led to increased on-site presence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study exploring pandemic-related PCLPS changes in North America. Findings of this study demonstrate that PCLPSs rapidly adapted to COVID-19 realities. Common themes emerged that may serve as a model for future practice. However, important gaps in understanding their effectiveness and acceptability need to be addressed.

METHODS: A 20-point survey relating to PCLPS changes during the COVID-19 pandemic was sent to professional listservs. Baseline hospital demographics, hospital and PCLPS workflow changes, and PCLPS experience were collected from March 20, 2020 - April 28, 2020 and August 18, 2020 - September 10, 2020. Qualitative data were collected from responding sites. An exploratory thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data that was not dependent on pre-determined coding themes. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: 22 academic hospitals in the US and Canada responded to the survey, with an average of 303 beds/hospital. Most respondents (18/22) were children's hospitals. Despite differences in regional impact of COVID-19 and resource availability, there was significant overlap in respondent experiences. Restricted visitation to one caregiver, use of virtual rounding, ongoing trainee involvement, and an overall low number of COVID-positive pediatric patients were common. While there was variability in PCLPS care delivery occurring virtually versus in person, all respondents maintained some level of on-site presence. Technological limitations and pediatric provider preference led to increased on-site presence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multi-center study exploring pandemic-related PCLPS changes in North America. Findings of this study demonstrate that PCLPSs rapidly adapted to COVID-19 realities. Common themes emerged that may serve as a model for future practice. However, important gaps in understanding their effectiveness and acceptability need to be addressed. This multi-site survey highlights the importance of establishing consensus through national professional organizations to inform provider and hospital practices.","Brahmbhatt, Khyati; Mournet, Annabelle M; Malas, Nasuh; DeSouza, Claire; Greenblatt, Jeanne; Afzal, Khalid I; Giles, Lisa L; Charoensook, Janet; Feuer, Vera; Raza, Haniya; Mooneyham, GenaLynne C; Pergjika, Alba; Schlesinger, Amanda; Chapman, Andrea; Strain, Angela; Gandhi, Bela; Johnson, Kyle; Mroczkowski, Megan M; Ibeziako, Patricia; Graham, Regina; Yoon, Yesie; Plioplys, Sigita; Fuchs, Catherine; Shaw, Richard J; Pao, Maryland",,,635

Unfortunately, false negative test results are often reported. In this study, we attempted to determine the principal causes leading to false negative results of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in respiratory tract specimens. Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%-95.26%) and specificity (83.72%-98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified. Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality. In addition, our results demonstrated that false negativity accounted for a vast majority of contradicting results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA test by RT-PCR.","Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Changtai; Han, Mingfeng; Ye, Jun; Gao, Yong; Liu, Zhongping; He, Tengfei; Li, Tuantuan; Xu, Mengyuan; Zhou, Luping; Zou, Guizhou; Lu, Mengji; Zhang, Zhenhua",Virol. sin.

Methods: We used data from government reports, clinical guidelines and other publications to estimate the main cost components of COVID-19 during 1 January-31 March 2020. These components were: identification and diagnosis of close contacts; suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19; treatment of COVID-19 cases; compulsory quarantine of close contacts and suspected cases; and productivity losses for all affected residents. Primary outcomes were total health-care and societal costs. Findings: The total estimated health-care and societal costs associated with COVID-19 were 4.26 billion Chinese yuan (¥; 0.62 billion United States dollars, US$) and ¥ 2646.70 billion (US$ 383.02 billion), respectively. Inpatient care accounted for 44.2% (¥ 0.95 billion/¥ 2.15 billion) of routine health-care costs followed by medicines, accounting for 32.5% (¥ 0.70 billion/¥ 2.15 billion). Productivity losses accounted for 99.8% (¥ 2641.61 billion/¥ 2646.70 billion) of societal costs, which were mostly attributable to the effect of movement-restriction policies on people who did not have COVID-19. Societal costs were most sensitive to salary costs and number of working days lost due to movement-restriction policies. Hubei province had the highest health-care cost while Guangdong province had the highest societal cost. Conclusion: Our results highlight the high economic burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The control measures to prevent the spread of disease resulted in substantial costs from productivity losses amounting to 2.7% (US$ 382.29 billion/US$ 14.14 trillion) of China's annual gross domestic product.","Jin, Huajie; Wang, Haiyin; Li, Xiao; Zheng, Weiwei; Ye, Shanke; Zhang, Sheng; Zhou, Jiahui; Pennington, Mark",Bull World Health Organ,,635
393630,Determination of Leading Commodities and Food Commodities Structure in Sigi Regency of Central Sulawesi Province,2021,"Soil enzymes play a key role in the circulation of nutrients and the functioning of the ecosystem. The aim of the study was to assess how the tree species of urban agglomerations affect soil quality and enzymatic activity (dehydrogenases DEH, catalase CAT, alkaline AlP and acid AcP phosphatase, protease PR, ß-glucosidase GLU, and urease UR). To this end, soil samples were taken from beneath nine park trees. The risk of soil contamination by selected heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd) was also investigated against the background of the selected physicochemical properties. Enzyme activity results were used to calculate multi-parametric indices of soil quality: availability factor (AF), enzymatic pH indicator (AlP/AcP), biological index of fertility (BIF), geometric mean (GMea), alternation index (Al3), biochemical soil activity (BA16 and BA17). The results showed statistically significant differences in physicochemical and enzymatic properties of soil depending on tree species. Correlation analysis showed that the content of total organic carbon (TOC), total nirogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and humus (OM) in soil significantly influenced the activity of the studied enzymes and glomalin content. AF coefficient values (1.84%-18.19%) suggest that the bioavailability of available phosphorus (AP) was sufficient. The Pb, Ni, Cd content results were found to be low and did not exceed the permissible concentrations. DEH, CAT and AlP activity were highest under common hawthorn, and AcP, GLU and PR under northern white cedar. The calculated enzymatic indicators proved to be a sensitive and accurate indicator of the dynamics of changes taking place in the city park soil. Based on the results, an attempt can be made to assess the planning of sustainable development of studied areas of urban parks.","Lemanowicz, Joanna; Haddad, Samir A; Bartkowiak, Agata; Lamparski, Robert; Wojewódzki, Piotr",Sci Total Environ,,635

393912,Impact of the Pandemic COVID-19 on the Implementation of Construction Contracts,2021,"We provide the details of the successful management of a patient with active Cushing's disease complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The patient was a 27-year-old Japanese female healthcare worker who was scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. She had been in close contact with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%. Medical treatment was initiated to control hypercortisolism by the 'block and replace' regimen using steroidogenesis inhibitors and hydrocortisone. The COVID-19 pneumonia improved with multi-modal treatment including antiviral therapy. One month later, after a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with appropriate protection against virus transmission to medical staff in the operating room and daily medical care nurses, trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed by our highly experienced pituitary surgeon. One month after the surgery, the patient's basal ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol were all under the detection limit. Surgical remission was expected. Since hypercortisolism due to active Cushing's disease may worsen a COVID-19 infection, multi-disciplinary management that includes appropriate and prompt treatment strategies is mandatory in such cases.","Yuno, Akiko; Kenmotsu, Yoshiyuki; Takahashi, Yuka; Nomoto, Hiroshi; Kameda, Hiraku; Cho, Kyu Yong; Nakamura, Akinobu; Yamashita, Yu; Nakamura, Junichi; Nakakubo, Sho; Kamada, Keisuke; Suzuki, Masaru; Sugino, Hirokazu; Inoshita, Naoko; Konno, Satoshi; Miyoshi, Hideaki; Atsumi, Tatsuya; Sawamura, Yutaka; Shimatsu, Akira",Endocr. j,,635

395280,Economic Resilience of Fishermen Community During Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on the basis of in vitro activity and data from uncontrolled studies and small, randomized trials. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned 1561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3155 to receive usual care. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The enrollment of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was closed on June 5, 2020, after an interim analysis determined that there was a lack of efficacy. Death within 28 days occurred in 421 patients (27.0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and in 790 (25.0%) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.23; P = 0.15). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. The results suggest that patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive within 28 days than those in the usual-care group (59.6% vs. 62.9%; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98). Among the patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline, those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (30.7% vs. 26.9%; risk ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27). There was a small numerical excess of cardiac deaths (0.4 percentage points) but no difference in the incidence of new major cardiac arrhythmia among the patients who received hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, those who received hydroxychloroquine did not have a lower incidence of death at 28 days than those who received usual care.

However, the analysis of the effects these interventions had is less advanced. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to assess these effects retrospectively. We use a regularized regression to find a parsimonious model that fits the data with the least changes in the [Formula: see text] parameter. Then, we postulate each jump in [Formula: see text] as the effect of an intervention. Following the do-operator prescriptions, we simulate the counterfactual case by forcing [Formula: see text] to stay at the pre-jump value. We then attribute a value to the intervention from the difference between true evolution and simulated counterfactual. We show that the recommendation to use facemasks for all activities would reduce the number of cases by 200,000 ([Formula: see text] CI 190,000-210,000) in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York State.

Drawing on the stress and coping literature, we argue that people around the world alleviate their anxiety and stress induced by the pandemic through both prosocial and 'self-interested' hoarding behaviours. This cross-cultural survey study examined the pushing (threat perception) and pulling (moral identity) factors that predicted prosocial acts and hoarding, and subsequently psychological well-being. Data were collected from 9 April to 14 May 2020 from 251 participants in the United Kingdom (UK), 268 in the United States (US), 197 in Germany (DE), and 200 in Hong Kong (HK). Whereas threat perception was associated positively with both prosocial acts and hoarding, benevolent moral identity was associated positively with the former but not the latter behaviour. We also observed cross-cultural differences, such that both effects were stronger in more individualistic (UK, US) countries than less individualistic (HK, DE) ones. The findings shed light on the prosocial vs. self-interested behavioural responses of people in different cultures towards the same pandemic crisis.","Tse, Dwight C K; Lau, Vienne W; Hong, Ying-Yi; Bligh, Michelle C; Kakarika, Maria",,,635

However, evidence on the effectiveness of this technology for the care of spine surgery patients is limited. In this systematic review the authors aimed to examine the current utilization of TM for spine surgery. METHODS: Using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, the authors performed a systematic review of the literature focused on the themes of telemedicine and spine surgery. Included in the search were randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-controlled studies. Two independent reviewers conducted the study appraisal, data abstraction, and quality assessments of the studies. RESULTS: Out of 1463 references from the initial search results, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of TM interventions focused on improving perioperative patient communication and patient education by using mobile phone apps, online surveys, or online materials for consent. The studies reported the feasibility of the use of TM for perioperative care and positive user experiences from the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The current increase in TM adoption due to the COVID-19 crisis presents an opportunity to further develop and validate this technology. Early evidence in the literature supports the use of TM as an adjunct to traditional in-person clinical encounters for certain perioperative tasks such as supplemental patient education and postoperative surveys.","Kolcun, John Paul G; Ryu, Won Hyung A; Traynelis, Vincent C",J Neurosurg Spine,,635
405553,Trade balance during the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"YouTube recently announced a decision to exclude potentially harmful content from video recommendations while allowing such videos to remain on the platform, but it is unclear whether this compromise is sufficient in mitigating YouTube's role in propagating this content. To assess this impact, we measure YouTube sharing in Twitter and Reddit in the eight months around YouTube's announcement using interrupted time series models. These models evaluate YouTube's impact on sharing of videos from a curated set of alternative political channels and popular videos shared in three conspiracy-oriented Reddit subreddits; we compare these models to a placebo dataset of makeup-oriented videos that should be unaffected by YouTube's announcement. Results suggest YouTube's de-recommending AIN-produced content has a significant suppressive effect on sharing of AIN videos in both Twitter and Reddit, with our models showing a significant and downward trend in sharing. For conspiracy video sharing, however, we see no significant change in Reddit and find an increase in the level of conspiracy sharing in Twitter. We see no significant effect on makeup sharing in either platform, suggesting YouTube's targeting particular content types has a targeted effect. Reducing exposure to anti-social videos without deleting them therefore has the potential to improve quality across the information ecosystem, but additional transparency is needed to evaluate these effects further.","Buntain, Cody; Bonneau, Richard; Nagler, Jonathan; Tucker, Joshua A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00970v1.pdf,635

It is therefore essential to provide a reference for making policy adjustments and transformations to promote the realization of SDGs in the post-pandemic era. Based on a literature review of the progress and policies of SDGs across countries worldwide, we find that research on sustainable policies has rapidly increased since the SDGs issued in 2015 with particular focuses on eco-environment, sustainable policies, green economy, sanitation and health, and water sanitation. Most countries are in the process of nationalization, institutionalization, and universalization of the SDGs through incorporating the SDGs into national development frameworks, enabling extensive participation and negotiation mechanisms, and promoting the SDGs’ national publicity. Countries of different economic and institutional backgrounds demonstrate divergent development pathways, priorities, measures, and progress in the implementation of SDGs. Despite significant global progress during the last five years, the North–South divide emerges in the policy action and achievement of SDGs. The least developed countries in sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia appear to be difficult or even unable to implement the SDGs and monitor the progress. In the post-pandemic era, particular attention shall be given to integrating SDGs and achieve synergy among goals, concretizing short-and medium-term priorities toward the SDGs targets for all countries, strengthening multilateralism and global cooperation among countries and continents, providing reliable data and approaches for real-time impact assessment and process monitoring, and promoting an inclusive engagement and integrative implementation with multiple stakeholders and consortiums. © 2021 by the authors.

417574,The Urgency of Policy Formulation: Dynamics of Covid-19 Handling and Big Data,2021,"Pandemic of virus COVID-19 posed numerous and unprecedented challenges to citizens and authorities which required shift in behavior and actions of all segments of society. Representing Ombudsmen Institution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, authors shared their experience in monitoring implementation of the decisions of all levels of government and presented challenges in striking the right balance between interests of public health and protection of rights of vulnerable groups. Public authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have passed emergency measures aimed at containing the spread of virus, but some of them failed to maintain human rights standards. Following the decisions of crisis centers to limit the freedom of movement, it was necessary to secure rights of children to education, protection from domestic violence and neglect in the family context. In introducing online education, authorities were asked to adapt recognition and grading system to the children in different conditions and circumstances, especially to the children with difficulties in development, children living in poverty and on margins of society such as Roma children or those living in institutions. Ombudsmen Institution registered increase in the number of domestic violence cases because measures limiting freedom of movement had impact on victim' ability to seek help from trusted sources, usually members of immediate family or representatives of law enforcement agencies. Having in mind that large number of citizens could not afford access to the official gazettes in any form, Ombudsmen requested that all enacted legislation be accessible online recommended that the decision banning reporters from conferences be reconsidered, guided by the right of citizens to be informed of their government actions. Examining the practice of placing COVID stickers on mail by the Post Office, Ombudsmen issued recommendation to stop such practice as it was deemed disproportional to the right to privacy and protection of personal data, while thepro-tection of postal workers could have been ensured by other protective measures. It also became evident that national budgetary capacities had to be increased in order to prevent deterioration in provision of basic public services such as health and social protection, since economic consequences of the pandemic were disproportionally felt by the groups exposed to poverty, such as Roma, refugees or migrants. Drawing conclusion from concrete cases, authors offer review of particular emergency measures, analyze their adequacy, justifiability and timeliness, while presenting authorities' response to Ombudsmens findings in formulating more adequate and efficient but, at the same time, least intrusive measures taken in response to the disaster. In search of common response to such widespread phenomenon, governments should recognize the intention of Ombudsmen Institutions to be in ""permanent session"" over protection of vulnerable groups and should more actively involve it in discussions on emergency measures and their effect on human rights and freedoms.

419118,"Neural network, ecological ecotone and tele-health in the development of rural areas during the crisis period caused by the pandemic Covid-19",2021,"SARS-CoV-2 may spread through respiratory droplets released by infected individuals. The viruses are transmitted in moist droplets which cause coronavirus disease. Many countries have mandated the wearing of face masks, to various extents. However, the efficacy of masks is yet to be well rationalised given the limited microstructure information. Here, three common face masks and associated air permeations were revealed by coupling X-ray tomographic imaging and infrared thermal imaging techniques. Quantitative parameters have been extracted from the 3D images. Also, image-based modelling was performed to simulate the permeability to show how droplets pass through the porous structure. Our results show that the N95 mask has the smallest average pore diameter (~30 µm) and the densest nanoscale fibres which provides superior droplet filtration among all cases. Modifications to the N95 masks are proposed to develop the next generation mask with higher efficacy and better breathability.Face masks are key for slowing the spread of COVID-19. Here, the microstructure of three common masks is determined by x-ray tomography, combined with image-based modelling of droplet permeability, revealing that N95 masks are best for droplet filtration.","Du, Wenjia Iacoviello Francesco Fernandez Tacson Loureiro Rui Brett Daniel J.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) may increase risk for symptoms due to fear of exposure during competition or uncertainty regarding participation. The current study examined the prevalence of COVID-19 anxiety in 437 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I student-athletes and its association with psychological symptoms. Only 0.2% of participants endorsed COVID-19 anxiety symptoms above cutoff. COVID-19 anxiety did not change after postponement of fall sports or differ between persons competing in different seasons. However, higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Though student-athletes generally reported low levels of psychological symptoms, females endorsed significantly higher levels than males. Low levels of COVID-19 anxiety in student-athletes may reflect protective factors (e.g., health knowledge, emotion regulation) or the tendency for this population to minimize psychological symptoms. Further investigations on the psychological impact of COVID-19 in athletes is needed.","Sanborn, V.; Todd, L.; Schmetzer, H.; Manitkul-Davis, N.; Updegraff, J.; Gunstad, J.",Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology,,635
440828,Food and Nutrition Security in The Context of COVID-19 and The Potential Role of Tilapia Aquaculture,2021,"The purpose of this article is to show the effect of Risk Perception RP and Risk Definition RD on the Risk-Addressing Behaviour RB. To carry out this study secondary data was used from a semi-structured survey administered between February and June 2020, a period during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study identified six dimensions of risk perception and thus tested six structural models. Risk perception (ξ RP) is defined as an external latent variable in the study. It is also assumed that the risk perception variable may affect the risk definition variable (η RD). The application software SmartPLS was used to analyse data through exploratory factor analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling on our research model. To achieve Convergent validity of the structural equation model of partial least squares, three criteria were met. In the study, Discriminant Validity was examined using the Fornell-Larcker criterion and Heterotrain-Monotrait Ratio (HTMT) coefficients. Results reveal that there is no direct relationship between the RB and “religion and beliefs”, the “fear level, the experience”, the “peer influences level” and the “openness”. However, we found a positive relationship between the agreement on “knowledge” and on RB and statistically significant relationships between the agreement on the RD and the agreement on the “religion and beliefs”, the “fear level”, the “experience”, the “knowledge”, the “peer influences level” and the RB. Moreover, there is an indirect relationship when controlling for the agreement on the RD between the agreement on the RB and the agreement on the “fear level”, the “experience”, the “knowledge” and the “peer influences level”. However, there is no relationship between the agreement on the “openness” and the agreement on the RB and a statistically significant but moderate relationship between the agreement on the RD and the agreement on the RB. Although, there seems to be abundant research on RP, so far we have found only a few studies on the influencing factors of RP, as effected by RB and RD, especially in distressed times such as during this current pandemic period of COVID-19. This study adds to body of literature and sheds new light on the interaction between RP, RB and RD in a time of distress. It provides important and original information that may be useful for government agencies, businesses, individuals, and the media when setting policies, governance structures, regulations, procedures and determining how to communicate.","Grima, Simon Hamarat Bahattin Özen Ercan Girlando Alessandra Dalli-Gonzi Rebecca",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,635

RECENT FINDINGS: Several reports from single centers have described increased, decreased, or no difference in outcomes of COVID-19 in PWH. These studies have come from a range of locations, each with different underlying HIV prevalence and access to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Differences in healthcare quality, access and policies may also affect reported outcomes in PWH across different locations, making interpretation of results more challenging. Meanwhile, different components of ART have been proposed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or disease progression. SUMMARY: The current review considers 6 months of data across geographic regions with a range of healthcare quality and access and ART regimens to generate a wider view of COVID-19 outcomes in PWH. Taken together, these studies indicate that HIV infection may be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, but comorbidities appear to play a larger role than HIV-specific variables in outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH. ART does not appear to protect from COVID-19 disease acquisition, progression or death.","Johnston, Rowena",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,,635

477491,Livestock shortage amidst COVID-19: A case of Brunei Darussalam,2021,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health crisis worldwide. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from mild to severe among different age groups, but the physiological changes related to COVID-19 are barely understood. METHODS: In the present study, a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based lipidomic strategy was used to characterize the endogenous plasma lipids for cured COVID-19 patients with different ages and symptoms. These patients were further divided into two groups: those with severe symptoms or who were elderly and relatively young patients with mild symptoms. In addition, automated lipidomic identification and alignment was conducted by LipidSearch software. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used for differential comparison. RESULTS: Nearly 500 lipid compounds were identified in each cured COVID-19 group through LipidSearch software. At the level of lipid subclasses, patients with severe symptoms or elderly patients displayed dramatic changes in plasma lipidomic alterations, such as increased triglycerides and decreased cholesteryl esters (ChE). Some of these differential lipids might also have essential biological functions. Furthermore, the differential analysis of plasma lipids among groups was performed to provide potential prognostic indicators, and the change in signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipidemia was observed in cured COVID-19 patients due to the viral infection and medical treatment, and the discharged patients should continue to undergo consolidation therapy. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma lipid markers and potential therapeutic targets of COVID-19 and essential resources for further research on the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Bai, Yunpeng; Huang, Wendong; Li, Yaocai; Lai, Changchun; Huang, Sumei; Wang, Guangwen; He, Yuemei; Hu, Linhui; Chen, Chunbo",Biosci. rep,,635

The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of facial PIs. The secondary outcomes of interest were facial pain while wearing PPE and ease of use of the care bundle. METHODS: This study used a voluntary survey by questionnaire, supplemented by a qualitative analysis of interviews from a small purposive sample that took place in one large Irish hospital over a two-month period in 2020. The hospital was a city-based public university teaching hospital with 800 inpatient beds. The intervention was a care bundle consisting of skin protection, face mask selection, material use, skin inspection, cleansing and hydration developed in line with international best practice guidelines. All staff working in COVID-19 wards, intensive care units and the emergency department in the hospital were given a kitbag containing the elements of the care bundle plus an information pamphlet. Data were collected via a survey and interviews. RESULTS: A total of 114 staff provided feedback on the use of the care bundle. Before using the care bundle 29% (n=33) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI, whereas after using the care bundle only 8% (n=9) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI. The odds ratio (OR) of skin injury development was 4.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-10.49; p=0.0001), suggesting that after the care bundle was issued, those who responded to the survey were almost five times less likely to develop a skin injury. Interviews with 14 staff determined that the bundle was easy to use and safe. CONCLUSION: Among those who responded to the survey, the use of the bundle was associated with a reduction in the incidence of skin injury from 29% to 8%, and respondents found the bundle easy to use, safe and effective. As with evidence from the international literature, this study has identified that when skincare is prioritised, and a systematic preventative care bundle approach is adopted, there are clear benefits for the individuals involved.","Moore, Zena; McEvoy, Natalie L; Avsar, Pinar; McEvoy, Linda; Curley, Gerard; O039,; Connor, Tom; Budri, Aglecia; Nugent, Linda; Walsh, Simone; Bourke, Frank; Patton, Declan",J Wound Care,,635

Here, we claim that we reliably detected A-to-G RNA modifications in the RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 with high signal to noise ratios, presumably caused by the host's deamination enzymes. Intriguingly, since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, it is technically impossible to distinguish SNPs and RNA modifications from the RNA-seq data alone without solid evidence, making it difficult to tell the evolutionary patterns behind the mutation spectrum. Researchers should clarify their biological significance before they automatically regard the mutations as SNPs or RNA modifications.

We aimed to determine patient satisfaction, perceived barriers, as well as indications for teledermatology appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was sent out via SurveyMonkey's online platform to patients of the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates' Dermatology department who attended telehealth appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Out of 894 invitations sent, 168 patients completed our survey.The most common reasons for making a telehealth appointment were for a new rash (11.6%), eczema (9.8%), and psoriasis (9.1%). The most common reasons respondents liked telehealth were because of time efficiency (81.1%), not requiring transportation (74.2%), and maintaining social distancing (73.6%). The most common reasons respondents did not like telehealth were due to lack of physical touch (26.8%) and feeling they received an inadequate assessment (15.7%). Very few patients reported that they were unlikely to undertake another telehealth visit (9.94%) or recommend a telehealth visit to others (6.92%). CONCLUSION: Dermatology patients likely perceive telehealth visits as a convenient and safe method for quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of physical touch, inability to provide close inspection and/or procedural intervention can be frustrating for patients and therefore meaningful selection of appropriate cases for telehealth visits can optimize the patient experience. Overall, telemedicine represents an effective and safe vehicle for delivering care especially during a global pandemic.

DESIGNSystematic review of studies that have considered impacts of vaccines in relation to baseline risks. Calculation of risk reduction and harms from published data in two random controlled trials and one population-based implementation study. Analysis of risk reductions in geographical areas with varying baseline risks. Comparison of results concerning COVID-19 vaccine and selected prior vaccines. SETTINGRandom controlled trials of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in multiple countries; population-based study using Pfizer vaccine in Israel. Counties with varying baseline risks in the United States; states with varying baseline risks in India. PARTICIPANTS43,448 and 30,420 subjects in the random controlled trials; 1,198,236 subjects in the population-based study. INTERVENTIONSMulti-site random controlled trials of vaccine efficacy; population-based administration of vaccine with determination of effectiveness by comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESRelative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to be vaccinated to prevent one symptomatic infection (NNV), absolute risk of the intervention (ARI), and number needed to harm (NNH). RESULTSA systematic review of literature in medicine and public health showed very few reports regarding ARR, NNV, ARI, and NNH; use of these indicators to compare benefits versus harms; or analysis of these EBM indicators in the context of varying baseline risks. From data in the two random controlled trials and one population-based study, calculated ARR was approximately 1 percent (as compared to RRR of 50 to 95 percent), and NNV was in the range of 100 to 500. In comparisons of ARR and NNV versus ARI and NNH, benefits and harms were not markedly different. From a sensitivity analysis of ARR and NNV in population groups with varying baseline risks, the effectiveness of vaccines as measured by ARR and NNV was substantially higher in regions with high as compared to low baseline risks. The ARR for COVID-19 vaccines was somewhat smaller and the NNV somewhat larger than achieved by some vaccines to prevent influenza and smallpox. CONCLUSIONThe efficacy and effectiveness of major COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by RRR, are impressive. As measured by ARR and NNV, which take into account variation in baseline risks, the effectiveness of the vaccines is substantially higher in areas with higher baseline risks. This finding can contribute to educational efforts, informed consent procedures, and policy making about priorities for vaccine distribution, especially under conditions of access barriers linked to poverty and inequality. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICMajor COVID-19 vaccines so far have shown impressive efficacy in random controlled trials and effectiveness in population-based studies. To determine efficacy and effectiveness, these studies have used relative risk reduction (RRR), which shows the difference in event rate between those receiving and not receiving a vaccine. Reports of efficacy and effectiveness have not yet clarified other key indicators from evidence-based medicine (EBM) that consider variations baseline risks. Such indicators include measures of benefits such as absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to be vaccinated (NNV), as well as measures of harm such as absolute risk of the intervention (ARI) and number needed to harm (NNH). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSFor COVID-19 vaccines, calculated ARR is somewhat lower and NNV somewhat higher than for certain prior vaccines such as those for influenza and smallpox. Indicators of harm for COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARI and NNH, appear to be in the same order of magnitude as indicators of benefit such as ARR and NNV. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARR and NNV, is substantially higher in geographical areas with high baseline risk, compared to areas with low baseline risk. These findings can assist in informed consent procedures, educational efforts, and priority setting in policies about distribution of vaccines, especially in the context of access barriers related to poverty and inequality.","Larkin, Andrew; Waitzkin, Howard",,,635

501206,Development of the green entrepreneurial mindset through modern entrepreneurship education,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mortality rates in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in the UK appeared to decline during the first wave of the pandemic. We aimed to quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital. METHODS: In this multicentre prospective observational cohort study, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 247 acute hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales during the first wave of the pandemic (between March 9 and Aug 2, 2020). We included all patients aged 18 years and older with clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19 (by RT-PCR test) from assumed community-acquired infection. We did a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and in-hospital mortality, adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness) and quantifying potential mediators (level of respiratory support and steroid treatment). The primary outcome was weekly in-hospital mortality at 28 days, defined as the proportion of patients who had died within 28 days of admission of all patients admitted in the observed week, and it was assessed in all patients with an outcome. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN66726260. FINDINGS: Between March 9, and Aug 2, 2020, we recruited 80 713 patients, of whom 63 972 were eligible and included in the study. Unadjusted weekly in-hospital mortality declined from 32·3% (95% CI 31·8-32·7) in March 9 to April 26, 2020, to 16·4% (15·0-17·8) in June 15 to Aug 2, 2020. Reductions in mortality were observed in all age groups, in all ethnic groups, for both sexes, and in patients with and without comorbidities. After adjustment, there was a 32% reduction in the risk of mortality per 7-week period (odds ratio [OR] 0·68 [95% CI 0·65-0·71]). The higher proportions of patients with severe disease and comorbidities earlier in the first wave (March and April) than in June and July accounted for 10·2% of this reduction. The use of respiratory support changed during the first wave, with gradually increased use of non-invasive ventilation over the first wave. Changes in respiratory support and use of steroids accounted for 22·2%, OR 0·95 (0·94-0·95) of the reduction in in-hospital mortality. INTERPRETATION: The reduction in in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in the case-mix and illness severity. A significant reduction in in-hospital mortality was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which could partly reflect accrual of clinical knowledge. The remaining improvement in in-hospital mortality is not explained by these factors, and could be associated with changes in community behaviour, inoculum dose, and hospital capacity strain.

502761,The impact of COVID-19 on the mobility of Transjakarta passengers,2021,"Following the announcement on December 2020 about the emergence of a new variant (VOC 202012/ 01, B.1.1.7 lineage) in the United Kingdom, a targeted surveillance was put in place in the Abruzzo region (Italy), which allowed detection of 313 persons affected by lineage B.1.1.7, up to the 20th of February 2021. We investigated the results of RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs tested from December 2020 to February 2021 to verify any difference on the viral load and persistence between people infected by lineage B.1.1.7 and others. Statistically significant lower values of CT associated with the detection of the N protein encoding gene (CT N) were observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection (median CT N = 15.8)in comparison to those infected by other lineages (median CT N = 16.9). A significantly longer duration of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection (16 days) in comparison to those infected by other lineages (14 days).","Calistri, Paolo; Amato, Laura; Puglia, Ilaria; Cito, Francesca; Di Giuseppe, Alessandra; Danzetta, Maria Luisa; Morelli, Daniela; Di Domenico, Marco; Caporale, Marialuigia; Scialabba, Silvia; Portanti, Ottavio; Curini, Valentina; Perletta, Fabrizia; Cammà, Cesare; Ancora, Massimo; Savini, Giovanni; Migliorati, Giacomo; D039,; Alterio, Nicola; Lorusso, Alessio",Int J Infect Dis,,635

Researchers have used different names for the same ORF or the same name for different ORFs, resulting in erroneous homological and functional inferences. We propose standard names for these ORFs and their shorter isoforms, developed in consultation with the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. We recommend calling the 39 codon Spike-overlapping ORF ORF2b; the 41, 57, and 22 codon ORF3a-overlapping ORFs ORF3c, ORF3d, and ORF3b; the 33 codon ORF3d isoform ORF3d-2; and the 97 and 73 codon Nucleocapsid-overlapping ORFs ORF9b and ORF9c. Finally, we document conflicting usage of the name ORF3b in 32 studies, and consequent erroneous inferences, stressing the importance of reserving identical names for homologs. We recommend that authors referring to these ORFs provide lengths and coordinates to minimize ambiguity caused by prior usage of alternative names.","Jungreis, Irwin; Nelson, Chase W; Ardern, Zachary; Finkel, Yaara; Krogan, Nevan J; Sato, Kei; Ziebuhr, John; Stern-Ginossar, Noam; Pavesi, Angelo; Firth, Andrew E; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Kellis, Manolis",Virology,,635

595721,Interferon lambda inhibits dengue virus replication in epithelial cells,2015-09-28,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic has infected millions of people. The conjunctival epithelium is easily exposed to infectious droplets and body fluids making eyes a potential route and reservoir of the infection. The CD147 and ACE2 receptor has been demonstrated in ocular surface cells, which implies that these cells may facilitate as a portal of entry for transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Despite low viral load in tears and conjunctival swab, the negative RT-PCR results cannot exclude the possibility of the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in ocular secretions. Pathogens might be transported by constant tear flow through the lacrimal duct system to the respiratory tract causing infection. Eyes are unlikely to be the main transmission route, however, their role in the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 cannot be overlooked. Therefore, proper eye protection should be instituted while attending Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 positive individuals, especially by health professionals.","Thapa, Bibechan",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508449/; https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.5634,635

METHODS: We calculated infection and death rates amongst US hospital workers per 100 COVID-19-related deaths in the general population based on observed numbers in Hubei, China, and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker (HW) infections in the US based on each of these two scenarios. We also assessed the impact of restricting hospital workers aged ≥ 60 years from performing patient care activities on these estimates. RESULTS: We estimated that about 53,000 hospital workers in the US could get infected, and 1579 could die due to COVID19. The availability of PPE for high-risk workers alone could reduce this number to about 28,000 infections and 850 deaths. Restricting high-risk hospital workers such as those aged ≥ 60 years from direct patient care could reduce counts to 2,000 healthcare worker infections and 60 deaths. CONCLUSION: We estimate that US hospital workers will bear a significant burden of illness due to COVID-19. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing the exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could mitigate these risks.","Razzak, Junaid A.; Bhatti, Junaid A.; Tahir, Muhammad Ramzan; Pasha-Razzak, Omrana",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275599/,635
