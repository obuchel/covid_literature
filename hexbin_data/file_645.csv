21365,The Efficacy of 18F-FDG PET/CT and Superparamagnetic Nanoferric Oxide MRI in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer and the Value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis,2021-09-11,"OBJECTIVE: The study objective of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness of vaborem (meropenem-vaborbactam) compared to the best available therapy (BAT) in adult patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae—Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (CRE-KPC) infections from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS). METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for Vaborem compared to BAT in CRE-KPC patients over a 5 year time horizon. The model structure for Vaborem simulated the clinical pathway of patients with a confirmed CRE-KPC infection. Model inputs for clinical effectiveness were sourced from the TANGO II trial, and published literature. Costs, resource use and utility values associated with CRE-KPC infections in the UK were sourced from the British National Formulary, NHS reference costs and published sources. RESULTS: Over a 5 year time horizon, Vaborem use increased total costs by £5165 and increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.366, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,113 per QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of discharge to long-term care (LTC), the annual cost of LTC and the utility of discharge to home. At thresholds of £20,000/QALY and £30,000/QALY, the probability of Vaborem being cost-effective compared to BAT was 79.85% and 94.93%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to a limited cost impact and increase in patient quality of life, vaborem can be considered as a cost-effective treatment option compared to BAT for adult patients with CRE-KPC infections in the UK.

39771,Atrium,2020-09-23,"Prior literature has shown that school learning climate is critical in helping individual learners meet their educational objectives. In this paper, the role of parental involvement in shaping the school learning climate is explored within a multilevel and hierarchical modeling framework using data from the 2015 PISA round. As the schools’ social and relational character, we find that reducing learning barriers is a critical challenge for school leadership. A welcoming environment for parents, as well as the effective design of effective forms of two-way communications, are positively associated with a substantial reduction in the barriers to improving teacher management’s learning climate. We also find that public schools facing social and educational inclusiveness challenges can dramatically enhance their learning environment by activating specific parental involvement mechanisms. Similarly, principal’s leadership in framing and communicating goals and curricular development to the school is also found to be significant for inclusiveness. However, parental involvement is also found to have potential tensions with school management. The worsening of the learning climate may arise due to pressures brought about by laws requiring parental involvement in schools. Because the learning climate is composed of a wide variety of relationships between and within schools, this work demonstrates that parental involvement is an integral part of school leadership and the school improvement process. Further research attention is encouraged to understand the tensions between teacher roles, principal leadership, and parental involvement through employing other quantitative or qualitative research designs.","Alinsunurin, Jason",Smart Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7504873/,645

60860,Depicting medullary thyroid cancer recurrence: the past and the future of nuclear medicine imaging.,2013,"Among U.S. men, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death (1). Past studies documented decreasing incidence of prostate cancer overall since 2000 but increasing incidence of distant stage prostate cancer (i.e., signifying spread to parts of the body remote from the primary tumor) starting in 2010 (2,3). Past studies described disparities in prostate cancer survival by stage, age, and race/ethnicity using data covering ≤80% of the U.S. population (4,5). To provide recent data on incidence and survival of prostate cancer in the United States, CDC analyzed data from population-based cancer registries that contribute to U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS).* Among 3.1 million new cases of prostate cancer recorded during 2003-2017, localized, regional, distant, and unknown stage prostate cancer accounted for 77%, 11%, 5%, and 7% of cases, respectively, but the incidence of distant stage prostate cancer significantly increased during 2010-2017. During 2001-2016, 10-year relative survival for localized stage prostate cancer was 100%. Overall, 5-year survival for distant stage prostate cancer improved from 28.7% during 2001-2005 to 32.3% during 2011-2016; for the period 2001-2016, 5-year survival was highest among Asian/Pacific Islanders (API) (42.0%), followed by Hispanics (37.2%), American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) (32.2%), Black men (31.6%), and White men (29.1%). Understanding incidence and survival differences by stage, race/ethnicity, and age can guide public health planning related to screening, treatment, and survivor care. Future research into differences by stage, race/ethnicity, and age could inform interventions aimed at improving disparities in outcomes.","Siegel, David A; O'Neil, Mary Elizabeth; Richards, Thomas B; Dowling, Nicole F; Weir, Hannah K",MMWR.

61933,Safety Matters: A Meta-analysis of Interhospital Transport Adverse Events in Critically Ill Patients.,2021,"OBJECTIVE To explore the potential targets, signal pathways and biological functions that mediate the effect of Lianhua Qingwen capsule in improving clinical cure rate of COVID-19 in light of network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. METHODS TCMSP, Target, Prediction, CooLGeN, GeneCards, DAVID and other databases were searched for the active components and their target proteins from 13 herbs including Forsythia, Honeysuckle and roasted Ephedra used in Lianhua Qingwen capsule. The common target proteins, signal pathways and biological functions shared by these components and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (fever, cough, and fatigue) were identified to construct the network consisting of the component drugs in Lianhua Qingwen capsule, the active ingredients of, their targets of action, and the biological functions involved using Gephi software. RESULTS A total 160 active components including MOL000522, and MOL003283, MOL003365, MOL003006, MOL003014 in 13 component drugs in Lianhua Qingwen capsule produced therapeutic effects against COVID-19 through 57 target proteins including MAPK1, IL6, HSP90AA1, TNF, and CCL2, involving 35 signaling pathways including NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that 83 chemical components had total scores no less than 5.0 for docking with 12 target proteins (including MAPK1, IL6, and HSP90AA1) with high binding activities to form stable conformations. The binding of MOL000522, MOL004989, and MOL003330 with MAPK1; MOL001495 and MOL001494 with NLRP3; MOL004908, MOL004863 and MOL004806 with HSP90AA1; MOL001749 with TLR9; and MOL001495 with AKT1 all had total scores exceeding 9.0. CONCLUSIONS Lianhua Qingwen capsule contains multiple effective ingredients to improve clinical cure rate of COVID-19, and its therapeutic effect is mediated by multiple protein targets, signal pathways and biological functions.","Yan, Haiyan; Zou, Chuncai",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2021.01.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509749/,645

Cryogels functionalized with amino acids were prepared and characterized through morphological, hydrodynamic, and thermal analyses. The adsorption capacities of cryogel-Phe and cryogel-Trp were evaluated in terms of type (sodium sulfate or sodium phosphate) and concentration (0.02 or 0.10 mol∙L-1) of saline solution, pH (4.0, 5.5, or 7.0), and NaCl concentration (0.0 or 0.5 mol∙L-1). The cryogel-Phe presented a higher adsorptive capacity, achieving its maximum value (q = 92.53 mg∙g-1) when the crude OPN crude leaf extract was diluted in sodium sulfate 0.02 mol∙L-1 + NaCl 0.50 mol∙L-1, at pH = 7.0. The dilution rate significantly (p < 0.05) affected the recovered protein amount after the adsorption and elution processes, reaching 94.45% when the feedstock solution was prepared with a crude extract 5 times. The zeta potential for the eluted OPN proteins was 5.76 mV (pH = 3.23) for both dilution rates. The secondary structure composition mainly included β-sheets (46.50%) and α-helices (13.93%). The cryogel-Phe exhibited interconnected pores ranging 20-300 μm in size, with a Young modulus of 1.51 MPa, and thermal degradation started at 230 °C. These results indicate that the cryogel-Phe exhibited satisfactory properties as promising chromatography support for use in high-throughput purification of crude leaf extract-derived OPN proteins.","Cristina Oliveira Neves, Isabelle; Aparecida Rodrigues, Adrise; Teixeira Valentim, Thamires; Cristina Freitas de Oliveira Meira, Ana; Henrique Silva, Sérgio; Ayra Alcântara Veríssimo, Lizzy; Vilela de Resende, Jaime","Journal of chromatography.

68195,Effect of angiogenesis induced by consecutive intramuscular injections of vascular endothelial growth factor in a hindlimb ischemic mouse model.,2014,"BACKGROUND A large number of studies have examined the potential complications of calf deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is no consensus on when or how to treat patients to prevent these complications. This systematic review assessed the rate of proximal propagation, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding and recurrence in patients with isolated calf DVT. METHODS Database searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science were undertaken along with extensive cross-referencing. Two independent reviewers screened the papers using stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies were graded on six methodological standards. Data on propagation, pulmonary embolism, recurrence and major bleeding were abstracted. RESULTS A total of 4261 papers were found; 15 met the inclusion criteria, including five randomized clinical trials and ten prospective cohort studies. The propagation rate to the popliteal vein or above was around 9 per cent and the rate of pulmonary embolism was close to 1·5 per cent. No studies found anticoagulant therapy to reduce the rate of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION The literature on calf DVT is heterogeneous, limiting conclusions from data analysis. Adverse outcomes are infrequent and studies do not suggest that they are reduced by anticoagulation.","Garry, J; Duke, A; Labropoulos, N",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27060255/,645
68391,The SNM practice guideline for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 2.0.,2011,"Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard for evaluating treatment efficacy. However, observational studies including non-randomized cohort studies as well as small RCTs have gained increasing attention especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where critical evaluation of limited therapeutic options are sought to improve patient care while awaiting results for subsequent randomized controlled trials. As the authors have previously discussed, RCTs and observational studies are complementary approaches which often appear synergistic with one another. While not all real-world studies are the same, the results of observational studies are notoriously subject to both known and unknown confounding factors. The utilization of COVID-9 Convalescent Plasma is a timely illustration of evaluating the efficacy and safety of a COVID-19 therapy given the dangerous and often lethal effects of the virus and the limited approved therapeutic options for the disease. While awaiting the results of large RCTS of convalescent plasma, serval observational cohorts and small RCTs have attempted to assess the efficacy and safety of this approach with very mixed results. Among the likely reasons for this failure to provide a definitive answer concerning the value of convalescent plasma are the many limitations inherent to addressing treatment efficacy in non-randomized studies. While such studies are often able to capture information on large numbers of individuals rapidly, it is important to understand that although larger numbers may enhance the precision of estimates provided, larger numbers, in and of themselves, do not increase the accuracy of estimates due to patient selection and other biases. At the same time, both observational studies and small RCTS are constantly at risk for publication bias due to investigator, reviewer and editorial bias toward positive studies. In this commentary we discuss the advantages and limitations of these methodologic approaches when addressing urgently needed evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapies in a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lyman, Gary H; Desai, Aakash; Leyfman, Yan; Kuderer, Nicole M",Cancer investigation,https://doi.org/10.1080/07357907.2021.1942127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134587/,645
69447,Long-Term Care: Efforts Supported By Foundations.,2018,"OBJECTIVES (1) To determine how pregnancy affects idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) symptoms. (2) To determine treatments utilized (including operating room (OR) and in-office procedures) for iSGS before, during, and after pregnancy. METHODS A 24-question survey was distributed to an international iSGS support group to assess the patient experience among individuals who have been pregnant with diagnosis of iSGS. Descriptive statistics and chi2 analyses were completed. RESULTS A total of 413 iSGS patients participated; 84.7% (n = 350) of patients were diagnosed prior to menopause. A total of 25.5% patients reported being pregnant when they had airway stenosis; 71.1% of those reported more severe airway symptoms during pregnancy. The proportion of patients that reported requiring ≥1 OR interventions (microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, laser, balloon dilation, or steroid injection) before, during and after pregnancy was the following, respectively: 37.3%, 35.6%, 51.3%. Whereas the proportion of patients that reported requiring ≥1 in-office interventions (awake balloon dilation or steroid injection) before, during and after pregnancy was the following, respectively: 13.6%, 11.8%, 15.8%. Number of pregnancies and age of diagnosis was not related to severity of symptoms or requiring more airway interventions (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS This survey reveals worsening of symptoms during pregnancy, however, this did not lead to increase in operative or clinic interventions to improve airway symptoms during pregnancy. Future avenues for research include optimizing management of airway symptoms during pregnancy to limit OR-based interventions.

71935,Evaluating the Reliability and Validity Evidence of the RIME (Reporter-Interpreter-Manager-Educator) Framework for Summative Assessments Across Clerkships.,2020-10-27,"OBJECTIVE The first objective of this scoping review is to identify all the tools designed to measure movement or mobility in adults. The second objective is to compare the tools to the conceptual definitions of movement and mobility by mapping them to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). INTRODUCTION The concepts of movement and mobility are distinct concepts that are often conflated, and the differences are important to patient care. Movement is a change in the place or position of a part of the body or of the whole body. Mobility is derived from movement and is defined as the ability to move with ease. Researchers and clinicians, including nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists who work with older adults and in rehabilitation, need to be confident that they are measuring the outcome of interest. INCLUSION CRITERIA This scoping review considered studies that included participants that are adults, aged 19 and older, with any level of ability or disability. The concepts of interest are tools that measure movement or mobility relative to the human body. Studies were considered regardless of country of origin, health care setting, or sociocultural setting. METHODS CINAHL, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched in June 2018 and OpenGrey, Dissertation Abstracts International, and Google Scholar were searched in November 2018. The searches were limited to articles in English, and the date range was from the inception of the database to the current date. Data were extracted from the studies using a custom data extraction tool. Once tools were identified for analysis, they were coded using the table format developed by Cieza and colleagues. RESULTS There were 702 unique tools identified, with 651 of them available to be coded for the ICF. There were 385 ICF codes used when coding the tools. From these codes, the percentage of codes of the defining attributes of movement and mobility that were covered could be calculated as well as the percentage of tool items that were linked to the antecedents, consequences, or defining attributes of movement or mobility. CONCLUSIONS Although there are many tools that measure only movement or mobility, there are many that measure a mixture of the defining attributes as well as the antecedents and consequences. The tool name alone should not be considered a guarantee of the concept measured, and tool selection should be done with a critical eye. This study provides a starting point from which clinicians and researchers can find tools that measure the concepts of movement and mobility of interest and importance to their patient population.","Moulton, Elizabeth; Wilson, Rosemary; Silva, Amina Regina; Kircher, Colleen; Petry, Stéfany; Goldie, Catherine; Medves, Jennifer; Deluzio, Kevin; Ross-White, Amanda",JBI evidence synthesis,https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-d-19-00366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323776/,645
73410,ERRATUM.,2021-07-23,"H5N1 avian influenza viruses remain a threat to public health mainly because they can cause severe infections in humans. These viruses are widespread in birds, and they vary in antigenicity forming three major clades and numerous antigenic variants. The most important features of the human monoclonal antibody FLD194 studied here are its broad specificity for all major clades of H5 influenza HAs, its high affinity, and its ability to block virus infection, in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence, this antibody may be suitable for anti-H5 therapy and as a component of stockpiles, together with other antiviral agents, for health authorities to use if an appropriate vaccine was not available. Our mutation and structural analyses indicate that the antibody recognizes a relatively conserved site near the membrane distal tip of HA, near to, but distinct from, the receptor-binding site. Our analyses also suggest that the mechanism of infectivity neutralization involves prevention of receptor recognition as a result of steric hindrance by the Fc part of the antibody. Structural analyses by EM indicate that three Fab fragments are bound to each HA trimer. The structure revealed by X-ray crystallography is of an HA monomer bound by one Fab. The monomer has some similarities to HA in the fusion pH conformation, and the monomer's formation, which results from the presence of isopropanol in the crystallization solvent, contributes to considerations of the process of change in conformation required for membrane fusion.","Xiong, Xiaoli; Corti, Davide; Liu, Junfeng; Pinna, Debora; Foglierini, Mathilde; Calder, Lesley J; Martin, Stephen R; Lin, Yi Pu; Walker, Philip A; Collins, Patrick J; Monne, Isabella; Suguitan, Amorsolo L; Santos, Celia; Temperton, Nigel J; Subbarao, Kanta; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Gamblin, Steven J; Skehel, John J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1510816112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26170284/,645

However, the specific mechanism for that improvement remains unclear. We examined whether the curcumin derivative galangin could reduce the fatty degeneration of liver tissue in mice with NAFLD by inducing autophagy, from the perspective of both prevention and treatment. Methods C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a prevention group (given galangin and a HFD simultaneously) or a treatment group (given galangin after being fed an HFD). The prevention group was treated with galangin (100 mg/kg/d) or an equal volume of normal saline (NS) while being fed an HFD. Some mice were treated with an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA; 30 mg/kg/biwk, i.p.) while being fed an HFD and galangin. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing both free fatty acids and galangin. Results Galangin was found to reduce the fatty degeneration of liver tissue induced by eating an HFD at both the prevention and treatment levels, and that effect might be related to an enhancement of hepatocyte autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA blocked the protective effect of galangin on hepatic steatosis. At the cellular level, galangin reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced the level of hepatocyte autophagy. Conclusion In vitro and in vivo studies showed that galangin cannot only improve pre-existing hepatic steatosis but also prevent the development of stenosis by promoting hepatocyte autophagy.","Zhang, Xinxu; Deng, Yuanyuan; Xiang, Juan; Liu, Huixia; Zhang, Jiani; Liao, Jie; Chen, Ke; Liu, Bo; Liu, Jun; Pu, Ying","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s258187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884242/,645

Morbidly obese (BMI >40 kg/m(2)) patients present as an especially challenging surgical cohort. We sought to evaluate the perioperative and pathologic outcomes associated with EP-RARP in morbidly obese men. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this institutional review board-approved study, our prospectively collected database (Cancer Information Systems [CAISIS]) was reviewed. One thousand six hundred sixty-three patients underwent EP-RARP for localized prostate cancer at our institution between July 2003 and December 2013 by a single surgeon. Forty patients were considered morbidly obese. A propensity score-matched analysis was performed using multivariate analysis incorporating 10 covariates to identify the comparable group of patients with a BMI of >40 kg/m(2) and <40 kg/m(2). RESULTS Apart from BMI, the two groups were matched (all p-values >0.05). Despite a higher total operating time and estimated blood loss (EBL) in the morbidly obese (238 vs 176 minutes, p<0.0001, and 235 vs 192 mL, p=0.003, respectively), there were no differences in the ability to perform nerve-sparing or pelvic lymphadenectomy, or the length of stay. While the morbidly obese had a higher rate of harboring more aggressive disease on final pathology (pT3 rates, 27.5 vs 7.5%, respectively), there were no differences in other postoperative pathologic parameters, such as prostate specimen weight, positive surgical margin status, and Gleason score sum. Moreover, there were no differences in intra- or postoperative complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The morbidly obese cohort harbored more aggressive disease with the difference in the proportion of pathologic T3 disease statistically significant. Apart from increased total operating time and EBL in the morbid obese, EP-RARP leads to comparable perioperative and pathologic outcomes to the nonmorbidly obese. Consideration should be given to added operating room time when operating on the morbidly obese.","Agrawal, Vineet; Feng, Changyong; Joseph, Jean",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2014.0661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347555/,645

Due to its molecular nature, the fundamental asymmetry of the hydrogen bond, and proton disorder, crystal defects in this condensed form of water reveal a complexity not usually seen in atomic crystalline solids. The discussion is organized in terms of the spatial extent of the defects. We start with zero-dimensional imperfections such as the molecular vacancy and interstitial, Bjerrum, and ionic defects, as well as possible defect complexes that can be formed from them. Subsequently, we turn to the properties of dislocations, which are the one-dimensional disturbances that carry plastic deformation in crystalline solids. Finally, we discuss two-dimensional defects such as stacking faults and grain boundaries and discuss to what extent the latter are similar to other interfaces in ice Ih such as the free surface. We conclude with an outlook at the road ahead, discussing future challenges toward understanding the role of crystal defects in the macroscopic behavior of ice Ih.","de Koning, Maurice",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0019067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962372/,645

Few days later, he monitored an increase in his resting heart rate. This was followed by a dry cough, fatigue, and myalgia. At the same time, symptoms occurred in all four family members. CLINICAL FINDINGS The patient had a dry cough. The medical examination was normal. Heart rate was 60/min, sinus rhythm, body temperature 36.6 °C. Complete anosmia was present. The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from a deep pharyngeal swab was positive in all five family members. THERAPY AND COURSE Symptoms were present for almost two weeks. All family members had anosmia, that started earlier and lasted longer than the other symptoms, and myalgia. Reduced taste sensation, fatigue, dry cough and sore throat were present in four of five persons. Shortness of breath at rest or gastrointestinal symptoms were absent. Four affected persons had sleep disturbances in the later course of the disease. None of the affected persons had raised temperature at any time during the disease. Specific medical or drug treatment was not necessary. All patients made full recoveries without signs of organ dysfunction, and with full restitution of physical strength. DISCUSSION We describe a family of 5 previously healthy persons with a mild course of COVID-19 disease. The symptoms and course are described in detail. Anosmia can precede other symptoms by several days and can indicate an early phase of infection. An increase in resting heart rate can occur in the absence of raised temperature or fever. The symptoms and course are discussed in the context of the ongoing pandemic, and efforts to control infection chains.","Isenmann, Anna; Isenmann, Stefan",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1190-0247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599633/,645

Research in extended reality (XR) technologies can overcome such barriers. These offer a platform for learning, objective skill-monitoring and, potentially, for automated certification. Prior to their incorporation into curricula however, thorough validation must be undertaken. As validity is heavily dependent on the participants recruited, there is a need to review, scrutinise and define recruitment criteria in the absence of pre-defined standards, for sound simulator validation. A systematic review on PubMed and IEEE databases was conducted. Training simulator validation research in fracture, arthroscopy and arthroplasty relating to the hip was included. 46 validation studies were reviewed. It was observed that there was no uniformity in reporting or recruitment criteria, rendering cross-comparison challenging.

98282,Tick-borne rickettsioses in Brazil: what lessons can be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that causes morbidity and mortality in humans. After infection with SARS-CoV, the acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function. A dysregulation in this wound healing process leads to fibrosis. Many survivors of SARS-CoV infection develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), with higher prevalence in older patients. Using mouse models of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, we have identified that the wound repair pathway, controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is critical to recovery from SARS-CoV-induced tissue damage. In mice with constitutively active EGFR [EGFR(DSK5) mice], we find that SARS-CoV infection causes enhanced lung disease. Importantly, we show that during infection, the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) are upregulated, and exogenous addition of these ligands during infection leads to enhanced lung disease and altered wound healing dynamics. Our data demonstrate a key role of EGFR in the host response to SARS-CoV and how it may be implicated in lung disease induced by other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses.IMPORTANCE PF has many causative triggers, including severe respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV. Currently there are no treatments to prevent the onset or limit the progression of PF, and the molecular pathways underlying the development of PF are not well understood. In this study, we identified a role for the balanced control of EGFR signaling as a key factor in progression to PF. These data demonstrate that therapeutic treatment modulating EGFR activation could protect against PF development caused by severe respiratory virus infection.","Venkataraman, Thiagarajan; Coleman, Christopher M; Frieman, Matthew B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00182-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28404843/,645

102508,Clinical trials in molecular imaging: the importance of following the protocol.,2011,"BACKGROUND Aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions is a major factor in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A tapered-cuff endotracheal tube (ETT) has been demonstrated to reduce aspiration around the cuff. Whether these properties are efficacious in reducing VAP is not known. METHODS This 2-period, investigator-initiated observational study was designed to assess the efficacy of a tapered-cuff ETT to reduce the VAP rate. All intubated, mechanically ventilated patients over the age of 18 were included. During the baseline period a standard, barrel-shaped-cuff ETT (Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo) was used. All ETTs throughout the hospital were then replaced with a tapered-cuff ETT (TaperGuard). The primary outcome variable was the incidence of VAP per 1,000 ventilator days. RESULTS We included 2,849 subjects, encompassing 15,250 ventilator days. The mean ± SD monthly VAP rate was 3.29 ± 1.79/1,000 ventilator days in the standard-cuff group and 2.77 ± 2.00/1,000 ventilator days in the tapered-cuff group (P = .65). While adherence to the VAP prevention bundle was high throughout the study, bundle adherence was significantly higher during the standard-cuff period (96.5 ± 2.7%) than in the tapered-cuff period (90.3 ± 3.5%, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS In the setting of a VAP rate very near the average of ICUs in the United States, and where there was high adherence to a VAP prevention bundle, the use of a tapered-cuff ETT was not associated with a reduction in the VAP rate.","Bowton, David L; Hite, R Duncan; Martin, R Shayn; Sherertz, Robert",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23431308/,645

Considering its easy access, cerebral imaging using FP-CT is an appealing modality for intra-procedural applications. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FP-CT compared with perfusion computed tomography (CTP) and perfusion magnetic resonance (MRP) in cerebral perfusion imaging. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science up to June 2019 for studies directly comparing FP-CT with either CTP or MRP in vivo. Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data on diagnostic accuracy was extracted and pooled if possible. RESULTS We found 11 studies comparing FP-CT with CTP and 5 studies comparing FP-CT with MRP. Most articles were pilot or feasibility studies, focusing on scanning and contrast protocols. All patients studied showed signs of cerebrovascular disease. Half of the studies were animal trials. Quality assessment showed unclear to high risks of bias and low concerns regarding applicability. Five studies reported on diagnostic accuracy; FP-CT shows good sensitivity (range 0.84-1.00) and moderate specificity (range 0.63-0.88) in detecting cerebral blood volume (CBV) lesions. CONCLUSIONS Even though FP-CT provides similar CBV values and reconstructed blood volume maps as CTP in cerebrovascular disease, additional studies are required in order to reliably compare its diagnostic accuracy with cerebral perfusion imaging.","Stille, Ernst L; Viozzi, Ilaria; Ter Laan, Mark; Meijer, Frederick J A; Futterer, Jurgen J; Rovers, Maroeska M",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-019-02285-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523757/,645

However, laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy (LESSC) is a controversial procedure. Its safety, cosmetic results, complications, post-operative pain and post-operative stay are not confirmed by multi-centre randomized controlled studies. OBJECTIVES This review examined the impact of LESSC versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). The primary outcomes were conversional rate and intraoperative and post-operative complications, and other outcomes were cosmetic results, operative time, post-operative pain and post-operative stay. DATA SOURCES Pubmed, EMbase, Web of Science, Ovid, clinical trials of the US National Institutes of Health and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register were searched to identify all possible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS Two reviewers completed article search, and eligible data were entered into a computerized spreadsheet for analysis. RESULTS Nine studies were obtained using the search strategy. Patients accepting LESSC had a higher conversion rate than those having CLC (7.17 (3.00, 17.11) (P < 0.01)). There was no significant difference for total complications between the two groups (1.17 (0.76, 1.80) (P = 0.46)), but incidence of incisional hernia and haemorrhage (seroma) in the LESSC group was obviously higher than that in the CLC group. Operative time was much longer in the LESSC group (mean difference: 10.69 (3.14, 18.24) (P = 0.006)). Cosmetic results favoured LESSC; however, post-operative abdominal pain and post-operative stay were not significantly different between the two groups in most of the nine studies. CONCLUSIONS LESSC can be safely performed with better cosmetic results; however, it carries a higher conversion rate and a longer operative time, and offers no benefit in terms of post-operative abdominal pain and post-operative stay. Further RCTs, according to the CONSORT statement, are advocated to validate its objective benefits.","Wang, Dong; Wang, Yan; Ji, Zhen-Ling",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-2197.2012.06044.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22507275/,645

The purpose of this study was to determine whether patterns of resting-state connectivity between brain regions predict differential outcome to antidepressant medication (sertraline) compared with placebo. METHODS Participants in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI at baseline. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo treatment for 8 weeks (N=279). A region of interest-based approach was utilized to compute functional connectivity between brain regions. Linear mixed-model intent-to-treat analyses were used to identify brain regions that moderated (i.e., differentially predicted) outcomes between the sertraline and placebo arms. RESULTS Prediction of response to sertraline involved several within- and between-network connectivity patterns. In general, higher connectivity within the default mode network predicted better outcomes specifically for sertraline, as did greater between-network connectivity of the default mode and executive control networks. In contrast, both placebo and sertraline outcomes were predicted (in opposite directions) by between-network hippocampal connectivity. CONCLUSIONS This study identified specific functional network-based moderators of treatment outcome involving brain networks known to be affected by major depression. Specifically, functional connectivity patterns of brain regions between and within networks appear to play an important role in identifying a favorable response for a drug treatment for major depressive disorder.","Chin Fatt, Cherise R; Jha, Manish K; Cooper, Crystal M; Fonzo, Gregory; South, Charles; Grannemann, Bruce; Carmody, Thomas; Greer, Tracy L; Kurian, Benji; Fava, Maurizio; McGrath, Patrick J; Adams, Phillip; McInnis, Melvin; Parsey, Ramin V; Weissman, Myrna; Phillips, Mary L; Etkin, Amit; Trivedi, Madhukar H",The American journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18070870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537090/,645

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-six CT angiograms were obtained in 74 patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute GI hemorrhage of an unknown source. Results of CT angiography were recorded, and the patients' electronic medical records were reviewed for documentation of subsequent interventional procedures performed within 24 hours of the reference CT angiogram to diagnose or control ongoing GI hemorrhage. Surgical, endoscopic, and final pathologic reports, if available, were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-two of the 86 CT angiograms (26%) were positive for active hemorrhage, with findings confirmed in 19 of the 22 cases (86%). Thirteen cases were confirmed with angiography, five cases were confirmed with surgery, and one case was confirmed with autopsy. Sixty-four of the 86 CT angiograms were negative, and 59 (92%) of the CT angiograms required no further intervention. These patients were discharged without incident. There were no cases in which CT angiography was negative and subsequent angiography within 24 hours was positive. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive value of CT angiography in the detection of active GI hemorrhage within this study population were 79%, 95%, 91%, 86%, and 92%, respectively.

115350,The world haunted by Covid-19.,2020,"BACKGROUND People affected by leprosy are at increased risk of ulcers from peripheral nerve damage. This in turn can lead to visible impairments, stigmatisation and economic marginalisation. Health care providers suggest that patients should be empowered to self-manage their condition to improve outcomes and reduce reliance on services. Self-care involves carrying out personal care tasks with the aim of preventing disabilities or preventing further deterioration. Self-help, on the other hand, addresses the wider psychological, social and economic implications of leprosy and incorporates, for example, skills training and microfinance schemes. The aim of this study, known as SHERPA (Self-Help Evaluation for lepRosy and other conditions in NePAl) is to evaluate a service intervention called Integrated Mobilization of People for Active Community Transformation (IMPACT) designed to encourage both self-care and self-help in marginalised people including those affected by leprosy. METHODS A mixed-method evaluation study in Province 5, Nepal comprising two parts. First, a prospective, cluster-based, non-randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of self-help groups on ulcer metrics (people affected by leprosy only) and on four generic outcome measures (all participants) - generic health status, wellbeing, social integration and household economic performance. Second, a qualitative study to examine the implementation and fidelity of the intervention. IMPACT This research will provide information on the effectiveness of combined self-help and self-care groups, on quality of life, social integration and economic wellbeing for people living with leprosy, disability or who are socially and economically marginalised in low- and middle- income countries.","Shrestha, Dilip; Napit, Indra B; Ansari, Subi; Choudhury, Sopna Mannan; Dhungana, Bishnu; Gill, Paramjit; Griffiths, Frances; Gwyther, Holly; Hagge, Deanna; Kandel, Shovakhar; Puri, Suraj; Sartori, Jo; Watson, Samuel Ian; Lilford, Richard",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10847-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957899/,645

METHODS Forty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in this study and were divided randomly into two groups, which were treated by the standard PR technique (standard PR group; n = 24) or the three-layer PR technique using peritoneum (three-layer PR group; n = 24) during RARP. We prospectively analyzed the continence rate by the 1-hour pad test. All patients underwent urethrocystography at 6 days postoperatively to evaluate position of vesicourethral junction. Pelvic MRI was also performed at 6 months postoperatively for anatomical evaluation. RESULTS Four weeks after RARP, the urinary continence rate was significantly higher in the three-layer PR group (57%) than in the standard PR group (26%, p = 0.036). Urethrocystography demonstrated that the postoperative craniocaudal distance from the symphysis pubis to the level of the vesicourethral junction was significantly shorter in the three-layer PR group than in the standard PR group (p < 0.01), suggesting that there was less tension on the vesicourethral anastomosis after three-layer PR. MRI confirmed that three-layer PR provided firmer reinforcement of the structures, supporting the posterior aspect of the urethral sphincter complex. CONCLUSIONS This prospective comparative study might suggest that three-layer two-step PR using peritoneum during RARP is a simple and feasible method seeming to improve early recovery of postoperative continence compared with standard two-step PR, although larger multicenter randomized controlled trials will be needed.","Ogawa, Soichiro; Hoshi, Seiji; Koguchi, Tomoyuki; Hata, Junya; Sato, Yuichi; Akaihata, Hidenori; Kataoka, Masao; Haga, Nobuhiro; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2017.0410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061068/,645

Currently, few assays are commercially available for veterinary applications, but they are available to identify and measure various cytokines, growth factors and their receptors, inflammatory proteins, kinases and inhibitors, neurobiology proteins, and pathogens and antibodies in human beings, nonhuman primates, and rodent species. In veterinary medicine, various nucleic acid and protein-coupled beads can be used in, or for the development of, antigen and antibody BBMAs, with the advantage that more data can be collected using approximately the same amount of labor as used for other antigen and antibody assays. Veterinary-related BBMAs could be used for detection of pathogens, genotyping, measurement of hormone levels, and in disease surveillance and vaccine assessment. It will be important to evaluate whether BBMAs are ""fit for purpose,"" how costs and efficiencies compare between assays, which assays are published or commercially available for specific veterinary applications, and what procedures are involved in the development of the assays. It is expected that many veterinary-related BBMAs will be published and/or become commercially available in the next few years.

In the current study, we aimed to explore the belief-related psychological factors of wearing facemasks for influenza A/H1N1 prevention in a sample of Hong Kong older adults. Community-dwelling Chinese adults (N = 137) aged between 65 and 80 years (Mage = 75.10; SDage = 6.49) participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using theoretical thematic analysis and identified themes were matched deductively within the belief-based processes of the health belief model. Results revealed beliefs that underpinned 4 general dimensions of facemask wearing: (1) perceived susceptibility and seriousness of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic (e.g., influenza A/H1N1 as contagious and lethal), (2) modifying factors (e.g., social responsibility to prevent influenza), (3) cues to action (e.g., seeing others doing it), and (4) perceived benefits and barriers (e.g., protects oneself and others, difficult to breathe). Future interventions can target these beliefs to improve facemask wearing of older adults and, thus, curb preventable infection rates during an influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.","Zhang, Chun-Qing; Chung, Pak-Kwong; Liu, Jing-Dong; Chan, Derwin K C; Hagger, Martin S; Hamilton, Kyra",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539519844082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007032/,645

126404,Coronavirus 2020.,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND Standard sleeve gastrectomy for the morbidly obese is feasible and safe using the hybrid transvaginal minilaparoscopic-assisted natural orifice surgery (MA-NOS) with available laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments and technology as illustrated by this technical report on a female patient. METHODS The intervention was a transvaginal sleeve gastrectomy in a 67-year-old woman who was hypertensive, noninsulin-dependent with diabetes with morbid obesity (BMI, 37). Operative field view was maintained at all times with a gastroscope introduced through a transvaginal trocar. The surgeon positioned himself at the right side of the patient using a 2-mm needle port/mini-grasper placed in the left upper quadrant for traction of the greater curvature of the stomach. A 12-mm umbilical trocar was used as the port for insertion of the LigaSure device used for division of the short gastric vessels and the Endo-GIA stapler for creation of the gastric tube. The first assistant used a second mini-grasper for liver retraction and stomach positioning. The resected stomach was retrieved through the vagina. There were no intraoperative complications. The operative time was 150 minutes. RESULTS The advantages of minimally invasive surgery seemed to be enhanced with this hybrid laparoscopic approach. Postoperative course was uneventful. All component steps of a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were reproduced. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal hybrid MA-NOS sleeve gastrectomy is both feasible and safe. The hybrid technique ensured safety during the performance of the procedure. MA-NOS is a potential option to avoid abdominal incisions and related complications for the laparoscopic resection of large intra-abdominal organs. Combined hybrid laparoscopic NOS for humans is currently a safe and reliable approach for major surgery through the NOS approach in female patients. Hybrid surgery allows controlled implementation of NOS techniques in clinical practice, providing a stepwise progression to the pure NOS approach once the appropriate technology has been developed. Additionally, it is the best way to stimulate the active development and evaluation of the underpinning technologies and instruments for these novel endoscopic surgical approaches. Appropriate clinical indications for these new procedures are yet to be defined. LSG is associated with short-term excess weight loss and resolution of comorbidities comparable to those obtained with other restrictive procedures. The performance of sleeve gastrectomy is an option in selected patients undergoing bariatric surgical treatment, particularly in the super obese and those who are considered high risk because of comorbid disease.","Lacy, Antonio M; Delgado, Salvadora; Rojas, Oscar A; Ibarzabal, Ainitze; Fernandez-Esparrach, Gloria; Taura, Pilar",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-0292-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19242758/,645

We analyzed relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and phylogenetic relationship between geographical regions, and calculated the genetic substitution patterns between Korean isolate and those from other countries. We calculated the ratios of synonymously substituted codons (SSC) to all observed substitutions and developed a new analytical parameter, EMC (the ratio of exact matching codons within each synonymous substitution group) to investigate more detailed substitution patterns within each synonymous codon group. We observed that FMDVs showed distinct RSCU patterns according to phylogenetic relationships in the same serotype (serotype O). Moreover, while the SSC and EMC values of FMDVs decreased according to phylogenetic distance, G + C composition at the third codon position was strictly conserved. Although there was little variation among the SSC values of 18 amino acids, more dynamic differences were observed in EMC values. The EMC values of 4- and 6-fold degenerate amino acids showed significantly lower values while most 2-fold degenerate amino acids showed no significant difference. Our findings suggest that different EMC patterns among the 18 amino acids might be an important factor in determining the direction of evolution in FMDV.","Ahn, Insung; Bae, Se Eun; Son, Hyeon Seok",Experimental & molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.3858/emm.2011.43.10.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21825834/,645

The architectures of DNNs play a crucial role in their performance, which is usually manually designed with rich expertise. However, such a design process is labor-intensive because of the trial-and-error process and also not easy to realize due to the rare expertise in practice. Neural architecture search (NAS) is a type of technology that can design the architectures automatically. Among different methods to realize NAS, the evolutionary computation (EC) methods have recently gained much attention and success. Unfortunately, there has not yet been a comprehensive summary of the EC-based NAS algorithms. This article reviews over 200 articles of most recent EC-based NAS methods in light of the core components, to systematically discuss their design principles and justifications on the design.

133937,Intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence tumor imaging with vascular endothelial growth factor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 targeting antibodies.,2011,"Phenomenon: Schools are considering the optimal timing of Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). Two primary reasons for moving Step 1 after the core clerkships are to promote deeper, more integrated basic science learning in clinical contexts and to better prepare students for the increasingly clinical focus of Step 1. Positioning Step 1 after the core clerkships leverages a major national assessment to drive learning, encouraging students to deepen their basic science knowledge while in the clinical setting. Previous studies demonstrated small increases in Step 1 scores, reductions in failure rates, and similar Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores when Step 1 was after the clerkships. Some schools that have moved Step 1 reported declines in clinical subject examination (CSE) performance. This may be due to shortened pre-clerkship curricula, the absence of the Step 1 study period for knowledge consolidation, or exposure to fewer National Board of Medical Examiners type questions prior to taking CSEs. This multi-institutional study aimed to determine whether student performance on CSEs was affected by moving Step 1 after the core clerkships. Approach: CSE scores for students from eight schools that moved Step 1 after core clerkships between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed in a pre-post format. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to quantify the effect of the curriculum on CSE performance. Additional analysis determined if clerkship order impacted clinical subject exam performance and whether the curriculum change resulted in more students scoring in the lowest percentiles (as defined as below the national fifth percentile) before and after the curricular change. Findings: After moving Step 1 to after the clerkships, collectively these eight schools demonstrated statistically significant lower performance on four CSEs (Medicine, Neurology, Pediatrics, and Surgery) but not Obstetrics/Gynecology or Psychiatry. Comparing performance within the three years pre and post Step 1 change, differences across all clerkships ranged from 0.3 to -2.0 points, with an average difference of -1.1. CSE performance in clerkships taken early in the sequence was more affected by the curricular change, and differences gradually disappeared with subsequent examinations. Medicine and Neurology showed the largest average differences between curricular-group when taken early in the clinical year. Finally, there was a slightly higher chance of scoring below the national fifth percentile in four of the clinical subject exams (Medicine, Neurology, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry) for the cohort with Step 1 after the clerkships. Insights: Moving Step 1 after core clerkships had a small impact on CSE scores overall, with decreased scores for exams early in the clerkship sequence and an increased number of students below the fifth percentile. Score differences have minor effects on clerkship grades, but overall the size of the effect is unlikely to be educationally meaningful. Schools can use a variety of mitigation strategies to address CSE performance and Step 1 preparation in the clerkship phase.","Jurich, Daniel; Daniel, Michelle; Hauer, Karen E; Seibert, Christine; Chandran, Latha; Pock, Arnyce R; Fazio, Sara B; Fleming, Amy; Santen, Sally A",Teaching and learning in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/10401334.2020.1860063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356583/,645

A retrospective cohort study.,2021-08-16,"The contact structure of a population plays an important role in transmission of infection. Many 'structured models' capture aspects of the contact pattern through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in unstructured models of a disease that confers immunity is that once a fraction [Formula: see text] has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunising higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited 'first wave' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we set out to investigate this more systematically. While networks offer a flexible framework to model contact patterns explicitly, they suffer from several shortcomings: (i) high-fidelity network models require a large amount of data which can be difficult to harvest, and (ii) very few, if any, theoretical contact network models offer the flexibility to tune different contact network properties within the same framework. Therefore, we opt to systematically analyse a number of well-known mean-field models. These are computationally efficient and provide good flexibility in varying contact network properties such as heterogeneity in the number contacts, clustering and household structure or differentiating between local and global contacts. In particular, we consider the question of herd immunity under several scenarios. When modelling interventions as changes in transmission rates, we confirm that in networks with significant degree heterogeneity, the first wave of the epidemic confers herd immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with less or no degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect may become much more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure disproportionately can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and therefore make the second wave more substantial. We strengthen this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. Overall, we find that results regarding (disease-induced) herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of the lockdown and how the lockdown is implemented in the model.","Di Lauro, Francesco; Berthouze, Luc; Dorey, Matthew D; Miller, Joel C; Kiss, István Z",Bulletin of mathematical biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00947-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654959/,645

Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used a respiratory virus surveillance platform in persons of all ages to detect community COVID-19 cases from March 23 to November 9, 2020. A population-based convenience sample of children younger than 18 years and adults in King County, Washington, who enrolled online for home self-collection of upper respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were included. Exposures Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from participant-collected samples. Main Outcomes and Measures RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Ct values stratified by age and symptoms. Results Among 555 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [20.1] years; 320 were female [57.7%]), 47 of 123 children (38.2%) were asymptomatic compared with 31 of 432 adults (7.2%). When symptomatic, fewer symptoms were reported in children compared with adults (mean [SD], 1.6 [2.0] vs 4.5 [3.1]). Symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (which corresponded to higher viral RNA levels) than asymptomatic individuals (adjusted estimate for children, -3.0; 95% CI, -5.5 to -0.6; P = .02; adjusted estimate for adults, -2.9; 95% CI, -5.2 to -0.6; P = .01).

We hypothesized that goal-directed haemodynamic therapy would improve flap survival rates and shorten hospitalization periods. METHODS Patients scheduled for free flap reconstruction were randomly assigned to a goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group (n = 31) or a conventional haemodynamic therapy control group (n = 31). The control group received extra bolus fluid and ephedrine or norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg. The goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group received a colloid solution as the extra bolus fluid to maintain a stroke volume variation < 12%; dobutamine, ephedrine, or norepinephrine was administered to maintain a cardiac index ≥ 2.5 l/min/m2 and mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg. Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols were not used except for fluid therapy. An otolaryngologist blinded to group assignments assessed flap outcomes and classified them as 'survival,' 'at risk' or 'failure.' RESULTS The hospitalization period was not significantly different between the groups. The goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group had significantly shorter intensive care unit stays and a higher flap survival rate. The crystalloid volume was significantly lower in goal-directed haemodynamic therapy group. Reoperation rates, post-operative complications, and laboratory data including inflammatory markers were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION Compared to conventional haemodynamic therapy, goal-directed haemodynamic therapy does not reduce hospitalization periods; it may, however, reduce the length of intensive care unit stays and increase flap survival rates.

The treatment is surgical and single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) involves performing laparoscopic surgery through a single transumbilical point, in an attempt to improve the results of laparoscopic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 73 patients with suspected acute appendicitis were operated on using the SILS technique between June 2009 and August 2010. All patients were operated on by the same surgical team, and the navel was the only point of entrance. Post-surgical pain was assessed using a numerical scale at the time of discharge. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to conventional laparoscopy. The mean surgical time was 40±14 (16-80) minutes. There were no complications during or after the surgery. The mean post-surgical pain score was 3±1 (1-7) and the mean hospital stay was 18±7 (9-42) hours. CONCLUSION SILS is a safe and effective technique for appendicitis. In the future, the most common surgical procedures could be performed through the navel.

A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation.","Dey, Arindam; Majumdar, Piya; Saha, Atanu; Sahu, Subhashis",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1831524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043698/,645

Preferences were assessed in relation to: (i) specific forms of tobacco cessation support (eg, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and various counseling formats); (ii) information sources (eg, government officials, doctors); and (iii) channels via which to receive relevant information (eg, television, social media). METHODS An online survey was administered to adults who smoke tobacco in Australia (n = 604) and the UK (n = 600). Descriptive analyses were conducted to identify levels of interest in cessation support and information provision. Differences in responses according to demographic characteristics and smoking history were assessed. RESULTS Around half of the respondents were interested in receiving personal counseling and/or participating in a text support program over the next month. By far the most popular delivery mechanism for personal counseling was email. Three-quarters of the sample expressed an interest in receiving free, home-delivered NRT. The most popular information sources nominated by respondents seeking more information about smokers' Covid-related risks were government departments and their doctor/general practitioner.

146271,"Partnership between the academy and public and private health systems to fight COVID-19: an experience report in Tubarão, Santa Catarina, Brazil.",2020-09-04,"OBJECTIVE The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a relatively simple regional anesthesia technique which entails the injection of local anesthetics (LA) into the interfascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, where nerves supplying the anterolateral abdominal wall course. It is widely used for acute pain management following abdominal surgical procedures. We describe a series of cases in which TAP blocks were used to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic abdominal wall pain (CAWP). DESIGN Consecutive case series of 5 patients presenting with CAWP. SETTING Regional referral Center for Pain Medicine of the academic tertiary hospital of Parma, Italy. RESULTS Five patients received TAP blocks with LA and steroid. Four patients reported ≥50% pain relief within hours of the procedure, and 2 of them maintained low pain intensities at 6- and 12-month follow-up calls. CONCLUSIONS Transversus abdominis plane blocks are a valuable addition to the diagnostic armamentarium of pain physicians confronted with abdominal pain of unclear origin. Although most patients responded to the LA injection, the varying degrees of response duration may have been influenced by the different etiologies underlying each condition and the variable expressions of placebo responses. Once the abdominal wall and/or its nerves are identified as pain generators, the optimal therapeutic management remains to be determined. Available literature as well as our case series shows that long-term benefit may be obtained with 1 or more injections, but we speculate that this may only be the case for pain with predominantly neuropathic components.","Baciarello, Marco; Migliavacca, Greta; Marchesini, Maurizio; Valente, Adriana; Allegri, Massimo; Fanelli, Guido",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294508/,645

MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective case-control study (Canadian Task Force classification II2) of total hysterectomy (Piver Type 1) provided by surgeons in Australia between November 2005 and May 2015. Data were collected via SurgicalPerformance, a web-based data project which aims to provide confidential feedback to surgeons about their surgical outcomes. Of 2440 records of women who received a hysterectomy, 1351 were eligible for these analyses; 107 received SURGIFLO(®) hemostatic matrix to prevent postoperative blood loss and 1244 did not. RESULTS Patients with or without SURGIFLO(®) differed in age, Charlson comorbidity index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system score (ASA), and also differed in clinical outcomes. After matching for patient's age and ASA at surgery, patients with and without SURGIFLO(®) had comparable baseline characteristics. Matched patients with and without SURGIFLO(®) had comparable clinical outcomes including risk of developing vault hematoma, return to the operating room, transfusion of red cells, surgical site infection (pelvis), readmission within 30 days and unplanned ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS In a sample matched by age and ASA, SURGIFLO(®) neither prevented nor caused additional adverse events in women undergoing hysterectomy. Surgeons used SURGIFLO(®) more commonly among women who were older, had more comorbidities and a higher ASA score. This indicates that it may be most useful in complicated surgery or cases.","Obermair, Helena; Janda, Monika; Obermair, Andreas",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.12924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27199208/,645

155713,Trying to carve nature at its joints: respecting the complexity of psychiatric diagnosis.,2020-10-01,"A central paradigm of immunity is that interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses precede pro-inflammatory ones, optimizing host protection and minimizing collateral damage1,2. Here, we report that for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) this paradigm does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 moderate-to-severe patients with COVID-19 hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-λ and type I IFN production were both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they became critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were produced before IFNs in all patients and persisted for a prolonged time. This condition was reflected in blood transcriptomes wherein prominent IFN signatures were only seen in critically ill patients who also exhibited augmented inflammation. By comparison, in 16 patients with influenza (flu) hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to those of COVID-19 and 24 nonhospitalized patients with flu with milder symptoms, IFN-λ and type I IFN were robustly induced earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were only acutely produced. Notably, higher IFN-λ concentrations in patients with COVID-19 correlated with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance and a higher IFN-λ to type I IFN ratio correlated with improved outcome for critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 correlated with longer hospitalization and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19, contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","Galani, Ioanna-Evdokia; Rovina, Nikoletta; Lampropoulou, Vicky; Triantafyllia, Vasiliki; Manioudaki, Maria; Pavlos, Eleftherios; Koukaki, Evangelia; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Panou, Vasiliki; Rapti, Vasiliki; Koltsida, Ourania; Mentis, Andreas; Koulouris, Nikolaos; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Koutsoukou, Antonia; Andreakos, Evangelos",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-00840-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277638/,645

For pandemic control, reliable assays for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are required. This pilot external quality assessment (EQA) scheme aimed to independently assess the participants' clinical performance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing, to identify shortcomings in clinical practice and to evaluate the suitability of the scheme format. Methods The EQA scheme consisted of eight serum samples with variable reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 intended for the analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies. Laboratories reported: (1) results for each sample and the respective method, (2) raw data from replicate testing of each sample. Results The 16 selected pilot EQA participants reported 294 interpreted results and 796 raw data results from replicate testing. The overall error rate for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM tests was 2.7, 6.9, and 16.7%, respectively. While the overall diagnostic specificity was rated as very high, sensitivity rates between 67 and 98% indicate considerable quality differences between the manufacturers, especially for IgA and IgM. Conclusions Even the results reported by the small number of participants indicate a very heterogeneous landscape of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological testing. Differences of available tests and the individual performance of laboratories result in a success rate of 57.1% with one laboratory succeeding for all three antibody-classes. These results are an incentive for laboratories to participate in upcoming open EQA schemes that are needed to achieve a harmonization of test results and to improve serological testing.","Haselmann, Verena; Özçürümez, Mustafa K; Klawonn, Frank; Ast, Volker; Gerhards, Catharina; Eichner, Romy; Costina, Victor; Dobler, Gerhard; Geilenkeuser, Wolf-Jochen; Wölfel, Roman; Neumaier, Michael",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-1183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853163/,645

The review clearly shows how there has been a considerable increase in the manufacture of objects based on the combination of organic matrices and coordination compounds. These coordination compounds are usually homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, anchored onto proper support, or coating the printed object, without destroying their unique properties. Advances are so fast that today it has already been possible to 3D print objects made exclusively from coordination compounds without additives. The new printable inks are made mainly with nano- non-porous coordination polymers, metal-organic gels, or metal-organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects with responses to stimuli that can act as sensors and drug delivery. In addition, the join of metal-organic frameworks with 3D print allows increasing the adsorption or selective capacity of the object concerning the original compound, being useful in energy storage, in gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the metal ion's presence can give them new properties such as luminescence finding usefulness in sensors, or anti-counterfeiting. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, the properties of the coordination bonds, anything goes to create surprising new printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes, that will shorten the gap between the academy and the industry of the coordination compounds.","Maldonado, Noelia; Amo-Ochoa, Pilar",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202002259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894574/,645

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 565 admissions with a primary diagnosis of LGIH. We obtained detailed clinical data on all subjects, focusing in particular on outcomes after TRBCS. 199 TRBCS studies were performed during 166 patient admissions (a patient admission was defined as an incident LGIH episode in a single patient). Of the 166 patient admissions in which TRBCS was performed, the scan was positive in approximately half (84/166; 51%); if TRBCS themselves were considered, they were positive 42% (84/199) of the time. Of the 84 admissions with a positive TRBCS, angiography was performed 54 times. Among this group, angiography revealed bleeding in only 20 patients (11 patients underwent embolization and 9 had hemostatic therapy). Out of 64 patients with a positive TRBCS who underwent colonoscopy, only 3 patients underwent endoscopic hemostatic therapy. Surgery was performed in 20 patients after a positive TRBCS (including in 17/54 patients after angiogram) and hemostasis was achieved in 16. Angiography, surgery and therapeutic colonoscopy were more commonly performed after positive than after a negative TRBCS. Patients who underwent angiography within 4 h of a positive TRBCS were neither more likely to have active bleeding found nor to undergo successful embolization. Not all patients with a positive TRBCS underwent angiography, and an abnormal TRBCS did not appear to predict successful angiographic therapy; further, a positive TRBCS was not predictive of subsequent definitive therapy. Because TRBCS appears to be followed up inconsistently, the data bring into question its routine use in clinical practice, and specifically raise the possibility that it is overused in patients with LGIH.","Duraiswamy, Sangeethapriya; Schmulewitz, Nathan; Rockey, Don C",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2016-000077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26956784/,645

Understanding the association between childhood diarrhea and meteorological factors would contribute to safeguard children from adverse health effects through early warning mechanisms. Thus, this study aimed at exploring the association between childhood diarrhea and meteorological factors to enable reducing health risks. A retrospective study design was used to explore the association between meteorological factors and childhood diarrhea in southwestern Ethiopia from 2010 to 2017. Mann Kendall trend test and Spearman's correlation were computed to test the association of childhood diarrhea and meteorological factors. The space-time permutation model was used to identify the risky periods, seasons with most likely clusters, and high childhood diarrhea. Similarly, a negative binomial regression model was fitted to determine the predictability of meteorological factors for childhood diarrhea. The highest childhood diarrhea morbidity was 92.60 per 1000 per under five children. The risk of childhood diarrhea increased by 16.66% (RR: 1.1666; 95% CI: 1.164-1.168) per increase in 1 °C temperature. Furthermore, rainfall was found to be a significant risk factor of childhood diarrhea, with 0.16% (RR: 1.00167; 95% CI: 1.001306-1.001928) per 1 mm increase in rainfall. The temperature was positively correlated with the occurrence of childhood diarrhea. But the association with rainfall showed spatial variability. The space-time permutation model revealed that dry season was found to be a high-risk period with excess childhood diarrhea. The results showed that the observed association between meteorological factors and childhood diarrhea could be used as evidence for early warning systems for the prevention of childhood diarrhea.","Alemayehu, Bezuayehu; Ayele, Birhanu Teshome; Melak, Fekadu; Ambelu, Argaw",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886968/,645

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses panel data from a sample of 53 countries to examine the impact of investor sentiment, measured by the financial and economic attitudes revealed by the search (FEARS) index (Da et al., 2015) on the stock return. Findings: The moderating role of government policy response indices with the FEARS index on the global stock returns is further explored. This paper finds that government policy responses have a moderating role in the sentiment and stock returns relationship. The effect holds true even when countries are split based on five classifications, i.e. cultural distance, health standard, government effectiveness, social well-being and financial development. The results are robust to an alternative measure of pandemic search intensity, quantile regression and two measures of stock market activity, i.e. conditional volatility and exchange traded fund returns. Research limitations/implications: The sample period of this study encompasses the early spread phase (January–May 2020) of the novel COVID-19 spread. Originality/value: This paper provides some early evidence on whether the government policy interventions are helpful to mitigate the impact of investor sentiment on the stock market.

170546,"COVID-19 crisis: International transfers of critical ill patients, a solution for border counties",2020,"Recent research indicates prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) result from structural and functional impairments to key cortical and subcortical networks including the default mode network (DMN) and the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (AFM). However, the specific mechanisms which underpin such impairments remain unknown. It is known that disruptions in the striatal-pallidal pathway can result in the over inhibition of the thalamus and lack of excitation to the cortex that characterises PDOC. Here, we used spectral dynamic causal modelling and parametric empirical Bayes on rs-fMRI data to assess whether DMN changes in PDOC are caused by disruptions in the AFM. PDOC patients displayed overall reduced coupling within the AFM, and specifically, decreased self-inhibition of the striatum paired with reduced coupling from striatum to thalamus. This led to loss of inhibition from AFM to DMN, mostly driven by posterior areas including the precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. In turn, the DMN showed disruptions in self-inhibition of the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex. Our results provide support for the anterior mesocircuit model at the subcortical level but highlight an inhibitory role for the AFM over the DMN, which is disrupted in PDOC.","Coulborn, S.; Taylor, C.; Naci, L.; Owen, A.

171808,Is the dream over? A study of the theory of customer delight in complaints against travel agencies,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically demonstrated the need for improved vaccination strategies and therapeutic responses to combat infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of vaccines has not yet been demonstrated in combination with commonly used immunosuppressive drug regimens. We sought to determine how common pharmaceutical drugs used in autoimmune disorders can alter immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination. We treated mice with five immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil), each with various mechanisms of action prior to and following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We assessed the functionality of antibody responses to spike protein and compared immune cell populations in mice that received no treatment with those that received continuous or temporarily suspended immune suppressive therapy. All tested immunosuppressants significantly reduced the antibody titers in serum and functional antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in immunized mice. Temporarily halting selected immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone and methotrexate, but not cyclophosphamide) improved antibody responses significantly. Through proof-of-principle experiments utilizing a mouse model, we demonstrated that immune suppression in autoimmune disorders through pharmaceutical treatments may impair vaccine response to SARS-CoV-2, and temporary suspension of immunosuppressant treatment may be necessary to mount an effective antibody vaccine response. This work provides feasibility for future clinical assessment of the impact of immunosuppressants on vaccine efficacy in humans. Significance Statement Immunosuppressant regimens are widely used as therapies for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, and cancer. However, immunosuppressants can impair critical immune responses to vaccination. The impact of standard immunosuppressant use on the critical, developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies has not been well-described. In this study, we use a mouse model to determine how different immunosuppressant drugs that act through different mechanisms can impair the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and how modulating these drug regimens may restore antibody levels and function.","Paschall, Amy V.; Ozdilek, Ahmet; Briner, Sydney L.; Brindley, Melinda A.; Avci, Fikri Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462156,645

Identifying how host response and co-morbidities impact disease presentation and progression are important to enable the development of treatments and predictive markers.In March 2020, Coventry and Warwickshire Pathology Service began saving clinical samples from COVID patients for verification of new assays. Ethical approval was obtained to continue, thus providing a biobank for future collaborative research efforts. Challenges included;the need to establish an effective detection system for samples, the standardisation of procedures to enable timely processing, the organisation of DNA extraction and the storage of samples in an HTA approved facility.Daily search routines were developed to generate lists in a standardised template, enabling staff to identify and retrieve samples quickly. Sample processing was centralised and managed by re-deployed staff. Given supply chain issues with RNA extraction consumables for automated platforms, a manual approach to DNA extraction was taken with the help of local university research staff. Finally, collaboration with the UHCW Arden Tissue Bank enabled the storage of samples, complying with all legislation and regulatory procedures.As a result of the strategies employed, over 10,000 samples have been stored, with numbers continuing to rise. Clinical information has been sourced including;ethnicity, co-morbidities, ventilation, and patient outcome. This has enabled grouping of patients based on disease severity. Since multiple samples from single patients were saved, this has allowed for disease trajectory focussed projects.Not only is the biobank providing samples for trust-led research, through Arden Tissue Bank, samples and ethics can be supplied to academic, commercial and charity organisations - both nationally and internationally.","Braybrook, Emma Anderson Neil Grammatopoulos Dimitris",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.194,645

Methods: For this systematic review, we searched scientific publications on PubMed and, the pre-print server, MedRxiv through August 18, 2021. Eligible studies were retrieved on August 18, 2021. We used the following search term on PubMed: (((Cohort Studies [Majr]) AND (COVID-19 [Mesh] OR SARS-CoV-2 [Mesh])) OR Reinfection [Majr]) OR Reinfection [Mesh]. We used the following search term on MedRxiv: Cohort Studies AND COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND Reinfection. The search terms were broad to encompass all possibilities for applicable studies. There were no restrictions on the date of publication. Studies that did not describe cohorts with estimates of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among those with previous infection were excluded. Studies that included vaccinated participants were either excluded or limited to sub-groups of non-vaccinated individuals. To identify relevant studies with appropriate control groups, we developed the following criteria for studies to be included in the systematic analysis: (1) baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, (2) a negative comparison group, (3) longitudinal follow-up, (4) a cohort of human participants, i.e., not a case report or case series, and (5) outcome determined by PCR. The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We assessed for selection, information, and analysis bias, per PRISMA guidelines. Results: We identified 1,392 reports. Of those, 10 studies were eligible for our systematic review. The weighted average risk reduction against reinfection was 90.4% with a standard deviation of 7.7%. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was observed for up to 10 months. Studies had potential information, selection, and analysis biases. Conclusions: The protective effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on re-infection is high and similar to the protective effect of vaccination. More research is needed to characterize the duration of protection and the impact of different SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Kojima, N.; Shrestha, N.; Klausner, J.

Our purpose was to determine the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence of vaccination against COVID-19 among patients attending an urban ED in Baltimore City. Methods: Using 1914 samples of known exposure status, we developed an algorithm to differentiate previously infected, vaccinated, and unexposed individuals using a combination of antibody assays. We applied this testing algorithm to 4360 samples ED patients obtained in the springs of 2020 and 2021. Using multinomial logistic regression, we determined factors associated with infection and vaccination. Results: For the algorithm, sensitivity and specificity for identifying vaccinated individuals was 100% and 99%, respectively, and 84% and 100% for naturally infected individuals. Among the ED subjects, seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 increased from 2% to 24% between April 2020 and March 2021. Vaccination prevalence rose to 11% by mid-March 2021. Marked differences in burden of disease and vaccination coverage were seen by sex, race, and ethnicity. Hispanic patients, though 7% of the study population, had the highest relative burden of disease (16 % of total infections) but similar vaccination rates. Women and White individuals were more likely to be vaccinated than men or Black individuals (adjusted odds ratios aOR 1.35 [95% CI: 1.02, 1.80] and aOR 2.26 [95% CI: 1.67, 3.07], respectively). Conclusions: Individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be differentiated from vaccinated individuals using a serologic testing algorithm.

A pilot study in the city of Madrid.],2020-11-17,"Purpose: Presently, Indian sectors are manifesting a higher level of interdependency and making the economy more vulnerable to human-caused and natural disasters. COVID-19 pandemic creates a devastating effect on the world economy. The Indian economy was expected to lose around ₹ 32,000 crores every day during the first 21 days of complete lockdown. This motivates to conduct the research on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the port logistics sector and how the effects of COVID-19 on port logistics propagate to other sectors owing to its interconnectedness and affect the economy of the country. Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of the study is analyze how perturbation in one sector can affect the system of interdependent sectors and it is done with interdependency analysis. It uses Wassily Leontief’s inoperability input-output model (IIM) and interval programming (IP) to develop a framework. IP is used to address situations where assumptions are not valid because of uncertainties associated with disruptive events. Findings: The model helps in describing how the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in port logistics can propagate owing to the interconnectedness across other sectors. The model uses the latest five-year data available on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development database. It uses metrics like inoperability and economic loss to study the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors. This study also presents the ranking of the affected sectors based on their inoperability and economic loss Research limitations/implications: In the future study, other techniques like dynamic evolution, multiplex network analysis, analytical hierarchy process, pinch analysis, stochastic evolution and pinch graph could be integrated with input-output (I-O) modelling. Integrated stochastic evolution with an I-O model allows capturing the likelihood of the events;it includes probability distributions instead of point estimates for scenario parameters. Methods like dynamic evolution and multiplex network analysis can be introduced in future work to shed lights on interdependency among the sector, which could potentially provide additional insights for transport policy formulations. Originality/value: This study discusses the theory, methodology and application of the IIM-IP model in the domain of port logistics. The developed IIM-IP model helps decision-makers to manage risk in port logistics. Firstly, it studies how different sectors are interconnected with each other. Secondly, it helps in identifying the most vulnerable sectors based on economic loss and inoperability. Thirdly, it provides the ranking of the sectors based on their economic losses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Sarkar, B. D.; Shankar, R.; Kar, A.

Many recent methods use deep neural networks to learn complex sequence representations and predict function from these. Deep supervised models require a lot of labeled training data which are not available for this task. However, a very large amount of protein sequences without functional labels is available. Results We applied an existing deep sequence model that had been pre-trained in an unsupervised setting on the supervised task of protein function prediction. We found that this complex feature representation is effective for this task, outperforming hand-crafted features such as one-hot encoding of amino acids, k-mer counts, secondary structure and backbone angles. Also, it partly negates the need for deep prediction models, as a two-layer perceptron was enough to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the third Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation benchmark. We also show that combining this sequence representation with protein 3D structure information does not lead to performance improvement, hinting that three-dimensional structure is also potentially learned during the unsupervised pre-training.

Yeast metabolic engineering offers the flexibility to meet the ever-increasing market demand. In this work, we took a retrosynthetic approach and sequentially identified the rate-limiting steps to improve the biosynthesis of the CBD precursor olivetolic acid (OLA) in Yarrowia lipolytica. We debottlenecked the critical enzymatic steps to overcome the supply of hexanoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, NADPH and ATPs to redirect carbon flux toward OLA. Implementation of these strategies led to an 83-fold increase in OLA titer in shaking flask experiment.

The encapsidation of the S mRNA correlates with the repression of N protein synthesis in vivo, and the encapsidated S mRNA cannot be translated in vitro. Unlike genome and antigenome assembly, S mRNA assembly is a relatively slow process, which is not coupled to its synthesis. Within the encapsidated S mRNA population, three forms could be distinguished, those with intact primers which were or were not also assembled with N protein and those in which the primer and up to 3 template bases had been lost. We suggest that genome replication, but not transcription, is down regulated with time in mosquito cells for reasons that are unclear. The pool of unassembled N protein then increased to the point at which it began to interact with its own mRNA, as this mRNA also contains what is considered to be the assembly site, i.e., the conserved sequences at the 5' ends of all genome and antigenome chains. This lead to the assembly of the entire mRNA, except for the nontemplate primer. Some of the primers were then also assembled with N protein, whereas others were digested to produce truncated mRNAs.","Hacker, D; Raju, R; Kolakofsky, D",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2573738/,645

Through interviews and workshops with general practitioners, nurses and policy leaders between March and July 2006, and literature analysis, we identified potential models of general practice in an established pandemic, and assessed their strengths and weaknesses. Three possible clinical models were identified: a default model of no change to service delivery; a streamed services model, where general practices reorganise themselves to take on either influenza-specific care or other clinical services; and a staff-determined mixed model, where staff move between different types of services. No single model or set of strategies meets the needs of all general practices to deliver and sustain the essential functions of primary health care during an established pandemic. Governments, general practice and the relevant peak professional bodies should decide before a pandemic on the suite of measures needed to support the models most suitable in their regions. Effective participation by general practice in a pandemic requires supplementary infrastructure support, changes to financial and staffing patterns, a review of legislation on medicolegal implications during an emergency, and intensive collaboration between general practices.","Phillips, Christine B; Patel, Mahomed S; Glasgow, Nicholas; Pearce, Christopher; Dugdale, Paul; Davies, Alison; Hall, Sally; Kljakovic, Marjan",The Medical journal of Australia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17407432/,645

Concomitant with this, the human population has been growing steadily. However, emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and AIDS, as well as re-emerging infectious diseases such as Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever, have been spreading in recent times. Three major infectious diseases, namely AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, are killing around 8 million people in the world annually. Although drugs effective against these infectious diseases are available at present, drastic therapeutics have not been developed yet. In addition, vaccines against these diseases often cannot prevent infections, because pathogenic viruses or bacteria evade the immune system of the host. Many diseases and emerging infections of pathogenic bacteria cannot be controlled by conventional pharmaceutics. These pathogens secrete regulatory factors. When the produced regulatory factor attains a certain level, an active factor is then produced by the pathogen to destroy the host. Considering these phenomena, we thought investigating characteristic regulatory or active factors will pave the way for developing novel vaccines or diagnostic drugs. Therefore, candidiasis was selected as a model, and application of the secretory protease of Candida albicans was examined for the development of novel drugs. Screening of novel candidates of antigens of C. albicans and vaccine development are also underway.

The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation.

This virus has been designated feline enteric coronavirus to differentiate it from FIPV. The virus is shed in the feces by many seropositive cats; in catteries it is a cause of inapparent to mildly severe enteritis in kittens 6 to 12 weeks of age. The virus may produce a more severe enteritis in young specific-pathogen-free kittens. Feline enteric coronavirus selectively infects the apical columnar epithelium of the intestinal villi, from the caudal part of the duodenum to the cecum. In severe infections, there are sloughing of the tips of the villi and villous atrophy. Many cats recovering from the disease remain carriers of the virus. Recovered cats, observed for 3 to 24 months, remained healthy and did not develop peritonitis, pleuritis, or granulomatous disease. The relationship of feline enteric coronavirus and FIPV was studied. Although the viruses were antigenically similar, they were distinctly different in their pathogenicities. The enteric coronavirus did not cause feline infectious peritonitis in coronavirus antibody-negative cats inoculated orally or intraperitoneally nor in coronavirus antibody-positive cats inoculated intraperitoneally or intratracheally. Serologic tests, using FIPV, canine coronavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine as substrate antigens in fluorescent antibody procedures may not accurately identify FIPV infection.

MeHg could also suppress insulin secretion in HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. After 24 h of exposure to MeHg, HIT-T15 cells had a significant increase in mercury levels with a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, MeHg displayed several features of cell apoptosis including an increase of the sub-G1 population and annexin-V binding. Treatment of HIT-T15 cells with MeHg resulted in disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and activation of caspase-3.

Most of the respiratory viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae and Coronaviridae families. No pathogens can be detected in a relatively large proportion of patients with respiratory disease, partially owing to limitations of current diagnostic assays but also since some infections are caused by as yet unknown pathogens. This review will focus on human coronaviruses. In the mid 1960s, two human coronaviruses were identified that cause the common cold: human coronaviruses (HCoV)-229E and HCoV-OC43. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and subsequent identification of two additional human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) has drawn attention to this virus family. This review summarizes the knowledge of current methodologies for identifying novel human coronavirus species. Furthermore, information on the discovery of known human coronaviruses will be presented.","Pyrc, Krzysztof; Berkhout, Ben; van der Hoek, Lia",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17402839/,645

In a limited field survey of calf diarrhoea 75 selected faeces were examined independently by ELISA and electron microscopy and the agreement between the two tests was 95 per cent for coronavirus and 84 per cent for rotavirus. A further comparison was made with 74 samples submitted for routine diagnosis and this yielded agreements of 82 per cent (coronavirus) and 89 per cent (rotavirus). Factors contributing to discrepant results were examined and the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two tests for routine detection of these enteric viruses are discussed.,"Reynolds, D J; Chasey, D; Scott, A C; Bridger, J C",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6328730/,645
196626,[Ethics Committee experience during COVID-19 emergency. A brief report.],2020-11-03,"AIM Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice for benign adrenal lesions including pheocromocytoma (PHE) and in selected patients with malignant lesions. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the authors' results after laparoscopic left anterior transperitoneal submesocolic adrenalectomy (LLATSA) for unilateral PHE. MATERIAL OF STUDY This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. From 1994 to 2018, 552 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA). Of these, 34 patients (14 men, 20 women, mean age 52.8 years) underwent LLATSA for PHE. RESULTS Mean operative time was 93.1 ± 44.9 minutes. Conversion to open surgery occurred in two patients due to difficult identification of the anatomy. Intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate instability were observed in four cases, but with no need for conversion. Postoperative morbidity was nil. One American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III patient died on postoperative day 4 from acute myocardial infarction. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 3.8 ± 1.8 days (range 2 - 8). DISCUSSION The main advantage of this approach is the early ligation of the main adrenal vein prior to any gland manipulation. This reduces the risk of catecholamines' spread and consequently the risk of hemodynamic instability. Intraperitoneal dissection is limited and there is no need to mobilize the colon or pancreas, with a lower risk of complications from organ manipulation. CONCLUSIONS LLATSA is feasible and safe for the treatment of PHE. A randomized trial design and a larger cohort of patients would be required to confirm these conclusions.

The purpose of this study is to identify linkages between these health sectors with the aim of informing a forward-looking policy approach to integrate public health functions in primary care. METHODS We searched national and international journals and the grey literature for relevant papers and reports published from January 1999 to December 2003. The final set of documents provided broad coverage of the topic, with emphasis on national and international representation and a special focus on disease surveillance, health promotion, accident and illness prevention and chronic diseases. RESULTS Three main findings emerged from this study. First, there is a need to understand and clearly articulate the roles and functions of public health and primary care in Canada. Second, the main areas of overlap between these sectors are health surveillance, health promotion and prevention of disease and injury. Third, based on an international literature search, we identified 10 models that demonstrate how these sectors can be integrated; five of them were developed in Canada. CONCLUSIONS National and international evidence and a variety of working models support the integration of public health functions in primary care. Canada has been a leader in developing models of integrated health systems that combine individualized approaches to influence personal health behaviour and community approaches to influence the health of the population. These integration models could be further developed through a focus on the common need of primary care and public health to address the health implications of the ever-present risk of emerging infectious diseases in Canada.","Stevenson Rowan, Margo; Hogg, William; Huston, Patricia",Healthcare policy = Politiques de sante,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19305749/,645

For these situations, we used fluorescent cholangiography. METHODS Our procedure for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy utilized the SILS-Port, and an additional pair of 5-mm forceps was inserted via an umbilical incision. As a fluorescence source, 1 mL of indocyanine green was intravenously injected after endotracheal intubation of patients in the operating room. A laparoscopic fluorescence imaging system developed by Karl Storz Endoskope was utilized for fluorescent cholangiography. RESULTS Fluorescent cholangiography could be used to identify the border of the lesion in the cystic duct. According to the fluorescent cholangiography results, a location for the resection line of the cystic duct could be identified; therefore, the planned resection was successful and produced a histologically negative margin. CONCLUSIONS Application of fluorescent cholangiography in the determination of the location of the resection line location during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for benign lesions of the cystic duct should be widely accepted.","Nojiri, Motoi; Igami, Tsuyoshi; Tanaka, Hiroshi; Toyoda, Yoshitaka; Ebata, Tomoki; Yokoyama, Yukihiro; Sugawara, Gen; Mizuno, Takashi; Yamaguchi, Junpei; Nagino, Masato","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846167/,645

199923,"COVID-19. Las consecuencias sociales, sanitarias y cardiovasculares",2020,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a r ecent pandemic that is advancing at a r apid r ate. The future course of the disease includes severe r espiratory infection and also leads to death if unattended. Meticulous measures are necessary before attending any patient. The dental operatories and the clinic surroundings must be well sanitized so as to prevent the spread of pandemic. AIM AND OBJECTIVE This r eview discusses in brief about the pathophysiology and course of COVID-19. Further, we discussed in detail the management aspects of patients in periodontal perspective and the sanitization procedures required for the dental clinic. REVIEW RESULTS The SARS coronavirus enters the human circulation via the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors which are also found on the oral mucosal surfaces. Furin and Cathepsin L are the pro-inflammatory molecules released during pathogenesis of periodontitis and mediate the molecular pathways that help the virus invade into the host. The clinic set-up should be modified to best suit the pandemic conditions. This includes the three phases, i.e., phase I: preparatory phase; phase II: implementation phase; and phase III: follow-up. The patient management is explained based on the emergency needs of the patient based on the recent AAP classification of periodontal diseases and conditions 2017 as emergency, urgent, and elective treatment needs which have been explained in detail. CONCLUSION It can be strongly concluded that there is direct relationship between oral health and systemic health. The treatment procedures and sanitization protocols must be definitely modified. Further consensus and systematic reviews help us arriving at a more standardized protocol. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This review would help clinicians modify the way they treat patients in the clinic and provide better services depending upon the emergency needs of the patient.","Jafer, Mohammed A; Hazazi, Majed A; Mashi, Majed H; Sumayli, Hassan A; Mobarki, Y J Ali; Sultan, Alnomari; Ali Hadi, Maryam S; Abulqasim, Huthyfah Mohammed; Thubab, Bandar Mohammed M; Patil, Shankargouda",The journal of contemporary dental practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893266/,645

Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections.","Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi; Qasim, Muhammad; Choi, Youngsok; Do, Jeong Tae; Park, Chankyu; Hong, Kwonho; Kim, Jin-Hoi; Song, Hyuk",,,645

The outbreak in Northern Italy demonstrates that it is fundamental to contain the virus' spread at a very early stage of diffusion. At later stages, no containment measure, even if strict, can prevent the saturation of the hospitals and of the intensive care units in any country. Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the beginning of the exponential growth of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy. We also assess short-term and long-term lockdown effects on intensive care units and number of deaths. Governments should use the Italian outbreak as a precedent and implement appropriate containment measures to prevent the saturation of their intensive care units and protect their population, also, and above all, in anticipation of a possible second exponential spread of infections.","Supino, M; d039,; Onofrio, A; Luongo, F; Occhipinti, G; Dal Co, A",BMC Public Health,,645

This study sought to investigate whether blood glucose (BG) levels or comorbid diabetes are associated with inflammatory status and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes were compared. The relationship among severity of COVID-19, inflammatory status, and diabetes or hyperglycemia was analyzed. The severity of COVID-19 in all patients was determined according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the Chinese National Health Committee (7th edition). Results: Four hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled in our study, and 71.58% of patients with diabetes and 13.03% of patients without diabetes had hyperglycemia. Compared with patients without diabetes (n = 366), patients with diabetes (n = 95) had a higher leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There was no association between severity of COVID-19 and known diabetes adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), known hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The leucocyte count, NLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level increased with increasing BG level. Hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of critical (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.72-9.30) or severe (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.47-8.58) COVID-19, and of increased inflammatory levels (high leucocyte count (OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.65-10.97), NLR (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.24-6.10), and CRP level (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.19-5.23)), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, severity of illness, and known diabetes. Conclusion: Hyperglycemia was positively correlated with higher inflammation levels and more severe illness, and it is a risk factor for the increased severity of COVID-19. The initial measurement of plasma glucose levels after hospitalization may help identify a subset of patients who are predisposed to a worse clinical course.","Zhang, Wen; Li, Chuanwei; Xu, Yu; He, Binfeng; Hu, Mingdong; Cao, Guoqiang; Li, Li; Wu, Shuang; Wang, Xia; Zhang, Chun; Zhao, Jianping; Xie, Jungang; Xu, Zihui; Li, Qi; Wang, Guansong",Mediators Inflamm,,645

The purpose of this study is to report on our management of the handling and delivery of biological medications to patients during periods of lockdown in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). METHODS: A descriptive study conducted at our 380-bed tertiary care hospital. Managing the delivery of the biological medications was organized in six phases: (1) taskforce development, (2) identification of the relevant biological medications, (3) identification of patients, (4) organization of transportation, (5) medication delivery/pickup and (6) locating patients with unidentified addresses. The study was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Biological medications were delivered to 1235/1373 (90%) patients. This included 1875/2036 (92%) prescriptions. 900 prescriptions were delivered to 570 patients living in 95 cities and villages across the kingdom. 141 patients received 183 prescribed oral biological medications and 477 patients received 787 prescribed parenteral biological medications delivered with temperature control. 224 parenteral biological medication were delivered by car to 116 patients living in less accessible cities in the west of the country. The car deliveries of parenteral biological medications required particularly careful handling, packaging and temperature control. Delivering biological medications to patients during the curfew was a unique experience. However, the approach we have used ensured safe access to medications under appropriate conditions. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Delivering biological medications to patients during the lockdown was challenging. With the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19, hospitals should have a standardized process in-place for delivering such medications.","Mukhtar, Amnah; Shukry, Murooj; Bannan, Douha",J Clin Pharm Ther,,645

269430,Inhalation Sedation During the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Expert Opinion,2020,"COVID-19 is a novel disease best known to cause a cough, fever and respiratory failure. Recently, it has been recognised that COVID-19 may present in multi-systemic ways which can cause diagnostic uncertainty or error.We present a patient who attended hospital with features of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) before developing clinical and radiological findings of COVID-19. While the authors recognise that neurological complications have been reported following COVID-19 infection, to their knowledge this report describes a unique presentation of GBS without preceding COVID-19 symptoms.Since these conditions may have considerable overlapping features including respiratory failure and (following prolonged critical care admission) profound weakness, it is possible that one diagnosis may be overlooked. Raising awareness of a possible association between these conditions is important so both are considered allowing appropriate investigations to be arranged to optimise the chance of neurological recovery and survival, while also protecting staff from potentially unrecognised COVID-19.","Gale, Aislinn; Sabaretnam, Suganya; Lewinsohn, Asher",BMJ case reports,,645
270866,Impact of statins in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Currently, South Asia accounts for a quarter of the world population, yet it already claims &#8776;60% of the global burden of heart disease. Besides the epidemics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease already faced by South Asian countries, recent studies suggest that South Asians may also be at an increased risk of heart failure (HF), and that it presents at earlier ages than in most other racial/ethnic groups. Although a frequently underrecognized threat, an eventual HF epidemic in the densely populated South Asian nations could have dramatic health, social and economic consequences, and urgent interventions are needed to flatten the curve of HF in South Asia. In this review, we discuss recent studies portraying these trends, and describe the mechanisms that may explain an increased risk of premature HF in South Asians compared with other groups, with a special focus on highly relevant features in South Asian populations including premature coronary heart disease, early type 2 diabetes mellitus, ubiquitous abdominal obesity, exposure to the world's highest levels of air pollution, highly prevalent pretransition forms of HF such as rheumatic heart disease, and underdevelopment of healthcare systems. Other rising lifestyle-related risk factors such as use of tobacco products, hypertension, and general obesity are also discussed. We evaluate the prognosis of HF in South Asian countries and the implications of an anticipated HF epidemic. Finally, we discuss proposed interventions aimed at curbing these adverse trends, management approaches that can improve the prognosis of prevalent HF in South Asian countries, and research gaps in this important field.","Martinez-Amezcua, Pablo; Haque, Waqas; Khera, Rohan; Kanaya, Alka M; Sattar, Naveed; Lam, Carolyn S P; Harikrishnan, Sivadasanpillai; Shah, Sanjiv J; Kandula, Namratha R; Jose, Powell O; Narayan, K M Venkat; Agyemang, Charles; Misra, Anoop; Jenum, Anne K; Bilal, Usama; Nasir, Khurram; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel",Circ Heart Fail,,645

Natural products have inspired the synthesis of compounds for pharmaceutical application, most of which are based on N-heterocyclic motifs. Among these, the pyrrole ring is one of the most explored heterocycles in drug discovery programs for several therapeutic areas, confirmed by the high number of pyrrole-based drugs reaching the market. In the present review, we focused on pyrrole and its hetero-fused derivatives with anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities, reported in the literature between 2015 and 2019, for which a specific target was identified, being responsible for their biological activity. It emerges that the powerful pharmaceutical and pharmacological features provided by the pyrrole nucleus as pharmacophore unit of many drugs are still recognized by medicinal chemists.","Li Petri, Giovanna; Spanò, Virginia; Spatola, Roberto; Holl, Ralph; Raimondi, Maria Valeria; Barraja, Paola; Montalbano, Alessandra",Eur J Med Chem,,645

One such measure could be to disinfect the air, especially in indoor environments. The goal of this work is to propose a novel design of a wet scrubber-reactor to deactivate airborne microbes using circular economy principles. Based on Fenton's reaction mechanism, the system proposed here will deactivate airborne microbes (bioaerosols) such as SARS-CoV-2. The proposed design relies on using a highly porous clay-glass open-cell structure as an easily reproducible and cheap material. The principle behind this technique is an in-situ decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive oxygen species and free radicals. The high porosity of a tailored ceramic structure provides a high contact area between atomized oxygen, free radicals and supplied polluted air. The design is shown to comply with the needs of achieving sustainable development goals.","Shishkin, Andrei; Goel, Gaurav; Baronins, Janis; Ozolins, Jurijs; Hoskins, Clare; Goel, Saurav",Environ Technol Innov,,645

OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the immune status of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 in the third trimester. METHODS: Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns. RESULTS: None of the 51 newborns showed fever or respiratory distress during hospitalization. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs was negative. Except for the low level of CD16-CD56 cells, the count and proportion of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 were all in the normal range. Moreover, the serum IgG and IgM levels were within the normal range, whereas IL-6 showed increased levels. There was no correlation between maternal COVID-19 duration and the lymphocyte subsets or cytokine levels (IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels and CD16-CD56 cells. One (1.96%) infant with an extremely elevated IL-6 concentration developed necrotizing enterocolitis in the third week after birth, and the remaining 50 infants did not show abnormal symptoms through the end of the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in the third trimester did not significantly affect the cellular and humoral immunity of the fetus, and there was no evidence that the differentiation of lymphocyte subsets was seriously unbalanced.","Liu, Pin; Zheng, Junwen; Yang, Pu; Wang, Xia; Wei, Cong; Zhang, Shiyu; Feng, Shuwen; Lan, Jing; He, Bingyan; Zhao, Dongchi; Li, Jiafu; Zhang, Yuanzhen",J. allergy clin. immunol,,645

Methods: We assessed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection, personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, PPE use, and accidents involving biological material among HCWs in the Recife metropolitan area, Northeast Brazil. Using respondent driven sampling, we included HCWs attending suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients from May 2020 to February 2021. Results: We analyzed 1,525 HCWs (527 physicians, 471 registered nurses, 263 nursing assistants/technicians, and 264 physical therapists). Women predominated in all categories (81.1%). Nurses were older and had more comorbidities (hypertension and overweight/obesity) than the other HCWs. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 61.8% after adjustment for the cluster random effect, weighted by network, and reference population size. The independent risk factors for a positive RT-PCR test were being a nursing assistant (OR adjusted: 2.56), not always using all recommended PPE in routine practice (ORadj: 2.15), and reporting a splash of biological fluid/respiratory secretion in the eyes (ORadj: 3.37). Conclusions: The high risk of infection among HCWs reflects PPE shortages and younger, possibly less experienced, frontline HCWs. There were disparities in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, with nursing assistants being the most vulnerable, possibly due to their longer and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients.","Albuquerque, Maria de Fatima Pessoa Militao de; Souza, Wayner Vieira de; Montarroyos, Ulisses Ramos; Pereira, Cresio Romeu; Braga, Cynthia; Araujo, Thalia Velho Barreto de; Ximenes, Ricardo Arraes de Alencar; Miranda-Filho, Democrito Barros; Szwarcwald, Celia Landmann; Souza-Junior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Xavier, Morgana Nascimento; Morais, Clarice Neuenschwander Lins de; Albuquerque, Gabriela Diniz Militao de; Bresani-Salvi, Cristiane; Mariz, Carolline Araujo; Siquera, Noemia Teixeira de; Galindo, Jadson Mendonca; Franca-Neto, Claudio Luiz; Barbosa, Jessyka Mary Vasconcelos; Veras, Maria Amelia S M; Lima, Luana Nepomuceno Gondim Costa; Cruz, Luciane Nascimento; Kendall, Carl; Kerr, Ligia Regina Franco Sansigolo; Martelli, Celina Maria Turchi",,,645

This retrospective study evaluated temporal trends in ANEN incidence and management over a 14-year period. METHODS: Appendectomy pathology reports from a single tertiary center were reviewed. RESULTS: During 2005-2018, 8327 appendectomies were performed and 57 ANENs were diagnosed (average age 31.7 ± 17 years; 70.2% women; 17.5% Arab ethnicity; and 22.8% < 18 years of age). The cohort was divided according to year of diagnosis (Period A 2005-2011; Period B 2012-2018). No differences were found in ANEN incidence (0.75% and 0.62%, respectively, p = 0.104), epidemiologic or pathologic characteristics between periods. In period B, pathology reports were more comprehensive and use of specific imaging and biochemical studies was more prevalent. Hemicolectomy rates and results were similar (8 in Period A, 7 in Period B, p = 0.925). All patients remained alive for the duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: No temporal changes in epidemiological, clinical or pathological features of ANENs were noted. Although clinico-pathological evaluation was more detailed after 2011, there was no change in rates of hemicolectomy or disease prognosis.","Twito, Orit; Paran, Haim; Avital, Shmuel; Kravtsov, Vladimir; Rosenblum, Rachel Chava; Rotman-Pikielny, Pnina; Klein, Noa",Am. j. surg,,645

The suggested models are verified with the example of epitaxial growth of &#945;-, Î³- and ß-FeSi2 silicide thin films on silicon substrates. The density of near-coincidence sites is shown to have a decisive role in the determination of epitaxial thin film orientation and explains the superior quality of ß-FeSi2 thin grown on Si(111) over Si(001) substrates despite larger lattice misfits. Ideal conjunctions for interfaces between the silicide phases are predicted and this allows for utilization of a thin buffer &#945;-FeSi2 layer for oriented growth of ß-FeSi2 nanostructures on Si(001). The thermal expansion coefficients are obtained within quasi-harmonic approximation from the DFT calculations to study the influence of temperature on the lattice strains in the derived interfaces. Faster decrease of misfits at the &#945;-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) interface compared to Î³-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) elucidates the origins of temperature-driven change of the phase growing on silicon substrates. The proposed approach guides from bulk phase unit cells to the construction of the interface atomic structures and appears to be a powerful tool for the prediction of interfaces between arbitrary phases for subsequent theoretical investigation and epitaxial film synthesis.","Visotin, Maxim A; Tarasov, I A; Fedorov, A S; Varnakov, S N; Ovchinnikov, S G",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,645

Potential explanations (for example, warmer environments1, younger populations2-4) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis. We synthesized factors hypothesized to drive the pace and burden of this pandemic in SSA during the period from 25 February to 20 December 2020, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare capacity, intervention efforts and human mobility dimensions. Large diversity in the probable drivers indicates a need for caution in interpreting analyses that aggregate data across low- and middle-income settings. Our simulation shows that climatic variation between SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories; however, heterogeneity in connectivity, although rarely considered, is likely an important contributor to variance in the pace of viral spread across SSA. Our synthesis points to the potential benefits of context-specific adaptation of surveillance systems during the ongoing pandemic. In particular, characterizing patterns of severity over age will be a priority in settings with high comorbidity burdens and poor access to care. Understanding the spatial extent of outbreaks warrants emphasis in settings where low connectivity could drive prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks resulting in extended stress to health systems.","Rice, Benjamin L; Annapragada, Akshaya; Baker, Rachel E; Bruijning, Marjolein; Dotse-Gborgbortsi, Winfred; Mensah, Keitly; Miller, Ian F; Motaze, Nkengafac Villyen; Raherinandrasana, Antso; Rajeev, Malavika; Rakotonirina, Julio; Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Yu, Weiyu; Grenfell, Bryan T; Tatem, Andrew J; Metcalf, C Jessica E",Nat Med,,645

The current study documents perceived changes since COVID-19 and compares these to observed longitudinal changes in reported weight, BMI, and how college students described their weight from January to April 2020. METHOD: Undergraduates (N = 90; 88% female) completed on-line assessments before and after students were required to leave campus due to COVID-19. Time 1 and Time 2 surveys collected demographic information, height, weight, and a Likert-scale rating to describe perceived weight, ranging from 1 = very underweight to 5 = very overweight (weight description). Time 2 surveys added questions for perceived changes since COVID-19 in body weight, eating, physical activity, various forms of screen time, and concerns about weight, shape, and eating. RESULTS: Time 2 surveys indicated perceived increases in body weight, eating, and screen time, and decreases in physical activity along with increased concerns about weight, shape and eating since COVID-19. Longitudinal data indicated no significant change in weight, body mass index (BMI), or BMI category, but how participants described their weight changed significantly from January to April 2020. Compared to longitudinal changes in BMI category, students' weight description was significantly more likely to fall into a higher category from Time 1 to Time 2. DISCUSSION: Shifts in how body weight is experienced in the wake of COVID-19 that do not align with observed changes in reported weight may reflect cognitive distortions that could increase risk for disordered eating in some individuals.","Keel, Pamela K; Gomez, Marielle M; Harris, Lauren; Kennedy, Grace A; Ribeiro, Jessica; Joiner, Thomas E",Int J Eat Disord,,645

The economic cost of it was estimated at USD 98 billion, while the social costs are still unknown. This study investigated how government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation. A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic kits, robots and nano-technology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online learning). A conclusion was drawn on leveraging these heuristics are crucial for lockdown easement planning.","Debnath, Ramit; Bardhan, Ronita",PLoS One,,645

Furthermore, Fe2O3 was successfully anchored by wet impregnation. The resulting materials are characterized by a disordered layered structure and a mesoporous texture. The heterostructures were employed as catalysts for the removal of two pharmaceuticals, acetaminophen (ACE) and antipyrine (ANT), by heterogeneous Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. ACE removal under different operation conditions was studied in detail to establish structure-performance relationships, being the TiO2 formation and the developed texture the main factors controlling the activity. ANT showed a higher refractory behavior in oxidation by Fenton. Among the technologies studied, heterogeneous photo-Fenton achieved the best catalytic performance and higher kinetic rate and mineralization degree. Iron leaching was very low, lower than 5% of the initial iron load in all cases. This work demonstrates the potential application of these heterostructures for the removal of emerging pollutants of different nature.","Molina, Carmen B; Sanz-Santos, Eva; Boukhemkhem, Ali; Bedia, Jorge; Belver, Carolina; Rodriguez, Juan J",,,645

A deeper understanding of the epidemic suggests that a person's negligence can cause widespread harm that would be difficult to negate. Since no vaccine is yet developed, social distancing must be practiced to detain COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we aim to develop a framework that tracks humans for monitoring the social distancing being practiced. To accomplish this objective of social distance monitoring, an algorithm is developed using object detection method. Here, CNN based object detector is explored to detect human presence. The object detector's output is used for calculating distances between each pair of humans detected. This approach of social distancing algorithm will red mark the persons who are getting closer than a permissible limit. Experimental results prove that CNN based object detectors with our proposed social distancing algorithm exhibit promising outcomes for monitoring social distancing in public areas.","Ansari, Mohd Aquib; Singh, Dushyant Kumar",Int J Inf Technol,,645

Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, France. We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: mortality and/or IMV requirement. RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated with TCZ and 176 patients were treated without TCZ. TCZ was used in patients in critical condition (oxygen therapy flow at TCZ onset was 10.5 L/min and 14/30 patients had &#8805; 50% lung involvement on CT scan) as a rescue treatment (8/30 patients who died were not admitted in USC in regard to their comorbidities). However, mortality and/or IMV requirement were lower in patients with TCZ than in patients without TCZ (27% vs 52%, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Despite the small sample size in the TCZ group, this result suggests that TCZ reduces mortality and/or IMV requirement in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

However, existing models only consider simple rule-based individual behaviors, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a deep-reinforcement-learning-powered microscopic model named Microscopic Pandemic Simulator (MPS). By replacing rule-based agents with rational agents whose behaviors are driven to maximize rewards, the MPS provides a better approximation of real world dynamics. To efficiently simulate with massive amounts of agents in MPS, we propose Scalable Million-Agent DQN (SMADQN). The MPS allows us to efficiently evaluate the impact of different government strategies. This paper first calibrates the MPS against real-world data in Allegheny, US, then demonstratively evaluates two government strategies: information disclosure and quarantine. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A joinpoint analysis of COVID-19 time series in Brazilian capitals,2020,"BACKGROUND: For older adults, over diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) is a primary driver of inappropriate antibiotic use. This risk is increased for patients in long-term care facilities (LTCF), especially as they transition back and forth to emergency departments (ED). In this study, we aimed to understand how health care provider communication and relationship dynamics affect LTCF residents treated in the ED to identify barriers to antibiotic stewardship for UTIs. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with nurses and physicians from LTCFs and EDs, guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety framework. Data were systematically coded and underwent iterative, conventional, content analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 LTCF and 16 ED providers across Wisconsin. ED and LTCF nurses have a critical role in both intrafacility and interfacility communication. Fragmented communication and interprofessional power dynamics were identified barriers to optimal antibiotic prescribing for UTIs. Identified strategies to overcome these issues included using objective diagnostic criteria, development of communication scripts, and nurse-to-nurse education. CONCLUSIONS: Our qualitative approach revealed important insights about how communication and relationship dynamics influence UTI diagnosis and optimal antibiotic stewardship for LTCF residents evaluated in the ED. Future interventions should strengthen communications between settings and across provider types, and address standardization of diagnostic and treatment communication pathways for LTCF residents with suspected infections transitioning between EDs and LTCFs.","Valmadrid, Luke Carmichael; Schwei, Rebecca J; Maginot, Elizabeth; Pulia, Michael S",Am. j. infect. control,,645

Métodos: Revisamos o boletim da Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa - edição especial Coronavírus (CONEP-COVID) (28 de maio de 2020) e as bases International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov e Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC) para identificar estudos registrados no Brasil que avaliassem intervenções de tipo de medicamento, terapia biológica ou vacinas. Descrevemos as características metodológicas e calculamos o poder para diferentes magnitudes de efeito. Resultados: Foram incluídos 62 estudos, 55 identificados no site da CONEP e mais sete nas bases de registro. As intervenções medicamentosas mais frequentemente testadas nesses estudos foram: cloroquina/hidroxicloroquina, azitromicina, plasma convalescente, tocilizumabe, sarilumabe, eculizumabe, vacina, corticoides, anticoagulantes, n-acetilcisteína, nitazoxanida, ivermectina e lopinavir/ritonavir. De 22 protocolos publicados até maio de 2020 nas bases de registro, 18 (82%) eram ensaios clínicos randomizados e 13 (59%) tinham grupo controle adequado. Entretanto, nove (41%) eram mascarados e somente cinco (24%) incluíam pacientes diagnosticados com teste de laboratório específico (por exemplo, transcrição reversa seguida de reação em cadeia da polimerase - RT-PCR).

426941,"""Let the algorithm decide"": Is human dignity at stake?*",2021,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological characteristics and good research practices of COVID-19 interventional studies developed in Brazil in the first months of the pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed the bulletin of the National Research Ethics Committee - Coronavirus Special Edition (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa - CONEP-COVID) (May 28, 2020) and the databases of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos - ReBEC) to identify interventional studies registered in Brazil that assessed drug type, biological therapy, or vaccines. We described their methodological characteristics and calculated their power for different effect magnitudes. RESULTS: A total of 62 studies were included, 55 retrieved from the CONEP website, and 7 from registry databases. The most tested pharmacological interventions in these studies were: chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, sarilumab, eculizumab, vaccine, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, n-acetylcysteine, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Out of 22 protocols published on registry databases until May 2020, 18 (82%) were randomized clinical trials, and 13 (59%) had an appropriate control group. However, 9 (41%) of them were masked, and only 5 (24%) included patients diagnosed with a specific laboratory test (for example, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction - RT-PCR). Most of these studies had power > 80% only to identify large effect sizes. In the prospective follow-up, 60% of the studies available at CONEP until May 2020 had not been published on any registry platform (ICTRP/ReBEC/ClinicalTrials) by July 21, 2020. CONCLUSION: The interventions evaluated during the Brazilian research response reflect those of international initiatives, but with a different distribution and a large number of studies assessing hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Limitations in methodological design and sample planning represent challenges that could affect the research outreach.","Ribeiro, Tatiane Bomfim; Mazotti, Talita Aona; Silva, Nayara Aparecida de Oliveira; Stein, Airton Tetelbom; Diaz-Quijano, Fredi Alexander; Melo, Daniela Oliveira de",Rev Bras Epidemiol,,645

439301,Can a reconceptualization of online training be part of the solution to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Sarcomas are rare tumours with considerable heterogeneity. Early and accurate diagnosis is important to optimise patient outcomes in terms of local disease control, overall survival (OS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Time to diagnosis is variable in bone as well as soft tissue sarcoma. Possible factors for a long time from first symptom to diagnosis (the total interval) include patient, tumour and healthcare characteristics, but until now the most relevant risk factors and its association with outcomes remain unknown. Our study aims to (1) quantify total interval, the time interval from first symptom until (histological) diagnosis; (2) identify factors associated with interval length and (3) determine the association between total interval and HRQoL, stage and tumour size at diagnosis, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a longitudinal, prospective, international, multicentre cohort study among patients aged &#8805;18 years with newly diagnosed bone or soft tissue sarcoma at eight centres (three in UK, five in The Netherlands). Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at five points in time; one at diagnosis and at follow-up points of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Questionnaire data is collected within the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry: an international data management system for collection of patient-reported outcomes. Clinical data will be extracted from patient records. The primary endpoint is HRQoL at diagnosis, measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Secondary endpoints are stage and tumour size at diagnosis, PFS, OS, additional patient-reported outcomes, such as quality-adjusted life years and psychological distress. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was given by the Health Research Authority and Research Ethics Committee for the United Kingdom (18/WA/0096) and medical ethical committee of Radboudumc for The Netherlands (2017-3881). Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and presented at meetings.

We report about a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with a genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variant in an immunocompetent female healthcare worker that has led to a mild disease course. No obvious viral escape mutations were observed in the second virus variant. The infectious virus was shed from the patient during the second infection episode despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in her blood. Our data indicate that a moderate immune response after the first infection, but not a viral escape, did allow for reinfection and live virus shedding.","Brehm, Thomas Theo; Pfefferle, Susanne; von Possel, Ronald; Kobbe, Robin; Nörz, Dominik; Schmiedel, Stefan; Grundhoff, Adam; Olearo, Flaminia; Emmerich, Petra; Robitaille, Alexis; Günther, Thomas; Braun, Platon; Andersen, Gabriele; Knobloch, Johannes K; Addo, Marylyn M; Lohse, Ansgar W; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Fischer, Nicole; Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian; Lütgehetmann, Marc",Viruses,,645

The overall quality of medical research remains poor, despite longstanding criticisms. The problems are well known, but the research community fails to properly address them. We suggest most problems stem from an underlying paradox: although methodology is undeniably the backbone of qualitative and responsible research, science consistently undervalues methodology. The focus remains more on the destination (research claims and metrics) than on the journey. Notwithstanding, research should serve society more than the reputation of those involved. While we notice that many initiatives are being established to improve components of the research cycle, these initiatives are too disjointed. The overall system is monolithic and slow to adapt. We assert that a top-down action is needed from journals, universities, funders and governments to break the cycle and put methodology first. These actions should involve the widespread adoption of registered reports, balanced research funding between innovative, incremental and methodological research projects, full recognition and demystification of peer review, mandatory statistical review of reports, adherence to reporting guidelines, and investment in methodological education and research. Currently, the scientific enterprise is doing a major disservice to patients and society.","Van Calster, Ben; Wynants, Laure; Riley, Richard D; van Smeden, Maarten; Collins, Gary S",J. clin. epidemiol,,645
455734,"Communication in the COVID-19 crisis: unique story, epic framework and missing stories",2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer might be at an increased risk of infection with COVID-19 and a more severe disease course. However, different tumor types have differing susceptibility to the infection and COVID-19 phenotypes. Thus, the risk and prevalence of COVID-19 is not uniform across the different tumor types. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to estimate the risk and prevalence of COVID-19 infection in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed up to July 25, 2020, thorough PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, CNKI, CBM, China Science, Wan Fang, and SciELO databases. The risk of COVID-19 infection in CRC patients was performed based on the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of six studies with 204 different cancer patients with COVID-19 and 92 CRC infected patients with COVID-19 were selected. Our results showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in CRC patients was 45.1% in the global population. The pooled data showed that there is no a significant risk of infection with COVID-19 in CRC patients in the global population (OR = 0.261, 95% CI 0.099-0.533, p = 0.082). However, when subgroup analysis was performed based on country of origin, we found a significant correlation in Chinese CRC patients (OR = 0.221, 95% CI 0.146-0.319, p &#8804; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study results revealed that Chinese CRC patients harbored a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, more multicenter, larger sample sizes and high-quality studies are required to verify this meta-analysis result.","Antikchi, Mohammad Hossein; Neamatzadeh, Hossein; Ghelmani, Yaser; Jafari-Nedooshan, Jamal; Dastgheib, Seyed Alireza; Kargar, Shadi; Noorishadkam, Mahmood; Bahrami, Reza; Jarahzadeh, Mohammad Hossein",J. gastrointest. cancer (Online),,645
456420,FDG PET Findings Post-COVID Vaccinations: Signs of the Times?,2021,"Existing estimations of air pollution from automobile sources are based on either experiments or small-scale governmental interventions. China's nationwide traffic control during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak provided us a unique opportunity to assess the direct dose-effect relationship between vehicle density and air pollution. We found that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the nationwide reduced air pollution (except for O3) could be largely explained by traffic control measures. During the traffic control period, every doubling of vehicle density was associated with a decrease of 4.2 (2.0, 6.4) µg/m3 in PM2.5, 5.5 (2.9, 8.1) µg/m3 in PM10, 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) µg/m3 in NO2, and 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) mg/m3 in CO comparing cities with different vehicle densities. Similarly, for every 10% increase in the truck proportion, PM2.5 decreased by 12.3 (4.1, 20.6) µg/m3, PM10 decreased by 14.3 (4.6, 23.9) µg/m3, and CO decreased by 0.14 (0.05, 0.23) mg/m3. Moreover, the associations between vehicle density and reduction in PM2.5, PM10, and CO during the traffic control period were stronger and showed near-complete linearity in cities with low green coverage rate (All P < 0.05 for interaction). According to our estimation, PM2.5 emissions from every doubling of vehicle density can lead to over 8000 excess deaths per year, 66% of which were caused by cardiopulmonary diseases. This natural experiment study is the first to observe the dose-effect relationship between on-road traffic and traffic-generated air pollution, as well as the mitigating effect of urban greening. Findings provide key evidence to the assessment and control of traffic-generated air pollution and its public health impact.","Jia, Chengyong; Li, Wending; Wu, Tangchun; He, Meian",Sci Total Environ,,645
459223,FDG PET/CT in Diagnosing COVID-19 Infection in a Cancer Patient With Exposure History But Minimal Symptoms,2020,"BACKGROUND: A significant portion of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at high risk of developing intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired swallowing dysfunction (neurogenic dysphagia) as a consequence of requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is a simple and safe treatment for neurogenic dysphagia. It has been shown that PES can restore safe swallowing in orally intubated or tracheotomized ICU patients with neurogenic dysphagia following severe stroke. We report the case of a patient with severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia (PED) due to prolonged intubation and severe general muscle weakness related to COVID-19, which was successfully treated using PES. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Caucasian female patient with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection developed neurogenic dysphagia following prolonged intubation in the ICU. To avoid aerosol-generating procedures, her swallowing function was evaluated non-instrumentally as recommended by recently published international guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her swallowing function was markedly impaired and PES therapy was recommended. PES led to a rapid improvement of the PED, as evaluated by bedside swallowing assessments using the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and Dysphagia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS), and diet screening using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). The improved swallowing, as reflected by these measures, allowed this patient to transfer from the ICU to a non-intensive medical department 5 days after completing PES treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PES treatment contributed to the restoration of a safe swallowing function in this critically ill patient with COVID-19 and ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Early clinical bedside swallowing assessment and dysphagia intervention in COVID-19 patients is crucial to optimize their full recovery. PES may contribute to a safe and earlier ICU discharge of patients with ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Earlier ICU discharge and reduced rates of re-intubation following PES can help alleviate some of the pressure on ICU bed capacity, which is critical in times of a health emergency such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Traugott, Marianna; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Kitzberger, Reinhard; Pavlata, Sophie; Seitz, Tamara; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Placher-Sorko, Gudrun; Pirker-Krassnig, Daniela; Ehehalt, Urs; Grasnek, Andreas; Beham-Kacerovsky, Michaela; Friese, Emanuela; Wenisch, Christoph; Neuhold, Stephanie",J Med Case Rep,,645

473264,Guidelines on Setting Up Stations for Remote Viewing of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Studies During COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection has challenged health care systems to increase capacity while conserving personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies and minimizing nosocomial spread. Telemedicine shows promise to address these challenges but lacks comprehensive evaluation in the inpatient environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate an intrahospital telemedicine program (virtual care), along with its impact on exposure risk and communication. METHODS: We conducted a natural experiment of virtual care on patients admitted for COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was documented use of virtual care. Patient characteristics, PPE use rates, and their association with virtual care use were assessed. In parallel, we conducted surveys with patients and clinicians to capture satisfaction with virtual care along the domains of communication, medical treatment, and exposure risk. RESULTS: Of 137 total patients in our primary analysis, 43 patients used virtual care. In total, there were 82 inpatient days of use and 401 inpatient days without use. Hospital utilization and illness severity were similar in patients who opted in versus opted out. Virtual care was associated with a significant reduction in PPE use and physical exam rate. Surveys of 41 patients and clinicians showed high rates of recommendation for further use, and subjective improvements in communication. However, providers and patients expressed limitations in usability, medical assessment, and empathetic communication. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot natural experiment, only a subset of patients used inpatient virtual care. When used, virtual care was associated with reductions in PPE use, reductions in exposure risk, and patient and provider satisfaction.","Legler, Sean; Diehl, Matthew; Hilliard, Brian; Olson, Andrew; Markowitz, Rebecca; Tignanelli, Christopher; Melton, Genevieve B; Broccard, Alain; Kirsch, Jonathan; Usher, Michael",J Med Internet Res,,645

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV, the causative agent behind the 2003 SARS outbreak. Based on prior reports, clinicians have pursued the off-label use of several antiviral drugs, while the scientific community has responded by seeking agents against traditional targets, especially viral proteases. However, several avenues remain unexplored, including disrupting E and M protein oligomerization, outcompeting host glycan-virus interactions, interfering with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans-virus interaction, and others.

Although it is unclear how long the pandemic will last, it may persist for many months. Throughout this time, it will be important to perform safe, comprehensive, and effective care for patients with and patients without COVID-19, recognizing that asymptomatic transmission is common with this disease. Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment; local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible because of many unknown and complex factors. However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.","Davenport, Matthew S; Bruno, Michael A; Iyer, Ramesh S; Johnson, Amirh M; Herrera, Ramses; Nicola, Gregory N; Ortiz, Daniel; Pedrosa, Ivan; Policeni, Bruno; Recht, Michael P; Willis, Marc; Zuley, Margarita L; Weinstein, Stefanie",J Am Coll Radiol,,645

For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care.

498340,[Implications on the scientific production of COVID-19.],2021,"While studies of urban acoustics are typically restricted to the audio range, anthropogenic activity also generates infrasound (<20 Hz, roughly at the lower end of the range of human hearing). Shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic unintentionally created ideal conditions for the study of urban infrasound and low frequency audio (20-500 Hz), as closures reduced human-generated ambient noise, while natural signals remained relatively unaffected. An array of infrasound sensors deployed in Las Vegas, NV, provides data for a case study in monitoring human activity during the pandemic through urban acoustics. The array records a sharp decline in acoustic power following the temporary shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential by the state of Nevada. This decline varies spatially across the array, with stations close to McCarran International Airport generally recording the greatest declines in acoustic power.

498342,[Implications on the scientific production of COVID-19.],2021,"While studies of urban acoustics are typically restricted to the audio range, anthropogenic activity also generates infrasound (<20 Hz, roughly at the lower end of the range of human hearing). Shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic unintentionally created ideal conditions for the study of urban infrasound and low frequency audio (20-500 Hz), as closures reduced human-generated ambient noise, while natural signals remained relatively unaffected. An array of infrasound sensors deployed in Las Vegas, NV, provides data for a case study in monitoring human activity during the pandemic through urban acoustics. The array records a sharp decline in acoustic power following the temporary shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential by the state of Nevada. This decline varies spatially across the array, with stations close to McCarran International Airport generally recording the greatest declines in acoustic power. Further, declines in acoustic power fluctuate with the time of day. As only signals associated with anthropogenic activity are expected to decline, this gives a rough indication of periodicities in urban acoustics throughout Las Vegas. The results of this study reflect the city's response to the pandemic and suggest spatiotemporal trends in acoustics outside of shutdowns.","Bird, Elijah J; Bowman, Daniel C; Seastrand, Douglas R; Wright, Melissa A; Lees, Jonathan M; Dannemann Dugick, Fransiska K",J Acoust Soc Am,,645

However, many aspects of the relationship between haematophagous bats and rabies still remain uninvestigated or contradictory. In an attempt to investigate some of these aspects, our group designed a cage system developed for the purpose of experimentally investigating rabies infections and the oral rabies immunization of haematophagous bats. The cages are made of polycarbonate, a transparent material that allows for total visualization of the bats for observation, photos and video monitoring and resistant to effects to bats excreta. Nine cages with independent air supply and exhaust systems are maintained on a stand. A prefilter unit using inner and outer HEPA filters guarantees air supply to bats through the cage interior, and air exhaustion provides for safe conditions for researchers. Drinking bottles are located externally. Adequate consumption of defibrinated blood, weight maintenance, low bat mortality (16.4%) and longevity are demonstrated herein. The maintenance of bats in these cages decreases the necessity of handling them and is consistent with the conclusion that the bats adapt well to captivity in this type of cage.","F. de Almeida, Marilene; C.

Mainland China is an area with a high incidence of tuberculosis, and the task of tuberculosis prevention and treatment is arduous. This paper aims to study the impact of seven influencing factors and spatial-temporal distribution of the relative risk (RR) of tuberculosis in mainland China using the spatial-temporal distribution model and INLA algorithm. The relative risks and confidence intervals (CI) corresponding to average relative humidity, monthly average precipitation, monthly average sunshine duration and monthly per capita GDP were 1.018 (95% CI 1.001-1.034), 1.014 (95% CI 1.006-1.023), 1.026 (95% CI 1.014-1.039) and 1.025 (95% CI 1.011-1.040). The relative risk for average temperature and pressure were 0.956 (95% CI 0.942-0.969) and 0.767 (95% CI 0.664-0.875). Spatially, the two provinces with the highest relative risks are Xinjiang and Guizhou, and the remaining provinces with higher relative risks were mostly concentrated in the Northwest and South China regions. Temporally, the relative risk decreased year by year from 2013 to 2015. It was higher from February to May each year and was most significant in March. It decreased from June to December. Average relative humidity, monthly average precipitation, monthly average sunshine duration and monthly per capita GDP had positive effects on the relative risk of tuberculosis. The average temperature and pressure had negative effects. The average wind speed had no significant effect. Mainland China should adapt measures to local conditions and develop tuberculosis prevention and control strategies based on the characteristics of different regions and time.","Bie, Siyu; Hu, Xijian; Zhang, Huiguo; Wang, Kai; Dou, Zhihui",Sci Rep,,645

In order to provide a practical and valid screening tool to facilitate safe engagement in physical activity and fitness assessments for the Brazilian population, this study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and verify the reproducibility of the evidence-based PAR-Q+ to the Brazilian Portuguese language. Method: Initially, the document was translated by two independent translators, before Brazilian experts in health and physical activity evaluated the translations and produced a common initial version. Next, two English native speakers, fluent in Brazilian Portuguese and accustomed to the local culture, back-translated the questionnaire. These back translations were assessed by the organization in charge of the PAR-Q+, then a final Brazilian version was approved. A total of 493 Brazilians between 5 and 93 yr (39.9 ± 25.4 yr), 59% female, with varying levels of health and physical activity, completed the questionnaire twice, in person or online, 1–2 weeks apart. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the internal consistency of all items of the questionnaire, and the Kappa statistic was used to assess the individual reproducibility of each item of the document. Additionally, the intraclass correlation coefficient and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to verify the general reproducibility (reliability) of the translated version. Results: The Brazilian version had an excellent internal consistency (0.993), with an almost perfect agreement in 93.8% of the questions, and a substantial agreement in the other 6.2%. The translated version also had a good to excellent total reproducibility (0.901, 95% CI: 0.887–0.914). Conclusion: The results show this translation is a valid and reliable screening tool, which may facilitate a larger number of Brazilians to start or increase physical activity participation in a safe manner.","Schwartz, Juliano; Oh, Paul; Takito, Monica Y.; Saunders, Bryan; Dolan, Eimear; Franchini, Emerson; Rhodes, Ryan E.; Bredin, Shannon S.

597793,Gynecologic Cancer: New and Follow-Up Patient Appointments in Botswana During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-06,"Records of epidemics acknowledge immunological multi-serotype illnesses as an important aspect of the occurrence and control of contagious diseases. These patterns occur due to antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) among serotype diseases, which leads to infection of secondary infectious classes. One example of this is dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which comprises the following four serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. The evolutionary vaccination game approach is able to shed light on this long-standing issue in a bid to evaluate the success of various control programs. Although immunization is regarded as one of the most accepted approaches for minimizing the risk of infection, cost and efficiency are important factors that must also be considered. To analyze the [Formula: see text] serovar aspect alongside ADE consequence in voluntary vaccination, this study establishes a new mathematical epidemiological model that is dovetailed with evolutionary game theory, an approach through which we explored two vaccine programs: primary and secondary. Our findings illuminate that the ‘cost-efficiency’ effect for vaccination decision exhibits an impact on controlling [Formula: see text] serovar infectious diseases and should be designed in such a manner as to avoid adverse effects. Furthermore, our numerical result justifies the fact that adopting ADE significantly boosted emerging disease incidence, it also suggest that the joint vaccine policy works even better when the complex cyclical epidemic outbreak takes place among multi serotypes interactions. Research also exposes that the primary vaccine is a better controlling tool than the secondary; however, introducing a highly-efficiency secondary vaccine against secondary infection plays a key role to control the disease prevalence.","Ariful Kabir, KM; Tanimoto, Jun",J Theor Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622789/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519320302344?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519320302344,645

Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster. A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 × 109/L (60.6 ± 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 ± 1.34% lymphocytes). Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes. Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Following treatment with early non-invasive ventilation and a bundle pharmacotherapy, she recovered with a good outcome. CONCLUSION Early non-invasive ventilation with a bundle pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment regimen for the broader population of patients with COVID-19.","Peng, Mian; Ren, Di; Liu, Xue-Yan; Li, Jin-Xiu; Chen, Rong-Lin; Yu, Bao-Jun; Liu, Yong-Feng; Meng, Xi; Lyu, Yan-Si",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i9.1705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420305/,645

The present study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare workers (HCWs) and to analyse various characteristics (risk factors) associated with SARS CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Eight government designated Corona virus disease -19 (COVID-19) hospitals were selected based on the hospital admission of patients with COVID-19 and the local epidemiological situation in the region. Multistage population proportion to size sampling was performed for the selection of HCWs. Serosurvey was conducted using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based IgG antibody test (COVID KAVACH). Bivariate and multiple logistic regression was performed to find out the factor/factors associated with the positive antibody test. RESULTS: Out of 3255 HCWs that participated in the study, data of 3253 were analysed. The seroprevalence was 19.7% (95% confidence interval: 18.5–21.3%). Factors associated were location, category of HCWs, male sex, previously tested positive by the molecular test, training on infection prevention and control, personal protective measures, handwashing technique, close contact with a patient confirmed with COVID-19, use of personal protective equipment and symptoms in the last 30 days. However, in multiple logistic regression, only location, category, previously tested positive by the molecular test and symptoms in the last 30 days were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: HCWs are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One in five HCWs had detectable antibodies. The presence of antibodies among HCWs may help in their placement and triage. HCWs may be advised to report early in case of any symptoms of COVID-19. Preventive measures may be targeted based on the location, with particular emphasis on ancillary workers and nurses.","Ghosh, Subhadeep; Yadav, Arun Kumar; Rajmohan, K.S.; Bhalla, Sharad; Sekhawat, Vikram Singh; Prashant, J.; Dubey, Sudhir; Sahai, Atul; Rakesh, C.R.; Chand, Satish; Rawat, M.S.; Gupta, Shilpi; Dhawan, Rakhi; Pandya, Kapil; Kotwal, Atul",Med J Armed Forces India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334905/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.03.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123721000939; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123721000939,645

Their binding alters the activity, stability, localization, and phosphorylation state of a target protein. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with the regulation of a wide range of general and specific signaling pathways suggests their crucial role in health and disease. Recent studies have linked 14-3-3 to several RNA and DNA viruses that may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of infections. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of host–virus interactions is vital for understanding the viral life cycle and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Moreover, pharmaceutical research is already moving towards targeting host proteins in the control of virus pathogenesis. As such, targeting the right host protein to interrupt host–virus interactions could be an effective therapeutic strategy. In this review, we generated a 14-3-3 protein interactions roadmap in viruses, using the freely available Virusmentha network, an online virus–virus or virus–host interaction tool. Furthermore, we summarize the role of the 14-3-3 family in RNA and DNA viruses.

Human beings become infected through tick bites, by crushing infected ticks, after contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock. Clinical features commonly show a dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage, myalgia, and fever. The levels of liver enzymes, creatinine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase are raised, and bleeding markers are prolonged. Infection of the endothelium has a major pathogenic role. Besides direct infection of the endothelium, indirect damage by viral factors or virus-mediated host-derived soluble factors that cause endothelial activations and dysfunction are thought to occur. In diagnosis, enzyme-linked immunoassay and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR are used. Early diagnosis is critical for patient therapy and prevention of potential nosocomial infections. Supportive therapy is the most essential part of case management. Recent studies suggest that ribavirin is effective against CCHF, although definitive studies are not available. Health-care workers have a serious risk of infection, particularly during care of patients with haemorrhages from the nose, mouth, gums, vagina, and injection sites.

It emerged in China during late 2019 and rapidly spread all over the world, producing a broad spectrum of clinical disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic infection to death (4.3 million victims so far). Consequently, the scientific research is devoted to investigating the mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis to both identify specific therapeutic drugs and develop vaccines. Although immunological mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathogenesis are still largely unknown, new understanding has emerged about the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are mainly focused on the dysregulated inflammatory response in severe COVID-19. Polyphenols are naturally occurring products with immunomodulatory activity, playing a relevant role in reducing inflammation and preventing the onset of serious chronic diseases. Mainly based on data collected before the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, polyphenols have been recently suggested as promising agents to fight COVID-19, and some clinical trials have already been approved with polyphenols to treat COVID-19. The aim of this review is to analyze and discuss the in vitro and in vivo research on the immunomodulatory activity of quercetin as a research model of polyphenols, focusing on research that addresses issues related to the dysregulated immune response in severe COVID-19. From this analysis, it emerges that although encouraging data are present, they are still insufficient to recommend polyphenols as potential immunomodulatory agents against COVID-19.","Bernini, Roberta; Velotti, Francesca",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641348/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26195803,645

Continuing the neurosurgical training while maintaining the well-being of our residents should be the primary concern of leaders of training programs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-sectional study was the evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical residency programs and neurosurgical practice in five tertiary medical centers in our country. We also aimed at detecting the shortcomings in training programs and provide solutions. METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared and sent to 73 neurosurgery residents in 5 tertiary centers in 4 governorates by social networks. The questions focused on the evaluation of clinical and surgical activities before and after the pandemic. Safety precautions, education, and residents’ mental health were also evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty residents responded to our survey. We identified a significant reduction in surgical cases, inpatient services, and working hours per week during the pandemic comparing to the pre-pandemic era. We also identified a significant increase in research hours and changes in educational methods from in-person methods to virtual ones. Seventy-four percent reported that personal protective equipment was not adequate for their duties. Sixty-eight percent experienced burnout symptoms. Unavailability of personal protective equipment, negative concerns regarding the surgical career, and financial strains significantly affected the mental health of residents. CONCLUSIONS: The survey highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical practice and education. Being in a developing country, this negative effect was amplified due to financial reasons and weak infrastructure. Inadequate personal protective equipment increased the risk of infection and work-related stress among neurosurgery residents. We lacked telemedicine services in our country.
