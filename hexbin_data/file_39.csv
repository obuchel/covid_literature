48,48,48,On pandemics and the duty to care: whose duty? who cares?,14.533451,4.541187,2006-04-20,"BACKGROUND: As a number of commentators have noted, SARS exposed the vulnerabilities of our health care systems and governance structures. Health care professionals (HCPs) and hospital systems that bore the brunt of the SARS outbreak continue to struggle with the aftermath of the crisis. Indeed, HCPs – both in clinical care and in public health – were severely tested by SARS. Unprecedented demands were placed on their skills and expertise, and their personal commitment to their profession was severely tried. Many were exposed to serious risk of morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by the World Health Organization figures showing that approximately 30% of reported cases were among HCPs, some of whom died from the infection. Despite this challenge, professional codes of ethics are silent on the issue of duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks, thus providing no guidance on what is expected of HCPs or how they ought to approach their duty to care in the face of risk. DISCUSSION: In the aftermath of SARS and with the spectre of a pandemic avian influenza, it is imperative that we (re)consider the obligations of HCPs for patients with severe infectious diseases, particularly diseases that pose risks to those providing care. It is of pressing importance that organizations representing HCPs give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members in the event of a pandemic. In this paper, we address the issue of special obligations of HCPs during an infectious disease outbreak. We argue that there is a pressing need to clarify the rights and responsibilities of HCPs in the current context of pandemic flu preparedness, and that these rights and responsibilities ought to be codified in professional codes of ethics. Finally, we present a brief historical accounting of the treatment of the duty to care in professional health care codes of ethics. SUMMARY: An honest and critical examination of the role of HCPs during communicable disease outbreaks is needed in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities, as well as ethical duties and obligations. With this paper, we hope to open the social dialogue and advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue.","Ruderman, Carly; Tracy, C Shawn; Bensimon, Cécile M; Bernstein, Mark; Hawryluck, Laura; Shaul, Randi Zlotnik; Upshur, Ross EG",BMC Med Ethics,39,12

Since its first description, a large number of clinical studies have been performed that address the clinical significance of HBoV detection and the molecular biology of the virus. This review summarizes the most important steps taken in HBoV research to date and addresses open questions that need to be answered in the future to provide a better understanding of the role of a virus that is difficult to grow in cell culture and is suspected to be a pathogen, although it has not yet fulfilled Koch’s postulates.","Schildgen, Oliver",Pathogens,39,11

In a world of modern transport and fast connectivity, these beasts of burden seem to be out‐dated. However, a growing demand for sustainable milk and meat production, especially in countries affected by climate change and increasing desertification, brings dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) back onstage and into the focus of animal breeders and scientists. In this review on the molecular genetics of these economically important species we give an overview about the evolutionary history, domestication and dispersal of Old World camels, whereas highlighting the need for conservation of wild two‐humped camels (Camelus ferus) as an evolutionarily unique and highly endangered species. We provide cutting‐edge information on the current molecular resources and on‐going sequencing projects. We cannot emphasise enough the importance of balancing the need for improving camel production traits with maintaining the genetic diversity in two domestic species with specific physiological adaptation to a desert environment.","Burger, P.

Unfortunately, these data are difficult to obtain and are typically collected on as-needed basis and maintained locally. This localized process unavoidably limits the access to important public health data by its users. Moreover, the diversity of data transmission standards and collection techniques make the collected data less usable. This paper proposes a new standardized public health information system based on the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) messages, which are the standard transactions between hospitals and insurance companies. In particular, this paper explores the applicability of HIPAA messages as a data source and transmission standard, and proposes a prototype design of a new system to collect and share public health data using HIPAA messages.","Wu, Min; Zhao, Tian; Wu, Changshan",J Med Syst,39,1

Later, similar Biotin-EIAs were developed but the sensitivities were unsatisfactory. Objectives: Further optimization of monoclonal Biotin-EIAs and comparison of the optimized assays with TR-FIAs. Study design: Variations in test format, diluents, incubation times and temperatures, and different monoclonal antibodies were tested, and the final comparisons were made with TR-FIA using stored nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: The improvements in Biotin-EIA featured four changes which increased sensitivity in the assay: (a) test diluent contained diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid; (b) antigen and biotinylated detector antibody were added simultaneously; (c) reaction time was extended from 1 h at 37°C to overnight at 4°C; (d) from the thirteen monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA, ten were optimal also in Biotin-EIA, but in the parainfluenza 1 and 2 assays other monoclonals proved more sensitive. Out of 257 originally positive specimens tested in the comparison studies, 192 (74.7%) were again positive and 54 (21.0%) were negative in both assays; nine were negative in TR-FIA but positive in Biotin-EIA, while two specimens were negative in Biotin-EIA but positive in TR-FIA. The overall agreement between the two assays was 95.7%. Conclusions: All monoclonal Biotin-EIAs can be optimized to the same sensitivity as TR-FIAs for the detection of respiratory viruses. Laboratories which have no TR-FIA expertise may use Biotin-EIA in the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.","Scalia, Guido; Halonen, Pekka E.; Condorelli, Francesca; Mattila, Marja L.; Hierholzer, John C.",Clin Diagn Virol,39,1

However, their roles in influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in H3N2-infected cells and mock-infected cells by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 6129 lncRNAs and 50,031 mRNA transcripts in A549 cells displayed differential expression after H3N2 infection compared with mock infection. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, 4963 were upregulated, and 1166 were downregulated. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases (KEGG) suggested that target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in some biological processes, such as cellular metabolism and autophagy. The up- or downregulated lncRNAs were selected and further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a comparative expression analysis of lncRNAs in A549 cells infected with H3N2. Our results support the need for further analyses of the functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs during H3N2 infection.

METHODS: A retrospective study with a provincial pediatric transport team from a tertiary hospital pediatric intensive care unit. Pediatric patients aged 28 days to < 17 years, who required IFT between January 2017 and December 2018, were identified through a transport registry and were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 118 (26.7%) patients received CPAP/BIPAP or HFNC support for IFT. The most common respiratory diagnosis was bronchiolitis (46%). These patients were placed on respiratory support, 31.4 minutes after the transport team’s arrival. None required intubation during their IFT, despite mean transport times of 163 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide important information for programs with large catchment areas, in which large distances and transport times should not be barriers to NIV implementation.","Holbird, Samantha; Holt, Tanya; Shaw, Adam; Hansen, Gregory",World J Pediatr,39,1

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of accidental hypothermia on mortality in trauma patients overall and patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) specifically. METHODS: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis using the Ovid Medline/PubMed database. Scientific articles reporting accidental hypothermia and its impact on outcomes in trauma patients were included in qualitative synthesis. Studies that compared the effect of hypothermia vs. normothermia at hospital admission on in-hospital mortality were included in two meta-analyses on (1) trauma patients overall and (2) patients with TBI specifically. Meta-analysis was performed using a Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model. RESULTS: Literature search revealed 264 articles. Of these, 14 studies published 1987–2018 were included in the qualitative synthesis. Seven studies qualified for meta-analysis on trauma patients overall and three studies for meta-analysis on patients with TBI specifically. Accidental hypothermia at admission was associated with significantly higher mortality both in trauma patients overall (OR 5.18 [95% CI 2.61–10.28]) and patients with TBI specifically (OR 2.38 [95% CI 1.53–3.69]). CONCLUSIONS: In the current meta-analysis, accidental hypothermia was strongly associated with higher in-hospital mortality both in trauma patients overall and patients with TBI specifically. These findings underscore the importance of measures to avoid accidental hypothermia in the prehospital care of trauma patients.

However, we lack a detailed understanding of the drought stress response of microbial decomposers. Here we present metatranscriptomic and metabolomic data on the physiological response of in situ microbial communities on plant litter to long-term drought in Californian grass and shrub ecosystems. We hypothesised that drought causes greater microbial allocation to stress tolerance relative to growth pathways. In grass litter, communities from the decade-long ambient and reduced precipitation treatments had distinct taxonomic and functional profiles. The most discernable physiological signatures of drought were production or uptake of compatible solutes to maintain cellular osmotic balance, and synthesis of capsular and extracellular polymeric substances as a mechanism to retain water. The results show a clear functional response to drought in grass litter communities with greater allocation to survival relative to growth that could affect decomposition under drought. In contrast, communities on chemically more diverse and complex shrub litter had smaller physiological differences in response to long-term drought but higher investment in resource acquisition traits across precipitation treatments, suggesting that the functional response to drought is constrained by substrate quality. Our findings suggest, for the first time in a field setting, a trade off between microbial drought stress tolerance, resource acquisition and growth traits in plant litter microbial communities.","Malik, Ashish A.; Swenson, Tami; Weihe, Claudia; Morrison, Eric W.; Martiny, Jennifer B.

Promising new biomarkers for diagnosis and immunotherapy have emerged recently. My-cobacterium is an ancient pathogen that has developed complex strategies for its persistence in the host and environment, likely based on the complexity of the network of interactions between the molecules involved in infection. Several biomarkers have received recent attention in the process of developing rapid and reliable detection techniques for tuberculosis. Among the most widely investigated antigens are CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein), ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target), Ag85A, Ag85B, CFP-7, and PPE18. Some of these antigens have been proposed as biomarkers to assess the key elements of the response to infection of both the pathogen and host. The design of novel and accurate diagnostic methods is essential for the control of tuberculosis worldwide. Presently, the diagnostic methods are based on the identification of molecules in the humoral response in infected individuals. Therefore, these tests depend on the capacity of the host to develop an immune response, which usually is heterogeneous. In the last 20 years, special attention has been given to the design of multiantigenic diagnostic methods to improve the levels of sensitivity and specificity. In this review, we summarize the state of the art in the study and use of mycobacterium biomolecules with the potential to support novel tuberculosis control strategies.","Rodríguez-Hernández, Elba; Quintas-Granados, Laura Itzel; Flores-Villalva, Susana; Cantó-Alarcón, Jorge Germinal; Milián-Suazo, Feliciano",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,39,1

In addition to causing acute diarrhea, rotaviruses and other enteric viruses may be involved in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis and other neonatal enteric diseases. There are several potential methods for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal viral infections. Antiviral immunoglobulins might be used to inhibit intestinal viral replication. Since only small concentrations of serum immunoglobulins are present at mucosal surfaces, oral administration of immunoglobulins might be utilized to maximize antiviral efficacy. Alternatively, inhibitors of specific glycoproteins of virus-cell binding might be used to prevent the productive infection of intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, since many enteric viruses require proteolytic enzymes for protein cleavage, protease inhibitors may prove effective for inhibition of intestinal viral replication. At this time, these methods have proven useful for the inhibition of rotavirus infection in experimental animals. The successful application of these and other methods for the prevention of enteric infections in humans might substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with enteric diseases in high-risk neonates.","Yolken, Robert H.; Maldonado, Yvonne; Kinney, Janet; Vonderfecht, Steve",Rev Infect Dis,39,1

This information is important for informing patients with IBD about disease treatment budgets and health care strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic status and medical care access of patients with IBD through the China Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation web-based platform in China. METHODS: Our study was performed in 14 IBD centers in mainland China between 2018 and 2019 through WeChat. Participants were asked to complete a 64-item web-based questionnaire. Data were collected by the Wenjuanxing survey program. We mainly focused on income and insurance status, medical costs, and access to health care providers. Respondents were stratified by income and the associations of income with medical costs and emergency visit times were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, 3000 patients with IBD, that is, 1922 patients with Crohn disease, 973 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 105 patients with undetermined colitis were included. During the last 12 months, the mean (SD) direct and indirect costs for per patient with IBD were approximately US $11,668.68 ($7944.44) and US $74.90 ($253.60) in China. The average reimbursement ratios for most outpatient and inpatient costs were less than 50%. However, the income of 85.5% (2565/3000) of the patients was less than ¥10,000 (US $1445) per month. Approximately 96.5% (2894/3000) of the patients were covered by health insurance, but only 24.7% (741/3000) of the patients had private commercial insurance, which has higher imbursement ratios. Nearly 98.0% (2954/3000) of the patients worried about their financial situation. Thus, 79.7% (2392/3000) of the patients with IBD tried to save money for health care and even delayed their medical treatments. About half of the respondents (1282/3000, 42.7%) had no primary care provider, and 52.2% (1567/3000) of the patients had to visit the emergency room 1-4 times per year for the treatment of their IBD. Multivariate analysis revealed that lower income (P=.001) and higher transportation (P=.004) and accommodation costs (P=.001) were significantly associated with the increased number of emergency visits of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients with IBD have enormous financial burdens and difficulties in accessing health care, which have increased their financial anxiety and inevitably influenced their disease outcomes. Early purchase of private insurance, thereby increasing the reimbursement ratio for medical expenses, and developing the use of telemedicine would be effective strategies for saving on health care costs.","Yu, Qiao; Zhu, Chunpeng; Feng, Shuyi; Xu, Liyi; Hu, Shurong; Chen, Hao; Chen, Hanwen; Yao, Sheng; Wang, Xiaoying; Chen, Yan",J Med Internet Res,39,1

Governments and health care organizations are offering digital tools such as self-assessment tools, symptom tracking tools, or chatbots. Other sources of digital tools, such as those offered through patient platforms, are available on the internet free of charge. We define patient platforms as health-specific websites that offer tools to anyone with internet access to engage them in their health care process with peer networks to support their learning. Although numerous social media platforms engage users without up-front charges, patient platforms are specific to health. As little is known about their business model, there is a need to understand what else these platforms are trying to achieve beyond supporting patients so that patients can make informed decisions about the benefits and risks of using the digital tools they offer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore what patient platforms are trying to achieve beyond supporting patients and how their digital tools can be used to generate income. METHODS: Textual and visual data collected from a purposeful selection of 11 patient platforms from September 2013 to August 2014 were analyzed using framework analysis. Data were systematically and rigorously coded and categorized according to key issues and themes by following 5 steps: familiarizing, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation. We used open coding to identify additional concepts not captured in the initial thematic framework. This paper reports on emergent findings on the business models of the platforms and their income-generating processes. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that in addition to patients, the platforms support other parties with interests in health and information exchanges. Patient platforms did not charge up-front fees but generated income from other sources, such as advertising, sponsorship, marketing (eg, sending information to users on behalf of sponsors or providing means for sponsors to reach patients directly), supporting other portals, and providing research services. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports on the mechanisms by which some patient platforms generate income to support their operations, gain profit, or both. Although income-generating processes exist elsewhere on social media platforms in general, they pose unique challenges in the health context because digital tools engage patients in health and information exchanges. This study highlights the need to minimize the potential for unintended consequences that can pose health risks to patients or can lead to increased health expenses. By understanding other interests that patient platforms support, our findings point to important policy implications, such as whether (and how) authorities might protect users from processes that may not always be in their best interests and can potentially incur costs to the health system.","Lai, Claudia; Deber, Raisa; Jadad, Alejandro R; Shachak, Aviv",J Med Internet Res,39,1

The liver and lung are the most common sites of PDAC metastasis, and each have been differentially associated with prognoses and responses to systemic therapies. A deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular landscape within the tumor microenvironment (TME) metastasis at these different sites is critical to informing future therapeutic strategies against metastatic PDAC. RESULTS: By leveraging combined mass cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing, we identify key regulatory pathways that distinguish the liver and lung TMEs in a preclinical mouse model of metastatic PDAC. We demonstrate that the lung TME generally exhibits higher levels of immune infiltration, immune activation, and pro-immune signaling pathways, whereas multiple immune-suppressive pathways are emphasized in the liver TME. We then perform further validation of these preclinical findings in paired human lung and liver metastatic samples using immunohistochemistry from PDAC rapid autopsy specimens. Finally, in silico validation with transfer learning between our mouse model and TCGA datasets further demonstrates that many of the site-associated features are detectable even in the context of different primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the distinctive immune-suppressive features in multiple liver and lung TME datasets provides further insight into the tissue specificity of molecular and cellular pathways, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying the discordant clinical responses that are often observed in metastatic diseases.

Methods to collect quality dietary information at scale for population research are time consuming, expensive and biased. Novel data sources offer potential to overcome these challenges and better understand population dietary patterns. In this research we will use 12 months of supermarket sales transaction data, from 2016, for primary shoppers residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region of the UK (n = 299,260), to identify dietary patterns and profile these according to their nutrient composition and the sociodemographic characteristics of the consumer purchasing with these patterns. Results identified seven dietary purchase patterns that we named: Fruity; Meat alternatives; Carnivores; Hydrators; Afternoon tea; Beer and wine lovers; and Sweet tooth. On average the daily energy intake of loyalty card holders -who may buy as an individual or for a household- is less than the adult reference intake, but this varies according to dietary purchase pattern. In general loyalty card holders meet the recommended salt intake, do not purchase enough carbohydrates, and purchase too much fat and protein, but not enough fibre. The dietary purchase pattern containing the highest amount of fibre (as an indicator of healthiness) is bought by the least deprived customers and the pattern with lowest fibre by the most deprived.

Yet interoceptive abilities in alexithymia—a personality trait characterized by a difficulty in the cognitive interpretation of emotional arousal, which impacts emotional experience—remain under-investigated, thereby limiting a full understanding of subjective emotional experience processing. Research has proposed two contrasting explanations thus far: in one model, the dimensions of interoceptive sensibility and accuracy in alexithymia would increase; in the other model, they would decrease. Surprisingly, the contribution of interoceptive awareness has been minimally researched. In this study (N = 182), the relationship between participants’ level of alexithymia and the three interoceptive dimensions was tested. Our results show that the higher the level of alexithymia is, the higher interoceptive accuracy and sensibility (R(2) = 0.29 and R(2) = 0.14); conversely, the higher the level of alexithymia is, the lower interoceptive awareness (R(2) = 0.36). Moreover, an ROC analysis reveals that interoceptive awareness is the most accurate predictor of alexithymia, yielding over 92% accuracy. Collectively, these results support a coherent understanding of interoceptive abilities in alexithymia, whereby the dissociation of interoceptive accuracy and awareness may explain the underlying psycho-physiological mechanisms of alexithymia. A possible neurocognitive mechanism is discussed which suggests insurgence of psychosomatic disorders in alexithymia and related psychotherapeutic approaches.

We applied a systems approach in mouse experiments to discover therapeutic targets for vein graft failure. METHODS: Global proteomics and high-dimensional clustering on multiple vein graft tissues were used to identify potential pathogenic mechanisms. The PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) pathway served as an example to substantiate our discovery platform. In vivo mouse experiments with macrophage-targeted PPARα small interfering RNA, or the novel, selective activator pemafibrate demonstrate the role of PPARα in the development and inflammation of vein graft lesions. In vitro experiments further included metabolomic profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, metabolic assays, and single-cell RNA sequencing on primary human and mouse macrophages. RESULTS: We identified changes in the vein graft proteome associated with immune responses, lipid metabolism regulated by the PPARs, fatty acid metabolism, matrix remodeling, and hematopoietic cell mobilization. PPARα agonism by pemafibrate retarded the development and inflammation of vein graft lesions in mice, whereas gene silencing worsened plaque formation. Pemafibrate also suppressed arteriovenous fistula lesion development. Metabolomics/lipidomics, functional metabolic assays, and single-cell analysis of cultured human macrophages revealed that PPARα modulates macrophage glycolysis, citrate metabolism, mitochondrial membrane sphingolipid metabolism, and heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored potential drivers of vein graft inflammation and identified PPARα as a novel potential pharmacological treatment for this unmet medical need.","Decano, Julius L.; Singh, Sasha A.; Gasparotto Bueno, Cauê; Ho Lee, Lang; Halu, Arda; Chelvanambi, Sarvesh; Matamalas, Joan T.; Zhang, Hengmin; Mlynarchik, Andrew K.; Qiao, Jiao; Sharma, Amitabh; Mukai, Shin; Wang, Jianguo; Anderson, Daniel G.; Ozaki, C.

Using reliable and valid instruments to measure the ethical conflict is essential. This study aimed to translate the Ethical Conflict in Nursing Questionnaire — Critical Care Version into Chinese and determine the reliability and validity in the population of Chinese nurses. METHODS: Researchers obtained permission and followed the translation-backward method to develop the Chinese version of the Ethical Conflict in Nursing Questionnaire — Critical Care Version (ECNQ-CCV-C). Relevant psychometric properties were selected according to the Consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments checklist. Critical care nurses were recruited from two tertiary public hospitals in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and Kunming, Yunnan Province. Of the 264 nurses we approached, 248 gave their consent and completed the study. RESULTS: The ECNQ-CCV-C achieved Cronbach’s alphas 0.902 and McDonald’s omega coefficient 0.903. The test-retest reliability was satisfactory within a 2-week interval (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.757). A unidimensional structure of the ECNQ-CCV-C was determined. Confirmatory factor analysis supported acceptable structure validity. Concurrent validity was confirmed by a moderate relation with a measure for hospital ethical climate (r = − 0.33, p < 0.01). The model structure was invariant across different gender groups, with no floor/ceiling effect. CONCLUSIONS: The ECNQ-CCV-C demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity among Chinese nurses and had great clinical utility in critical care nursing.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with HLH from 1 April 2018 to 31 December 2020. The clinical data of these patients (basic information, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, HLH diagnostic criteria, H Score, main treatments, outcomes) were collected. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (23 males and 10 females; 40.55±18.78 years) with 34 clinical episodes (one male had two clinical episodes and died during the second episode) were enrolled. Twenty-five patients were placed in a “survivor” group, and nine patients were categorized into a “deceased” group. Fever, splenomegaly, hemoglobin <90 g/L and platelet count <100×10(9)/L most commonly met the diagnostic standard for HLH. The H Score results in the survival group and deceased group was 212.4±37.18 and 252.1±40.95, respectively. Viral infection was the most common reason for HLH, followed by immune-system disease and cancer. Laboratory tests showed that deceased-group patients had multiple-organ dysfunction. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the lactate dehydrogenase (lactate dehydrogenase) level (P = 0.039; odds ratio, 0.999) was significantly related to death. CONCLUSION: In the emergency department, HLH should be considered for critically ill patients with fever, splenomegaly, low hemoglobin and low platelet count. The H Score might be useful to diagnose HLH quickly. In our study, 26.47% of HLH patients died in the emergency department, and patients with a significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase level had a markedly increased risk of death.","Zhang, Fang-Jie; Huang, Guo-Qing; Li, Jia; Xu, Ji; Li, Xiang-Min; Wang, Ai-Min",Int J Gen Med,39,5

Potential Role for Endorphins in Exercise Effects on Adult Neurogenesis,14.53163,4.464214,2021-07-21,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The mitochondrial enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2), which converts serine into glycine and generates 1C units for cell growth, is one of the most consistently overexpressed metabolic enzymes in cancer. Here, we reveal that the anti-diabetic biguanide metformin operates as a novel class of non-catalytic SHMT2 inhibitor that disrupts the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent SHMT2 oligomerization process and ultimately SHMT2 activity. As SHMT2 inhibitors have not yet reached the clinic, these findings may aid the rational design of PLP-competitive SHMT2 inhibitors based on the biguanide skeleton of metformin. ABSTRACT: The anticancer actions of the biguanide metformin involve the functioning of the serine/glycine one-carbon metabolic network. We report that metformin directly and specifically targets the enzymatic activity of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2). In vitro competitive binding assays with human recombinant SHMT1 and SHMT2 isoforms revealed that metformin preferentially inhibits SHMT2 activity by a non-catalytic mechanism. Computational docking coupled with molecular dynamics simulation predicted that metformin could occupy the cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) cavity and destabilize the formation of catalytically active SHMT2 oligomers. Differential scanning fluorimetry-based biophysical screening confirmed that metformin diminishes the capacity of PLP to promote the conversion of SHMT2 from an inactive, open state to a highly ordered, catalytically competent closed state. CRISPR/Cas9-based disruption of SHMT2, but not of SHMT1, prevented metformin from inhibiting total SHMT activity in cancer cell lines. Isotope tracing studies in SHMT1 knock-out cells confirmed that metformin decreased the SHMT2-channeled serine-to-formate flux and restricted the formate utilization in thymidylate synthesis upon overexpression of the metformin-unresponsive yeast equivalent of mitochondrial complex I (mCI). While maintaining its capacity to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, metformin lost its cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity in SHMT2-null cancer cells unable to produce energy-rich NADH or FADH(2) molecules from tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolites. As currently available SHMT2 inhibitors have not yet reached the clinic, our current data establishing the structural and mechanistic bases of metformin as a small-molecule, PLP-competitive inhibitor of the SHMT2 activating oligomerization should benefit future discovery of biguanide skeleton-based novel SHMT2 inhibitors in cancer prevention and treatment.","Tramonti, Angela; Cuyàs, Elisabet; Encinar, José Antonio; Pietzke, Matthias; Paone, Alessio; Verdura, Sara; Arbusà, Aina; Martin-Castillo, Begoña; Giardina, Giorgio; Joven, Jorge; Vazquez, Alexei; Contestabile, Roberto; Cutruzzolà, Francesca; Menendez, Javier A.",Cancers (Basel),39,1

Furthermore, the advent and now common use of biologic immunosuppressive drugs are given to an increasing number of patients prior to transplantation or for treatment of complications arising during the posttransplant period such as graft-versus-host disease, lymphoproliferative disorders, opportunistic malignancies, cancer recurrences, and rejection of solid organ allograft. These and other recent therapeutic advances in transplantation procedures continue to be fraught with prolonged and often unpredictable period of drug-induced immune dysregulation. The emergence and spread of difficult-to-treat opportunistic bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases in transplant population have evolved under the influence of environmental-, host-, disease-, and treatment-specific variance. A diligent diagnostic adjudication is of utmost importance in a population with known proclivity for atypical disease presentation. Inaccurate diagnosis may result in inappropriate and ineffective empiric therapy that may worsen patients’ morbidity and heighten the risk for further complications and death. Advancement in understanding the immunopathogenesis of infectious diseases, hosts’ immunologic vulnerability for infections, emerging molecular diagnostic paradigms, deciphering potential therapeutic impact of immune modulation by existing and new antimicrobial drugs, and active research and development in mitigation strategies to promote immune recovery and immune preservation are encouraging developments in optimizing care for patients in need for lifesaving transplantation procedures.","Safdar, Amar",Principles and Practice of Transplant Infectious Diseases,39,1

Using these host–pathogen interactions to their advantage, pathogens attach, invade, disseminate, and evade host defense mechanisms to promote their survival in the hostile host environment. Many viruses, bacteria, and parasites express adhesins that bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to facilitate their initial attachment and subsequent cellular entry. Some pathogens also secrete virulence factors that modify HSPG expression. HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed on the cell surface of adherent cells and in the extracellular matrix. HSPGs are composed of one or several heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains attached covalently to specific core proteins. For most intracellular pathogens, cell surface HSPGs serve as a scaffold that facilitates the interaction of microbes with secondary receptors that mediate host cell entry. Consistent with this mechanism, addition of HS or its pharmaceutical functional mimic, heparin, inhibits microbial attachment and entry into cultured host cells, and HS-binding pathogens can no longer attach or enter cultured host cells whose HS expression has been reduced by enzymatic treatment or chemical mutagenesis. In pathogens where the specific HS adhesin has been identified, mutant strains lacking HS adhesins are viable and show normal growth rates, suggesting that the capacity to interact with HSPGs is strictly a virulence activity. The goal of this chapter is to provide a mechanistic overview of our current understanding of how certain microbial pathogens subvert HSPGs to promote their infection, using specific HSPG–pathogen interactions as representative examples.","Bartlett, Allison H.; Park, Pyong Woo",Glycans in Diseases and Therapeutics,39,2

Unlike other RNA viruses which make their structural proteins first, this class of proteins is synthesized after −1 PRF, from subgenomic mRNAs produced subsequent to production of RDRP. Also unique among the coronaviruses is the inclusion of mRNA structural elements that do not appear to be essential for frameshifting. Understanding the differences between –1 PRF signals from coronaviruses and other viruses will enhance our understanding of –1 PRF in general, and will be instructive in designing new classes of antiviral therapeutics. In this chapter we summarize current knowledge and add additional insight to the function of the programmed –1 ribosomal frameshift signal present in the SARS-associated coronavirus.","Dinman, Jonathan D.",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,39,1

In undertaking public engagement, researchers and policy makers may be motivated by the desire to build policy which is acceptable and workable in the community, that is instrumental goals are foremost. With instrumental goals in mind, there are a number of ways to collect community views but they may provide quite different answers as shown in the two examples described here. In the chapter we explore, the relationship between choice of method of engagement and (i) the findings of the engagement exercise, and (ii) the acceptability and applicability of these findings in a policy context.","Street, Jackie M.; Marshall, Helen; Braunack-Mayer, Annette J.; Rogers, Wendy A.; Ryan, Philip",Big Picture Bioethics: Developing Democratic Policy in Contested Domains,39,16

Social relations provide an independent source of information about users and can be exploited for improving recommendation performance. Most of existing recommendation methods exploit social influence by refining social relations into a scalar indicator to either directly recommend friends’ visited items to users or constrain that friends’ embeddings are similar. However, a scalar indicator cannot express the multifaceted interest correlations between users, since each user’s interest is distributed across multiple dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a new embedding-based framework, which exploits users’ multifaceted interest correlation for social recommendation. We design a dimension-wise attention mechanism to learn a correlation vector to characterize the interest correlation between a pair of friends, capturing the high variation of users’ interest correlation on multiple dimensions. Moreover, we use friends’ embeddings to smooth a user’s own embedding with the correlation vector as weights, building the elaborate unstructured social influence between users. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that modeling users’ multifaceted interest correlations can significantly improve recommendation performance.","Wang, Hao; Shen, Huawei; Cheng, Xueqi",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,39,1

In this paper, we start from elements and relations discovered inspecting the literature on business process meta-models through a systematic literature review. We then combine these elements and relations to build a business process meta-model. The obtained literature-based business process meta-model, which is on purpose built to disclose criticalities, is then inspected and discussed.

But it's likely that, once disruption and uncertainty fade, the rebound in activity will be strong. It's important for firms to position themselves for such a recovery. ▪ Historical evidence supports this view. In the past 200 years, short recessions have typically been followed by robust recovery. Long‐term impacts from natural disasters have generally only been evident for specific hazards. Except for AIDS, longer‐term pandemic effects also appear to have been contained. ▪ Surveys during the 2003 SARS and 2009 influenza outbreaks highlight one explanation for time‐limited impacts. Public fears increased alongside rising infection rates, but they dissipated promptly as outbreaks came under control. ▪ Our modelling is consistent with these stylised facts. In our coronavirus pandemic scenario, global growth grinds to a halt in Q2 2020 but then rebounds to a rapid pace within a year. With much of the initial output loss recovered in a relatively short period of time, long‐term impacts are limited. ▪ But there are risks to this view. The period of disruption could be longer than anticipated, depending on the potential spread and seasonality of COVID‐19 and policy actions to mitigate the fallout. Opinion polls also highlight the potential risk of larger, more persistent effects for some countries. ▪ Moreover, coronavirus‐related weakness and associated financial distress could expose other key vulnerabilities ‐ for example related to deteriorating corporate sector balance sheets and fragile trade relations. These would be expected to have persistent effects on global activity over the coming years.",,,39,22

The expected ubiquity of NVM has stimulated interest in the design of novel concepts ensuring correctness of concurrent programming abstractions in the face of persistency. So far, this has lead to the design of a number of persistent concurrent data structures, built to satisfy an associated notion of correctness: durable linearizability. In this paper, we transfer the principle of durable concurrent correctness to the area of software transactional memory (STM). Software transactional memory algorithms allow for concurrent access to shared state. Like linearizability for concurrent data structures, opacity is the established notion of correctness for STMs. First, we provide a novel definition of durable opacity extending opacity to handle crashes and recovery in the context of NVM. Second, we develop a durably opaque version of an existing STM algorithm, namely the Transactional Mutex Lock (TML). Third, we design a proof technique for durable opacity based on refinement between TML and an operational characterisation of durable opacity by adapting the TMS2 specification. Finally, we apply this proof technique to show that the durable version of TML is indeed durably opaque. The correctness proof is mechanized within Isabelle.","Bila, Eleni; Doherty, Simon; Dongol, Brijesh; Derrick, John; Schellhorn, Gerhard; Wehrheim, Heike","Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems",39,16

The StMungo (“Scribble-to-Mungo”) tool is a bridge between multiparty session types and typestates. StMungo translates a communication protocol, namely a sequence of sends and receives of messages, given as a multiparty session type in the Scribble language, into a typestate specification and a Java API skeleton. The generated API skeleton is then further extended with the necessary logic, and finally typechecked by Mungo. The Mungo tool extends Java with (optional) typestate specifications. A typestate is a state machine specifying a Java object protocol, namely the permitted sequence of method calls of that object. Mungo statically typechecks that method calls follow the object’s protocol, as defined by its typestate specification. Finally, if no errors are reported, the code is compiled with javac and run as standard Java code. In this tutorial paper we give an overview of the stages of the [St]Mungo toolchain, starting from Scribble communication protocols, translating to Java classes with typestates, and finally to typechecking method calls with Mungo. We illustrate the [St]Mungo toolchain via a real-world case study, the HTTP client-server request-response protocol over TCP.

In addition to tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), recent epidemiological studies have shown the emergence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species in causing lung diseases in humans. Although more than 170 NTM species are present in various environmental niches, only a handful, primarily Mycobacterium avium complex and M. abscessus, have been implicated in pulmonary disease. While TB is transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets containing Mtb, generated by patients with symptomatic disease, NTM disease is mostly disseminated through aerosols originated from the environment. However, following inhalation, both Mtb and NTM are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs. Subsequently, various immune cells are recruited from the circulation to the site of infection, which leads to granuloma formation. Although the pathophysiology of TB and NTM diseases share several fundamental cellular and molecular events, the host-susceptibility to Mtb and NTM infections are different. Striking differences also exist in the disease presentation between TB and NTM cases. While NTM disease is primarily associated with bronchiectasis, this condition is rarely a predisposing factor for TB. Similarly, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, NTM disease presents as disseminated, extrapulmonary form rather than as a miliary, pulmonary disease, which is seen in Mtb infection. The diagnostic modalities for TB, including molecular diagnosis and drug-susceptibility testing (DST), are more advanced and possess a higher rate of sensitivity and specificity, compared to the tools available for NTM infections. In general, drug-sensitive TB is effectively treated with a standard multi-drug regimen containing well-defined first- and second-line antibiotics. However, the treatment of drug-resistant TB requires the additional, newer class of antibiotics in combination with or without the first and second-line drugs. In contrast, the NTM species display significant heterogeneity in their susceptibility to standard anti-TB drugs. Thus, the treatment for NTM diseases usually involves the use of macrolides and injectable aminoglycosides. Although well-established international guidelines are available, treatment of NTM disease is mostly empirical and not entirely successful. In general, the treatment duration is much longer for NTM diseases, compared to TB, and resection surgery of affected organ(s) is part of treatment for patients with NTM diseases that do not respond to the antibiotics treatment. Here, we discuss the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment modalities available for TB and NTM diseases of humans.","Gopalaswamy, Radha; Shanmugam, Sivakumar; Mondal, Rajesh; Subbian, Selvakumar",J Biomed Sci,39,1

Instead, individual devices build their own models, and the model parameters are transmitted. The server constructs a global model using these parameters, which is then re-transmitted back to the devices. The major bottleneck of this approach is the communication overhead as all the devices need to transmit their model parameters at regular intervals. Here we present an interesting and novel alternative to federated learning known as Fusion Learning, where the distribution parameters of the client’s data along with its local model parameters are sent to the server. The server regenerates the data from these distribution parameters and fuses all the data from multiple devices. This combined dataset is now used to build a global model that is transmitted back to the individual devices. Our experiments show that the accuracy achieved through this approach is in par with both a federated setup and a centralized framework needing only one round of communication to the central server.","Kasturi, Anirudh; Ellore, Anish Reddy; Hota, Chittaranjan",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,39,1

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in more than 6,700,000 infections and 390,000 deaths worldwide. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by this virus. In this project concept, we aim to focus on the peptide-protein interaction analysis using two important drug targets in SARS-CoV-2 such as spike (S) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. These proteins play an important role in the virus entry and encapsidation of the viral particles. Motifs or functional regions in these two proteins must be sharing sequence homology with human protein (ACE2) which may be involved in the binding mechanism. The results will show a set of motif regions which can disrupt the viral infection. Once we identify these sets of antigenic determinant regions, antibody binding activity studies can be performed by in vitro methods. Our results from this study may suggest the existence of antigenic mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins. The hit peptide components will have therapeutic applications to be developed into a wide variety of medicinal formulations against SARS-CoV-2 such as vaccine, intranasal and inhalation formulations. Also, the choice of conserved regions will lead to development of cross protective therapeutics against wide range of coronaviruses.","Madhavan, Maya; Mustafa, Sabeena",Trans Indian Natl,39,1

To this point, it is unclear if PP is also beneficial for ARDS patients treated with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support. METHODS: We report retrospective data of a single-centre registry of patients with severe ARDS requiring VV ECMO support between October 2010 and May 2018. Patients were allocated to the PP group if PP was performed during VV ECMO treatment or the supine positioning group. VV ECMO weaning success and hospital survival were analysed before and after propensity score matching. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients could be analysed, and 38 patients (24.1%) received PP. There were no significant differences in VV ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.94) and hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.7%, p = 0.98) between the prone and supine groups, respectively. The analysis of 38 propensity score matched pairs also showed no difference in hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.8%, p = 1.0) or VV ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 44.7%, p = 0.82).

Previous research has implicated CTLA4 as a potential susceptibility gene. CTLA4 is an important regulator of T cell function and polymorphisms/mutations in CTLA4 have been associated with a number of autoimmune phenotypes in both humans and rodent models of autoimmunity. The aim of the current study was to undertake a case:control association study of CTLA4 promotor polymorphisms in three dog breeds, cocker spaniels, springer spaniels and West Highland white terriers (WHWT). RESULTS: Polymorphisms in the CTLA4 promoter were determined by PCR and sequence-based typing. There were significant associations with three promoter haplotypes in cocker spaniels (p = 0.003). A series of SNPs were also associated with hypoadrenocorticism in cocker spaniels and springer spaniels, including polymorphisms in predicted NFAT and SP1 transcription factor binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that CTLA4 promotor polymorphisms are associated with this complex genetic disease and supports an immune mediated aetiopathogenesis of canine hypoadrenocorticism.","Boag, Alisdair M.; Short, Andrea; Kennedy, Lorna J.; Syme, Hattie; Graham, Peter A.; Catchpole, Brian",Canine Med Genet,39,1

The paper surveys 24 southern and east African countries within the context of COVID-19. Between 5 March and 15 April 2020 COVID-19 had spread to 23 southern and east African countries, except Lesotho. The overwhelming majority of these countries imposed general restrictions on their populations from March 2020 and nearly all restricted visits to prisons to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The pandemic and government responses demonstrated the importance of reliable and up to date data on the prison population, and any confined population, as it became evident that such information is sorely lacking. The World Health Organization recommended the release of prisoners to ease congestion, a step supported by the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. However, the lack of data and the particular African context pose some questions about the desirability of such a move. The curtailment of prison visits by external persons also did away with independent oversight even in states parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). In the case of South Africa, prison monitors were not listed in the ensuing legislation as part of essential services and thus were excluded from access to prisons. In the case of Mozambique, it was funding being placed on hold by the donor community that prevented the Human Rights Commission from visiting prisons. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted long-standing systemic problems in Africa’s prisons. Yet African states have remained remarkably reluctant to engage in prison reform, despite the fact that poorly managed prisons pose a significant threat to general public health care.","Muntingh, Lukas M",J Hum Rights Pract,39,1

This is further emphasised within 'ASPHER's European List of Core Competencies for the Public Health Professional' which mentions that public health responsibilities fall upon the 'public health workforce'. If even those outside the medical profession are considered part of the public health workforce, why are medical students being overlooked as a group who can contribute? As representatives of the future generation of medical professionals, shouldn't they be an obvious starting point for practising public health advocacy? Medical students have the potential to act and, with better integration into the public health workforce, could become an asset. Despite them having a legal obligation to contribute in emergency situations, there are insufficiencies or a lack of clarity within the guidelines to highlight and elaborate on what students are specifically expected to be able to carry out in various situations. This is in stark contrast to the predefined lists of competencies against which medical professionals are assessed. This workshop will focus on identifying the core competencies regarding medical students in their contribution to emergency preparedness and how these could be integrated into the existing framework for effecting a structured and organised response. The primary outcome is to achieve better advocacy for public health in future medical professionals with a focus on preparedness for emergency situations. To begin with, research carried out to elucidate whether different countries have set guidelines or competencies that are expected of medical students by the conclusion of their medical studies will be presented. Such guidelines both on national and regional levels were identified and then compared following analysis. This will be followed by more personal accounts from medical students and a discussion of the potential steps that could be introduced to improve emergency preparedness. Shortcomings of such guidelines concerning medical student competencies are further highlighted in times of crisis such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is during this time when healthcare systems are stretched and their contribution may be most valuable. The nature of this contribution within the context of international pandemic plans will be explored and debated. Finally this workshop will conclude by opening up the floor for discussion between the panellists and the audience regarding the topics and issues raised. This workshop aims to highlight the need for core competencies in medical education and bring this topic to the forefront for further discussion and analysis amongst professionals, with the eventual international unification, simplification and clarification of these being the ultimate goal. This could be pivotal for the future of public health and in the advancement and evolution of education. KEY MESSAGES: Armed with suitable competencies, medical students can be an asset to the public health workforce if utilised effectively and in doing so can enhance preparedness response.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between public health interventions against the COVID-19 outbreak and the outcome. METHODS: The observational study included data on incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases (outcome) and public health non-pharmaceutical interventions (exposure) from five countries: France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the USA, December 31, 2019 through April 12, 2020. The public health measures were grouped into five categories: lockdown, movement restrictions, public health measures, social (including social distancing) and economic measures, and use of facial mask. The multiple linear regressions were utilized to test the hypothesis that implementation of some public health measures was associated with the change in the incident number of COVID-19 cases, 2-sided, α = 0.05. RESULTS: The incidence of COVID-19 would be significantly greater without lockdown (1.89 times, p-value <.0001), public health and economic measures (25.17, p-value <.0001), and using masks (11.93, p-value=0.002), assuming that all other public health policies are the same. The effectiveness increases with earlier time of implementation. Among considered countries, South Korea was the most efficacious, where all measures were statistically significantly efficacious (p-value <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate an association between public health measures and the outcome. The experience from South Korea should be studied further as the most effective non-pharmacological approach to fight the disease. This paper is the first step to develop the standardized approach utilizing the public health interventions to be applied effectively to the globe population.

This study examines the successfulness of the handling of disasters in Indonesia, with particular focus on eruptions of Mount Merapi. Disasters foster a close relationship between the government and the community in response to the emergency. This study uses a mixed method to analyse social networks in evaluating the structure of disaster networks in Indonesia and their implications for disaster management. Data were collected via a survey of 100 respondents from 28 institutions representing, for practical purposes, each population identified by each institution (government, non-governmental organisations and volunteers) that participated in handling the Merapi eruption disaster. The findings revealed that considerable miscommunication between institutions reduced the effectiveness of disaster management so that close discussion about conflict resolution was needed to develop more mature and systematic planning. Inter-agency trust is also felt to be necessary in disaster management. Trust between agency members and other institutions strongly supports the success of systematic disaster management. Meanwhile, every institution must foster open leadership by giving individuals with precise knowledge of the situation and the condition of the disaster area a mandate to lead directly in the field. Disaster governance is carried out through the agreement of each institution formed in the Disaster Emergency Planning (Rencana Penanggulangan Kedaruratan Bencana – RPKB) guidelines. These guidelines expect the Government and the community to coordinate with each other in a structured and systematic manner in the process of disaster management.","Pratama, Prawira Yudha; Nurmandi, Achmad",Jamba,39,1

Such traditional agroforestry systems can foster a variety of benefits; besides positive livelihood implications baobab can particularly address food security objectives due to its highly nutritious fruits. However, many bottlenecks persist inhibiting the broader potential of indigenous trees in farming systems and their increased utilisation and commercialisation. We suggest that traditional farming systems with baobab trees can be advanced by stimulating the emergence of local markets for baobab products while promoting businesses and innovations aimed at meeting the arising market demand. Increasing the perceived value of local agroforestry products in combination with facilitating additional commercialisation pathways will in turn lead to food security and livelihood benefits. Using a multi-stakeholder approach such considerations were put into practice in Kilifi, Kenya, by initiating a community-based enterprise development producing high-quality baobab powder and oil. Initial results demonstrate behavioural changes, an improved practical knowhow with regard to baobab management and utilisation, and an increased consumption of baobab, which may already contribute to food security objectives. Baobab is increasingly seen as a valuable resource as opposed to ‘food for the poor’ and a tree possessed by evil spirits. This may lay the groundwork for further value addition activities and enterprise development in the communities. With baobab being a common, yet so far underutilised feature of local farming systems in Kilifi, activities based on its increasing commercialisation can be complementary and easily integrable to prevailing livelihood strategies.","Meinhold, Kathrin; Darr, Dietrich",Agroforest Syst,39,1

The prevalence of diseases and behavioural effects in organic dairy cow, beef cattle, sheep, pig, laying hen and broiler chicken were discussed in the context of the organic values and current knowledge on animal health and welfare. In total 166 peer-reviewed scientific publications between 2008 and 2020 were included. No strong evidence for neither inferior nor distinctly higher animal welfare in organic compared with conventional production could be supported. The welfare status of organic livestock is in general good in relation to the OIE definition of animal health and welfare. However, organic systems are still facing several challenges related to animal health and the arising of goal conflicts due to management and practical implications. Greater possibilities to perform species-specific behaviours in organic production systems, however, indicate that the organic standards offer a good framework for high animal welfare management. For organic dairy farmers, the main health problems are similar to those of non-organic farms; especially mastitis and lameness need improvement. Parasites, together with mastitis and lamb mortality, are important welfare issues in organic sheep production. Piglet mortality, leg problems, parasite load and increasing respiratory problems are of major relevance in organic pig production. For organic laying hens, major health challenges relate to feather pecking and cannibalism, parasites and possibilities to express species-specific behaviours. For organic broilers, dermatitis of footpads, hocks and breast are reported as main health issues.","Åkerfeldt, Magdalena Presto; Gunnarsson, Stefan; Bernes, Gun; Blanco-Penedo, Isabel",Org,39,1

On the other hand, the behavior of system features (e.g., operating systems) and the external world (e.g., communication between components) is usually specified using first-order formalisms. In principle, the soundness theorem of a separation logic is its interface with first-order theorems, but the soundness theorem may implicitly make assumptions about how other components are specified, limiting its use. In this paper, we show how to extend the higher-order separation logic of the Verified Software Toolchain to interface with a first-order verified operating system, in this case CertiKOS, that mediates its interaction with the outside world. The resulting system allows us to prove the correctness of C programs in separation logic based on the semantics of system calls implemented in CertiKOS. It also demonstrates that the combination of interaction trees + CompCert memories serves well as a lingua franca to interface and compose two quite different styles of program verification.","Mansky, William; Honoré, Wolf; Appel, Andrew W.",Programming Languages and Systems,39,22

As telehealth services continue to expand, a better understanding of patient satisfaction is required in order to optimize the patient experience for IBD patients. METHODS: We analyzed patient satisfaction data from a metropolitan tertiary hospital’s IBD outpatient clinic. Three questions were compared between in-person and virtual visits: “Did this provider listen carefully to you?”, “Did this provider seem to know the important information about your medical history?”, and “Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst provider possible and 10 is the best provider possible, what number would you rate this provider?” We performed Fisher’s exact tests to analyze differences in top-box satisfaction scores between in-person and virtual visits. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions was performed to identify key satisfaction themes. RESULTS: We collected satisfaction data from 309 in-person medical visits and 202 telehealth visits. Top-box satisfaction scores for provider listening and provider medical history decreased overall from in-person to virtual visits, while overall provider ratings remained the same (Figure 1). Decreases were larger among males than among females for both provider listening and provider knowledge (Table 1). After excluding patients who reported problems with the video connection or video quality, no statistically significant changes in top-box scores were found between in-person and telehealth visits (Figure 1). Open-ended answers where overwhelmingly positive, but care coordination issues and technical problems were perceived as barriers. DISCUSSION: We identified a decrease in patient satisfaction with telehealth visits compared to in-person visits, particularly among males. This decrease was not observed after adjusting for those experiencing technical issues with their visit. Efforts to improve telehealth technology platforms, patient preparation for telehealth visits, and provider education regarding handling technology glitches during a visit may help improve overall patient satisfaction with virtual IBD visits.","Ghafari-Saravi, Afsoon; Rabizadeh, Shervin; Dubovsky, Alan; Miller, Shaun; Melmed, Gil; van Deen, Welmoed",Inflamm Bowel Dis,39,22

Imprudent online posts distort the posters’ digital identity, which refers to one’s online image as perceived by others. Online attention-seeking behaviour may result in digital identities that are separate from a person’s true nature, which can lead to social and mental harm. To mitigate these impacts, effective educational material is needed to help non-technical users understand the risks and consequences of thoughtless, attention-seeking online behaviour. This study takes the first step towards fulfilling this educational need by developing the Online Attention Game (OAG), which is played in a laboratory or classroom setting (OAG-CS) or remotely (OAG-R). It replicates the online competition involved in seeking other social media users’ attention. Through five OAG games (two OAG-CS games with students, two OAG-CS games with researchers, and one OAG-R game with researchers), we confirmed the tendencies and characteristics of young university students’ and adult researchers’ online posting behaviour. Through carrying out the OAG-R successfully, we ensured the OAG was useful for digital identity education even at the difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Obana, Tadao; Takubo, Miha; Orito, Yohko; Murata, Kiyoshi; Sai, Hidenobu; Okamoto, Tadayuki",Rev Socionetwork Strat,39,1

This paper has the aim to measure the cost of a missed integration, by highlighting what GDP growth would be in case of a missed integration. It does so by building a scenario of missed integration and compares it with a reference scenario. Scenarios are based on the Macroeconomics, Social, Sectoral, Territorial (MASST) model that has recently been updated to its fourth generation, whereby regional economic relations are tested econometrically. The estimated cause–effect chains are then the basis to build new scenarios simulated under complex sets of internally coherent assumptions in a simulation stage. The reference scenario presented is not a simple extrapolation of past trends; the post-crisis period registered structural changes to be taken into account for the future. In the integration scenario, we assume further integration within the EU to take place through the following changes: (1) higher trade flows among EU countries (“production integration effect”); (2) higher decrease in non-tariffs barriers (“proximity effect to larger markets”); (3) higher trust within and among countries (“social effect”); (4) higher quality of government (“institutional effect”); (5) stronger cooperation networks among cities (“cooperation effect”); and (6) higher exports (“market integration effect”). Results show that a more integrated scenario leads to faster economic growth across all EU countries. Territorial disparities are also initially lower in the case of more integration, although this difference abates over time. Lastly, the gains from integration are not spatially even and some regions gain more than others.","Capello, Roberta; Caragliu, Andrea",A Broad View of Regional Science,39,1

Tourism in Botswana is currently highly based around the country’s natural resources although it stands as having the potential to grow beyond this by diversification facilitated for by Tourism product development. The success of this industry in Botswana can be attributed to the low volume, high value, nature-based tourism in national parks and game reserves taking place mostly in the north of this country Globally Tourism development is increasingly being viewed as an important tool for promoting economic growth and alleviating poverty amongst others. While Tourism is a multi-sector industry, it is not an industry that is immune to rapid decline due to the effects of global pandemics and other events. In the year 2020 this is proving to be true in the case of not only Botswana’s economic development and progression, but the Covid 19 pandemic is negatively affecting global tourism to date.

CEPS is also sufficiently adaptable to be used for other time series physiological data such as EEG (electroencephalography), postural sway or temperature measurements. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience sample of nine healthy adults in a pilot for a larger study investigating the effects on vagal tone of breathing paced at various different rates, part of a development programme for a home training stress reduction system. Results: The current version of CEPS focuses on those complexity and entropy measures that appear most frequently in the literature, together with some recently introduced entropy measures which may have advantages over those that are more established. Ten methods of estimating data complexity are currently included, and some 28 entropy measures. The GUI also includes a section for data pre-processing and standard ancillary methods to enable parameter estimation of embedding dimension m and time delay τ (‘tau’) where required. The software is freely available under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3) for non-commercial users. CEPS can be downloaded from Bitbucket. In our illustration on PB, most complexity and entropy measures decreased significantly in response to breathing at 7 breaths per minute, differentiating more clearly than conventional linear, time- and frequency-domain measures between breathing states. In contrast, Higuchi fractal dimension increased during paced breathing. Conclusions: We have developed CEPS software as a physiological data visualiser able to integrate state of the art techniques. The interface is designed for clinical research and has a structure designed for integrating new tools. The aim is to strengthen collaboration between clinicians and the biomedical community, as demonstrated here by using CEPS to analyse various physiological responses to paced breathing.","Mayor, David; Panday, Deepak; Kandel, Hari Kala; Steffert, Tony; Banks, Duncan",Entropy (Basel),39,1

One mechanism of action is their reactivity toward thiols of metabolites like cysteine and glutathione (GSH). This work aimed at better understanding these interactions. Both 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) and abscisic acid (ABA) conjugated with cysteine. It was found that the reactivity of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls with GSH followed the sequence trans-2-hexenal < 12-OPDA ≈ 12-OPDA-ethylester < 2-cyclopentenone << methyl vinylketone (MVK). Interestingly, GSH, but not ascorbate (vitamin C), supplementation ameliorated the phytotoxic potential of MVK. In addition, 12-OPDA and 12-OPDA-related conjugated carbonyl compounds interacted with proteins, e.g., with members of the thioredoxin (TRX)-fold family. 12-OPDA modified two cysteinyl residues of chloroplast TRX-f1. The OPDAylated TRX-f1 lost its activity to activate the Calvin–Benson-cycle enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). Finally, we show that 12-OPDA interacts with cyclophilin 20-3 (Cyp20-3) non-covalently and affects its peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans isomerase activity. The results demonstrate the high potential of 12-OPDA as a diverse interactor and cellular regulator and suggest that OPDAylation may occur in plant cells and should be investigated as novel regulatory mechanism.","Maynard, Daniel; Viehhauser, Andrea; Knieper, Madita; Dreyer, Anna; Manea, Ghamdan; Telman, Wilena; Butter, Falk; Chibani, Kamel; Scheibe, Renate; Dietz, Karl-Josef",Biomolecules,39,16

PURPOSE: Considering that sleep restriction influences eating behavior, we highlight that changes in it may occur during the COVID-19 quarantine. Alterations in feeding time can uncouple the body clocks, leading to circadian misalignment and consequently to a disruption in homeostasis and disturbances in many metabolic functions. METHOD: Narrative review. RESULTS: Do not apply. CONCLUSION: The increase of body weight is related to increased food intake in response to mental stress and more time spent at home, increased opportunity to feed, and increased visual and olfactory stimulation to eat, which represents a potential risk of overfeeding nowadays. In this article, we postulate that the unusual lifestyle imposed by the COVID-19 quarantine may induce a circadian misalignment, which is capable to induce alterations on eating and sleep behaviors.","da Silva, Flavia Rodrigues; Junior, Antonio Herbert Lancha; Brant, Valdênio Martins; Lôbo, Ingrid Ludimila Bastos; Lancha, Luciana Oquendo Pereira; Silva, Andressa; de Mello, Marco Túlio",Nutrire,39,5

The gut microbiome is a critical determinant of health and modulates host immunity and metabolism through a number of recognised pathways, including through the production of immunomodulatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Dietary supplementation with non-digestible fibre can augment the microbial production of SCFA and lead to favourable immune and metabolic outcomes, although this has yet to be shown in human kidney transplant recipients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Dietary inulin for gut health in solid-organ transplantation (DIGEST) is a single-centre, unblinded, pilot parallel-arm randomised controlled trial designed to assess the feasibility and adherence of dietary inulin, a naturally occurring dietary fibre, in the early post-transplant period in kidney transplant recipients. Participants will be randomised at day 28 post-transplant to a 4-week period of dietary inulin (10–20 g/day) in addition to standard care, or standard care alone, and followed-up until week 12 post-transplant. The primary outcomes of the study are: (i) the feasibility of participant recruitment, randomisation and retention; (ii) adherence to the intervention (inulin) and (iii) the tolerability of inulin determined by changes in gastrointestinal symptoms as scored on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes include: (1) glycaemic variability determined by continuous glucose monitoring; (2) abundance of SCFA-producing microbiota, as determined by 16s rRNA sequencing of the faecal metagenome; (3) serum SCFA concentrations; (4) peripheral blood immune cell populations; (5) recipient inflammatory and metabolic profiles and (6) the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection and kidney function determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All study visits, clinical and laboratory assessments will be integrated into usual post-transplant care, creating no additional healthcare encounters or procedures. The risks associated with this study are minor. Inulin has been shown to be well tolerated across a variety of cohorts, with the occurrence of short-term adverse gastrointestinal symptoms self-limiting. However, with gastrointestinal adverse events common following kidney transplantation, the tolerability of inulin in this cohort remains unknown. The results of DIGEST will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences. This study has been approved by the Sydney Local Health District’s Ethics Committee (Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Zone).

An interactive SimMan3G-mannequin, technician utilizing a Mask-Ed™, trained confederate nurse and a video flexible laryngoscope trainer were used to provide high-fidelity simulation. Participants rated how prepared-they felt in managing the relevant condition before and after on a Likert scale (1–strongly disagree, 5–strongly agree). The session was repeated for the new nine first-on-call ENT doctors. RESULTS: Participants in the pilot session felt more prepared in managing both tracheostomy emergencies (1.2vs4.2)-and-epistaxis (2.0vs5.8). Participants in the subsequent session also felt-more-prepared in managing stridor (2.1vs4.6) -and-epistaxis-(3.1vs4.7). All-14-attendants stated that they would recommend the session to others. CONCLUSIONS: Despite-the-simulation-course-being-originally-established-to help support newly qualified-FiY1 doctors during COVID-19, the success of the programme has resulted in its formal incorporation-into departmental ENT induction.","Li, L; Hopkins, M; Oliver, N; Wet, D T Du; Hathorn, I; Mellanby, E",Br J Surg,39,16

In particular, conspiracy theories argued on the effect of specific new technologies like 5G and misinformation tarnished the reputation of brands like Huawei. Language plays a crucial role in understanding the motivational determinants of social media users in sharing misinformation, as people extract meaning from information based on their discursive resources and their skillset. In this paper, we analyze textual and non-textual cues from a panel of 4923 tweets containing the hashtags #5G and #Huawei during the first week of May 2020, when several countries were still adopting lockdown measures, to determine whether or not a tweet is retweeted and, if so, how much it is retweeted. Overall, through traditional logistic regression and machine learning, we found different effects of the textual and non-textual cues on the retweeting of a tweet and on its ability to accumulate retweets. In particular, the presence of misinformation plays an interesting role in spreading the tweet on the network. More importantly, the relative influence of the cues suggests that Twitter users actually read a tweet but not necessarily they understand or critically evaluate it before deciding to share it on the social media platform.","Di Domenico, Giandomenico; Tuan, Annamaria; Visentin, Marco",Ital,39,1

Accordingly, this study sought to examine the impact of the pandemic on the dietary intake of youth participating in the Creating Opportunities for Adolescents through Coaching, Healthy Eating, and Sports (COACHES) program, an intervention using coaches trained in trauma-informed coaching strategies to improve health of youth from at-risk communities. METHODS: The COACHES program recruited 6th and 7th grade students from five schools in New Orleans, LA. Students (n = 67) completed an adapted version of the CoRonavIrus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) for Youth (V0.3) to assess dietary intake and perception of health during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics were used to examine self-reported impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Among the students who completed the CRISIS questionnaire (n = 67, 11.7+/−0.73 yrs, 55.2% female, 41.8% overweight/obese), 49.3% reported an overall physical health decrease during the pandemic, 65.6% were not meeting recommendations for daily fruit and vegetable intake, and 72.7% consumed sugary beverages two or more times daily. However, more than one-third actually reported increasing fruit and vegetable consumption during the pandemic, and more than one-quarter reduced their sugary beverage intake. Boys were more likely than girls to report increased fruit and vegetable intake, and youth who were overweight or obese were more likely to report maintaining or improving their overall diet, though results were only significant at the 90% level (P = 0.065). CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges due to COVID-19, urban youth report improved dietary intake during the pandemic. These results highlight the importance of school-based intervention programs in meeting the nutrition needs of at-risk youth.

A study of 371 freshmen in a Chinese university showed that extraversion had a curvilinear relationship with social acceptance, such that the relationship was significantly positive from lower to moderate levels of extraversion, but the positive relationship leveled off at higher levels of extraversion. Extraversion also had a curvilinear relationship with depression, such that the relationship was significantly negative from lower to moderate levels of extraversion, but the negative relationship leveled off at higher levels of extraversion. The study indicates that beyond a certain point, the beneficial effects of extraversion on socialization outcomes were diminished. That is, higher levels of extraversion were not associated with more positive socialization outcomes (though they were not associated with worse outcomes either) when extraversion exceeded a certain point.

Food security and quality are top row topics in today’s world health scenario. During sudden food crisis, it needs extra attention where producers, suppliers, and stakeholders play the most vital roles. This paper puts forward a two-phase sustainable multi-tier supplier selection model for FSC based on an integrated decision analysis under multi-criteria perspectives considering sustainability criteria, suppliers and sub-suppliers. In the first phase, the model estimates supplier selection criteria weights using a combined version of step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and level based weight assessment (LBWA) in conjunction with D-numbers. In the second phase, Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS)-D method is applied to obtain a ranking pre-order of different tier suppliers. Moreover, several sensitivity analyses are carried out in order to examine model reliability. To check application practicability, the proposed model is implemented in a case study of WineSol Corporation in Spain. The proposed model is expected to serve as a kickoff point for developing advanced decision-making models for effectually address multi-tier supplier selection problems under uncertain environment.","Yazdani, Morteza; Pamucar, Dragan; Chatterjee, Prasenjit; Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi",Oper Manag Res,39,1

We evaluated the role of the endocannabinoid/CB(1)R system and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) for dual‐target therapeutic strategy using human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung samples from patients with HPS and controls, HPS‐PF patient‐derived lung fibroblasts, and bleomycin‐induced PF in pale ear mice (HPS1(ep/ep)). We found overexpression of CB(1)R and iNOS in fibrotic lungs of HPSPF patients and bleomycin‐infused pale ear mice. The endocannabinoid anandamide was elevated in BALF and negatively correlated with pulmonary function parameters in HPSPF patients and pale ear mice with bleomycin‐induced PF. Simultaneous targeting of CB(1)R and iNOS by MRI‐1867 yielded greater antifibrotic efficacy than inhibiting either target alone by attenuating critical pathologic pathways. Moreover, MRI‐1867 treatment abrogated bleomycin‐induced increases in lung levels of the profibrotic interleukin‐11 via iNOS inhibition and reversed mitochondrial dysfunction via CB(1)R inhibition.

To understand their hopes, we distinguished between transcendent and immanent hopes, a distinction that was motivated by our initial interpretation of the interviews. All the authors described difficulties in addressing social issues in their science textbook writing in the processes of authorization and resistance from science teachers, which located their hope in the transcendent domain. Yet, their immanent hopes with the agency also emerged in the discussion of teachers’ actions to develop and use alternative texts that engage with local socio-environmental issues, rather than on textbook content innovations.

The Johansen cointegration and ARDL approaches were used after realizing a varied order of integration from the stationarity test by adopting unit root tests. All variables were established to wield a positive impact on economic development except financial development from the financial sector which was significant in the short run but insignificant in the long run. Financial development from the private sector, exchange rate, consumer price index, gross domestic product, and population wield significant influence on FDI inflow for economic development, which implies that an improvement in these factors will equitably support economic growth. In principle, 1% improvement in the financial development from the private sector and exchange rate will produce a corresponding 397% and 78% increase advancement in FDI inflows in the long run. Averagely, financial development from the private sector, exchange rate, consumer price index, gross domestic product, and population are valuable to the economy of Rwanda.

With BRICKxAR, physical LEGO construction is guided by virtual bricks. Compared with the state of the art, accuracy of the virtual–physical model alignment is significantly improved through a new design of marker-based registration, which can achieve an average error less than 1 mm throughout the model. Realistic object occlusion is accomplished to reveal the true spatial relationship between physical and virtual bricks. LEGO players’ hand detection and occlusion are realized to visualize the correct spatial relationship between real hands and virtual bricks, and allow virtual bricks to be “grasped” by real hands. The major finding of the research is that the integration of these features makes AR instructions possible for small parts assembly, validated through a working AR prototype for constructing LEGO Arc de Triomphe and quantitative measures of the accuracies of registration and occlusions. In addition, a heuristic evaluation of BRICKxAR’s features has led to findings that the present method could advance AR instructions in terms of enhancing part visibility, match between mental models and visualization, alignment of physical and virtual parts in perspective views and spatial transformations, tangible user interface, consolidated structural diagrams, virtual cutaway views, among other benefits for guiding construction.

The sample had an average age of 56 years, was slightly more male (55%) than female (44%) or other (2%), mostly White (88%), well-educated (70% bachelors degree or more), and middle-income ($60,000–$75,000 annually). Measures included: COVID-19-related stress perceptions (e.g., concerns about infection, job, lack of necessities), presence of and search for meaning in life, forgiveness of situations, psychological distress, hopelessness, and optimism. A latent mental health variable was created that was comprised of psychological distress, hopelessness, and optimism. All hypothesized direct effects were in evidence, and all but one indirect effect were observed. Specifically, older age was related to better mental health through higher presence of meaning and lower search for meaning. Older age was also related to better mental health through a serial indirect pathway from lower COVID-19-related stress perceptions to higher presence of and lower search for meaning and higher forgiveness of situations to mental health. The proposed model was largely supported and confirms existing theory and research on aging, positive psychological processes, and mental health. Findings also offer new insights on the unique potential role of forgiveness of situations and its theoretical relevance to offending situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study offers a beginning for theorists, researchers, and practitioners to consider the connections between aging and mental health and the intricate interconnections between stress appraisal and positive coping resources that may serve to support it.","Toussaint, Loren; Cheadle, Alyssa; Dezutter, Jessie; Williams, David R.",Front Psychol,39,29

Recent global events including the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic means that human encounter with viruses is increased. Cancer development in individuals with viral infection can take many years after infection, demonstrating that the involvement of viruses in cancer development is a long and complex process. This complexity emanates from individual genetic heterogeneity and the many steps involved in cancer development owing to viruses. The process of tumorigenesis is driven by the complex interaction between several viral factors and host factors leading to the creation of a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is ideal and promotes tumor formation. Viruses associated with human cancers ensure their survival and proliferation through activation of several cellular processes including inflammation, migration, and invasion, resistance to apoptosis and growth suppressors. In addition, most human oncoviruses evade immune detection and can activate signaling cascades including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Notch and Wnt pathways associated with enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis. This expert review examines and synthesizes the multiple biological factors related to oncoviruses, and the signaling cascades activated by these viruses contributing to viral oncogenesis. In particular, I examine and review the Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomaviruses, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus in a context of cancer pathogenesis. I conclude with a future outlook on therapeutic targeting of the viruses and their associated oncogenic pathways within the TME.

Clinical research has found that probiotics have a beneficial effect on active ulcerative colitis, but to date, significant efficacy has rarely been found in the use of probiotics in the remission phase of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. More studies are needed to assess the utilization of probiotics in IBD remission. In this study, we assessed the administration of Bacillus subtilis in remission and its possible mechanism in mice with IBD. Oral administration of B. subtilis was implemented for 6 weeks (dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-P6w group), 2 weeks (DSS-P2w group) or 0 weeks (DSS-control(CT) group) in the remission phase in rodents with (DSS)-induced IBD. The body weight, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded, and colon H&E staining was performed. The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) mRNA and epithelium proliferation-related Ki67 was detected. Gut microbiota were tested by 16S rRNA sequencing. Administration of B. subtilis in remission effectively increased the body weight and colon length and decreased DAI in the DSS-P6w group compared with the DSS-CT group, but there is no significant difference between the DSS-P2w and DSS-CT groups. The epithelial integrity was improved, and the expression of ZO-1 and occludin increased due to administration of B. subtilis in remission, which was more evident in the DSS-P6w group. The expression of Ki67 increased in the DSS-CT group compared with that in the CT group. The administration of B. subtilis effectively down-regulated the expression of Ki67 in the DSS-P6w and DSS-P2w groups compared with the DSS-CT group. Furthermore, gut microbial structure was improved, with significantly decreased Escherichia/Shigella and Enterococcus, and increased Akkermansia and corresponding microbial function in the DSS-P6w group. Short-term administration of B. subtilis in the remission phase showed no significant improvement in mice with IBD. Long-term and continuous supplementation of B. subtilis in remission could effectively maintain the remission by protecting epithelial integrity, regulating proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, and improving gut microbiota and the corresponding microbial function.","Liu, Yongqiang; Yin, Fang; Huang, Linsheng; Teng, Hongfei; Shen, Tongyi; Qin, Huanlong",Food & function,39,29

Cell viability, cell colony number, cell proliferation, apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, flow cytometry and LDH release assays, respectively. The interaction between miR-665 and circMYBL2 or EGFR was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The protein expression levels were quantified by western blot or immunohistochemistry assay. Mice xenograft models were constructed to investigate the effect of circMYBL2 on CC tumor growth. CircMYBL2 was upregulated in CC tissues and cells, especially in PTX-resistant CC tissues and cells, and it was a stable circRNA mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. CircMYBL2 could enhance the PTX resistance of CC cells in vitro and promote CC tumor growth in vivo.

Oxygen therapy, nebulised medication and ventilatory support are treatments used in clinical practice to treat influenzal infection are thought to generate droplets or aerosols. OBJECTIVES Evaluation of the characteristics of droplet/aerosol dispersion around delivery systems during non-invasive ventilation (NIV), oxygen therapy, nebuliser treatment and chest physiotherapy by measuring droplet size, geographical distribution of droplets, decay in droplets over time after the interventions were discontinued. METHODS Three groups were studied: (1) normal controls, (2) subjects with coryzal symptoms and (3) adult patients with chronic lung disease who were admitted to hospital with an infective exacerbation. Each group received oxygen therapy, NIV using a vented mask system and a modified circuit with non-vented mask and exhalation filter, and nebulised saline. The patient group had a period of standardised chest physiotherapy treatment. Droplet counts in mean diameter size ranges from 0.3 to > 10 µm were measured with an counter placed adjacent to the face and at a 1-m distance from the subject/patient, at the height of the nose/mouth of an average health-care worker. RESULTS NIV using a vented mask produced droplets in the large size range (> 10 µm) in patients (p = 0.042) and coryzal subjects (p = 0.044) compared with baseline values, but not in normal controls (p = 0.379), but this increase in large droplets was not seen using the NIV circuit modification. Chest physiotherapy produced droplets predominantly of > 10 µm (p = 0.003), which, as with NIV droplet count in the patients, had fallen significantly by 1 m. Oxygen therapy did not increase droplet count in any size range. Nebulised saline delivered droplets in the small- and medium-size aerosol/droplet range, but did not increase large-size droplet count. CONCLUSIONS NIV and chest physiotherapy are droplet (not aerosol)-generating procedures, producing droplets of > 10 µm in size. Due to their large mass, most fall out on to local surfaces within 1 m. The only device producing an aerosol was the nebuliser and the output profile is consistent with nebuliser characteristics rather than dissemination of large droplets from patients. These findings suggest that health-care workers providing NIV and chest physiotherapy, working within 1 m of an infected patient should have a higher level of respiratory protection, but that infection control measures designed to limit aerosol spread may have less relevance for these procedures. These results may have infection control implications for other airborne infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and tuberculosis, as well as for pandemic influenza infection.","Simonds, A K; Hanak, A; Chatwin, M; Morrell, Mj; Hall, A; Parker, K H; Siggers, J H; Dickinson, R J",Health technology assessment,39,1

METHODS A total of 104 sepsis patients and 100 healthy controls (HCs) were consecutively enrolled, and miR-146b relative expression in their plasma samples was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In sepsis patients, disease severity was assessed using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. ARDS occurrence and 28-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS MiR-146b was decreased in sepsis patients compared to HCs. ARDS occurred in 30 (28.8%) sepsis patients, and miR-146b was reduced in ARDS sepsis patients compared to non-ARDS sepsis patients. Meanwhile, miR-146b distinguished ARDS sepsis patients from non-ARDS sepsis patients (area under the curve (AUC): 0.728, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.627-0.829). Subsequent multivariate logistic regression showed that miR-146b, age, smoke, respiratory infection, and serum creatinine predicted ARDS risk independently, and their combination well-discriminated ARDS sepsis patients from non-ARDS sepsis patients (AUC: 0.863, 95% CI: 0.792-0.934). Additionally, miR-146b was negatively correlated with serum creatinine, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, APACHE II score, and SOFA score, while positively correlated with albumin. Regarding prognosis, miR-146b was decreased in 28-day sepsis deaths compared to 28-day sepsis survivors, and it discriminated 28-day sepsis deaths from 28-day sepsis survivors (AUC: 0.785, 95% CI: 0.680-0.890).

It is almost always associated with cirrhosis and it is usually diagnosed in later stages of the disease. Furthermore, recurrence rate following liver transplantation ranges between 15 and 30%. The most important factor determining the recurrence is vascular invasion. METHODS In this review, the issue of microvascular invasion causing hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence is reviewed. Macroscopic vascular invasion is almost easy to diagnose on radiologic evaluation. However, microscopic vascular invasion is almost always diagnosed with pathologic evaluation. On the other hand, microscopic vascular invasion is associated with early recurrences and reduced disease-free survival. The type of vessel that is invaded determines the nature of the spread of the tumor cells. Invasion of the hepatic venous tributaries leads to systemic metastasis whereas portal venous invasions lead to intrahepatic spread of the tumor. Microscopic vascular invasion should be diagnosed before liver transplantation or liver resection in order to deliver the appropriate therapy to the patients. RESULTS Yet, there is no ideal marker to suggest microscopic vascular invasion before any intervention. Markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, des carboxy prothrombin, or gamma-glutamyl transferase have been found to be correlated with microscopic vascular invasion. These parameters are not very efficient to be used in routine clinical practice. CONCLUSION Therefore, further research is needed to define ideal marker associated with microscopic vascular invasion.","Isik, Burak; Gonultas, Fatih; Sahin, Tolga; Yilmaz, Sezai",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,39,28

METHODS Patients with a single treatment of a solitary, biopsy-proven renal tumour with intent to cure over a 14-year period were included (n = 203). Probability of residual disease over time, complication rates and all-cause mortality were assessed in relation to multiple variables. RESULTS Mean tumour size was 2.5 cm (range 1.0-6.0). Mean follow-up was 34.1 months (range 1-131). There was an increase in likelihood of residual disease for tumours ≥3.5 cm (P < 0.05), clear cell subtype of renal cell carcinoma (P ≤ 0.005) and maximum treatment temperature ≤70 °C (P < 0.05). There was a decrease in likelihood of residual disease for exophytic tumours (P = 0.01) and no difference based on age, gender, tumour location or type of radio freqency (RF) electrode used. Major complications occurred in 3.9 %. Median post-treatment survival was 7 years for patients with tumours <4 cm, and 5-year overall survival was 80 %. Probability of minor complication increased with tumour size (P = 0.03), as did all-cause mortality (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS CT-guided RFA is safe and effective for early-stage renal cancer, particularly for exophytic tumours measuring <3.5 cm. Overall 5-year survival with tumours <4 cm is comparable to partial nephrectomy. KEY POINTS • Prognostic indicators for success of CT-guided RFA of renal tumours are reported. • Tumour size ≥3.5 cm confers an increased risk for residual tumour. • Clear cell renal cell carcinoma subtype confers increased risk for residual tumour. • Tmax <70 °C within the ablation zone confers increased risk for residual tumour. • Exophytic tumours have a lower probability of residual disease.","Iannuccilli, Jason D; Dupuy, Damian E; Beland, Michael D; Machan, Jason T; Golijanin, Dragan J; Mayo-Smith, William W",European radiology,39,25

The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on ""COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020. RESULTS For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports. These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections. We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. People are currently using these drugs for malaria. It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.","Meo, S A; Klonoff, D C; Akram, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,39,12

METHODS Data were pooled from 2 prospective cohort studies, the OPTIC Registry (n = 3,635) and the AMISTAD Study (n = 618), and from the randomized PERFORM Trial (n = 19,120), all of which included patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA. Influenza vaccination status was determined in 23,110 patients. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death up to 2 years. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction and stroke separately. RESULTS Influenza vaccination had no association with the primary outcome in the propensity score-matched cohort (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.11; p = 0.67) or in the propensity score-adjusted cohort (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.12; p = 0.99). Similarly, the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction did not differ between the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group; in the matched cohort, the hazard ratio was 1.01 (95% CI 0.88-1.17; p = 0.89) for stroke and 0.84 (95% CI 0.59-1.18; p = 0.30) for myocardial infarction.

However, some women are not able to breastfeed, or choose not to. Few studies have examined the experiences of non-breastfeeding mothers, including their challenges, supports, and mental health sequelae. We sought to identify women's experiences with breastfeeding, specifically their reasons for not breastfeeding, challenges faced, and supports received, and the association between breastfeeding and postpartum mental health. Self-identified postpartum women (N = 70) completed a questionnaire investigating perinatal health. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and quantitative measures were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Qualitative analysis identified two main themes reflecting reasons for not breastfeeding (maternal factors and infant factors) and three primary challenges associated with not breastfeeding (emotional health, physical health, and perceived lack of support). Authors identified two main themes categorizing non-breastfeeding mothers' experiences with support (sources of support and type of support). A MANOVA revealed significantly greater levels of distress, anxiety, and depression, and lower levels of social support, among non-breastfeeding, relative to breastfeeding mothers. Findings reveal limitations in the availability of information and resources for non-breastfeeding mothers. It is possible that the pressure women may experience regarding breastfeeding may contribute to increased psychological distress for mothers who cannot or choose not to breastfeed. Based on our findings, future research and applied action should target the development and evaluation of informational resources and supports for non-breastfeeding women.","Penniston, Trinda; Reynolds, Kristin; Pierce, Shayna; Furer, Patricia; Lionberg, Carrie",Archives of women's mental health,39,1

We explored the use of one such measure, the Carolinas Comfort Scale(®) (CCS), to compare long-term outcomes for patients who received two different types of mesh. The CCS questionnaire asks about mesh sensation, pain and movement limitations, and combines the answers into a total score. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 684 patients were treated between January 2007 and August 2008 and were followed up in November 2009. RESULTS Data on 215 patients who met the inclusion criteria were available (96 patients who received Surgipro™ mesh and 119 who received Parietene™ Progrip™ mesh). Recurrence rates were similar in the Surgipro™ group (2/96, 2.1%) and Progrip™ group (3/118, 2.5%) (Fisher's exact test = 1.0). Chronic pain occurred less frequently in the Surgipro™ group (11/95, 11.6%) than in the Progrip™ group (22/118, 18.6%) (p<0.157). Overall, 90% of CCS total scores indicated a good outcome (scores of 10 or less out of 115). A principal component analysis of the CCS found that responses clustered into two subscales: 'mesh sensation' and 'pain+movement limitations'. The Progrip™ group had a slightly higher mesh sensation score (p<0.051) and similar pain+movement limitations scores (p<0.120). CONCLUSIONS In this study of quality of life outcomes related to different mesh types, the CCS subscales were more sensitive to differences in outcome than the total CCS score for the whole questionnaire. Future research should consider using the CCS subscales rather than the CCS total score.","Zaborszky, Andras; Gyanti, Rita; Barry, John A; Saxby, Brian K; Bhattacharya, Panchanan; Hasan, Fazal A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,39,1

To date, biallelic missense variants in ZNF526 gene, encoding a Krüppel-type zinc-finger protein, have been reported in three families with non-syndromic intellectual disability. METHODS Here, we describe five individuals from four unrelated families with an undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in which we performed exome sequencing, on a combination of trio-based (4 subjects) or single probands (1 subject). RESULTS We identified five patients from four unrelated families with homozygous ZNF526 variants by whole exome sequencing. Four had variants resulting in truncation of ZNF526; they were affected by severe prenatal and postnatal microcephaly (ranging from -4 SD to -8 SD), profound psychomotor delay, hypertonic-dystonic movements, epilepsy and simplified gyral pattern on MRI. All of them also displayed bilateral progressive cataracts. A fifth patient had a homozygous missense variant and a slightly less severe disorder, with postnatal microcephaly (-2 SD), progressive bilateral cataracts, severe intellectual disability and unremarkable brain MRI.Mutant znf526 zebrafish larvae had notable malformations of the eye and central nervous system, resembling findings seen in the human holoprosencephaly spectrum.

METHODS This prospective multicentre study included consecutive patients with clinically possible CVT. On admission, patients underwent clinical examination, blood-sampling for D-dimers-measuring (ELISA-test), and MR-/CT-venography. Predictive value of clinical variables and D-dimers for CVT were calculated. A clinical score to stratify patients into groups with low, moderate, or high CVT risk was established using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS CVT was confirmed in 25.8% (94/359) patients by neuroimaging. The optimal estimate of clinical probability was based on 6 variables: seizure(s) at presentation (4 points), known thrombophilia (4 points), oral contraception (2 points), duration of symptoms >6 days (2 points), worst headache ever (1 point) and focal neurological deficit at presentation (1 point) (AUC 0.889).We defined 0-2 points as low CVT probability (NPV 94.1%). 186 (51.8%) patients had a low probability score, of whom 11 (5.9%) had CVT. The frequency of CVT was 28.3% (34/120) in patients with a moderate (3-5 points) and 92.5% (49/53) in patients with a high (6-12 points) probability score. All low CVT probability patients with CVT had D-dimers >500µg/L. Predictive value of D-dimers for CVT for ≥675µg/l (best cut-off) vs. ≥500µg/l respectively was: Sens:77.7%/Spec:77%/NPV:90.7%/ACC:77.2% vs. Sens:89.4%/Spec:66.4%/NPV:94.6%/ACC:72.4%. To the clinical score added D-dimers >500µg/L resulted in the best CVT prediction score explored (at the cut-off≥6 points: Sens:83%/Spec:86.8%/NPV:93.5%/ACC:84.4%/AUC:0.937). CONCLUSION The proposed new clinical score in combination with D-dimers may be helpful for prediction of CVT as a pretest score;none of the CVT patients showed low clinical probability for CVT and D-dimers <500µg/L.","Heldner, Mirjam R; Zuurbier, Susanna M; Li, Bojun; Von Martial, Rascha; Meijers, Joost C M; Zimmermann, Rebekka; Volbers, Bastian; Jung, Simon; El-Koussy, Marwan; Fischer, Urs; Kohler, Hans P; Schroeder, Verena; Coutinho, Jonathan M; Arnold, Marcel",Neurology,39,22

Building on existing literature that theorizes the interrelationships of public health and national security, global surveillance, and transnational hegemony, the postcolonial theoretical standpoint interrogates how such meanings are constructed within PEPFAR. A postcolonial deconstruction of the 2009 PEPFAR report to the Congress revealed three meanings of HIV/AIDS that were discursively constructed in such policy documents: (a) the ""Third World"" as a site of intervention, (b) U.S. altruism as ""lifting"" the burden of the soul, and (c) AIDS, economics, and security.

A 5-mm margin is optimal but not always achievable in the oropharynx. We aimed to identify a consensus of definition and management of close margins for human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer without other risk factors. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive survey METHODS: A survey of the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) was conducted to evaluate the abovementioned objectives by presenting hypothetical scenarios and asking questions regarding management. RESULTS One-hundred fifty-five AHNS members completed the survey (18% response rate). Close margins were defined as <5 mm, <3 mm, and <1 mm by 27.7%, 32.3%, and 32.3% of respondents. There was no significant difference in margin determination with experience level (P = .186). In an HPV-positive tumor with close margins, 51% chose postoperative observation. The remainder chose adjuvant radiation (22.6%), chemoradiation (1.9%), or re-excision of the wound bed (19.4%).

In fact, postoperative hemorrhage may result in airway compression and respiratory distress, and therefore, effective hemostasis is an important goal in thyroid surgery. Postoperative hematoma occurs at a rate of approximately 0.1% to 1.1%. Almost all cases occur in the first 6 h after surgery and can be the result of several surgeon or patient factors. For many years the clamp-and-tie technique has been the most common way to divide the main vascular pedicles of the thyroid gland. Alternatively, bipolar electrocautery has been used for only very small vessels. Other hemostatic systems have been introduced and proved to be potentially very useful in neck surgery and, in particular, for thyroid surgery. This new class of instruments is generally known as ""energy devices"" because they use different forms of energy, such as advanced bipolar (LigaSureTM Small Jaw Medtronic, Covidien product, Mineapolis, MN, USA) and ultrasound (Harmonic Focus; Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, Cincinnati, OH, USA), and hybrid devices that join these two technologies (Thunderbeat by Olympus, Japan). Although they all generate a significant elevation of temperature in the tissues, as in any form of energy, the temperatures reached by these instruments are never as high as the standard monopolar electrocautery. For small bleeding very close to critical structures, where energy devices are too dangerous to be used and clamp and tie is not possible, several studies have assessed the use of adjunctive hemostatic agents. In conclusion, all energy devices have been shown to significantly decrease operative times without increasing costs or complications. Adjunctive hemostatic agents have shown equivalent differences when added to standard methods from a clinically significant perspective.","Materazzi, Gabriele; Ambrosini, Carlo Enrico; Fregoli, Lorenzo; De Napoli, Luigi; Frustaci, Gianluca; Matteucci, Valeria; Papini, Piermarco; Bakkar, Sohail; Miccoli, Paolo",Gland surgery,39,29

In the past few years, new telecommunication-based practices, including various forms of e-rehabilitation have gained attention all over the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Telerehabilitation is an alternative way of delivering rehabilitation services in which information and communication technologies are used to expedite communication between the health care professional and the patient at a distant location. It can be beneficial to people in rural areas, especially individuals in isolated communities. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced speedy adoption of telerehabilitation due to restricted traditional in-person visits all over the world, including KSA; however, no telerehabilitation guidelines are available in the country. Since specialized rehabilitation services are limited to main cities of the country, the provision of care by reaching out the underserved areas using telemedicine technology is deemed important. These guidelines were established collaboratively by panel of various rehabilitation experts with input from other practitioners in the field and strategic stakeholders. It will facilitate rehabilitation clinicians practicing in KSA providing consultation, counseling, education, assessment, monitoring, therapy, or follow-up to a patient remotely using telemedicine communication technologies. This document includes administrative, clinical, and technical guidelines, which are aimed to standardize telerehabilitation practice across the country.

Because the remnant stomach and the pancreas share an arterial blood supply, it is often unclear whether the remnant stomach can be safely preserved when performing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) post gastrectomy. We herein report two cases in which the remnant stomach was safely preserved using near-infrared spectroscopy to assess the regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) in the remnant stomach during operation. PRESENTATION OF CASE The first patient, a 68-year-old man, was diagnosed with cancer of the pancreatic head and underwent PD a year after proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The remnant stomach was safely preserved by evaluation of the rSO2 before and after reconstruction of the arteries. The second patient, an 82-year-old woman with a history of distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer 40 years previously, was diagnosed with a main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreatic body, requiring DP. As in the previous case, we could safely preserve the remnant stomach through assessing the intraoperative rSO2 of the remnant stomach. DISCUSSION Through comparing changes in the rSO2 during surgery, near-infrared spectroscopy provides objective and quantitative assessments of intestinal viability to predict ischemic complications. CONCLUSION This method may be a viable option to evaluate the blood supply to the alimentary tract.","Akabane, Shintaro; Ohira, Masahiro; Ishiyama, Kohei; Kobayashi, Tsuyoshi; Ide, Kentaro; Tahara, Hiroyuki; Kuroda, Shintaro; Tanimine, Naoki; Shimizu, Seiichi; Tanabe, Kazuaki; Ohdan, Hideki",International journal of surgery case reports,39,19

Viruses have developed diverse strategies to subvert host defense mechanisms and increase their survival. In the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as a model, we previously reported that accessory gene 7 counteracts the host antiviral response by associating with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c). In the present work, the effect of the absence of gene 7 on the host cell, during infection, was further analyzed by transcriptomic analysis. The pattern of gene expression of cells infected with a recombinant mutant TGEV, lacking gene 7 expression (rTGEV-Δ7), was compared to that of cells infected with the parental virus (rTGEV-wt). Genes involved in the immune response, the interferon response, and inflammation were upregulated during TGEV infection in the absence of gene 7. An exacerbated innate immune response during infection with rTGEV-Δ7 virus was observed both in vitro and in vivo. An increase in macrophage recruitment and activation in lung tissues infected with rTGEV-Δ7 virus was observed compared to cells infected with the parental virus. In summary, the absence of protein 7 both in vitro and in vivo led to increased proinflammatory responses and acute tissue damage after infection. In a porcine animal model, which is immunologically similar to humans, we present a novel example of how viral proteins counteract host antiviral pathways to determine the infection outcome and pathogenesis.","Cruz, Jazmina L G; Becares, Martina; Sola, Isabel; Oliveros, Juan Carlos; Enjuanes, Luis; Zúñiga, Sonia",Journal of virology,39,5

However, the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY We focus on the effect of TXL on blood-brain barrier (BBB) including edema formation and tight junction (TJ) protein rearrangement, and inflammatory response after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We further explore the protective mechanism of TXL on ischemia-induced BBB damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult CD1 male mice (n=168) were randomly divided into TXL pre-treatment group, TXL pre-post treatment group, TXL post-treatment group, control group and sham group. Mice in TXL pre-treatment group were given TXL solution by 1g/kg/day orally for 7 days before tMCAO. Mice in pre-post treatment group were continuously given TXL 7 days before and 14 days after tMCAO. Mice in TXL post-treatment group were given TXL solution immediately after tMCAO. Rotarod test and neurological severity scores were evaluated at 1-14 days following tMCAO. Brains were harvested for examining infarct volume, edema formation, and immunofluorescent staining at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO. Cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA expression, and BBB permeability were further examined by RT-PCR and immunostaining. RESULTS TXL pre-post treatment improved neurobehavioral outcomes and reduced infarct volume compared to the control (p<0.05). Meanwhile, hemispheric swelling, Evans blue and IgG protein extravasation reduced, while TJ protein expression up-regulated in pre-post treatment group (p<0.05). Further study indicated that infarct volume was smaller and BBB damage was less severe in TXL pre-post treatment group compared to TXL pre-treatment alone. It was noted that fewer myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells and less cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α expression in pre-post treatment group compared to the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS TXL pre-treatment and pre-post treatment effectively protected the brain from BBB disruption via alleviating inflammatory response. Moreover, pre-post treatment has better outcomes, suggesting that continuous administration of TXL before and throughout ischemia period is necessary because of multiple functions of TXL.","Liu, Ye; Tang, Guang Hui; Sun, Yu Hao; Lin, Xiao Jie; Wei, Cong; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Liu, Jian Rong",Journal of ethnopharmacology,39,1

Using 15N-NH2Cl as an isotope tracer, we found that 15N-TCNM accounted for 70.7-76.5% of total TCNM during UV/NH2Cl treated 2 natural waters, which was significantly higher than the proportion of 15N-TCNM in chloramination (NH2Cl alone). This is a direct evidence that NH2Cl, rather than the nitrogenous matters in waters, was the predominant nitrogen source of TCNM during UV/NH2Cl treatment. Phenol derivatives with meta-substituents and with electron-withdrawing groups facilitated the formation of TCNM precursors during UV/NH2Cl treatment. Significant correlations were found between Hammett constants (σ) of substituents and TCNM formation potentials. The formation mechanisms of TCNM were revealed using resorcinol as a representative phenolic compound. During UV/NH2Cl treatment, HO•, reactive chlorine species and reactive nitrogen species contributed to 28.1%, 29.0% and 19.4% of resorcinol degradation. Five nitro(so)-intermediates were identified as the main TCNM precursors. The formation pathways of TCNM were proposed. Alkaline pH was recommended to reduce the formation of TCNM precursors during UV/NH2Cl treatment.","Zhang, Xinran; Zhai, Jiaxin; Lei, Yu; Huang, Huang; Ren, Pengfei; Lambropoulou, Dimitra; Yang, Xin",Journal of hazardous materials,39,33

This study compares tissue integration and inflammatory response in abdominal wall repair with composites with different absorbable synthetic barriers. METHODS Full-thickness defects created in the abdominal wall of rabbits were repaired using polypropylene prosthesis or the following composites: Physiomesh™ (Phy); Ventralight™ (Vent) and ""new composite mesh"" (Ncm) not yet used clinically in humans. The collected seroma was evaluated for IFN-γ/IL-4 by ELISA. Tissue integration, anti- (IL-13/TGFβ-1/IL-10/IL-4) and pro-inflammatory (TNF-α/IL-6/IFN-γ/VEGF) cytokine mRNA expression and TGFβ/VEGF immunolabeling were evaluated at 14 and 90 days post-implant. RESULTS Seroma was observed in 10 of 12 Phy/Vent and 4 of 12 Ncm. Wound fluid IFN-γ showed a time-dependent significant increase in Vent and tendency to decrease in Ncm, while all composites exhibited IL-4 upward trend. Prostheses were fully infiltrated by an organized connective tissue at end time although the area had shown prior seroma. A stable mesothelium was developed, except in adhesion areas. Vent/Phy displayed a significant increase in TNF-α/IFN-γ-mRNA over time. Significant decrease in VEGF mRNA was observed in Phy/Ncm, while a significant increase of TGFβ-1 mRNA was evident in all composites over time. Ncm exhibited the highest TGFβ protein expression area at short term and the greatest percentage of VEGF positive vessels at end time. CONCLUSION Ncm could be an appropriate candidate to improve clinical outcome showing the lower development of seroma and optimal tissue integration with minimal pro-inflammatory cytokine response over time and consistent pro-wound healing cytokine expression.","Pascual, G; Sotomayor, S; Rodríguez, M; Bayon, Y; Bellón, J M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,39,17

However, the contribution of antibodies to protection and to the course of the disease during first-time exposure to a pathogen is unknown. We analyzed the antibodies and B cell responses in severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Despite our primary assumption that high antibody titers contribute to a mild disease, we found that severe COVID-19 illness, and not mild infection, correlates with strong anti-viral antibody and memory B cell responses. This phenomenon was also demonstrated for anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibiting antibodies that we recently isolated from an actively infected Tuberculosis-sick donor. This correlation between disease severity and antibody responses can be explained by the fact that high viral loads drive B cell stimulation and generation of high-affinity antibodies that will be protective upon future encounter with the particular pathogen.","Freund, Natalia T",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,39,16

These roles include: (i) driving atheroprogression in the clinically stable phase of disease; (ii) inciting atheroma destabilization and precipitating acute coronary syndromes (ACS); and (iii) responding to cardiomyocyte necrosis in myocardial infarction (MI). Despite an evolving understanding of these biologic processes, successful clinical translation into effective therapies has proven challenging. Realizing the promise of targeting inflammation in the prevention and treatment of ASCVD will likely require more individualized approaches, as the degree of inflammation differs among cardiovascular patients. A large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) as a clinical measure of inflammation. Appreciating the mechanistic diversity of ACS triggers and the kinetics of hsCRP in MI may resolve purported inconsistencies from prior observational studies. Future clinical trial designs incorporating hsCRP may hold promise to enable individualized approaches. The aim of this Clinical Review is to summarize the current understanding of how inflammation contributes to ASCVD progression, destabilization, and adverse clinical outcomes. We offer forward-looking perspective on what next steps may enable successful clinical translation into effective therapeutic approaches-enabling targeting the right patients with the right therapy at the right time-on the road to more individualized ASCVD care.","Lawler, Patrick R; Bhatt, Deepak L; Godoy, Lucas C; Lüscher, Thomas F; Bonow, Robert O; Verma, Subodh; Ridker, Paul M",European heart journal,39,19

THE PURPOSE The routine screening-based multiyear retrospective observational study of prevalence and circulation patterns of epidemic-prone human coronaviruses in Moscow. MATERIAL AND METHODS The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect RNA of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in nasal and throat swabs from 16,511 patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI), aged 1 month to 95 years (children accounted for 58.3%) from January 2016 to March 2020, and swabs from 505 relatively healthy children in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Results. HCoVs were yearly found in 2.6-6.1% of the examined patients; the detection frequency was statistically higher in adults than in children, regardless of sex. At the height of the disease incidence in December 2019, HCoVs were detected in 13.7% of the examined, demonstrating a two-fold increase as compared to the multi-year average for that month. The statistical frequency of HCoV detection in ARI pediatric patients under 6 years was significantly higher than in their healthy peers (3.7 vs 0.7%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION HCoVs circulate annually, demonstrating a winter-spring seasonal activity pattern in the Moscow Region and reaching peak levels in December. Over the years of observation, the HCoV epidemic activity reached maximum levels in December 2019-February 2020 and decreased in March to the multi-year average. Amid a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 cases imported to Moscow in March 2020, the HCoV detection frequency dropped sharply, which can be explained by the competition between different coronaviruses and by the specificity of HCoV detection with the diagnostic test kit used in this study.","Yatsyshina, S B; Mamoshina, M V; Shipulina, O Yu; Podkolzin, A T; Akimkin, V G",Voprosy virusologii,39,19

METHODS This prospective study was carried out in 3 university hospitals in Finland during 2 consecutive winter seasons. We enrolled consecutive children <2 years of age hospitalized with an attending physician's diagnosis of bronchiolitis. All enrolled children were included in the primary analysis. A parallel analysis was also conducted using a stricter definition for bronchiolitis (age <12 months and no history of wheeze). Polymerase chain reaction was used to test the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples for multiple respiratory pathogens. RESULTS The median age of the 408 children was 8 months, 73% had no history of wheeze and their median hospital LOS was 2 days. 144 (35%) children had RSV only and 92 (23%) children rhinovirus only infections. Children with rhinovirus only had shorter duration of prehospital symptoms, higher disease severity score at entry and more often a history of wheezing (all P ≤ 0.001). Controlling for 7 demographic and clinical characteristics, those with rhinovirus only had shorter hospital LOS when compared with children with RSV only (adjusted odds ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.22-0.92; P = 0.03).

We reviewed our experience with management and treatment of ZD and sought to determine what type of treatment is most effective and efficient. We selected patients who underwent treatment for ZD between January 2004 and January 2014 at our tertiary referral center. All procedures were performed by ENT surgeons. The medical records were reviewed for pre- and intraoperative characteristics and follow-up. Of our 94 patients (58 male, 36 female), 75 underwent endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy (42 stapler, 33 laser) and 6 received treatment via transcervical approach. 13 interventions were aborted. Mean operating time was 49.0 min for stapler, 68.3 for laser and 124.0 for the transcervical approach. Its respective median post-operative admission durations were 2.0, 3.0 and 3.0 days. After the first treatment, of the 75 endoscopic procedures, 45 patients (23 stapler, 22 laser) had complete symptom resolution. In the transcervical group 4 (67 %) patients were symptom free and one patient died of complications. In the endoscopically treated patients, ten complications occurred, of which 8 G1 and 2 G2 (Clavien Dindo classification). In the transcervical group 2 complications occurred, 1 G3b and 1 G5. Both endoscopic techniques provide efficient management of Zenker's diverticulum with the stapler-assisted modality providing a shorter surgery duration and hospital admission. Although there is no significant difference in terms of complications or recurrence rates for both endoscopic techniques, it seems that stapler patients are at higher risk of having a re-intervention and of having more severe complications.","Visser, L J; Hardillo, J A U; Monserez, D A; Wieringa, M H; Baatenburg de Jong, R J",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,39,1

The analytical sample comprises 886 adolescents aged 10-16 years surveyed both before and during the pandemic. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure adolescents' mental health. RESULTS The results from person fixed-effects regression models show that adolescents with better-than-median mental health before the pandemic have experienced an increase in their emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer relationship problems, but a decrease in their prosocial tendency during the pandemic. In contrast, adolescents with worse-than-median mental health before the pandemic have experienced opposite changes in each Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire domain. Further results from lagged dependent variable regression models show that compared with girls, boys have experienced a smaller increase in emotional problems but a greater decrease in prosocial tendency. The negative mental health impact is particularly prominent among adolescents in one-parent, one-child, and low-income households. Adult household members' COVID-19 symptoms and illness have undermined adolescents' peer relationships. CONCLUSIONS The results reveal the pandemic's diverse impacts on adolescent mental health, which vary with adolescents' prepandemic mental health and sociodemographic backgrounds. The findings underline the need for tailored mental health support for adolescents and targeted measures to mitigate inequalities in the mental health impact of the pandemic.","Hu, Yang; Qian, Yue",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,39,28

Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is a common premalignant lesion of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, although the risk of developing cancer in BE remains low. Therefore, screening is not recommended in the general population. Surveillance of BE is recommended to detect high grade dysplasia or carcinoma in an early stage, although there is no clear evidence that surveillance leads to a reduced mortality. This review discusses the several screening and surveillance techniques, including chromoendoscopy, narrow band imaging, autofluorescence imaging and confocal laser endomicroscopy, pointing out the areas that are well established as well as the new techniques that require more research.","Maes, Sielte; Sharma, Prateek; Bisschops, Raf",Best practice & research.

Since this kind of surgery mainly uses intraoral incisions, the narrow surgical field of intraoral incisions and the surrounding important neurovascular tissues make it easy for complications, to occur during the osteotomy process, which results in greater surgical risks. The first craniofacial-plastic surgical robot (CPSR-I) system is developed to complete the precise positioning and improve the surgeon's force perception ability. The Kalman filtering method is adopted to reduce the interference of sensor signal noise. An adaptive fuzzy control system, which has strong robustness and adaptability to the environment, is designed to improve the stability of robot-assisted surgical operations. To solve the problem of the depth perception, we propose an automatic bone drilling control strategy that combines position and force conditions to ensure that the robot can automatically stop when the bone is penetrated. On the basis of model surgery and animal experiments, preliminary experiments were carried out clinically. Based on the early results of 6 patients, the robot-assisted approach appears to be a safe and effective strategy for genioplasty.","Lin, Li; Xu, Cheng; Shi, Yunyong; Zhou, Chaozheng; Zhu, Ming; Chai, Gang; Xie, Le",Scientific reports,39,27

Therefore, these proteins and NAs can be applied as ""drugs"" to regulate the biofunctions from abnormal to normal. Either for proteins and NAs, the most challenging thing is to avoid the biodegradation or physicochemical degradation before they reach the targeted location, and then functions as complete functional structures. Hence, appropriate delivery systems are very important which can protect them from these degradations. Cyclodextrins (CDs) based delivery systems achieved mega successes due to their outstanding pharmaceutical properties and there have been several reviews on CDs based small molecule drug delivery systems recently. But for biomolecules, which are getting more and more important for modern therapies, however, there are very few reviews to systematically summarize and analyze the CDs-based macro biomolecules delivery systems, especially for proteins. In this review, there were some of the notable examples were summarized for the macro biomolecules (proteins and NAs) delivery based on CDs. For proteins, this review included insulin, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin (BSA), green fluorescent protein (GFP) and IgG's, etc. deliveries in slow release, stimulating responsive release or targeting release manners.

To summarize the state of the art for clinicians and researchers. METHODS We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with a control group (usual care or enhanced usual care) conducted in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries and published until 2016. RESULTS Thirty-one interventions were identified, the majority of which were conducted in the United States in patients with breast cancer. Most interventions aimed to decrease social inequalities based on ethnicity/race and/or socioeconomic level, with fewer interventions targeting inequalities based on geographical area. The most frequently assessed outcomes were quality of life (n = 20) and psychosocial factors (n = 20), followed by treatment adherence or satisfaction (n = 12,), knowledge (n = 11), pain management (n = 10), and lifestyle habits (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS The impact of interventions designed to improve cancer treatment and follow-up care in socially disadvantages groups is multifactorial. Multicomponent-intervention approaches and cultural adaptations are common, and their effectiveness should be evaluated in the populations of interest. More interventions are needed from outside the Unite States and in patients with cancers other than breast cancer, targeting gender or geographical inequalities and addressing key outcomes such as treatment adherence or symptom management.","Ruiz-Pérez, Isabel; Rodríguez-Gómez, Marina; Pastor-Moreno, Guadalupe; Escribá-Agüir, Vicenta; Petrova, Dafina",Psycho-oncology,39,19

OBJECTIVE To determine whether incisionless otoplasty is a reliable and replicable technique in correcting prominauris. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study consisted of a retrospective electronic medical record review for 72 patients undergoing incisionless otoplasty for the correction of prominauris by a single surgeon from November 2006 to April 2013. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 87 months. The patients were operated on at both St Joseph's Health Centre (a community hospital) and The Cumberland Clinic (private practice) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All patients undergoing an incisionless otoplasty for the correction of prominauris were eligible. Participants' ages ranged from 3 to 55 years, with the majority being adults. Seventy patients were followed up for outcomes. INTERVENTIONS Incisionless otoplasty. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number and type of sutures used, perioperative complications, and postoperative follow-up including complications and revisions. Complications included infection, hematoma, bleeding, perichondritis, suture granuloma, suture exposure, and suture failure. RESULTS A mean (SD) 2.5 (0.8) sutures were used in the left ear, 2.48 (0.75) in the right ear, and 4.69 (1.75) in total. The number of sutures used in the left vs right ear was not significantly different (P = .60). All patients had horizontal mattress sutures placed for correction of prominauris. There were no serious perioperative complications such as infection, bleeding, hematoma, perichondritis, or cartilage necrosis. Follow-up data were extracted and analyzed in 70 patients, with a mean follow-up time of 31 months. Complications were seen in 10 patients (14%): 4 were due to suture failure, 3 were due to suture exposure, 2 were due to granuloma formation, and 1 was due to a Polysporin (bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate) reaction. Nine patients (13%) needed a revision to achieve a desirable result. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The technique of incisionless otoplasty used in this study was well tolerated and effective in both pediatric and adult patients, producing favorable outcomes with minimal complications. This procedure is less invasive than its open counterpart and seems at least equally effective in longevity.","Mehta, Shaun; Gantous, Andres",JAMA facial plastic surgery,39,7

Btk inhibition has shown impressive clinical efficacy in various B cell malignancies. However, it remains unknown whether inhibition additionally induces changes in BCR signaling due to feedback mechanisms, a phenomenon referred to as BCR rewiring. In this report, we studied the impact of Btk activity on major components of the BCR signaling pathway in mice. As expected, NF-κB and Akt/S6 signaling was decreased in Btk-deficient B cells. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of several proximal signaling molecules including CD79a, Syk and PI3K, as well as the key Btk-effector PLCγ2 and the more downstream kinase Erk were significantly increased. This pattern of BCR rewiring was essentially opposite in B cells from transgenic mice overexpressing Btk. Importantly, prolonged Btk inhibitor treatment of wild-type mice or mice engrafted with leukemic B cells also resulted in increased phosho-CD79a and phospho-PLCγ2 in B cells. Our findings show that Btk enzymatic function determines phosphorylation of proximal and distal BCR signaling molecules in B cells. We conclude that Btk inhibitor treatment results in rewiring of BCR signaling, which may affect both malignant and healthy B cells. This article is protected by copyright.

Anecdotal reports suggest that guidelines may disproportionately allocate resources away from patients with cancer, but no comprehensive evaluation has been performed. Objective To examine the implications of US state CSC guidelines for patients with cancer, including allocation methods, cancer-related categorical exclusions and deprioritizations, and provisions for blood products and palliative care. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional population-based analysis examined state-endorsed CSC guidelines published before May 20, 2020, that included health care resource allocation recommendations. Main Outcomes and Measures Guideline publication before or within 120 days after the first documented US case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), inclusion of cancer-related categorical exclusions and/or deprioritizations, provisions for blood products and/or palliative care, and associations between these outcomes and state-based cancer demographics. Results Thirty-one states had health care resource allocation guidelines that met inclusion criteria, of which 17 had been published or updated since the first US case of COVID-19. States whose available hospital bed capacity was predicted to exceed 100% at 6 months (χ2 = 3.82; P = .05) or that had a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC; χ2 = 6.21; P = .01) were more likely to have publicly available guidelines. The most frequent primary methods of prioritization were the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (27 states [87%]) and deprioritizing persons with worse long-term prognoses (22 states [71%]). Seventeen states' (55%) allocation methods included cancer-related deprioritizations, and 8 states (26%) included cancer-related categorical exclusions. The presence of an in-state CCC was associated with lower likelihood of cancer-related categorical exclusions (multivariable odds ratio, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.004-0.87]). Guidelines with disability rights statements were associated with specific provisions to allocate blood products (multivariable odds ratio, 7.44 [95% CI, 1.28-43.24). Both the presence of an in-state CCC and having an oncologist and/or palliative care specialist on the state CSC task force were associated with the inclusion of palliative care provisions. Conclusions and Relevance Among states with CSC guidelines, most deprioritized some patients with cancer during resource allocation, and one-fourth categorically excluded them. The presence of an in-state CCC was associated with guideline availability, palliative care provisions, and lower odds of cancer-related exclusions. These data suggest that equitable state-level CSC considerations for patients with cancer benefit from the input of oncology stakeholders.","Hantel, Andrew; Marron, Jonathan M; Casey, Michael; Kurtz, Sharyn; Magnavita, Emily; Abel, Gregory A",JAMA oncology,39,16

In this observational study, the NIRS index regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) was measured noninvasively before, during, and after endovascular therapy via bilateral forehead NIRS optodes. During the study period, 63 patients were monitored with NIRS; 43 qualified for analysis. Before recanalization, 10 distinct rSO2 decreases occurred in 11 patients with respect to time to intubation. During recanalization, two kinds of unilateral rSO2 changes occurred in the affected hemisphere: small peaks throughout the treatment (n=14, 32.6%) and sustained increases immediately after recanalization (n=2, 4.7%). Lower area under the curve 10% below baseline was associated with better reperfusion status (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥ 2b, P=0.009). At the end of the intervention, lower interhemispheric rSO2 difference predicted death within 90 days (P=0.037). After the intervention, higher rSO2 variability predicted poor outcome (modified Rankin scale > 3, P=0.032). Our findings suggest that bi-channel rSO2-NIRS has potential for guiding neuroanesthesia and predicting outcome.

ANIMALS 40 feedlot calves. PROCEDURES Calves were fed diets containing high (3,300 U/kg) or low (1,100 U/kg) amounts of vitamin A beginning on the day of arrival at a feedlot (day 0) and continuing daily until the end of the study (day 140). Serum retinol concentrations were evaluated in blood samples obtained throughout the study. Calves were inoculated IM with an inactivated BCoV vaccine on days 112 and 126. Blood samples obtained on days 112 and 140 were used for assessment of BCoV-specific serum IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA titers via an ELISA. RESULTS The low vitamin A diet reduced serum retinol concentrations between days 112 and 140. After the BCoV inoculation and booster injections, predominantly serum IgG1 antibodies were induced in calves fed the high vitamin A diet; however, IgG1 titers were compromised at day 140 in calves fed the low vitamin A diet. Other isotype antibodies specific for BCoV were not affected by the low vitamin A diet. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dietary vitamin A restriction increases marbling in feedlot cattle; however, its effect on antibody responses to vaccines is unknown. A low vitamin A diet compromised the serum IgG1 responses against inactivated BCoV vaccine, which suggested suppressed T-helper 2-associated antibody (IgG1) responses. Thus, low vitamin A diets may compromise the effectiveness of viral vaccines and render calves more susceptible to infectious disease.","Jee, Junbae; Hoet, Armando E; Azevedo, Marli P; Vlasova, Anastasia N; Loerch, Steve C; Pickworth, Carrie L; Hanson, Juliette; Saif, Linda J",American journal of veterinary research,39,33

Our objective is to determine the efficacy of fall-risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) withdrawal on the prevention of falls and fall-related complications. METHODS/DESIGN We will search for all published and unpublished randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of FRID withdrawal compared to usual care on the rate of falls, incidence of falls, fall-related injuries, fall-related fractures, fall-related hospitalizations, or adverse effects related to the intervention in adults aged 65 years or older. Electronic database searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL. A grey literature search will be conducted including clinical trial registries and conference proceedings and abstracts. Two reviewers will independently perform in duplicate citation screening, full-text review, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. Conflicts will be resolved through team discussion or by a third reviewer if no consensus can be reached. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will be used to independently rate overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome. Results will be synthesized descriptively, and a random effects meta-analysis will be conducted for each outcome if studies are deemed similar methodologically, clinically, and statistically. DISCUSSION We will attempt to determine whether a FRID withdrawal strategy alone is effective at preventing falls in older adults. Our results will be used to optimize and focus fall prevention strategies and initiatives internationally with a goal of improving the health of older adults.

As farm, performance, and companion animals, horses are a unique species from a zoonotic disease risk perspective, and the risks of subclinical infections spreading among horses can pose challenges. Using a nanoscale real-time PCR platform, we investigated the prevalence of 14 enteric pathogens, 11 Escherichia coli genes, and 9 respiratory pathogens in fecal samples from 97 apparently healthy horses at a multi-day horse event. In addition, sugar flotation test was performed for fecal parasites. E. coli f17 was commonly detected, prevalent in 59% of horses, followed closely by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (55%). Additional pathogens recognized included betacoronavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Cryptosporidium sp., E. coli O157, equine adenovirus 1, equine rhinitis B virus, and others. The use of PCR data may overestimate the true prevalence of these pathogens but provides a sensitive overview of common pathogens present in healthy horses. Our results prompt the continued need for practical biosecurity measures at horse shows, both to protect individuals interacting with these horses and to minimize transmission among horses.","Stout, Alison E; Hofmar-Glennon, Hayley G; André, Nicole M; Goodman, Laura B; Anderson, Renee R; Mitchell, Patrick K; Thompson, Belinda S; Lejeune, Manigandan; Whittaker, Gary R; Goodrich, Erin L","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",39,13

In recent years, numerous observations have been reported and various methods of measurement have been employed. The present paper introduces a novel wearable sensor in intelligent clothing for human body temperature measurement. The objective is the integration of optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based sensors into functional textiles to extend the capabilities of wearable solutions for body temperature monitoring. In addition, the temperature sensitivity is 150 pm/°C, which is almost 15 times higher than that of a bare FBG. This study combines large and small pipes during fabrication to implant FBG sensors into the fabric. The law of energy conservation of the human body is considered in determining heat transfer between the body and its clothing. The mathematical model of heat transmission between the body and clothed FBG sensors is studied, and the steady-state thermal analysis is presented. The simulation results show the capability of the material to correct the actual body temperature. Based on the skin temperature obtained by the weighted average method, this paper presents the five points weighted coefficients model using both sides of the chest, armpits, and the upper back for the intelligent clothing. The weighted coefficients of 0.0826 for the left chest, 0.3706 for the left armpit, 0.3706 for the right armpit, 0.0936 for the upper back, and 0.0826 for the right chest were obtained using Cramer's Rule. Using the weighting coefficient, the deviation of the experimental result was ± 0.18 °C, which favors the use for clinical armpit temperature monitoring. Moreover, in special cases when several FBG sensors are broken, the weighted coefficients of the other sensors could be changed to obtain accurate body temperature.","Li, Hongqiang; Yang, Haijing; Li, Enbang; Liu, Zhihui; Wei, Kejia",Optics express,39,19

Understanding the role of anosmia as an early symptom of infection may improve monitoring and management of SARS-CoV2 infection. METHODOLOGY We conducted a systematic review of the literature of SARS-CoV2 infection/COVID-19 and anosmia to help inform management of anosmia in healthcare works. We report a case series of healthcare workers, who presented with a loss of sense of smell secondary to COVID-19 infection to demonstrate management principles. RT-PCR was used to confirm COVID-19 positivity and psychophysical testing of olfaction was performed using the British version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, UPSIT. RESULTS The systematic literature search returned 31 articles eligible for inclusion in the study and informed our recommendations for clinical assessment and management. All three healthcare professionals who presented with loss of sense of smell subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Psychophysical testing of olfaction using the UPSIT confirmed mild and moderate microsmia in two, respectively, and normosmia at day 17 in one. CONCLUSIONS Olfactory (± gustatory) dysfunction is indicative of COVID-19 infection and thus has important implications in the context of healthcare workers, or key workers in general, who work in close contact with others if not recognised as suffering from COVID. This leads to a potentially higher likelihood of spreading the virus. In conjunction with our literature review these findings have helped with creating recommendations on the assessment and management of olfactory dysfunction during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both for healthcare workers and patients.","Lechner, M; Chandrasekharan, D; Jumani, K; Liu, J; Gane, S; Lund, V J; Philpott, C; Jayaraj, S",Rhinology,39,16

METHODS Professional workers (N = 1854) from 40 CDC institutions were chosen using the stratified cluster random sampling method in all 13 municipalities of Heilongjiang Province, China. Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used. RESULTS Of 10 key capacities, the 3 that were most urgently needed during emergency response fieldwork as identified by respondents were crisis communication capacity, personal protection capacity, and laboratory detection capacity. Overall, 38.1% of respondents self-rated as ""poor"" on their coping-capacity. The logistic regression found that proficiency in emergency preparedness planning, more practical experiences in emergency response, effectiveness in training and drills, a higher education level, and a higher professional position were significantly associated with the individual's field coping-capacity. CONCLUSION This study identified CDC professionals' most urgent capacity need and the obstructive factors and highlighted the importance of enhancing the capacity in crisis communication, personal protection, and laboratory detection. Intervention should be targeted at sufficient fund, formalized, and effective emergency training and drills, more operational technical guidance, and all-around supervision and evaluation.","Zhao, Miaomiao; Liu, Baohua; Wang, Lan; Wu, Qunhong; Kang, Zheng; Hao, Yanhua; Amporfro, Daniel; Gao, Lijun",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,39,17

Successive monitoring of these pollutants has noteworthy significance for drinking water safety. Accordingly, this study conducted successive monitoring of antibiotics and ARGs from 2015 to 2017 in a drinking water source in East China. The total antibiotic concentration ranged from 19.68 ng/L to 497.00 ng/L, and decreased slightly from 2015 to 2017. Eighteen out of forty-one ARG subtypes showing resistance to six antibiotic classes and one class I integrase gene intI1, were detected in the drinking water source at concentrations ranging from 6.5 × 104 copies/mL to 1.6 × 106 copies/mL. Importantly, the total ARG concentration increased on an annual basis from 2015 to 2017 with an average annual increment of 0.25 orders of magnitude, which was mainly attributed to the increase in specific ARG subtypes, such as sul1, sul2, sul3, tetA, qnrB, and ermB. Most ARGs was positively correlated with the intI1 genes (r = 0.47-0.55, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the variation of antibiotics and ARGs appeared to be related to the water indices, particularly of the values of COD, BOD5, NO2-N (P < 0.05). This study provides basic data on antibiotic and ARG pollution in the studied drinking water source. Importantly, the findings expound that although the residual antibiotics in this drinking water source decreased slightly from 2015 to 2017, while its biological effect, the antibiotic resistance, increased annually, which give a warning of the antibiotic resistance pollution in the drinking water source.","Hu, Yaru; Jin, Lei; Zhao, Yi; Jiang, Lei; Yao, Shijie; Zhou, Wang; Lin, Kuangfei; Cui, Changzheng",The Science of the total environment,39,1

In this study, we observe that the S2 subunit of the IBV Beaudette strain is additionally cleaved at the second furin site (RRRR(690)/S) in cells expressing S constructs and in virus-infected cells. Detailed time course experiments showed that a peptide furin inhibitor, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone, blocked both viral entry and syncytium formation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the S1/S2 cleavage by furin was not necessary for, but could promote, syncytium formation by and infectivity of IBV in Vero cells. In contrast, the second site is involved in the furin dependence of viral entry and syncytium formation. Mutations of the second site from furin-cleavable RRRR/S to non-furin-cleavable PRRRS and AAARS, respectively, abrogated the furin dependence of IBV entry. Instead, a yet-to-be-identified serine protease(s) was involved, as revealed by protease inhibitor studies. Furthermore, sequence analysis of CoV S proteins by multiple alignments showed conservation of an XXXR/S motif, cleavable by either furin or other trypsin-like proteases, at a position equivalent to the second IBV furin site. Taken together, these results suggest that proteolysis at a novel XXXR/S motif in the S2 subunit might be a common mechanism for the entry of CoV into cells.","Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,39,1

OBJECTIVE To compare clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing pre-SRS embolization with ethylene copolymer (Onyx) with outcomes in patients undergoing SRS alone. METHODS Seventy consecutive patients with BAVMs who underwent SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with radiographic obliteration and complication. RESULTS Forty-one (59%) patients presented without BAVM rupture and 29 (41%) patients presented with rupture. Pre-SRS embolization was used in 20 patients (28.6%; 7 unruptured and 13 ruptured). Twenty-five of 70 (36%) patients sustained a complication from treatment, including 6 (9%) patients with a post-SRS latency period hemorrhage. Ten (14%) patients had persistent neurological deficits after treatment. Functional outcome (as modified Rankin Scale), complication rate, and radiographic obliteration at last follow-up were not significantly different between embolized and non-embolized groups in both unruptured and ruptured BAVMs. For unruptured BAVMs, 3- and 5-year rates of radiographic obliteration were 23% and 73% for non-embolized patients and 20% and 60% for embolized patients, respectively. For ruptured BAVMs, 3- and 5-year rates of radiographic obliteration were 45% and 72% for non-embolized patients and 53% and 82% for embolized patients, respectively. CONCLUSION Pre-SRS embolization with Onyx was not associated with worse clinical or radiographic outcomes than SRS treatment without embolization. Pre-SRS embolization has a low complication rate and can safely be used to target high-risk BAVM features in carefully selected patients destined for SRS.","Nerva, John D; Barber, Jason; Levitt, Michael R; Rockhill, Jason K; Hallam, Danial K; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Sekhar, Laligam N; Kim, Louis J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,39,30

Calcium ions (Ca2+) act as second messengers regulating secretion in many of these cases. In this setting, mitochondria appear as key players providing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, buffering Ca2+ concentrations and acting as structural platforms. These tasks also require the concerted actions of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery. These proteins mediate mitochondrial fusion and fission, and are also required for transport and tethering of mitochondria to cellular organelles where the different steps of the secretion process take place.

Our objective was to describe characteristics of a predominantly outpatient population tested for SARS-CoV-2 in an area receiving comprehensive testing. METHODS We extracted data on demographic characteristics and clinical data for all patients (91% outpatient) tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March 10 through April 24, 2020. We manually extracted data on symptoms and exposures from a subset of patients, and we calculated the adjusted odds of receiving a positive test result by demographic characteristics and clinical risk factors. RESULTS Of 17 662 people tested, 1006 (5.7%) received a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. Hispanic/Latinx people were twice as likely as non-Hispanic White people to receive a positive test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.1), although the severity at presentation did not explain this discrepancy. Young people aged 0-19 years had the lowest rates of receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 (<4 cases per 10 000 population), and adults aged 70-79 and 40-49 had the highest rates of hospitalization per 100 000 population among people who received a positive test result (16 and 11, respectively).

The objective was to externally validate the revisions by using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) of the American College of Surgeons. METHODS Cases presenting from 2000 through 2012 were drawn from the NCDB and reclassified according to the eighth edition stage classification. Clinically and pathologically staged subsets of NSCLC were analyzed separately. The T, N, and overall TNM classifications were evaluated according to clinical, pathologic, and ""best"" stage (N = 780,294). Multivariate analyses were carried out to adjust for various confounding factors. A combined analysis of the NSCLC cases from both databases was performed to explore differences in overall survival prognosis between the two databases. RESULTS The databases differed in terms of key factors related to data source. Survival was greater in the IASLC database for all stage categories. However, the eighth edition TNM stage classification system demonstrated consistent ability to discriminate TNM categories and stage groups for clinical and pathologic stage.

This study is to investigate the possible linkage between LCN2 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or forkhead transcription factor O1 (FoxO1), which influences insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis in liver. METHODS LCN2 knockout (LCN2KO) mice and wild-type littermates were used to evaluate the effect of LCN2 on insulin sensitivity and hepatic gluconeogenesis through pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), glucose tolerance test (ipGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, respectively. LCN2KO mice and WT mice in vivo, and in vitro HepG2 cells were co-transfected with adenoviral FoxO1-siRNA (Ad-FoxO1-siRNA) or adenovirus expressing constitutively active form of AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK), or dominant negative adenovirus AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), the relative mRNA and protein levels of two key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) were measured. RESULTS Improved insulin sensitivity and inhibited gluconeogenesis in the LCN2KO mice were confirmed by pyruvate tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Nuclear FoxO1 and its downstream genes PEECK and G6P were decreased in the livers of the LCN2KO mice, and AMPK activity was stimulated and directly phosphorylated FoxO1. In vitro, AMPK activity was inhibited in HepG2 cells overexpressing LCN2 leading to a decrease in phosphorylated FoxO1 and an increase in nuclear FoxO1. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that LCN2 regulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism through inhibiting AMPK activity, and regulating FoxO1 and its downstream genes PEPCK/G6P, which regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis.","Sun, W-X; Lou, K; Chen, L-J; Liu, S-D; Pang, S-G",Journal of endocrinological investigation,39,1

Our study assesses the feasibility of the Modified Angoff Method to reach expert consensus regarding difficulty of medical simulations. We compared scores with participant physiologic stress. METHODS Emergency medicine physicians with expertise in simulation education were asked to review 8 scenarios and estimate the percentage of resident physicians who would perform all critical actions using the modified Angoff method. A standard deviation (SD) of less than 10% of estimated percentage correct signified consensus. Twenty-five residents then performed the 6 scenarios that met consensus and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured. RESULTS During round 1, experts rated 4/8 scenarios within a 10% SD for postgraduate year 3 (PGY3) and 3/8 for PGY4 residents. In round 2, 6/8 simulation scenarios were within an SD of 10% points for both years. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.84 for PGY3 ratings and 0.89 for PGY4 ratings. A mixed effects analysis of variance showed no significant difference in HRV change from rest to simulation between teams or scenarios. Modified Angoff Score was not a predictor of HRV (multiple R = 0.0176). CONCLUSIONS Modified Angoff ratings demonstrated consensus in quantifying the estimated percentage of participants who would complete all critical actions for most scenarios. Although participant HRV did decrease during the scenarios, we were unable to significantly correlate this with ratings. This modified Angoff method is a feasible approach to evaluate simulation difficulty for educational and research purposes and may decrease the time and resources necessary for scenario piloting.","Joseph, Melissa N; Chang, Jungsoo; Buck, Samuel G; Auerbach, Marc A; Wong, Ambrose H; Beardsley, Thomas D; Reeves, Philip M; Ray, Jessica M; Evans, Leigh V",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,39,19

AIM To investigate cerebral autoregulation (CAR) and activity after propofol for endotracheal intubation in preterm neonates. METHODS Twenty-two neonates received propofol before intubation as part of a published dose-finding study. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oxygenation (rScO2), and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) were analyzed until 180 min after propofol. CAR was expressed as transfer function (TF) gain, indicating % change in rScO2 per 1 mmHg change in MABP. Values exceeding mean TF gain + 2 standard deviations (SD) defined impaired CAR. RESULTS After intubation with a median propofol dose of 1 (0.5-4.5) mg/kg, rScO2 remained stable during decreasing MABP. Mean (±SD) TF gain was 0.8 (±0.3)%/mmHg. Impaired CAR was identified in 1 and 5 patient(s) during drug-related hypotension and normal to raised MABP, respectively. Suppressed aEEG was observed up to 60 min after propofol. CONCLUSIONS Drug-related hypotension and decreased cerebral activity after intubation with low propofol doses in preterm neonates were observed, without evidence of cerebral ischemic hypoxia. CAR remained intact during drug-related hypotension in 95.5% of patients. Cerebral monitoring including CAR clarifies the cerebral impact of MABP fluctuations.","Thewissen, Liesbeth; Caicedo, Alexander; Dereymaeker, Anneleen; Van Huffel, Sabine; Naulaers, Gunnar; Allegaert, Karel; Smits, Anne",Pediatric research,39,1

In 2018, Monash Children's Hospital established an Early Neurodevelopment Clinic based upon evidence-based guidelines for the early diagnosis of CP in high-risk infants. In this study, we aimed to characterise the infants presenting to the clinic and determine the rate of CP diagnosis. METHODS This study analysed data from infants attending the Early Neurodevelopment Clinic between May 2019 and April 2020. Infants at high-risk for CP attended the clinic at 3 months corrected age. Neuroimaging reports were reviewed, and a Prechtl's General Movement Assessment and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination were performed. Infants were diagnosed as having typical development, delayed development, high-risk of CP or CP at the time of clinic attendance and referred on to the appropriate pathway. RESULTS Ninety-six high-risk infants attended the clinic over the 1 year study period. Sixty-eight (71%) infants were extremely preterm or extremely low birthweight, and 28 (29%) were infants at born at older gestation with evidence of moderate to severe brain injury. Nine (9.6%) infants received a CP diagnosis and 12 (12.5%) were considered high-risk of CP. All infants with CP or high-risk of CP were referred to the Victorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to implement the early CP diagnosis guidelines into a high-risk infant follow-up clinic. Implementation of the guidelines allows for early diagnosis of CP and appropriate referral of high-risk infants.","King, Arrabella R; Machipisa, Catherine; Finlayson, Francyne; Fahey, Michael C; Novak, Iona; Malhotra, Atul",Journal of paediatrics and child health,39,9

Smartphone technologies and applications have provided the opportunity to capture digital images and easily share them. The smartphone otoscope device was developed as a simple system that can convert a smartphone into a digital otoscope. This device has the prospective ability to improve physician-patient communication and assist with the diagnosis and management of ear disease. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and physician/parental satisfaction using the Cellscope® smartphone attachment for at home tympanostomy tube monitoring. METHODS Children between 6 months and 15 years of age at an urban tertiary children's hospital that were scheduled for bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion or underwent bilateral tympanostomy tube surgery were prospectively enrolled in the study. Comparisons were made between parental home-recorded videos and findings during in-office otoscopy. Two independent otolaryngologists reviewed the videos and concordance between inter-rater agreements was calculated. Acceptability and use questionnaires were administered to physicians and parents. RESULTS There was good intra-rater agreement between traditional otoscopy and video-otoscopy for tube extruding, tube blocked and tube extruded with at least 80% agreement (P < .05) and excellent inter-rater agreement between physicians for nearly all tube variables (P < .0001) There was a high degree of satisfaction with this mode of surveillance. Parents and physicians agreed that the CellScope® smartphone was easy to use, helpful with the occurrence of acute events, and appeared to improve quality of care. CONCLUSIONS The CellScope® smartphone is feasible for use in tympanostomy tube surveillance. Use of the device may allow otolaryngologists to easily follow a child's tympanostomy tube remotely over time and offer greater parental satisfaction.","Don, Debra M; Koempel, Jeffrey A; Fisher, Laurel M; Wee, Choo Phei; Osterbauer, Beth","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",39,7

The rate of postinterventional symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages was reported to be as high as 20%. Therefore, we investigated the safety and efficacy of this technique in a large multicentric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data bases of 4 German stroke centers were screened for all patients who received emergency stent placement of the extracranial internal carotid artery in combination with mechanical thrombectomy of the anterior circulation between 2007 and 2014. The primary outcome measure was the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III criteria; secondary outcome measures included the angiographic revascularization results and clinical outcome. RESULTS One hundred seventy patients with a median age of 64 years (range, 25-88 years) were treated. They presented after a median of 98 minutes (range, 52-160 minutes) with a median NIHSS score of 15 (range, 12-19). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 15/170 (9%) patients; there was no statistically significant difference among groups pertaining to age, sex, intravenous rtPA, procedural timings, and the rate of successful recanalization. In 130/170 (77%) patients, a TICI score of ≥ 2b could be achieved. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19%, and 36% of patients had a favorable outcome at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Emergency stent placement in the extracranial internal carotid artery in combination with anterior circulation thrombectomy is effective and safe. It is not associated with a significantly higher risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage compared with published series for mechanical thrombectomy alone.","Behme, D; Mpotsaris, A; Zeyen, P; Psychogios, M N; Kowoll, A; Maurer, C J; Joachimski, F; Liman, J; Wasser, K; Kabbasch, C; Berlis, A; Knauth, M; Liebig, T; Weber, W",AJNR.

CMBs are increasingly recognised with the widespread use of MRI in healthy individuals as well as in the context of cerebrovascular disease or dementia. They can also be encountered in major critical medical conditions such as in patients requiring extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. The advent of MRI-guided postmortem neuropathological examinations confirmed that, in the context of cerebrovascular disease, the vast majority of CMBs correspond to recent or old microhaemorrhages. Detection of CMBs is highly influenced by MRI parameters, in particular field strength, postprocessing methods used to enhance T2* contrast and three dimensional sequences. Despite recent progress, harmonising imaging parameters across research studies remains necessary to improve cross-study comparisons. CMBs are helpful markers to identify the nature and the severity of the underlying chronic small vessel disease. In daily clinical practice, presence and numbers of CMBs often trigger uncertainty for clinicians especially when antithrombotic treatments and acute reperfusion therapies are discussed. In the present review, we discuss those clinical dilemmas and address the value of CMBs as diagnostic and prognostic markers for future vascular events.","Puy, Laurent; Pasi, Marco; Rodrigues, Mark; van Veluw, Susanne J; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Shoamanesh, Ashkan; Cordonnier, Charlotte","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",39,1

Distinct from central and effector memory T cells, TRM cells take up residence in home tissues such as the lung or urogenital tract and are ideally positioned to respond quickly to pathogen encounter. TRM have been found to play a role in the immune response against many globally important infectious diseases for which new or improved vaccines are needed, including influenza and tuberculosis. It is also increasingly clear that TRM play a pivotal role in cancer immunity. Thus, vaccines that can generate this memory T cell population are highly desirable. The field of immunoengineering-that is, the application of engineering principles to study the immune system and design new and improved therapies that harness or modulate immune responses-is ideally poised to provide solutions to this need for next-generation TRM vaccines. This review covers recent developments in vaccine technologies for generating TRM and protecting against infection and cancer, including viral vectors, virus-like particles, and synthetic and natural biomaterials. In addition, it offers critical insights on the future of engineering vaccines for tissue-resident memory T cells.","Knight, Frances C; Wilson, John T",Advanced therapeutics,39,5

METHODS Participants were 238 adolescents (132 males; 118 with ADHD) aged 15.64-17.99 years and their parents. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires in May/June 2020 when in-person schools were closed in the U.S. RESULTS Twenty-two percent of families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and only 59% of school-based services received before COVID-19 continued during COVID-19 remote learning. Adolescents with ADHD had fewer routines and more remote learning difficulties than adolescents without ADHD. Parents of adolescents with ADHD had less confidence in managing remote learning and more difficulties in supporting home learning and home-school communication. Thirty-one percent of parents of adolescents with ADHD with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or receiving academic accommodations (504 Plan) reported remote learning to be very challenging, compared with 18% of parents of adolescents with ADHD without an IEP/504 Plan, and only 4% of parents of adolescents with neither ADHD nor an IEP/504 Plan. Fewer adolescent routines, higher negative affect, and more difficulty concentrating because of COVID-19 were each associated with greater adolescent remote learning difficulties only in adolescents with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS This study provides initial findings of the nature and impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative for schools and communities to provide the necessary supports to adolescents, particularly those with mental health and/or learning difficulties, and to their parents.","Becker, Stephen P; Breaux, Rosanna; Cusick, Caroline N; Dvorsky, Melissa R; Marsh, Nicholas P; Sciberras, Emma; Langberg, Joshua M",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,39,7

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of vulnerable populations, such as those with gynecologic cancer who develop COVID-19 infections, is limited. METHODS Patients from 6 NYC-area hospital systems with known gynecologic cancer and a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Demographic and clinical outcome data were abstracted through a review of electronic medical records. RESULTS Records for 121 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID-19 were abstracted; the median age at the COVID-19 diagnosis was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 51.0-73.0 years). Sixty-six of the 121 patients (54.5%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients, 45 (68.2%) required respiratory intervention, 20 (30.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 9 (13.6%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen patients (14.0%) died of COVID-19 complications. No patient requiring mechanical ventilation survived. On multivariable analysis, hospitalization was associated with an age ≥64 years (risk ratio [RR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.51), African American race (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13-2.15), and 3 or more comorbidities (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.03-1.98). Only recent immunotherapy use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.08-11.27) was associated with death due to COVID-19 on multivariable analysis; chemotherapy treatment and recent major surgery were not predictive of COVID-19 severity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a COVID-19 infection is 14.0%. Recent immunotherapy use is associated with an increased risk of mortality related to COVID-19 infection. LAY SUMMARY The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is 14.0%; there is no association between cytotoxic chemotherapy and cancer-directed surgery and COVID-19 severity or death.

Here, we performed comprehensive differential molecular profiling between TMJ fibrous and bony ankylosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Six sheep were used and a bilateral different degree of TMJ trauma was performed to induce fibrous ankylosis in one side and bony ankylosis in the other side. The ankylosed calluses were harvested at days 14 and 28 postoperatively and analyzed by Affymetrix OviGene-1_0-ST microarrays. DAVID was used to perform the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis for the different expression genes (DEGs). The DEGs were also typed into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to get the interaction data. Ten DEGs, including 7 hub genes from PPI analysis, were confirmed by real-time PCR. RESULTS We found 90 and 323 DEGs at least 2-fold at days 14 and 28, respectively. At day 14, bony ankylosis showed upregulated DEGs, such as TLR8, SYK, NFKBIA, PTPRC, CD86, ITGAM, and ITGAL, indicating a stronger immune and inflammatory response and cell adhesion, while genes associated with anti-adhesion (PRG4) and inhibition of osteoblast differentiation (SFRP1) had higher expression in fibrous ankylosis. At day 28, bony ankylosis showed increased biological process related to new bone formation, while fibrous ankylosis was characterized by a prolonged immune and inflammatory reaction.

Here, we describe a flexible Bayesian statistical framework to reconstruct virus transmission between different host species based on viral gene sequences, while simultaneously testing and estimating the contribution of several potential predictors of cross-species transmission. Specifically, we use a generalized linear model extension of phylogenetic diffusion to perform Bayesian model averaging over candidate predictors. By further extending this model with branch partitioning, we allow for distinct host transition processes on external and internal branches, thus discriminating between recent cross-species transmissions, many of which are likely to result in dead-end infections, and host shifts that reflect successful onwards transmission in the new host species. Our approach corroborates genetic distance between hosts as a key determinant of both host shifts and cross-species transmissions of rabies virus in North American bats. Furthermore, our results indicate that geographical range overlap is a modest predictor for cross-species transmission, but not for host shifts. Although our evolutionary framework focused on the multi-host reservoir dynamics of bat rabies virus, it is applicable to other pathogens and to other discrete state transition processes.","Faria, Nuno Rodrigues; Suchard, Marc A; Rambaut, Andrew; Streicker, Daniel G; Lemey, Philippe","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the subintimal approach for long femoropopliteal artery occlusions.Methods and Results:From a multicenter retrospective registry cohort, we included a total of 461 patients with 487 femoropopliteal artery occlusions classified as Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC) II C/D for this analysis. We compared the immediate and mid-term outcomes of subintimal vs. intraluminal approaches. There were 228 patients with 243 limbs in the subintimal group, and 233 patients with 244 limbs in the intraluminal group. Baseline clinical and lesion characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. The technical success rate was significantly higher in the subintimal group than in the intraluminal group (95.1% vs. 89.8%, P=0.041).

Methods: Patients with esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding who received TIPS treatment (ePTFE covered stent) or gastroscopy for the first time as the secondary prevention for portal hypertension at Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University through March to July 2017 were selected. One year after the operation, liver function changes, ascites remission rates, incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, re-bleeding rate, average hospitalization frequency and expenses, survival time, as well as the TIPS patency conditions were analyzed in the two groups of patients. 2 test, Kaplan-Meier method and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the data. Results: There were 74 and 66 cases in the TIPS and the drug combined gastroscopy group and the follow-up duration (14.57 ± 0.79) was 12-16 months. One year after surgery, the remission rate of ascites in the TIPS group was higher 57.1% (32/56) than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group (0), and the difference was statistically significant (χ(2) = 2 = 36.73, P < 0.01). The cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery in the TIPS group was 32.4% (24/74), 37.8% (28/74), 40.5% (30/74), and 40.5% (30/74), respectively. The cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the drug combined gastroscopy group was 3.0% (2/66), 3.0% (2/66), 3.0% (2/66), and 6.1% (4/66), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the TIPS group was higher than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group (χ(2) = 11.29, P < 0.01). The incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy ( grade III to IV) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery in the TIPS group was 2.7% (2/74), 0, 0, and 0, respectively. The incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy in drug combined gastroscopy group was 0, and there was no statistically significant difference in development of hepatic encephalopathy between the two groups (P > 0.05). The re-bleeding rates of TIPS group and drug combined gastroscopy group were 0 and 27.3% (18/66), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (χ(2) = 22.42, P < 0.01). There was no death reported during the follow-up period between both groups. The hospitalization frequency times (1.45 ± 0.80) in TIPS group was lower than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group times (3.24 ± 1.80), and the difference was statistically significant (U = -4.52, P < 0.01). Conclusion: In the prevention of esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding, TIPS (ePTFE-covered stent) treatment has the advantages of reducing re-bleeding rate, high ascites remission rate and hospitalizations frequency. In addition, patients treated with TIPS have a higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy than that of drugs combined with gastroscopy. However, TIPS did not exacerbate the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, and there was no significant difference in the 1-year survival rate after TIPS and drugs combined with gastroscopy treatment.","Lin, Z P; Chen, S L; Wang, J Y; Liu, F; Tan, Q; Peng, Q F; Zhao, J B",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,39,31

However, the consequences of lockdown on psychotic symptoms have been poorly investigated. METHODS An online survey was run from April 13 to May 11, 2020; a total of 728 French subjects from the general population were included in the study. We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and hallucination-like experiences were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale, respectively. Self-reported measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, repetitive thoughts, among others, were also included. RESULTS Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables (age, sex and education), loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, experiential avoidance, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, anxiety and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27). Neither length of isolation nor the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with psychotic experiences in the final models. CONCLUSIONS No evidence was found for the impact of isolation on psychotic symptoms in the general population in France one month after the lockdown. It nevertheless confirms the preeminent role of several factors previously described in the maintenance and development of psychotic symptoms in the context of a pandemic and lockdown measures.","Bortolon, Catherine; Capdevielle, Delphine; Dubreucq, Julien; Raffard, Stéphane",Journal of psychiatric research,39,24

METHODS The gene set enrichment profile, GSE12446, which includes 9 human endometrial samples from postmenopausal women treated with tibolone (tibolone group) and 9 control samples (control group), was downloaded from GEO database for analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tibolone vs. control groups were identified and then used for function and pathway enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were also performed. Finally, drug-target interaction was predicted for genes in modules, and then were validated in Pubmed. RESULTS A total of 238 up-regulated DEGs and 72 down-regulated DEGs were identified. These DEGs were mainly enriched in various biological processed and pathways, such as cilium movement (e.g., CCDC114 and DNAI2), calcium ion homeostasis, regulation of hormone levels and complement/coagulation cascades. PPI network contained 368 interactions and 166 genes, of which IGF1, DNALI1, CCDC114, TOP2A, DNAH5 and DNAI2 were the hue genes. A total of 96 drug-gene interactions were obtained, including 94 drugs and eight genes. TOP2A and HTR2B were found to be targets of 28 drugs and 38 drugs, respectively. Among the 94 obtained drugs, only 12 drugs were reported in studies, of which 7 drugs (e.g., epirubicin) were found to target TOP2A. CONCLUSIONS CCDC114 and DNAI2 might play important roles in tibolone-treated postmenopausal women via cilium movement function. TOP2A might be a crucial target of tibolone in endometrium of postmenopausal women.","Lv, Yanhua; Liu, Yanqing; Wang, Yueqiang; Kong, Fanrong; Pang, Qiuxiang; Hu, Guirong",BMC women's health,39,7

The purpose of our study was to investigate the anatomical features of the vertebral artery (VA) for transbrachial direct VA cannulation of a guiding catheter (GC) to perform coil embolization of posterior circulation aneurysms. METHODS Included in retrospective analysis were patients who underwent transbrachial coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms in the posterior cerebral circulation by direct VA cannulation of a GC from 2007 to 2013. Investigated were patient characteristics, preoperative sizes of aneurysms, aneurysms location, the angle formed by the target VA and the subclavian artery (AVS), and the VA diameter at the level of the fourth cervical vertebral body (VAD) in the side of the transbrachial access route. RESULTS Thirty-one patients with 32 aneurysms met our criteria. The locations of aneurysms were the VA (n = 16), basilar artery (BA) tip (n = 10), BA trunk (n = 3), BA superior cerebellar artery (n = 1), BA anterior inferior cerebellar artery (n = 1), and VA posterior inferior cerebellar artery (n = 1).

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our endovascular database for all patients treated with stent retrievers for posterior circulation stroke between June 2012 and June 2014. Twelve patients were identified. The following data were analyzed: thrombus location, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, thrombus etiology, comorbidities, time from presentation to initiation of endovascular treatment, time from start of angiography to revascularization, and whether intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered pre-thrombectomy. Outcome was considered poor when modified Rankin Scale score was >2. RESULTS Mean patient age was 63.42 years (median, 64.5; range, 28-83 years); 7 were women.

The role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of KD is not fully understood. METHODS Charts of patients with KD admitted to Children's Hospital Colorado from January 2009 to May 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with KD who had a nasopharyngeal wash submitted for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral testing were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and outcomes of patients with and without positive respiratory viral PCR results were compared. RESULTS Of 222 patients with KD admitted to the hospital, 192 (86%) had a respiratory viral PCR test performed on or shortly after admission. Ninety-three (41.9%) of the 192 patients with KD had a positive respiratory viral PCR, and the majority were positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus. No statistically significant differences were found in the clinical characteristics and laboratory values between the groups with and without positive respiratory viral PCR findings. Both groups had the same frequency of upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and had the same incidence of admission to the PICU, intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant disease, and coronary artery lesions. CONCLUSIONS No differences in clinical presentations or outcomes in children with KD stratified according to positive or negative respiratory viral PCR testing were observed. A positive respiratory viral PCR or presence of respiratory symptoms at the time of presentation should not be used to exclude a diagnosis of KD.","Turnier, Jessica L; Anderson, Marsha S; Heizer, Heather R; Jone, Pei-Ni; Glodé, Mary P; Dominguez, Samuel R",Pediatrics,39,1

Objective To determine whether hydrocortisone improves outcome for patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants An ongoing adaptive platform trial testing multiple interventions within multiple therapeutic domains, for example, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, or immunoglobulin. Between March 9 and June 17, 2020, 614 adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized within at least 1 domain following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovascular organ support at 121 sites in 8 countries. Of these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain. The domain was halted after results from another trial were released. Follow-up ended August 12, 2020. Interventions The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n = 143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n = 152), or no hydrocortisone (n = 108). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%). Results After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n = 137), shock-dependent (n = 146), and no (n = 101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6%-71.5%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0% and 63.5%. For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support-free days were 0 (IQR, -1 to 15), 0 (IQR, -1 to 13), and 0 (-1 to 11) days (composed of 30%, 26%, and 33% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support-free days among survivors). The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3%), 5 (3%), and 1 (1%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days. However, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.

METHODS Based on the ethical principle of virtue ethics and the underlying goal of providing individual patients with treatment according to their best interests, the methodology of triage is reassessed and revised. RESULTS The decision making processes regarding treatment decisions during a pandemic are redefined and new methods of intensive care provision recommended as well as recommending the use of a 'ranking' system for patients excluded from intensive care, defining the role of non-intensive care specialists, and applying two types of triage as 'organisational triage' and 'treatment triage' based on the demand for intensive care. CONCLUSION Using a different underlying ethical basis upon which to plan for a pandemic crisis could maximise the number of patients receiving intensive care based on individual patients' best interests.","Tillyard, Andrew",Intensive care medicine,39,1

Rapid detection is crucial to reduce their spread and prevent infections and outbreaks. OBJECTIVES To evaluate a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (called NG-Test VanA) for the rapid and reliable detection of VanA-producing VRE (VanA-VRE) from colonies and broth. METHODS NG-Test VanA was validated on 135 well-characterized enterococcal isolates grown on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar (including 40 VanA-VRE). Different agar plates and culture broths widely used in routine laboratories for culture of enterococci were tested. RESULTS All 40 VanA-VRE clinical isolates were correctly detected in less than 15 min irrespective of the species expressing the VanA ligase and the medium used for bacterial growth. No cross-reaction was observed with any other clinically relevant ligases (VanB, C1, C2, D, E, G, L, M and N). Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 100% for VanA-VRE grown on MH agar plates. NG-Test VanA accurately detects VanA-VRE irrespective of the culture medium (agar and broth). Band intensity was increased when using bacteria grown on vancomycin-containing culture media or on MH close to the vancomycin disc as a consequence of VanA induction. The limit of detection of the assay was 6.3 × 106 cfu per test with bacteria grown on MH plates and 4.9 × 105 cfu per test with bacteria grown on ChromID® VRE plates. CONCLUSIONS NG-Test VanA is efficient, rapid and easy to implement in the routine workflow of a clinical microbiology laboratory for the confirmation of VanA-VRE.","Oueslati, Saoussen; Volland, Hervé; Cattoir, Vincent; Bernabeu, Sandrine; Girlich, Delphine; Dulac, Ducan; Plaisance, Marc; Laroche, Maxime; Dortet, Laurent; Simon, Stéphanie; Naas, Thierry",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,39,20

Importantly, weak interactions that are often invisible to other biophysical methods can also be probed. Methodological advancements in NMR have enabled the investigation of high molecular weight, homo-oligomeric complexes that bind multiple ligand molecules, with increasing numbers of studies of the structural dynamics and binding properties of these systems. It therefore becomes of interest to consider how binding and kinetics parameters can be extracted from experiments on these more complicated molecules. Here we present the theoretical framework for analyzing binding reactions of homo-oligomeric complexes by NMR, taking into account all of the chemical species in solution and their corresponding NMR observables.

This is especially true during outbreaks of novel pathogens which may require atypical control methods reflecting the unknowns inherent in such situations. Healthcare providers within the UK have adopted various structures and models of infection prevention and control (IPC) service reflecting the individual needs of different organisations. As such, the roles and responsibilities of IPC practitioners vary between organisations. Variations in models of care combined with challenges created by outbreaks of novel infections may make algorithm based approaches to outbreak management less effective and potentially prone to missing key actions or considerations which may improve outcomes. Here we suggest the application of a widely established military planning technique, developed to aid decision making in combat environments, to the management of outbreaks of novel infection in acute hospital settings. The technique can be applied at all levels within an IPC hierarchy regardless of role or responsibility and may improve the coherency and efficacy of outbreak management efforts made by IPC teams. The technique may also be applied to outbreaks of known infections; however, in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the model, a novel infection has been used to illustrate its potential value in outbreak management when knowledge is limited.","Wynn, Matthew Oliver; George, Ryan; Cole, Mark",Journal of infection prevention,39,24

Although HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) has been introduced as a risk factor for these diseases' progression, it is not sufficient on its own to yield an accurate estimation of the outcome of the infection. In the present study, PVL and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) expression level as viral factors, and IFN λ3 as a host factor, were evaluated in HAM/TSP patients and HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). During 2014-2015, 12 HAM/TSP patients and 18 ACs who had been referred to the HTLV-1 Clinic, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), Mashhad, Iran, were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and the DNA and mRNA were extracted for quantification of HBZ, IFN λ3 expression, and PVL using real-time PCR (TaqMan method). Although the PVL was higher in the HAM/TSP group, with a 94% confidence interval, there were no considerable differences in terms of HBZ mRNA and PVL between ACs and HAM patients. IFN λ3 expression in the HAM/TSP group was significantly higher than in the ACs (P = 0.02). To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the expression level of IFN λ3 in HTLV-1 positive patients. The immune response against HTLV-1 viral antigens and virulent factors will therefore further refine our knowledge of interactions between the virus and host in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-related disorders.

However, these materials mostly emit in the blue or green region, in which preparation of materials with long-wavelength (especially near-infrared) emission is still a great challenge. In this work, it is found that 2-(dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate (DMA) and itaconic anhydride (ITA) undergo a ring-opening reaction at room temperature, and subsequently generate zwitterionic compound (IDMA). Based on the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, ionic bond can effectively promote the isolated electron-rich chromophores to form new emissive clusters with extended electron delocalization. Herein, two oligomers (P1 and P2) with different fluorescence emissions by controlling the concentration of zwitterionic monomers before polymerization are synthesized. It is worth noting that the maximum emission wavelength of P2 at high concentration is up to 712 nm, which is very rare in previous reports. In addition, the resulting oligomer (P2) shows typical aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE), excitation-dependent fluorescence, temperature-sensitive emission, and solvatochromism. The cytotoxicity assay demonstrates that P2 was low toxic to Huh7 and LM3 cells, and suitable for cell imaging.

However, among scaled digital health solutions, ensuring sustainability remains elusive. This study explores the factors underpinning scale-up of digital health solutions for FLHWs in India, and the potential implications of these factors for sustainability. METHODS We assessed five FLHW digital tools scaled at the national and/or state level in India. We conducted in-depth interviews with implementers, technology and technical partners (n=11); senior government stakeholders (n=5); funders (n=1) and evaluators/academics (n=3). Emergent themes were grouped according to a broader framework that considered the (1) digital solution; (2) actors; (3) processes and (4) context. RESULTS The scale-up of digital solutions was facilitated by their perceived value, bounded adaptability, support from government champions, cultivation of networks, sustained leadership and formative research to support fit with the context and population. However, once scaled, embedding digital health solutions into the fabric of the health system was hampered by challenges related to transitioning management and ownership to government partners; overcoming government procurement hurdles; and establishing committed funding streams in government budgets. Strong data governance, continued engagement with FLHWs and building a robust evidence base, while identified in the literature as critical for sustainability, did not feature strongly among respondents. Sustainability may be less elusive once there is more consensus around the roles played between national and state government actors, implementing and technical partners and donors. CONCLUSION The use of digital tools by FLHWs offers much promise for improving service delivery and health outcomes in India. However, the pathway to sustainability is bespoke to each programme and should be planned from the outset by investing in people, relationships and service delivery adjustments to navigate the challenges involved given the dynamic nature of digital tools in complex health systems.","Singh, Neha S; Scott, Kerry; George, Asha; LeFevre, Amnesty Elizabeth; Ved, Rajani",BMJ global health,39,31

This study assessed prevalence of, and antecedent factors and care access for the two common cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, to support health system improvements. METHODS Data was from a population based nationally representative survey. Prevalence of hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg or a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose ≥6.1 mmol/L or a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes. Care-cascades for hypertension and diabetes were created with four stages: being tested, diagnosed, treated, and achieving control. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate individual-level factors - including symptoms of mental illness - associated with having hypertension or diabetes, and with progressing through the hypertension care cascade. Whether people at overt increased risk of hypertension or diabetes (defined as > 50 years old, BMI > 30 kg/m2, or currently smoking) were more likely to be tested was assessed using chi squared. RESULTS Prevalence of hypertension was 33.5% (CI 30.6-36.5). Older age (OR 7.7, CI 4.93-12.02), some education (OR 0.6, CI 0.44-0.89), obesity (OR 3.1, CI 2.12-4.44), and raised fasting blood glucose (OR 2.4, CI 2.38) were significantly independently associated with hypertension. Only 10.9% (CI 8.6-13.8) of the entire hypertensive population achieved blood pressure control, associated factors were being female (OR 4.8, CI 2.33-9.88), formally employed (OR 3.0, CI 1.26-7.17), and overweight (OR 2.5, CI 1.29-4.76). The prevalence of diabetes was 4.4% (CI 3.4-5.5), and associated with old age (OR 14.1, CI 6.05-32.65) and almost significantly with obesity (OR 2.1, CI 1.00-4.37). Only 11.9% (CI 6.6-20.6) of the diabetic population had achieved control. Individuals at overt increased risk were more likely to have been tested for hypertension (chi2 19.4) or diabetes (chi2 33.2) compared to the rest of the population. Symptoms of mental illness were not associated with prevalence of disease or progress through the cascade.

The assessments of the recovered patients were applied on the initial phase that the tests of the patients were negative and on the 4-week follow up phase. RESULTS The results showed that the anxiety scores were significantly higher in the healthy control group than in the group of recovered patients. The IGT-Net 4 scores were significantly and IGT-Net total scores were marginally significantly lower in the group of recovered patients. In other words, recovered patients showed higher risk-taking behavior tendencies. This tendency difference is consistent with the anxiety levels of the groups. These IGT scores showed to be persistent in the 4-week follow up phase.

Other than ultrasonography, no routine preoperative imaging was used; however, we performed routine intraoperative cholangiography on all patients. RESULTS There was no difference in age (49 +/- 15 vs. 57 +/- 19, p = 0.7), sex (79% vs. 82% females, p = 0.6), and ASA grade (1.9 +/- 1 vs. 1.8 +/- 1, p = 0.7). A larger proportion of the TCE group presented as an emergency (TCE 45% vs. LC alone 27%, p = 0.03) and more often presented with acute biliary pain compared with LC alone (27% vs. 13%, p = 0.02). Although a majority of the patients in the TCE group had clinical or biochemical risk factors for CBD stones (86%), only 27% had suspected stones on preoperative ultrasound. The incidence of jaundice (6% vs. 20%, p = 0.01) was lower in the LC alone group compared with TCE patients. Previous abdominal surgery was noted in 34% patients who underwent LC alone and 30% in LC/TCE (p = 0.06). Significantly there was no difference in open conversion between the two groups (LC alone 0.5% vs. LC/TCE 0.6%, p = 0.07).

In April 2020, when COVID-19-related shutdowns were at their first peak, cases dropped to a historic low of 0 examinations (the lowest number of cases in the past 10 years). CONCLUSIONS The data show an initial drop in the number of survivors seeking postassault care after the COVID shutdown; however, cases rebounded through the second full month of shutdown orders.

One (10%) patient had a minor complication (postoperative fever treated with antibiotics) and one (10%) patient had a major complication (small bowel obstruction necessitating reoperation). Of the 10 tumors, 2 were pathologic stage T(1b), 4 were pathologic stage T(2), and 4 were stage T(3a). At a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range 1-16 mos), six (60%) patients were alive without evidence of recurrence, and 4 (40%) patients were alive with disease. Of those four patients, all four had known metastatic disease before surgery. CONCLUSION LESS-RN for large or advanced stage renal masses is a technically challenging operation. In experienced hands, however, it is a safe and feasible therapeutic option for the management of these tumors.","Rosoff, James S; Fine, Ronnie G; Velez, Marissa C; Del Pizzo, Joseph J",Journal of endourology,39,1

The worldwide concern about the safety of patients and professionals in these institutions is relevant. In Brasil, a large part of post-acute care and chronic patients is performed at home through Home Care (HC). OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in Home Care patients and the clinical outcomes of these patients; it also aims to assess the impact of the epidemic on the number of patients, new admissions, and hospitalizations. METHODS A descriptive study of the COVID-19 cases that affected the population in care by Home Doctor (a private company of Home Care), between the months of March 2020 and May 2020 and analysis of the total number of patients, the hospitalization and death rate in the period compared to the pre-epidemic period. RESULTS There were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 21 of which were male, mean age 73 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities, the most prevalent were: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (54%) and Stroke (35%). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1% in the studied population. There were 10 hospitalizations with 5 hospital deaths and one case of home death (lethality 19%). Safe care was maintained, with a low death rate (0.6%) and hospitalization (6.1%). CONCLUSION Home Care is able to maintain safe care during the pandemic due to COVID-19, with a low incidence of COVID-19, low hospitalization rate, and low mortality when compared to nursing homes institutions.","Gaspar, Heloisa Amaral; Oliveira, Cláudio Flauzino de; Jacober, Fabiana Camolesi; Deus, Eduardo Roberto de; Canuto, Flavia",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,39,1

Comparing week-to-week reported influenza-like illness percentages may identify the time of year a novel pathogen is introduced. However, changes in health-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic call in to question the reliability of 2019-2020 ILINet data as a comparison to prior years, potentially rendering this system less reliable as a novel pathogen surveillance tool. Corroboration of trends seen in the 2019-2020 ILINet data lends confidence to the validity of those trends. This study compares predicted versus reported influenza and influenza-like illnesses in vaccinated adults as a surrogate measure of novel pathogen surveillance. METHODS An online survey was used to ask US adults their influenza vaccination status, whether they were diagnosed with influenza after vaccination, and whether they experienced an influenza-like illness other than flu. RESULTS Prevalence of self-reported flu diagnosis in adults age 18-64 who received the flu vaccine between September 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020 (n = 3,225) was 5.8 %, while self-reported flu or flu-like illness (without a flu diagnosis) was 17.9 %. CONCLUSION Flu and flu-like illness in this sample of flu-vaccinated U.S. adults is significantly higher than predicted, consistent with substantially higher ILI's in 2019-20 compared to ILI's from 2018-19, suggesting that the ILI values reported during the COVID-19 pandemic may be appropriate for comparison to prior years.","Lennon, Robert P; Miller, Erin L; Snyder, Bethany; Van Scoy, Lauren Jodi",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,39,26

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a zoonotic pathogen, came into sight, spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) all over the globe. Association of cutaneous signs and symptoms with COVID-19 is being studied worldwide, principally, to determine if these dermatoses can help in early recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These dermatological manifestations can range from erythematous rash, urticaria to livedo reticularis, and acrocyanosis in patients of all age groups. Correspondingly, dermatologists treating COVID-19 patients, suffering from inflammatory dermatoses, with biologics or immunomodulators should exert caution and use specific protocols to adjust the doses of these medications. Prevention of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 is being promoted universally, with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand washes, and hand sanitizers around the clock. However, an array of cutaneous adverse effects such as contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, friction blisters, contact urticaria, acne, and infections are associated with the use of PPE. Extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are still emerging in the community, and physicians and researchers are working together globally to strengthen the clinical management of these patients.

Potential CUG-initiated uORFs are also found in many strains. The AUG-initiated uORF is presumably translated following genomic 5'-end cap-dependent ribosomal scanning, but its function is unknown. Here, in a reverse-genetics study with mouse hepatitis coronavirus, the following were observed. (i) When the uORF AUG-initiating codon was replaced with a UAG stop codon along with a U112A mutation to maintain a uORF-harboring stem-loop 4 structure, an unimpaired virus with wild-type (WT) growth kinetics was recovered. However, reversion was found at all mutated sites within five virus passages. (ii) When the uORF was fused with genomic (main) ORF1 by converting three in-frame stop codons to nonstop codons, a uORF-ORF1 fusion protein was made, and virus replicated at WT levels. However, a frameshifting G insertion at virus passage 7 established a slightly 5'-extended original uORF. (iii) When uAUG-eliminating deletions of 20, 30, or 51 nucleotides (nt) were made within stem-loop 4, viable but debilitated virus was recovered. However, a C80U mutation in the first mutant and an A77G mutation in the second appeared by passage 10, which generated alternate uORFs that correlated with restored WT growth kinetics. In vitro, the uORF-disrupting nondeletion mutants showed enhanced translation of the downstream ORF1 compared with the WT. These results together suggest that the uORF represses ORF1 translation yet plays a beneficial but nonessential role in coronavirus replication in cell culture.","Wu, Hung-Yi; Guan, Bo-Jhih; Su, Yu-Pin; Fan, Yi-Hsin; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,39,17

STUDY DESIGN An observation study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Intensive care units (ICU) of Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, from October 2020 to December 2020. METHODOLOGY The data of 149 patients, who were admitted to the ICU were collected and analysed retrospectively. Routine blood samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission to the ICU; and 102 patients with the mortal course and 47 patients with the non-mortal course were included in the study. The data obtained from these patients were analyzed in the biostatistics programme. Results: The median age of all patients was 68 years; while 94 of them were males (63.1%) and 55 of them were females (36.9%). Median levels of potassium (K) (p=0.04), uric acid (p=0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.004), and procalcitonin (PCT) (p<0.001) were significantly higher and median level of prealbumin (p=0.002) was significantly lower in the deceased group. The cut-off level of prealbumin for mortality was found as 0.085 g/L (p=0.002). Further analysis revealed that the risk of mortality was found as 2.193 times more in patients with prealbumin levels of <0.085 g/L (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.193, 95% CI: 1.084-4.434). CONCLUSION As a result of this study, it was found that patients with lower levels of prealbumin at the time of admission to the ICU have a higher risk for mortality. It was showed that prealbumin can be a useful biomarker for predicting mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.

Type 2 Stickler Syndrome results from a mutation in the gene coding for α-1 type XI pro-collagen, which has been identified in the human vitreous, cartilage and the cochlea of the mouse. The condition is characterised by classic ocular abnormalities, auditory dysfunction, osteoarthropathy and oro-facial dysplasia. METHODS This is a population study which used a combination of audiometric, tympanometric, and self-report measures on a series of 65 individuals (mean age 29.2 years, range 3-70, female 63.1%) with genetically confirmed type 2 Stickler Syndrome. RESULTS Hearing impairment was identified in at least one ear for 69% of individuals. Analysis against age-matched normative data showed that reduced hearing sensitivity was present across all test frequencies. Sensorineural hearing loss was most common (77% of ears), with conductive (3%), mixed (7%) and no hearing loss (13%), respectively. The proportion of hypermobile tympanic membranes (24%) was less than previously documented in type 1 Stickler Syndrome. When present, this appears to arise as a direct result of collagen abnormalities in the middle ear. Self-report measures of speech and spatial hearing in sound were comparable to a non-syndromic cohort with similar audiometric thresholds. CONCLUSIONS Auditory impairment in type 2 Stickler Syndrome is predominantly associated with cochlear hearing loss of varying severities across affected individuals. The impact on hearing thresholds can be seen across the frequency range, suggesting a contribution of defective collagen throughout the cochlea. Self-report questionnaires showed that difficulties understanding speech, and spatial information in sound (such as that used for localisation), were worse than a young, normal-hearing population but comparable to a non-syndromic cohort with similar audiometric thresholds. Therefore, it is likely that hearing loss in type 2 Stickler Syndrome arises in the auditory periphery, without significant central processing deficits.","Alexander, Philip; Gomersall, Philip; Stancel-Lewis, Jack; Fincham, Gregory Scott; Poulson, Arabella; Richards, Allan; McNinch, Annie; Baguley, David M; Snead, Martin",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,39,1

The intraoperative assessment of cerebral ischemia remains a technological challenge. OBJECTIVE As a novel approach, cortical tissue integrity was monitored using simultaneous measurements of regional capillary-venous cerebral blood flow (rvCBF), oxygen saturation (Srvo2), and hemoglobin amount (rvHb) during aneurysm surgery. METHODS Fifteen patients scheduled for aneurysm surgery of the anterior and posterior circulation were included. A fiber optic probe was placed on the cortex associated with the distal branch of the aneurysmatic vessel. Blinded measurements by combined laser-Doppler flowmetry (rvCBF) and photospectrometry (Srvo2, rvHb) were performed before and after surgical clipping or trapping of the aneurysm. Data were correlated with postoperative imaging and neurological outcome. RESULTS Cortical measurements could be successfully performed in all patients. Significant increase (>25% change from baseline) or decrease (<25% change from baseline) of rvCBF, Srvo2, and rvHb was detectable in 33 to 46% of patients after surgical intervention. Severe decrease (>50% change from baseline) of all parameters or solitary of rvCBF was correlated to reduced cerebral perfusion and neurological deficits in 2 patients. CONCLUSION Combined laser-Doppler flowmetry and photospectrometry provides real-time information on cortical microcirculation. Intraoperative alterations of parameters (rvCBF, Srvo2, rvHb) might reflect changes of cerebral tissue integrity during intracranial aneurysm surgery.","Klein, Klaus Ulrich; Stadie, Axel; Fukui, Kimiko; Schramm, Patrick; Werner, Christian; Oertel, Joachim; Engelhard, Kristin; Fischer, Gerrit",Neurosurgery,39,17

Current ENETS guidelines advocate resection of all localised d-NETs. However, 'watch and wait' may be appropriate for some localised, small, grade 1, non-functioning, non-ampullary d-NETs. We evaluated whether patients with such d-NETs who chose 'watch and wait' involving regular endoscopic surveillance had equivalent disease-related outcomes to patients undergoing endoscopic or surgical resection. Methods Retrospective review of patients with histologically confirmed d-NETs at Liverpool ENETS Centre of Excellence 2007-2020. Results Sixty-nine patients were diagnosed with d-NET of which fifty were sporadic, non-functioning, non-ampullary tumours. Patient treatment groups were similar in terms of age, gender, tumour location and grade, but unsurprisingly, larger tumours (median diameter 17mm (p<0.0001)) were found in the surgically treated group. Five patients underwent surgical resection with no evidence of tumour recurrence or disease-related death. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic resection, with one local recurrence detected during follow-up. Thirty patients (28 with d-NETs ≤10mm) underwent 'watch and wait' with resection only if tumours increased in size. The d-NETs in 28/30 patients remained stable or decreased in size over a median 27 months (IQR:15-48, R:3-98). In seven patients the d-NET was completely removed by avulsion during diagnostic biopsy and was not seen at subsequent endoscopies. Only two patients showed increased d-NET size during surveillance, of whom only one was fit for endoscopic resection. No NET-related deaths were documented during follow up. Conclusions All of the localised, ≤10mm, grade 1, non-functioning, non-ampullary d-NETs in this cohort behaved indolently with very low risks of progression and no tumour-related deaths. 'Watch and wait' therefore appears to be a safe alternative management strategy for selected d-NETs.","Exarchou, Klaire; Moore, Andrew R; Smart, Howard L; Duckworth, Carrie A; Howes, Nathan; Pritchard, D Mark",Neuroendocrinology,39,1

OBJECTIVES We studied whether environmental viral infections in the general population can be associated with increased MS relapse occurrence using retrospective data from 1986 to 1995 when interferons were not yet available. METHODS Logistic regression modelling was used to compare retrospectively the monthly relapse occurrence from 407 MS patients in Turku University hospital archives and data on ten different specifically diagnosed viral infection epidemics in the general population of Southwestern Finland from 1986 to 1995. The outcome was the odds ratio (OR) of very high relapse occurrence versus low relapse occurrence, or moderate versus low relapse occurrence. RESULTS After a peak in diagnosed influenza A cases in the general population, the MS relapse occurrence was 6.5 times more likely to be very high (95% CI 1.8-24.0) and 7.1 times more likely to be moderately high (95% CI 1.5-33.2). An increase in MS relapse counts also followed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3-15.1), but we found no significant association with adenovirus infections and MS relapses. The MS relapse occurrence was lowest in the summer months July-August (Chi-square test, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that influenza A and EBV viral infections in the general population are associated with a higher occurrence of exacerbations in MS patients, and thus environmental infection data should be included in epidemiological models on MS relapses.","Oikonen, Mervi; Laaksonen, Mikko; Aalto, Ville; Ilonen, Jorma; Salonen, Reijo; Erälinna, Juha-Pekka; Panelius, Martin; Salmi, Aimo",Multiple sclerosis,39,16

Early initiation of treatment is associated with improved outcomes. In clinical practice, empiric oseltamivir treatment is therefore commonly started prior to diagnostic microbiological confirmation. There is limited data on the patient characteristics, outcomes and safety of this practice. This study investigated outcomes and safety of this preemptive treatment strategy using oseltamivir. METHODS Descriptive analysis of LTRs who received oseltamivir for ≥2 days for suspected influenza infection between 07-2011 and 06-2012. Analyses were based on data from electronic medical records and our standardized LTR database with prospective documentation of clinical information including medication, laboratory and radiological results, outcomes and adverse events. RESULTS We included 133 patients with a total of 261 oseltamivir treatment episodes (87.4% as outpatients). Median duration of oseltamivir treatment was 4 days (range 2 to 67), and 98.5% had concomitant antibiotic pharmacotherapy. Indications for oseltamivir included acute respiratory infection (66.7%), non-distinctive inflammatory reaction (51.3%), and influenza-like illness (2.7%). Influenza virus infection was confirmed by PCR in only 7%. Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen detected (14.9%). We discovered a wide range of adverse events but none occurred in >5%, and most were mild and of questionable causal relationship to oseltamivir administration.

In this study, we applied principles from Self-Determination Theory to develop and test activities to satisfy basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) to enhance the experience of need satisfaction, autonomous self-regulation, and subjective vitality, and to decrease the experience of need frustration, controlled self-regulation, amotivation, and perceived stress. METHOD Using a 10-day experimental research design among an Iranian sample (N = 208, Mage = 23.52, SD = 5.00), we randomly allocated participants to either an experimental (basic psychological need-satisfying activities intervention, n = 98) or a control (neutral comparison group, n = 110) condition. RESULTS Repeated measure ANCOVA showed that participants in the experimental condition reported greater psychological need satisfaction, autonomous self-regulation, subjective vitality, and lesser psychological need frustration, amotivation, and perceived stress than did participants in the control condition. CONCLUSION We conclude that the intervention was successful in helping participants enhance their motives and well-being and reduce their stress when life is surrounded by uncertainty and during social distancing restrictions.","Behzadnia, Behzad; FatahModares, Saeideh",Applied psychology.

CTCs contain a small subset of metastatic precursors that can form metastases in secondary organs and provide a resource to identify mechanisms underlying metastasis-initiating properties. Despite technological advancements that allow for highly sensitive approaches of detection and isolation, CTCs are very rare and often present as single cells, posing an extreme challenge for ex vivo expansion after isolation. Here, using previously established patient-derived CTC lines, we performed a small molecule drug screen to identify compounds that can improve ex vivo culture efficiency for single CTCs. We found that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and other antioxidants can promote ex vivo expansion of single CTCs, by reducing oxidative and other stress particularly at the initial stage of single cell expansion. RNA-seq analysis of growing clones and non-growing clones confirmed the effect by NAC, but also indicate that NAC-induced decrease in oxidative stress is insufficient for promoting proliferation of a subset of cells with predominant senescent features. Despite the challenge in expanding all CTCs, NAC treatment led to establishment of single CTC clones that have similar tumorigenic features. Implications: Through a small molecule screen and validation study, we found that NAC could improve the success of ex vivo expansion of single CTCs by mitigating the initial stress, with the potential to facilitate the investigation of functional heterogeneity in CTCs.","Teng, Teng; Kamal, Mohamed; Iriondo, Oihana; Amzaleg, Yonatan; Luo, Chunqiao; Thomas, Amal; Lee, Grace; Hsu, Ching-Ju; Nguyen, John D; Kang, Irene; Hicks, James; Smith, Andrew; Sposto, Richard; Yu, Min",Molecular cancer research : MCR,39,25

METHODS Data was collected as part of routine clinical care from 2011 to 2013. Adherence was recorded by downloads from the PAP device. ""Adequate"" adherence was defined as ≥4 h/night for 70 % of days used. Effectiveness of therapy was measured by polysomnography (PSG) pre- and post-PAP initiation. One year follow-up was undertaken to determine the long-term utilisation of PAP therapy. RESULTS Ninety-nine children were included (55 CPAP, 44 BiLevel). Mean age and BMI z-score were 6.9 ± 5.5 years and 0.1 ± 2.0 for CPAP and 9.8 ± 5.9 years and -0.5 ± 2.6 for BiLevel, respectively. At initial download, adequate adherence was observed in 75 % of CPAP and 91 % of BiLevel users. Mean hours of use (per night) for all nights used was 6.8 ± 2.8 and 9.3 ± 3.6 h, respectively. PSG demonstrated that CPAP use was associated with >60 % decrease in the obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (OAHI, 19.0 ± 18.4 to 2.4 ± 3.1; p < 0.001). BiLevel use was associated with improved baseline SaO2 and TcCO2 (SaO2, 92.5 ± 5.4 % to 95.5 ± 2.9 %; p = 0.001 and reduction in TcCO2, 50.0 ± 10.9 mmHg to 44.8 ± 7.6 mmHg; p = 0.01). At follow-up, 22 (40 %) patients on CPAP and 26 (59 %) on BiLevel continued with therapy, and amongst these, adequate adherence was maintained in 76 % of CPAP and 80 % of Bilevel users. CONCLUSIONS In this Australian paediatric cohort (predominantly non-obese), adherence with BiLevel was greater than for CPAP. Over half of our population continue to utilise PAP therapy 1 year later, and amongst these cases, adequate adherence was maintained.","Machaalani, Rita; Evans, Carla A; Waters, Karen A",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,39,1

BACKGROUND After orthotopic HTx, allografts undergo DMI that contributes to functional impairment, especially to increased passive myocardial stiffness, which is an important pathophysiological determinant of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiographic SW elastography is an emerging approach for measuring myocardial stiffness in vivo. Natural SWs occur after mechanical excitation of the myocardium, for example, after MVC, and their propagation velocity is directly related to myocardial stiffness, thus providing an opportunity to assess myocardial stiffness at end-diastole. METHODS 52 HTx recipients that underwent right heart catheterization (all) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (n = 23) during their annual check-up were prospectively enrolled. Echocardiographic SW elastography was performed in parasternal long axis views of the LV using an experimental scanner at 1,135 ± 270 frames per second. The degree of DMI was quantified with T1 mapping. RESULTS SW velocity at MVC correlated best with native myocardial T1 values (r = 0.75; p < 0.0001) and was the best noninvasive parameter that correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) (r = 0.54; p < 0.001). Standard echocardiographic parameters of LV diastolic function correlated poorly with both native T1 and PCWP values. CONCLUSIONS End-diastolic SW propagation velocities, as measure of myocardial stiffness, showed a good correlation with CMR-defined diffuse myocardial injury and with invasively determined LV filling pressures in patients with HTx. Thus, these findings suggest that SW elastography has the potential to become a valuable noninvasive method for the assessment of diastolic myocardial properties in HTx recipients.","Petrescu, Aniela; Bézy, Stéphanie; Cvijic, Marta; Santos, Pedro; Orlowska, Marta; Duchenne, Jürgen; Pedrosa, João; Van Keer, Jan M; Verbeken, Eric; von Bardeleben, Stephan; Droogne, Walter; Bogaert, Jan; Van Cleemput, Johan; D'hooge, Jan; Voigt, Jens-Uwe",JACC.

We have developed a new approach, single-incision transumbilical LRYGB (SITU-LRYGB) to treat morbid obesity. We compared the surgical results and patient satisfaction in a study of five-port LRYGB and SITU-LRYGB. Fifty morbidly obese patients (14 males, 36 females) underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with five-port LRYGB or the SITU-LRYGB approach. During the operation, we used a novel intraoperative liver traction method with a ""liver suspension tape"" that we specifically designed for SITU-LRYGB. Compared to five-port surgery with SITU-LRYGB, there were no intraoperative complications, wound healing was excellent, and there was no abdominal scarring. SITU surgical time was longer than that with five-port LRYGB (99.8 vs. 67.6 min, P < 0.001). Patients treated with the five-port method were more obese than those in the SITU group (127.9 vs. 112.4 kg, P = 0.016). After the bariatric surgery, no difference in comorbidity was found in both groups. Patient satisfaction was greater with SITU than with the five-port method (4.48 vs. 3.96, P = 0.006). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be successfully achieved via a single umbilical incision, a method that provides a short operative time and good recovery and eliminates abdominal scarring.","Huang, Chih-Kun; Yao, Sheng-Fa; Lo, Chi-Hsien; Houng, Jer-Yiing; Chen, Yaw-Sen; Lee, Po-Huang",Obesity surgery,39,1

We employed spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to characterize the changes in optical properties of tissue during wound healing progression in a porcine model of split-thickness skin grafts and also in a model of burn wound healing with no graft intervention. Changes in the reduced scattering coefficient measured using SFDI correlated with structural changes reported by histology of biopsies taken concurrently. SFDI was able to measure spatial inhomogeneity in the wounds and predicted heterogeneous healing. In addition, we were able to visualize differences in healing rate, depending on whether a wound was debrided and grafted, versus not debrided and left to heal without intervention apart from topical burn wound care. Changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were also quantified, giving insight into hemodynamic changes during healing..","Kennedy, Gordon T; Stone, Randolph; Kowalczewski, Andrew C; Rowland, Rebecca; Chen, Jeffrey H; Baldado, Melissa L; Ponticorvo, Adrien; Bernal, Nicole; Christy, Robert J; Durkin, Anthony J",Journal of biomedical optics,39,7

The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical and angiographic outcomes of using the LUNA aneurysm embolization system (AES) for treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS The LUNA AES Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study that was designed to evaluate device safety and efficacy. Bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms were included. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed using the Raymond-Roy classification scale. Disability was assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Morbidity was defined as mRS >2 if baseline mRS ≤2, increase in mRS of 1 or more if baseline mRS >2, or mRS >2 if aneurysm was ruptured at baseline. Clinical and angiographic follow-up was conducted at 6, 12 and 36 months. RESULTS Sixty-three subjects with 64 aneurysms were enrolled. Most aneurysms were unruptured (60/63 (95.2%)); 49 were bifurcation or terminal (49/64 (76.6%)). Mean aneurysm size was 5.6±1.8 mm (range, 3.6-14.9 mm), and mean neck size was 3.8±1.0 mm (range, 1.9-8.7 mm). Though immediate postoperative adequate occlusion was low (11/63, 18%), adequate occlusion was achieved in 78.0% (46/59) and 79.2% (42/53) of the aneurysms at 12 months and 36 months, respectively. Four patients were retreated by the 12-month follow-up (4/63 (6.3%)) and three patients were retreated by the 36-month follow-up (3/63 (4.8%)). There were two major strokes (2/63 (3.2%)), one minor stroke (1/63 (1.6%)) and three incidents of intracranial hemorrhage in two subjects (2/63 (3.2%)) prior to the 12-month follow-up. There was one instance of mortality (1/63, 1.6%). Morbidity was 0% (0/63) and 1.8% (1/63) at the 12-month and 36-month follow-ups, respectively.

There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of FTRD for resection of upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) lesions. Patients and methods This was an international multicenter retrospective study, including patients who had an endoscopic resection of an upper GIT lesion using the FTRD between January 2017 and February 2019. Results Fifty-six patients from 13 centers were included. The most common lesions were mesenchymal neoplasms (n = 23, 41 %), adenomas (n = 7, 13 %), and hamartomas (n = 6, 11 %). Eighty-four percent of lesions were located in the stomach, and 14 % in the duodenum. The average size of lesions was 14 mm (range 3 to 33 mm). Deployment of the FTRD was technically successful in 93 % of patients (n = 52) leading to complete and partial resection in 43 (77 %) and 9 (16 %) patients, respectively. Overall, the FTRD led to negative histological margins (R0 resection) in 38 (68 %) of patients. A total of 12 (21 %) mild or moderate adverse events (AEs) were reported. Follow-up endoscopy was performed in 31 patients (55 %), on average 88 days after the procedure (IQR 68-138 days). Of these, 30 patients (97 %) did not have any residual or recurrent lesion on endoscopic examination and biopsy, with residual adenoma in one patient (3 %). Conclusions Our results suggest a high technical success rate and an acceptable histologically complete resection rate, with a low risk of AEs and early recurrence for FTRD resection of upper GIT lesions.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Ichkhanian, Yervant; Dawod, Qais; Meining, Alexander; Schmidt, Arthur; Glaser, Nicholas; Vosoughi, Kia; Diehl, David L; Grimm, Ian S; James, Theodore; Templeton, Adam W; Samarasena, Jason B; Chehade, Nabil El Hage; Lee, John G; Chang, Kenneth J; Mizrahi, Meir; Barawi, Mohammed; Irani, Shayan; Friedland, Shai; Korc, Paul; Aadam, Abdul Aziz; Al-Haddad, Mohammad; Kowalski, Thomas E; Smallfield, George; Ginsberg, Gregory G; Fukami, Norio; Lajin, Michael; Kumta, Nikhil A; Tang, Shou-Jiang; Naga, Yehia; Amateau, Stuart K; Kasmin, Franklin; Goetz, Martin; Seewald, Stefan; Kumbhari, Vivek; Ngamruengphong, Saowanee; Mahdev, Srihari; Mukewar, Saurabh; Sampath, Kartik; Carr-Locke, David L; Khashab, Mouen A; Sharaiha, Reem Z",Endoscopy international open,39,1

DESIGN Validation of the EPIC FFQ was done against three 24-hour recalls. Unadjusted and energy adjusted correlations, Bland Altman plots, and weighed kappa statistics were used to assess the agreement between the two methods. SETTING Lebanon. PARTICIPANTS 119 adults (staff and students) at a Lebanese University. RESULTS Good unadjusted and energy-adjusted correlation coefficients were found between data from the two methods which ranged from -0.002 (vitamin A) to 0.337 (carbohydrates) and were all statistically significant except for vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin A, selenium, and niacin. Slight/fair agreement was reported through weighed kappa estimates for unadjusted data ranging from -0.05 (vitamin C) to 0.248 (magnesium) and for energy-adjusted data ranging from -0.034 (vitamin A) to 0.203 (phosphorus). Individuals were categorised into exact and adjacent quartiles with an average of 78% for unadjusted data and 70% for energy-adjusted data, indicating a very good agreement between the EPIC FFQ and the average of the 24-HRs data. The visual inspection of the Bland-Altman plots revealed an over-estimation of energy, carbohydrates, protein, and fat intakes by the FFQ method. CONCLUSION Overall, when all tests were taken into consideration, this study demonstrated an acceptable agreement of the EPIC FFQ with the 24-hour dietary recall method and significantly good correlations between dietary intakes.

In this review, we focus on the significance of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) as a diagnostic or post-therapeutic prognostic marker for various forms of NSCLCs. RECENT FINDINGS The lungs have the highest levels of basal RAGE expression in mammals. The physiologic RAGE in lungs may be involved in adhesion and spreading of AT-1 cells and maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis. However, high level expression of RAGE complicates various diseases including acute lung injury. In NSCLCs, while a number of studies report decreased RAGE expression, inferring a protective role, others suggest that RAGE expression may contribute to NSCLC pathogenesis. Genetic polymorphisms of RAGE are reportedly associated with NSCLC development and complications. RAGE and its polymorphic variants may be useful diagnostic or post-therapeutic prognostic markers of NSCLCs.","Mukherjee, Tapan K; Malik, Parth; Hoidal, John R",Current oncology reports,39,1

Usage of PAPRs by healthcare workers is rapidly increasing; these respirators are often considered the best option in healthcare settings, particularly during public health emergency situations, such as outbreaks of pandemic diseases. At the same time, lack of user training and certain vigorous work activities may lead to a decrease in a respirator's performance. There is a critical need for real-time performance monitoring of respiratory protective devices, including PAPRs. In this effort, a new robust and low-cost real-time performance monitor (RePM) capable of evaluating the protection offered by a PAPR against aerosol particles at a workplace was developed. The new device was evaluated on a manikin and on human subjects against a pair of condensation nuclei counters (P-Trak) used as the reference protection measurement system. The outcome was expressed as a manikin-based protection factor (mPF) and a Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) determined while testing on subjects. For the manikin-based testing, the data points collected by the two methods were plotted against each other; a near-perfect correlation was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.997. This high correlation is particularly remarkable since RePM and condensation particle counter (CPC) measure in different particle size ranges. The data variability increased with increasing mPF. The evaluation on human subjects demonstrated that RePM prototype provided an excellent Sensitivity (96.3% measured on human subjects at a response time of 60 sec) and a Specificity of 100%. The device is believed to be the first of its kind to quantitatively monitor PAPR performance while the wearer is working; it is small, lightweight, and does not interfere with job functions.","Grinshpun, Sergey A; Corey, Jonathan; Yermakov, Michael; Wu, Bingbing; Strickland, Kevin T; Bergman, Michael; Zhuang, Ziqing",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,39,1

The structure and phase-behavior of single and double bilayers of 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphoethanolamine (DPPE) were investigated by specular neutron reflectivity for their viability as biomembrane mimics. Whilst single bilayer samples were found to exhibit stable gel and fluid structures, double bilayers were found to be intrinsically unstable in the fluid phase as a planar structure. A Bragg peak was observed in the reflectivity data at just above the gel-to-fluid transition temperature, indicating the partial rearrangement of the upper bilayer into a repeat stacked structure. The lower bilayer was structurally stable. The structure and phase-behaviour of a double bilayer containing a ratio of 9 : 1 DPPE/cholesterol was also investigated to assess the stabilising effect of cholesterol on the upper bilayer. The presence of cholesterol completely destabilised the upper bilayer, causing it to detach 7 °C below the gel-to-fluid transition temperature of DPPE. It is possible that the cholesterol increases the overall conical shape of DPPE molecule by residing in the chain region of the lipid.","Stidder, Barry; Fragneto, Giovanna; Roser, Stephen J",Soft matter,39,27

Mortality from rhabdomyolysis is approximately 10%. This study aimed to develop an interpretable and generalizable model for early mortality prediction in RM patients. METHOD Retrospective analyses were performed on two electronic medical record databases: the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC- III) database. We extracted data from the first 24h after patient ICU admission. Data from the two datasets were merged for further analysis. The merged datasets were randomly divided, with 70% used for training and 30% for validation. We used the machine learning model XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with the Shapley additive explanation method to conduct early and interpretable predictions of patient mortality. Five typical evaluation indexes were adopted to develop a generalizable model. RESULTS In total, 938 patients with RM were eligible for this analysis. The AUC of the XGBoost model in predicting hospital mortality was 0.871, the sensitivity was 0.885, the specificity was 0.816, the accuracy was 0.915 and the F1 score was 0.624. The XGBoost model performance was superior to that of other models (logistic regression (AUC = 0.862), support vector machine (AUC = 0.843), random forest (AUC = 0.825) and naive Bayesian (AUC = 0.805) and clinical scores (SOFA (AUC = 0.747) and APS III (AUC = 0.721)). CONCLUSIONS Although the XGBoost model is still not great from an absolute performance perspective, it provides better predictive performance than other models for estimating the mortality of patients with RM based on patient characteristics in the first 24h of admission to the ICU.","Liu, Chao; Liu, Xiaoli; Mao, Zhi; Hu, Pan; Li, Xiaoming; Hu, Jie; Hong, Quan; Geng, Xiaodong; Chi, Kun; Zhou, Feihu; Cai, Guangyan; Chen, Xiangmei; Sun, Xuefeng",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,39,23

Low-dose SoluMatrix® diclofenac has been developed to provide efficacy at lower diclofenac doses. A recently published Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SoluMatrix diclofenac 35 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) and thrice daily (t.i.d.) in patients with OA pain treated for 12 weeks. METHODS This Phase III multicenter, open-label study assessed the safety of SoluMatrix diclofenac in patients with OA dosed up to 52 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01510912). The study enrolled 602 chronic NSAID/acetaminophen users, aged ≥40 years with OA of the knee or hip. Patients received SoluMatrix diclofenac 35 mg b.i.d., which could be increased to t.i.d. and subsequently reduced to b.i.d. as needed. Safety assessments included AEs, vital signs, physical examination findings, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory test results. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). RESULTS A total of 601 patients received SoluMatrix diclofenac; 373 of 601 patients (62.1%) received treatment for ≥11 months. The most frequent AEs included upper respiratory tract infection, headache, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and nausea. Serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic AEs were uncommon. A small proportion (99 patients, 16.5%) of patients discontinued participation in the study due to AEs. Clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in Physical Component Summary Scores of the SF-36 were noted at week 12 and were sustained through week 52. Improvements in six of the eight individual physical and mental SF-36 domains were also noted. CONCLUSION SoluMatrix diclofenac treatment for up to 1 year was generally well tolerated in patients with OA pain and associated with improvement in quality of life measures.

The superiority of the design is that the nanofibers can absorb and store visible light energy and maintain the activity under light or dark environment. Moreover, the nanofibers can uninterruptedly release ROS in the absence of an external hydrogen donor, acting as a biocide under all weather conditions. A facile spraying method is proposed to rapidly deploy the functional nanofibers to existing PPE, such as protective suits and masks.

The objective of this study aimed to investigate the impression of copper (Cu)-triggered toxicity on mitochondrial dynamic, oxidative stress, and unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in fundic gland of pigs. Weaned pigs were randomly distributed into three groups, fed with different Cu of 10 mg/kg (control group), 125 mg/kg (group I), and 250 mg/kg (group Ⅱ). The trial persisted for 80 days and the fundic gland tissues were collected for further researches. Moreover, the markers participated to mitochondrial dynamic, UPRmt，and oxidative stress in fundic gland were determined. Results revealed that vacuolar degeneration were observed in the treated groups contrast with control group, and the Cu level was boosted with the increasing intake of Cu. Besides that, the levels of CAT, TRX, H2O2, and G6PDH were reduced in group Ⅰ and group Ⅱ, the mRNA levels of NRF2, HO-1, SOD-1, CAT, SOD-2, GSR, GPX1, GPX4, and TRX in the treated groups were promoted contrast to control group. Furthermore, the protein expression of KEAP1 was dramatically decreased, and the protein expression of NRF2, TRX and HO-1 were markedly enhanced in group Ⅰ and Ⅱ at 80 days. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression levels of MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 down-regulated and protein level of DRP1 was increased with the adding levels of Cu. Nevertheless, the UPRmt-related mRNA levels of CLPP, HTRA-2, CHOP, HSP10, and HSP60 were enhanced dramatically in Cu treatment group compared with control group. In general, our current study demonstrated that excessive absorption of Cu in fundic gland were related with stimulating UPRmt, oxidative stress, and the NRF2 interceded antioxidant defense. These results could afford an updated evidence on molecular theory of Cu-invited toxicity.","Huo, Haihua; Wang, Shuzhou; Bai, Yuman; Liao, Jianzhao; Li, Xinrun; Zhang, Hui; Han, Qingyue; Hu, Lianmei; Pan, Jiaqiang; Li, Ying; Tang, Zhaoxin; Guo, Jianying",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,39,20

I developed this mini special issue amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate recent advancements and opportunities for four main subthemes that support drug discovery and development including prediction of metabolic pathways, translational pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, pharmacogenomics, and trends in bioanalysis. Scientific papers in these areas were covered by investigators from the International Society for the Study of Xenobiotics New Investigator Group and other investigators. Advancement in the predictive capability of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models used to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile of investigational drugs can help offset the cost of unexpected safety and/or efficacy issues during clinical studies. Likewise, extensive application of pharmacogenomics in drug development and clinical care can help direct therapeutic benefits to the appropriate patient population with the overall goal of accelerating drug development and mitigating failed drug cost. Finally, I hope that the scientific contributions in this mini special issue will stimulate practical advancements across all aspects of basic science research that support drug discovery and development to help unlock the door to the next generation of drug discovery and development that features reduced failure rates and accelerated development.","Nwabufo, Chukwunonso K",Drug metabolism reviews,39,1

Although initial reports suggested a high rate of SCI with phased radiofrequency (RF) ablation on use of the pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC), the incidence was subsequently markedly reduced in consequence of procedural modifications in recent studies. We analyzed cerebral microembolization as assessed with transcranial Doppler during phased RF ablation and with two other single-shot AF ablation technologies: the cryoballoon (CB) and the nMARQ™ multipolar irrigated RF ablation system. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 89 patients (mean age: 57, SD: 12years; 62 males) with paroxysmal or persistent AF underwent PVI. Phased RF was used according to the initial protocol in 7 patients (PVAC Group I), with procedural modifications and a newer (14.4) version of the RF generator in 37 patients (PVAC Group II) and with the most recent (version 15.1) generator in 18 patients (PVAC Group III). Ablation was performed with the CB in 13 and with the nMARQ system in 14 patients. The number of microemboli (mean+(SD)) detected in the middle cerebral arteries was 2703 (918) in PVAC Group I, 1087 (542) in PVAC Group II, 719 (469) in PVAC Group III, 1057 (784) with CB and 2166 (1047) with nMARQ (p<0.01). CONCLUSION Significant decreases in MES counts were observed thanks to the procedural modifications and newer RF generator with phased RF. High MES counts comparable to those with the initial phased RF resulted from the use of nMARQ.","Kiss, Alexandra; Nagy-Baló, Edina; Sándorfi, Gábor; Edes, István; Csanádi, Zoltán",International journal of cardiology,39,1

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and nutritional impact of a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG). METHODS This was a retrospective study of 167 patients with EGC in the upper stomach. Of these, 57 patients underwent LAsTG, while 110 patients underwent LATG. Postoperative change in body weight, and serum concentration of albumin (Alb) and total protein (TP) were compared between the LAsTG and LATG groups. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the influence of potential confounding factors. RESULTS Frequency of anastomotic complications was significantly higher in the LATG group (16.3 %) than in the LAsTG group (5.3 %, P = 0.040). Postoperative recovery of body weight at 12 months after surgery was significantly better in the LAsTG group (89.8 ± 1.4 %) than in the LATG group (82.1 ± 1.0 %, P < 0.001). By ANCOVA, adjusted mean differences of Alb and TP at 12 months after surgery between the LAsTG and LATG groups were 0.226 g/dl (95 % CI 0.141-0.312; P < 0.001) and 0.380 g/dl (95 % CI 0.265-0.495; P < 0.001); thus, the surgical procedure was significantly associated with the postoperative Alb and TP levels. CONCLUSIONS LAsTG could be a better choice than LATG for EGC in the upper stomach as a result of improvements in the incidence of anastomotic complications and postoperative nutritional status.","Kosuga, Toshiyuki; Hiki, Naoki; Nunobe, Souya; Noma, Hisashi; Honda, Michitaka; Tanimura, Shinya; Sano, Takeshi; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu",Annals of surgical oncology,39,16

The most prominent and the only stressor with high stress scores was pressure at work, paperwork and multitasking items in particular. After having grouped the SOHs into three groups by type of organisation in which they work, our results singled out SOHs working in public institutions as having the highest levels of stress (average of 143 points). They reported high pressure at work, work overload, and poor relationship with superiors (in terms of communication and support). SOHs working in healthcare centres and private outpatient clinics also reported higher pressure at work, but the latter had no problems with relationship with superiors, while healthcare centre SOHs complained of work underload and advancement constraints. Differences in relationship with superiors, disagreement/conflicts at work and advancement constraints reflect different organisation of work, which was confirmed by later analysis of subgroups.

Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the annual trends, according to age and sex, for the calendar years 2010-19. RESULTS Over the 10 years, screening rates for T2D had doubled while glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) tests for management remained constant. At the end of 2014, the MBS introduced HbA1c screening tests. By 2019, the HbA1c screening rates were three times higher than glucose tolerance tests, which had halved. DISCUSSION A strong adoption of the national screening guidelines introduced in 2015-16 was identified. Limitations in MBS data categorisation, such as no item number specific to fasting glucose or insulin, prevented detailed analysis of other potentially relevant tests that might be used to screen for prediabetes and diabetes.","Tijs, Louise; Hunter, Jennifer; Molodysky, Eugen",Australian journal of general practice,39,1

Median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 35 mo (26-44, 95% confidence interval) and 51 mo (37-65, 95% confidence interval), respectively. Patients with responding BMs (complete remission, partial remission, or minor response) exhibited a trend toward better OS (median OS not reached after 53 mo) when compared to nonresponding patients (39 mo, P = 0.076). Only Ki-67 index (>10%) and chromogranin A level (>600 ng/mL) contributed to regression analysis. CONCLUSION BM of GEP NETs is effectively controlled by PRRT, with long progression-free survival and OS. Poor patient condition and multifocality of BMs do not clearly affect treatment efficacy, possibly encouraging the use of PRRT in advanced bone metastatic disease. Larger studies are needed to assess predictors of treatment outcome in these patients.","Ezziddin, Samer; Sabet, Amir; Heinemann, Florian; Yong-Hing, Charlotte J; Ahmadzadehfar, Hojjat; Guhlke, Stefan; Höller, Tobias; Willinek, Winfried; Boy, Christian; Biersack, Hans-Jürgen","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",39,29

The disease causes a range of respiratory illnesses, which are fatal. The COVID-19 disease has spread globally and has significantly impacted the health delivery systems, travel regulations, and economic activities and has posed and upsurge of responsibilities for the frontline healthcare workers. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, it has typically caused complications which include pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction together with renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of date, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 though there are ongoing research studies to formulate a treatment. COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the risk of infection is higher for patients with immunesuppressed patients than regular patients. The immunesuppressed conditions include cancer, HIV, and patients with solid organ transplants (SOT). This paper aims to review the risk and impact of COVID-19 on immunesuppressed patients, with a focus on cancer, HIV, and patients with SOT and the essence of special parameters for their care and management. Despite the fatal effects of this global pandemic, the findings of this study indicate the high risk which immunosuppressed patients have to contract the disease; thus, the governments and health delivery systems have to offer them extra support and treatment.","Mohammed, Ali Haider; Blebil, Ali; Dujaili, Juman; Rasool-Hassan, Bassam A",AIDS reviews,39,8

Group 1 underwent a two-layer handsewn jejunocecal side-to-side anastomosis (HS); Group 2 received a stapled jejunocecal side-to-side anastomosis (GIA). Each group was divided into two subgroups (HS80 and HS100, GIA80 and GIA100). Specimens were inflated and CT scanned. The stomal/jejunal area ratio and blind end pouch volume/area were measured and compared. Effective length of the stoma was measured and compared with the initial length. Stomal/jejunal area ratio was 1.1 for both 80 techniques, 1.6 for the GIA100, and 1.9 for the HS100 technique. Both HS and GIA techniques produced a blind end pouch and exhibited a mean increase of the final stomal length ranging from 6 to 11% greater than the original stomal length. All techniques will exhibit a length increase of the final stomal length compared to the intended stomal length, with a consequent increase in stomal area. Stapled techniques consistently produced a large distal blind end pouch. Length of a jejunocecal anastomosis should be selected in accordance with the diameter of afferent jejunum, and the 80 mm stomal length could be deemed sufficient in horses.","Giusto, Gessica; Iotti, Bryan; Sammartano, Federica; Valazza, Alberto; Gandini, Marco",Journal of veterinary medicine,39,1

METHODS AND RESULTS A 72-year-old male patient presented with dyspnoea (NYHA III) in part due to severe aortic stenosis. Concomitant diseases were severe peripheral artery disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD IV) and renal insufficiency, such that neither a transfemoral nor a transapical approach was considered favourable. An eSheath was introduced into the abdominal aorta via the femoral vein and the inferior vena cava. TAVI was then performed according to standard procedures. After TAVI, the veno-arterial junction was occluded with a 6 mm AMPLATZER Muscular VSD Occluder (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) using an 8.5 Fr Agilis™ sheath (St. Jude Medical) inside the TAVI sheath. Aortography showed no retroperitoneal accumulation of contrast media. The femoral vein access site was closed using two prepositioned sutures (ProGlide; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A CT scan the following day showed no retroperitoneal haemorrhage.

Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, recombination of an apha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely.

Peptic ulcers, caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin (LDA), are the most common cause. Although the incidence and mortality associated with NVUGIB have been decreasing owing to considerable advances in the prevention and management of NVUGIB over the past 20 years, it remains a common clinical problem with an annual incidence of ∼67 per 100,000 individuals in the United States in 2012. NVUGIB is a medical emergency, and mortality is in the range ∼1-5%. After resuscitation and initial assessment, early (within 24 hours) diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy together with intragastric pH control with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) form the basis of treatment. With a growing ageing population treated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications, the clinical management of NVUGIB is complex as the risk between gastrointestinal bleeding events and adverse cardiovascular events needs to be balanced. The best clinical approach includes identification of risk factors and prevention of bleeding; available strategies include continuous treatment with PPIs or H. pylori eradication in those at increased risk of developing NVUGIB. Treatment with PPIs and/or use of cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs should be implemented in those patients at risk of NVUGIB who need NSAIDs and/or LDA.","Lanas, Angel; Dumonceau, Jean-Marc; Hunt, Richard H; Fujishiro, Mitsuhiro; Scheiman, James M; Gralnek, Ian M; Campbell, Helen E; Rostom, Alaa; Villanueva, Càndid; Sung, Joseph J Y",Nature reviews.

Solution nuclear magnetic resonance experiments are consistent with a 5'-uYNMG(U)a or uCUYG(U)a tetraloop conformation characterized by an anti-C47-syn-G50 base-pairing interaction, with U51 flipped out into solution and G50 stacked on A52. Previous studies showed that U48C and U48A substitutions in MHV SL2 were lethal, while a U48G substitution was viable. Here, we characterize viruses harboring all remaining single-nucleotide substitutions in the pentaloop of MHV SL2 and also investigate the degree to which the sequence context of key pentaloop point mutations influences the MHV replication phenotype. U49 or U51 substitution mutants all are viable; C47 substitution mutants also are viable but produce slightly smaller plaques than wild-type virus. In contrast, G50A and G50C viruses are severely crippled and form much smaller plaques. Virus could not be recovered from G50U-containing mutants; rather, only true wild-type revertants or a virus, G50U/C47A, containing a second site mutation were recovered. These functional data suggest that the Watson-Crick edges of C47 and G50 (or A47 and U50 in the G50U/C47A mutant) are in close enough proximity to a hydrogen bond with U51 flipped out of the hairpin. Remarkably, increasing the helical stem stability rescues the previously lethal mutants U48C and G50U. These studies suggest that SL2 functions as an important, but rather plastic, structural element in stimulating subgenomic RNA synthesis in coronaviruses.","Liu, Pinghua; Li, Lichun; Keane, Sarah C; Yang, Dong; Leibowitz, Julian L; Giedroc, David P",Journal of virology,39,1

Such a sell-off may continue for more than a day, leading to a significant crash in the stock price or, more specifically, an extreme event (EE). In this paper, Hilbert-Huang transformation and a structural break analysis (SBA) have been applied to identify and characterize an EE in the stock market due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hilbert spectrum shows a maximum energy concentration at the time of an EE, and hence, it is useful to identify such an event. The EE's significant energy concentration is more than four times the standard deviation above the mean energy of the normal fluctuation of stock prices. A statistical significance test for the intrinsic mode functions is applied, and the test found that the signal is not noisy. The degree of nonstationarity test shows that the indices and stock prices are nonstationary. We identify the time of influence of the EE on the stock price by using SBA. Furthermore, we have identified the time scale ( τ) of the shock and recovery of the stock price during the EE using the intrinsic mode function obtained from the empirical mode decomposition technique. The quality stocks with V-shape recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic have definite τ of shock and recovery, whereas the stressed stocks with L-shape recovery have no definite τ. The identification of τ of shock and recovery during an EE will help investors to differentiate between quality and stressed stocks.

We previously demonstrated that apoD protects against neuropathology by controlling the level of peroxidated lipids. Here, we further investigated the biological function of apoD in a mouse model of acute encephalitis. Our results show that apoD transcript and protein are upregulated during acute encephalitis induced by the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection. The apoD upregulation coincides with glial activation, and its expression returns to normal levels when the virus is cleared, concomitantly to a resolved glial reactivity. In addition, the overexpression of human apoD in the neurons of Thy-1/ApoD transgenic mice results in a threefold increase of the number of mice surviving to HCoV-OC43 infection. This increased survival rate is correlated with an upregulated glial activation associated with a limited innate immune response (cytokines, chemokines) and T-cell infiltration into infected brains. Moreover, the protection seems to be associated with a restricted phospholipase A2 activity. These data reveal a role for apoD in the regulation of inflammation and suggest that it protects from HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis, most likely through the phospholipase A2 signaling pathways.","Do Carmo, Sonia; Jacomy, Hélène; Talbot, Pierre J; Rassart, Eric",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,39,17

In South Africa (SA), intensive care is faced with the challenge of resource scarcity as well as an increasing demand for intensive care unit (ICU) services. ICU services are expensive, and practitioners in low- to middle-income countries experience daily the consequences of limited resources. Critically limited resources necessitate that rationing and triage (prioritisation) decisions are frequently necessary in SA, particularly in the publicly funded health sector. Purpose. The purpose of this consensus statement is to examine key questions that arise when considering the status of ICU resources in SA, and more specifically ICU admission, rationing and triage decisions. The accompanying guideline in this issue is intended to guide frontline triage policy and ensure the best utilisation of intensive care in SA, while maintaining a fair distribution of available resources. Fair and efficient triage is important to ensure the ongoing provision of high-quality care to adult patients referred for intensive care. Recommendations. In response to 14 key questions developed using a modified Delphi technique, 29 recommendations were formulated and graded using an adapted GRADE score. The 14 key questions addressed the status of the provision of ICU services in SA, the degree of resource restriction, the efficiency of resource management, the need for triage, and how triage could be most justly implemented. Important recommendations included the need to formally recognise and accurately quantify the provision of ICU services in SA by national audit; actively seek additional resources from governmental bodies; consider methods to maximise the efficiency of ICU care; evaluate lower level of care alternatives; develop a triage guideline to assist policy-makers and frontline practitioners to implement triage decisions in an efficient and fair way; measure and audit the consequence of triage; and promote research to improve the accuracy and consistency of triage decisions. The consensus document and guideline should be reviewed and revised appropriately within 5 years. Conclusion. In recognition of the absolute need to limit patient access to ICU because of the lack of sufficient intensive care resources in public hospitals, recommendations and a guideline have been developed to guide policy-making and assist frontline triage decision-making in SA. These documents are not a complete plan for quality practice but rather the beginning of a long-term initiative to engage clinicians, the public and administrators in appropriate.","Joynt, G M; Gopalan, D P; Argent, A A; Chetty, S; Wise, R; Lai, V K W; Hodgson, E; Lee, A; Joubert, I; Mokgokong, S; Tshukutsoane, S; Richards, G A; Menezes, C; Mathivha, R L; Espen, B; Levy, B; Asante, K; Paruk, F",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,39,1

METHODS A single incision of about 4-5 cm long was performed at the 5th intercostal space along the anterior axillary line. No additional skin incisions were made. A flexible videoscope and multiple VATS instruments were simultaneously inserted into the uniport. Pulmonary lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. Verbal pain scores were registered using the visual analog scale from 0 to 10 at the first post-operative day. RESULTS No post-operative complications or hospital mortality were recorded. Mean operative time was 112.6 min (range 70-200) and mean postoperative hospital stay 3.2 days (range 2-6). Mean pain score was 0.5 (range 0-2).

Local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) at any organ, and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method from the time of ablation and compared between patients with (n = 49) and without (n = 33) prior hepatectomy. Cox regression models were used to identify LTPFS predictors. RESULTS Median overall follow-up period was 28 months (range, 4.5-132 months). Three-year actuarial LTPFS (patient level: 73% vs 34%, P < .001) was significantly higher in patients with than without prior hepatectomy, respectively. Similarly, 3-year RFS (23% vs 9.1%, P = .026) and OS (78% vs 48%, P = .003) were improved in patients with prior hepatectomy. At multivariate analysis, predictors of worse LTPFS were: no prior hepatectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-5.45; P = .045), minimal ablation margin < 5 mm (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.18-4.87; P = .016), and RAS-mutant tumor (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.18-5.94; P = .019).

Expert histological review of LGD is advised, but limited data are available on its clinical value. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the value of an expert pathology panel organised in the Dutch Barrett's Advisory Committee (BAC) by investigating the incidence rates of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) after expert histological review of LGD. DESIGN We included all BO cases referred to the BAC for histological review of LGD diagnosed between 2000 and 2011. The diagnosis of the expert panel was related to the histological outcome during endoscopic follow-up. Primary endpoint was development of HGD or OAC. RESULTS 293 LGD patients (76% men; mean 63 years±11.9) were included. Following histological review, 73% was downstaged to non-dysplastic BO (NDBO) or indefinite for dysplasia (IND). In 27% the initial LGD diagnosis was confirmed. Endoscopic follow-up was performed in 264 patients (90%) with a median follow-up of 39 months (IQR 16-72). For confirmed LGD, the risk of HGD/OAC was 9.1% per patient-year. Patients downstaged to NDBO or IND had a malignant progression risk of 0.6% and 0.9% per patient-year, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Confirmed LGD in BO has a markedly increased risk of malignant progression. However, the vast majority of patients with community LGD will be downstaged after expert review and have a low progression risk. Therefore, all BO patients with LGD should undergo expert histological review of the diagnosis for adequate risk stratification.","Duits, Lucas C; Phoa, K Nadine; Curvers, Wouter L; Ten Kate, Fiebo J W; Meijer, Gerrit A; Seldenrijk, Cees A; Offerhaus, G Johan; Visser, Mike; Meijer, Sybren L; Krishnadath, Kausilia K; Tijssen, Jan G P; Mallant-Hent, Rosalie C; Bergman, Jacques J G H M",Gut,39,1

However, the effect of the dura and blood vessel on recording signal quality is not understood and may be a critical factor impacting implementation of a closed-loop endovascular neuromodulation system. The present work compares the performance and recording signal quality of a minimally-invasive endovascular neural interface with conventional subdural and epidural interfaces. We compared bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution of recorded cortical signals using subdural, epidural and endovascular arrays four weeks after implantation in sheep. We show that the quality of the signals (bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio) of the endovascular neural interface is not significantly different from conventional neural sensors. However, the spatial resolution depends on the array location and the frequency of recording. We also show that there is a direct correlation between the signal-noise-ratio and classification accuracy, and that decoding accuracy is comparable between electrode arrays. These results support the consideration for use of an endovascular neural interface in a clinical trial of a novel closed-loop neuromodulation technology.","John, Sam E; Opie, Nicholas L; Wong, Yan T; Rind, Gil S; Ronayne, Stephen M; Gerboni, Giulia; Bauquier, Sebastien H; O'Brien, Terence J; May, Clive N; Grayden, David B; Oxley, Thomas J",Scientific reports,39,31

However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large-and will undoubtedly grow many fold-placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization, making it possible to complete the placements under the constraints of real-time contact tracing. Thus, our method addresses an important need for maintaining a fully updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the University of California Santa Cruz SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2 specifically for laboratories worldwide.","Turakhia, Yatish; Thornlow, Bryan; Hinrichs, Angie S; De Maio, Nicola; Gozashti, Landen; Lanfear, Robert; Haussler, David; Corbett-Detig, Russell",Nature genetics,39,1

Moreover, we studied whether reversion reduced cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS From the population-based KORA S4/F4/FF4 cohort study conducted in Southern Germany, we utilized data from the second and third visit to the study center (median follow-up 6.5 years). We used two overlapping data sets, one with 563 persons with HbA1c<6.5% (mean age 69 years, 51.5% men), one with 510 persons with glucose-based prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance. We calculated proportions of reversion, and estimated adjusted relative risks for the association between initial BMI/WC and change of BMI/WC, respectively, and reversion (and persistence of normoglycaemia, respectively). We estimated 10-year cardiovascular risks using the Framingham 2008 score. Overall, 27.3% of persons with HbA1c-defined prediabetes and 9.2% of persons with glucose-based prediabetes returned to normoglycaemia during follow-up. Lower initial BMI/WC and reduction of BMI/WC were associated with larger probabilities of returning to normoglycaemia (e.g., for HbA1c 5.7-6.4%, RR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.09-1.41) per 1 kg/m2 decline of BMI). Moreover, reduction of BMI/WC increased probabilities of maintaining normoglycaemia (e.g., for glucose-based prediabetes, RR = 1.09 (1.02-1.16) per 1 kg/m2 decline of BMI). 10-year cardiovascular risk was 5.6 (1.7-9.6) percentage points lower after reversion from glucose-based prediabetes to normoglycaemia. CONCLUSION In older adults, even moderate weight reduction contributes to reversion from prediabetes to normoglycaemia and to maintaining normoglycaemia.","Kowall, Bernd; Rathmann, Wolfgang; Kuss, Oliver; Herder, Christian; Roden, Michael; Stang, Andreas; Huth, Cornelia; Thorand, Barbara; Meisinger, Christa; Peters, Annette","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",39,1

The effects of the KOR agonist U50,488 and the KOR antagonist aticaprant were assessed on nest building behavior, an ethologically relevant indicator of overall well-being and affect, in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice. Females required a higher dose of U50,488 to suppress nesting, and a higher dose of aticaprant to restore U50,488-induced impairment of nesting. Females also required a higher dose of aticaprant to decrease immobility scores in the forced swim test. Pretreatment with the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen at a dose which blocked estrogen receptors, augmented the effect of U50,488 on nesting in female mice, suggesting that estrogen receptors play a key role in attenuating the effects of KOR ligands in female mice. Together, these results suggest that females are less sensitive to KOR mediation, requiring a higher dose to achieve comparable results to males. This behavioral sensitivity, as measured by nesting, may be mediated by estrogen receptors. Together these studies highlight the importance of comparing sex differences in response to KOR regulation on behaviors related to affective states.","Jacobson, Moriah L; Wulf, Hildegard A; Tsuda, Mumeko C; Browne, Caroline A; Lucki, Irwin",Neuropharmacology,39,19

We report the single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) learning experience of 2 hepatobiliary surgeons and the factors that could influence the learning curve of SILC. Methods. Patients who underwent SILC by Surgeons A and B were studied retrospectively. Operating time, conversion rate, reason for conversion, identity of first assistants, and their experience with previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) were analysed. CUSUM analysis is used to identify learning curve. Results. Hundred and nineteen SILC cases were performed by Surgeons A and B, respectively. Eight cases required additional port. In CUSUM analysis, most conversion occurred during the first 19 cases. Operating time was significantly lower (62.5 versus 90.6 min, P = 0.04) after the learning curve has been overcome. Operating time decreases as the experience increases, especially Surgeon B. Most conversions are due to adhesion at Calot's triangle. Acute cholecystitis, patients' BMI, and previous surgery do not seem to influence conversion rate. Mean operating times of cases assisted by first assistant with and without LC experience were 48 and 74 minutes, respectively (P = 0.004). Conclusion. Nineteen cases are needed to overcome the learning curve of SILC. Team work, assistant with CLC experience, and appropriate equipment and technique are the important factors in performing SILC.","Tay, Chee Wei; Shen, Liang; Hartman, Mikael; Iyer, Shridhar Ganpathi; Madhavan, Krishnakumar; Chang, Stephen Kin Yong",Minimally invasive surgery,39,7

The airborne by-products may have potential health implications. METHODS We developed a simple way to use de conventional surgical evacuator coupled with de electrosurgical pen attached to a 14G bladder catheter for open surgery. It was used in ten prospective patients with breast cancer. RESULTS We notice a high reduction in surgical smoke during all breast surgery. A questionnaire was used for all participants of the surgery to answer the impression that they had about the device. The subjective impression was that the surgical smoke in contact whit the surgical team was reduced by more than 95%. CONCLUSIONS Surgical smoke is the gaseous by-product produced by heat-generating devices in various surgical procedures. Surgical smoke may contain chemicals particles, bacteria, and viruses that are harmful and increase the risk of infection for surgeons and all the team in the operation room due to long term exposure of smoke mainly in coronavirus disease 2019 age.

We designed the study to compare the effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil in 50 % of patients (EC50) for successful insertion of the i-gel second-generation supraglottic airway device with that for laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion during target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. METHODS Forty-one female patients were randomized to the i-gel group (n = 20) or the LMA group (n = 21). Anesthesia was induced with propofol Ce of 5 μg/ml and the predetermined remifentanil Ce, and the i-gel or LMA was inserted 5 min later. The remifentanil Ce was estimated by modified Dixon's up-and-down method (initial concentration: 3.0 ng/ml, step size: 0.5 ng/ml). The patient's response to device insertion was classified as either ""success (no movement)"" or ""failure (movement)"". RESULTS Using the Dixon's up-and-down method, EC50 of remifentanil Ce for the i-gel (1.58 ± 0.41 ng/ml) was significantly lower than that for LMA (2.25 ± 0.55 ng/ml) (p = 0.038). Using isotonic regression, EC50 (83 % CI) of remifentanil in the i-gel group [1.50 (1.37-1.80) ng/ml] was statistically lower than that in the LMA group [2.00 (1.82-2.34) ng/ml]. EC95 (95 % CI) of remifentanil in the i-gel group [2.38 (1.48-2.50) ng/ml] was statistically lower than that in the LMA group [3.35 (2.58-3.48) ng/ml].

This randomised controlled trial evaluated the outcomes of preperitoneal closed-system suction drainage in laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernioplasty for inguinal hernia. METHODS Ninety patients aged 18-80 years who presented to our hospital between May 2016 and February 2017 with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomised into the preperitoneal drain and no-drain groups. The primary outcome was seroma size on postoperative day 6. Secondary outcomes included clinical seroma formation and seroma size on day 1, day 6, 1 and 7 months postoperatively, length of postoperative stay, pain score, and recurrence. RESULTS There was no significant difference in age, sex, co-morbidities, hernia side, mean hernia size, operating time, fixation adjuncts, or postoperative stay. The overall incidence of clinical seroma formation was 25.6% on postoperative day 1, 60.3% on postoperative day 6, 13.2% 1 month and 0% 7 months postoperatively. The mean drain output was 57.9 ml. The drain group had significantly fewer patients with seroma on day 1 (6 vs 14, p = 0.022) and day 6 (17 vs 30, p = 0.000), and a smaller mean seroma size on days 1 and 6 (p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis showed that sac ligation versus reduction, peritoneal perforation, and fixation adjuncts had no significant effects on seroma formation or size. There is a trend of lower early post-operation VAS score and more urinary retention in drain group was observed but not reaching statistical significance. No differences in postoperative pain score or complications were observed at 1 and 7 months' post operation. CONCLUSIONS Preperitoneal drainage for 23 h after laparoscopic TEP hernioplasty for inguinal hernia can effectively decrease seroma formation in the early postoperative period, and potentially improving postoperative pain. The benefit is short-term and no significant difference was demonstrated after 1-month post operations. This tradition technique applied to novel operative repair of inguinal hernia is safe and feasible with no significant morbidity demonstrated. Preperitoneal drainage after TEP can be considered as an option to improve patient satisfactions and recovery in selected patient group for maximal benefit, especially for those with prolonged operation which may associate with higher chance of seroma formation.","Fan, J K M; Liu, J; Chen, K; Yang, X; Xu, X; Choi, H K; Chan, F S Y; Chiu, K W H; Lo, C M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,39,1

Over a decade ago, the first microinvasive glaucoma surgical (MIGS) procedures were introduced. Since then, a number of these novel intraocular pressure controlling surgical options have been approved worldwide. Governing bodies and health care administration often utilize CPGs when considering funding for newer technologies. This highlights the importance of well-written, accurate, and up-to-date CPGs in the rapidly evolving field of MIGS. If CPGs are unable to fill this role, their use in treatment decision-making is doing a disservice to patients, who will be denied currently available and potentially superior care. To determine the overall value of a CPG, the methodological quality with which it was developed, in addition to the current relevance and appropriateness of its recommendations, should be evaluated. The objective of the present study was to assess the methodological quality of currently available international glaucoma CPGs, as well as their coverage of MIGS as a surrogate marker of relevance and appropriateness to policy-makers and ophthalmologists alike. MATERIALS AND METHODS To identify potentially relevant CPGs, a predefined search strategy was used to search the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and Web of Science. All CPGs related to adult glaucoma and published in English were included. CPG methodological quality was assessed by 3 individuals using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Studies were then assessed for coverage of MIGS devices and procedures. RESULTS Search strategy and subsequent screening identified 11 CPGs for analysis. Eight were of high quality according to the AGREE II criteria. Three included basic information on MIGS, but none provided specific recommendations regarding their indications or which patient populations would benefit most. CONCLUSIONS Many international glaucoma CPGs are of high methodological quality. However, coverage of MIGS is sparse, nonspecific and in many instances, absent. This causes CPGs to be a suboptimal source in guiding physicians and health policy-makers in areas characterized by novel and/or rapidly evolving technologies. Mechanisms to incorporate updated evidence in CPGs would have to be considered before they can be used as a source of contemporary clinical decision-making.","Michaelov, Evan; Armstrong, James J; Nguyen, Mary; Instrum, Bridget; Lam, Tracey; Denstedt, James; Hutnik, Cindy M L",Journal of glaucoma,39,1

It provides anxiety and relief, facilitates procedures and nursing tasks, and minimizes intolerance of mechanical ventilation. Alpha-2 agonists such as dexmedetomidine and clonidine have been shown to be an effective alternative in the general critical care population by reducing duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), as compared to traditional sedative agents such as propofol or benzodiazepines. However, there is a paucity of literature detailing their utility and safety in neurocritical care, a population that presents unique considerations for management of global and cerebral hemodynamics, agitation, and facilitation of neurological assessments. The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of alpha-2 agonists for non-procedural sedation in mechanically ventilated brain-injured patients. METHODS We will search the Embase and MEDLINE databases for all randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies examining neurocritically ill adult patients aged 18 years and older who are on mechanical ventilation and receiving alpha-2 agonists for non-procedural sedation. Primary outcomes of interest include effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Secondary outcomes include adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation, 30-day mortality, ICU length of stay, incidence of delirium, and quality of sedation. Continuous outcomes will be presented as means and mean differences and discrete counting events will be presented as event rates. Pre-defined criteria for heterogeneity are provided for determination of pooling eligibility. Where appropriate, we will pool estimates for individual outcomes. Planned subgroup analyses include specific alpha-2 agonist agent, study design, clinical diagnosis, dosing regimen, and use of adjunctive agents. Quality of evidence for the recommendation will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach where appropriate. DISCUSSION This systematic review will summarize the evidence on the efficacy and safety for the use of alpha-2 agonists as sedative agents in the neurocritical care population.

The aim was to estimate hospitalization rates among exposed civilians who later immigrated to Israel. We conducted a historical follow-up study, among persons exposed to Chernobyl (n = 1128) using linked hospitalization records from Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC), compared with immigrants from other areas of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) (n = 11,574), immigrants not from FSU (n = 11,742) and native-born Israelis (n = 8351), matched on age and gender (N = 32,795). Hospitalizations for specific ICD-10 coded diagnostic groups were analyzed by exposure and comparison groups by gender and age at accident. In addition, the rate of hospitalization, and the duration of hospital days and the number of hospitalizations for these selected diagnostic groups was also calculated. Hospitalizations for specific ICD-10 coded diagnostic groups and for any hospitalization in these diagnostic groups in general were analyzed by exposure and comparison groups and by covariates (gender and age at accident). The rate of any hospitalization for the selected diagnostic groups was elevated in the low exposure Chernobyl group (51.1%), which was significantly higher than the immigrant (41.6%) and the Israel-born comparison group (35.1%) (p < .01) but did not differ from either the high exposure group (46.9%) or the FSU comparison group (46.4%), according to the post-hoc tests. The total number of hospitalizations in the low exposure Chernobyl group (2.35) differed from the immigrant (1.73) and Israel comparison group (1.26) (p < .01) but did not differ from the FSU comparison group (1.73) or the high exposure group (2.10). Low exposure women showed higher rates of circulatory hospitalizations (33.8%) compared to immigrants (22.8%) and Israeli born (16.5%), while high exposure women (27.5%) only differed from Israelis (p < .01). Neither exposure group differed from FSU immigrant women on the rate of circulatory hospitalizations. Post-hoc tests showed that among women in the low exposure group, there was a significant difference in rate of hospitalizations for neoplasms (28.6%) compared to the three comparison groups; FSU (18.6%), immigrants (15.7%) and Israel (13.1) (p < .01). Those among the low exposure group who were over the age of 20 at the time of the accident showed the higher rates of circulatory (51.2%) and neoplasm hospitalizations (33.3%), compared to the other immigrant groups (p < .01). When controlling for both age at accident and gender, hospitalizations for neoplasms were higher among Chernobyl-exposed populations (RR = 1.65, RR = 1.77 for high and low-exposure groups, respectively) compared to other FSU immigrants (RR = 1.31) other immigrants (RR = 1.11) and Israeli born (RR = 1.0) after controlling for gender and age at accident. High RRs attributable to Chernobyl exposure were also found for circulatory diseases compared to other immigrants and Israeli born (RRs = 1.50, 1.47 for high and low exposure compared to 1.11. and 1.0, other immigrants and Israeli born, respectively). Endocrine problems and disorders of the eye also showed elevated RR compared to the immigrant comparison groups. Respiratory and mental disorders did not show any consistent association with Chernobyl exposure. The findings support unique Chernobyl morbidity associations only in some diagnostic groups, particularly for low exposure women. General immigration effects on hospitalizations compared to the Israeli born population were found on all diagnostic groups. There is a need to improve the services and medical follow-up for these Chernobyl exposed groups in specific diagnostic groups.","Cwikel, Julie; Sheiner, Eyal; Sergienko, Ruslan; Slusky, Danna; Quastel, Michael",Journal of immigrant and minority health,39,1

We then analyzed FOAM's comprehensiveness by describing over- and underrepresentation among these topics and subtopics. Methods First, we searched for FOAM resources based on the most recent 12 months of relevant content for each organ system from the top 50 Social Media Index sites. Next, we classified all 898 posts into its related topics or subtopics per the American Board of Emergency Medicine's Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine. Finally, we analyzed how comprehensively FOAM covered each organ system and the frequency of posts that covered each organ system subtopic as well as identified the subtopics with the most frequent coverage. Results The search yielded 898 FOAM posts, of which cardiology and neurology were significantly overrepresented and psychobehavioral; obstetrics and gynecology; and head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat were significantly underrepresented. Among subtopics, acute coronary syndrome had the highest subtopic coverage consisting of 55.5% of all cardiology content. Other highly represented subtopics include renal colic; diabetic ketoacidosis; sepsis; and stroke with 39, 40, 40, and 71% of each of their topic's content, respectively. Conclusions Although residents and programs are frequently incorporating FOAM into the educational curriculum, these materials seem to lack comprehensiveness.

OBJECTIVES To examine psychometric properties, including internal consistency, construct validity, and test-retest reliability, of the Thai version of the International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Quality of Life Basic Data Set (QoL-BDS). SETTING Outpatient rehabilitation clinic, urodynamic clinic, and rehabilitation ward at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital. METHODS Participants were assigned to complete two assessment tools, the Thai version of QoL-BDS which consisted of three single items on satisfaction with life as a whole, physical health and psychological health, and the Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) completed by face to face interview. After 2 weeks, the participants were evaluated the QoL-BDS again via telephone interviewing to assess test-retest reliability. RESULTS One hundred and thirty people with spinal cord injury (SCI) were included in the study. Of all participants, 103 people had a traumatic SCI. The mean (SD) age was 43.0 (13.1) years and the median (IQR) time after SCI was 7.5 (1-14) years. The Thai version of QoL-BDS had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89), fair to good construct validity (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.43-0.57, p < 0.01) and good to excellent test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.73-0.86). CONCLUSIONS The Thai version of QoL-BDS had acceptable psychometric properties.

Carrying out such war, some governments try to redefine the distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere in their people's lives. Even sexual life, the most private sphere in people's lives, may be exposed to various forms of supervision and control from their states in the name of the national ""war effort."" In particular, the government in war does not hesitate to scrutinize the most private sphere of their people's lives when certain aspects of their lives do considerable harm to ""war effort"" or ""national efficiency."" The British society in the First World War intensively experienced some kind of ""social control"" due to the increasing spread of venereal disease (VD) both among civilians and troops. Like British society as a whole, the British army, who had primary responsibility to fight the war in the field, had to fight another hard battle against an enemy within VD, throughout the war. During the First World War, VD caused 416,891 hospital admissions among British and Dominion troops. Excluding readmissions for relapses, approximately five percent of all the men who served in Britain's armies in the course of the war became infected. During the war, at least a division was constantly out of action because so many troops had to treat VD. This disease caused a huge drain on the British army's human and material resources and consequently undermined, to a considerable extent, its military efficiency. However, a series of measures of the British Army to improve the high rate of infection among their troops have been simply considered ineffective by both contemporaries and subsequent researchers. This article aims to provide a more balanced perspective on the efforts of the British Army to fight VD during the war and reconsider the existing understandings in regard to their general effectiveness.

Traditional antibiotic recommendations have been a first-generation cephalosporin for Gustilo Type-I and Type-II open fractures, with the addition of an aminoglycoside for Type-III fractures and penicillin for soil contamination. However, concerns over changing bacterial patterns and the side effects of aminoglycosides have led to interest in other regimens. The purpose of the present study was to describe the adherence to current prophylactic antibiotic guidelines. METHODS We evaluated the antibiotic-prescribing practices of 24 centers in the U.S. and Canada that were participating in 2 randomized controlled trials of skin-preparation solutions for open fractures. A total of 1,234 patients were evaluated. RESULTS All patients received antibiotics on the day of admission. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic regimen was cefazolin monotherapy (53.6%). Among patients with Type-I and Type-II fractures, there was 61.1% compliance with cefazolin monotherapy. In contrast, only 17.2% of patients with Type-III fractures received the recommended cefazolin and aminoglycoside therapy, with an additional 6.7% receiving piperacillin/tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS There is moderate adherence to the traditional antibiotic treatment guidelines for Gustilo Type-I and Type-II fractures and low adherence for Type-III fractures. Given the divergence between current practice patterns and prior recommendations, high-quality studies are needed to determine the most appropriate prophylactic protocol.","Lin, Carol A; O'Hara, Nathan N; Sprague, Sheila; O'Toole, Robert V; Joshi, Manjari; Harris, Anthony D; Warner, Stephen J; Johal, Herman; Natoli, Roman M; Hagen, Jennifer E; Jeray, Kyle J; Fowler, Justin T; Phelps, Kevin D; Pilson, Holly T; Gitajn, I Leah; Bhandari, Mohit; Slobogean, Gerard P",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

METHODS This study presents findings from a reanalysis of a 7-center trial conducted in Ontario, Canada, included 209 adults with chronic knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to receive 28 days of therapy with an active solution (1.5% w/w diclofenac sodium in dimethyl sulfoxide) or 1 of 2 control solutions containing no diclofenac. The key outcome measures used in the current analyses were administered throughout the study period and assessed pain intensity, perceived activity limitations, and a composite score measuring both domains. A structural cross-lagged regression approach was used to determine the reciprocal effects of pain and activity limitations over time. RESULTS In both study groups, participants (N=209) experienced significant reductions in mean pain intensity and activity limitations from baseline to weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 (P<0.001 for both variables). Similarly, there were significant reductions in the activity limitations outcome at weeks 1 and 4 for the active versus control group (P<0.05 for both). Higher levels of perceived activity limitations predicted more future pain at all time points. Cross-lagged associations in which pain predicted subsequent perceived activity limitations were not significant at any time point. All 3 outcome measures evidenced similar responsiveness to the treatment. CONCLUSION These analyses showed that a decrease in activity limitations results in a decrease in pain intensity. However, changes in pain intensity had no effect on subsequent activity limitations in the study sample. None of the 3 outcome variables emerged as being more responsive to treatment than the others.","Jensen, Mark P; Molton, Ivan R",The Clinical journal of pain,39,10

We have recently shown that HIV-1 Tat induces expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a characteristic of HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system. We have also shown that the Tat-induced GFAP expression in astrocytes is regulated by p300 and that deletion of the early growth response 1 (Egr-1) cis-transacting element within the p300 promoter abolishes Tat-induced GFAP expression. In this study, we further examined the relationship between Tat and Egr-1 in astrocytes. We found increased Egr-1 protein expression in Tat-expressing human astrocytoma cells and mouse primary astrocytes. Using the Egr-1 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter gene assay and the site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that Tat increased Egr-1 expression by transactivating the Egr-1 promoter and involving specific serum response elements within the promoter. Consistent with these data, we showed that Tat transactivation of the Egr-1 promoter was abrogated when astrocytes were cultured in serum-reduced media. Taken together, these results reveal that Tat directly transactivates Egr-1 expression and suggest that Tat interaction with Egr-1 is probably one of the very upstream molecular events that initiate Tat-induced astrocyte dysfunction and subsequent Tat neurotoxicity.","Fan, Yan; Zou, Wei; Green, Linden A; Kim, Byung Oh; He, Johnny J",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,39,31

The Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) score has been suggested to be associated with accelerated brain atrophy in middle-aged subjects but the regional specificity of atrophic areas remains to be elucidated. METHODS 3T T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of 160 cognitively healthy middle-aged participants (mean age = 52) in the PREVENT-Dementia cohort, from baseline and from follow-up after 2 years, were examined. Images were preprocessed using Computational Anatomy Toolbox 12. Voxel-based morphometry was performed in FSL 6.0.1 to identify areas of grey matter (GM) volume differences both cross-sectionally and longitudinally between subjects with high and low baseline CAIDE score (CAIDE score was dichotomized at cohort-median). A GM percentage of change map was created for each subject for evaluation of atrophy over 2 years. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, education and total intracranial volume. RESULTS Compared to subjects with CAIDE score ≤ 6 (low risk), subjects with CAIDE score > 6 (high risk) showed lower GM volume in the temporal, occipital, and fusiform cortex and lingual gyrus at baseline, and greater percentage of GM loss over 2 years in the supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, superior parietal lobule and cingulate gyrus (corrected P < 0.05). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated accelerated GM atrophy concentrated in several AD signature cortical regions in healthy middle-aged subjects with high CAIDE scores.","Liu, Xulin; Dounavi, Maria-Eleni; Ritchie, Karen; Wells, Katie; Ritchie, Craig W; Su, Li; Muniz-Terrera, Graciela; O'Brien, John T",Journal of neurology,39,7

Five out of six fetuses in the EVE group completed the study period with key physiological variables remaining within their respective reference ranges for the duration of the 48 h study. Bacteremia was identified in four out of five EVE fetuses, and was associated with a systemic inflammatory response. Using our refined EVE therapy platform, preterm lambs were maintained in a stable physiological condition for 48 h. These findings represent a significant advance over earlier work with this system; however, the identification of bacteremia and a fetal inflammatory response suggests that further refinement to the EVE therapy platform is required.","Miura, Yuichiro; Usuda, Haruo; Watanabe, Shimpei; Woodward, Eleanor; Saito, Masatoshi; Musk, Gabrielle C; Kallapur, Suhas G; Sato, Shinichi; Kitanishi, Ryuta; Matsuda, Tadashi; Newnham, John P; Stock, Sarah J; Kemp, Matthew W",Artificial organs,39,1

However, the short half-life and reactivity of NO have made precise, tunable delivery difficult. As such, conventional methodologies have generally relied on donors that spontaneously release NO at different rates, and delivery profiles have largely been constrained to decaying dynamics. In recent years, the possibility of finely controlling NO release, for instance with light, has become achievable and this raises the question of how delivery dynamics influence therapeutic potential. Here we investigated this relationship using Escherichia coli as a model organism and an approach that incorporated both experimentation and mathematical modeling. We found that the best performing delivery mode was dependent on the NO payload, and developed a mathematical model to quantitatively dissect those observations. Those analyses suggested that the duration of respiratory inhibition was a major determinant of NO-induced growth inhibition. Inspired by this, we constructed a delivery schedule that leveraged that insight to extend the antimicrobial activity of NO far beyond what was achievable by traditional delivery dynamics. Collectively, these data and analyses suggest that the delivery dynamics of NO have a considerable impact on its ability to achieve and maintain bacteriostasis.","Sivaloganathan, Darshan M; Brynildsen, Mark P",Frontiers in physiology,39,1

Welding processes can be used to produce pieces by AM techniques and their application has been intensified lately. Commonly, AM processes use MIG/MG and TIG and primarily with wire as stock material. Welding offers the advantage of producing large parts in lower time and material consistency is always good, since those processes have been greatly improved. In contrast, welding workpieces, generally, result with rough surfaces and poor geometric quality, which makes them not readily acceptable for most of the common machinery applications. The present work investigates the use TIG process with metal powder as stock material to produce workpieces, which are to be post processed by machining. The AM process is based on the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) system. A simple one-axis moving system was produced to test the whole concept. Powder was preferred since it is readily available in variety of metallic alloys. Two powder grain sizes (Gs), three travel speed values (f) and three current levels (C) were tested producing weld beads of AISI H13 on a substrate of AISI 1020 plate. Beads were assessed by measuring external dimensions and looking at their microstructures. Additional tests were performed building straight wall stacking 10 layers with the best welding parameters found with the first trials. Results indicate that materials with good internal quality could be produced when making single beads and also building straight walls. These first trials show that the proposed process can be used as a promising hybrid process, using AM (PBF-TIG) and conventional machining at the same equipment. Future work will concentrate on adapting the welding and powder bed system in a machining center to further study the process.","Moreira, Alcindo F.; Ribeiro, Kandice S.B.; Mariani, Fábio E.; Coelho, Reginaldo T.",Procedia Manufacturing,39,24

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of precautionary and normalization steps taken by the Turkish government on the number of confirmed cases, current cases, and deaths due to the COVID-19 in Turkey. Materials and Methods: The study used exponential regression models to estimate the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and current cases. The study data were collected from the Turkish Ministry of Health, Turkish Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the national public broadcaster of Turkey. Results: The precautions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused the exponentially increasing number of cases to be brought under control and to decrease exponentially. The normalization steps taken paused the exponential decrease in the number of cases and caused the number of cases to remain flat during the summer months and then rise again. If the normalization steps were not implemented and the precautions taken continued in the same way, it was calculated that the numbers of COVID-19 current cases would be reset on June 26, 2020. The total number of deaths would remain at 4423 and the total number of confirmed cases would be 150586. Discussion: As a result, the impact of precautionary and normalization steps on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic was examined. It has been observed that the impact of these steps on the pandemic is exponential.

Hospital-acquired COVID-19 is a recognised problem amongst both patients and staff, with growing evidence for the relevance of airborne transmission. This study examined the effect of air filtration and ultra-violet (UV) light sterilisation on detectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosols. Methods We conducted a crossover study of portable air filtration and sterilisation devices in a repurposed surge COVID ward and surge ICU. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) cyclonic aerosol samplers and PCR assays were used to detect the presence of airborne SARS-CoV-2 and other microbial bioaerosol with and without air/UV filtration. Results Airborne SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the ward on all five days before activation of air/UV filtration, but on none of the five days when the air/UV filter was operational; SARS-CoV-2 was again detected on four out of five days when the filter was off. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 was infrequently detected in the ICU. Filtration significantly reduced the burden of other microbial bioaerosols in both the ward (48 pathogens detected before filtration, two after, p=0.05) and the ICU (45 pathogens detected before filtration, five after p=0.05). Conclusions These data demonstrate the feasibility of removing SARS-CoV-2 from the air of repurposed surge wards and suggest that air filtration devices may help reduce the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2.","Conway Morris, A.; Sharrocks, K.; Bousfield, R.; Kermack, L.; Maes, M.; Higginson, E.; Forrest, S.; Pereira-Dias, J.; Cormie, C.; Old, T.; Brooks, S.; Hamed, I.; Koenig, A.; Turner, A.; White, P.; Floto, R.

Data sources Databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of included studies were systematically searched for 6TG and synonyms from 1998–2018. Methods We included studies of patients with ALL or inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) treated with 6TG, excluding studies with 6TG as part of an intensive chemotherapy regimen. We uploaded a protocol to PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018089424). Database and manual searches yielded 1823 unique records. Of these, 395 full-texts were screened for eligibility. Finally, 134 reports representing 42 studies were included. Results and conclusions We included data from 42 studies of ALL and IBD patients; four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 3,993 patients, 20 observational studies including 796 patients, and 18 case reports including 60 patients. Hepatotoxicity in the form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) occurred in 9–25% of the ALL patients in two of the four included RCTs using 6TG doses of 40–60 mg/m2/day, and long-term hepatotoxicity in the form of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) was reported in 2.5%. In IBD patients treated with 6TG doses of approximately 23 mg/m2/day, NRH occurred in 14% of patients; SOS has not been reported. At a 6TG dose of approximately 12 mg/m2/day, NRH was reported in 6% of IBD patients, which is similar to the background incidence. According to this review, doses at or below 12 mg/m2/day are rarely associated with notable hepatotoxicity and can probably be considered safe.","Toksvang, Linea Natalie; Schmidt, Magnus Strøh; Arup, Sofie; Larsen, Rikke Hebo; Frandsen, Thomas Leth; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Rank, Cecilie Utke",bioRxiv,39,1

Cases were identified both through symptom-triggered testing and a universal asymptomatic testing program. An online questionnaire was sent to all University of Cambridge students on 25 November to investigate risk factors for testing positive in the period after 30 October 2020. This asked about symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results, in-person teaching settings, other aspects of University life, and attendance at social events in the period just prior to lockdown, from 30th October and 4th November 2020. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken evaluating potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results Among 3,980 students responding to the questionnaire, 99 (2.5%) reported testing SARS-CoV-2 positive in the period studied; 28 (28%) were asymptomatic. We found strong independent associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were attendance at two social settings in the City of Cambridge (adjusted odds ratio favouring disease 13.0 (95% CI 6.2,26.9) and 14.2 (95% CI 2.9,70)), with weaker evidence of association with three further social settings. By contrast, we did not observe strong independent associations between disease risk and type of accommodation or attendance at, or participation in, a range of activities associated with the University curriculum.

To limit the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first wave between March and May 2020, Italian workers had massively started performing remote working. Insights on the subjective perception of noise annoyance under the remote working settings were thus necessary. Workers from a university and from several large and small Italian companies, resulting in 1,934 participants overall, answered to a questionnaire on the perception of noise annoyance in the remote working environment. A total of 57% of the responding workers stated to be sensitive to noise. The questionnaire was delivered online;data were recorded anonymously and then aggregated for statistical analyses. Results show that 55% of the workers perform their activity in an isolated room of the home environment, 43% in a shared room (e.g., kitchen, living room), and 2% in an outdoor space, with the majority of workers (57%) performing activity without other people in the environment. Among the noise sources investigated, 25% of workers recognize the noise generated by people (e.g., talking, moving, calling, listening to music) as the main source of disturbance. The negative consequences of noise annoyance during the remote working hours are mainly related to a loss of concentration and to a difficulty in relaxing. Furthermore, workers reported to get easily irritated by noise generated from the neighborhoods or from the housemates as it tends to distract from finishing a task. © Copyright © 2021 Puglisi, Di Blasio, Shtrepi and Astolfi.","Puglisi, G.

First, I show how Chinese commercial surveillance analytics profits from legitimation lent by the West-centric hierarchical academe. Then, I move to transnational academic repurposing of Big Data from China, which becomes increasingly common. Such social research tends to yield specters of China that are untethered to the lived realities of those whose data are taken.

While society expects universities to lead DI efforts, the successful development and implementation of DIs, particularly in administration and management contexts, remains a challenge. In addition, research lacks knowledge on the DI process at public universities, while further understanding and guidance are needed. Against this backdrop, our study aims to enhance the understanding of the DI process at public universities by providing a structured overview of corresponding drivers and barriers through an exploratory single case study. We investigate the case of a German public university and draw from primary and secondary data of its DI process from the development of three specific digital process innovations. Building upon Business Process Management (BPM) as a theoretical lens to study the DI process, we present 13 drivers and 17 barriers structured along the DI actions and BPM core elements. We discuss corresponding findings and provide related practice recommendations for public universities that aim to engage in DI. In sum, our study contributes to the explanatory knowledge at the convergent interface between DI and BPM in the context of public universities. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Kleider, E.; Kreuzer, T.; Lösser, B.; Oberländer, A.

The debate includes claims that sheltering in place influences deaths unrelated to infection or other natural causes. Testing this claim should improve the benefit/cost accounting that presumably informs the decision of whether to reimpose sheltering in place. To distinguish effects of shelter-in-place policies from other events in the pandemic, we compare experiences in two large US states with markedly different policies. We use time-series methods to compare temporal variation in non-natural deaths in California to that in Florida. California was the first state to begin and among the last to end sheltering in place while sheltering began later and ended earlier in Florida. We find that during weeks when California had shelter-in-place orders in effect, but Florida did not, the odds that a non-natural death occurred in California rather than Florida fell 14.8% below values expected from history. These results suggest that sheltering-in-place policies reduce mortality from mechanisms unrelated to infection or other natural causes of death.","Catalano, R.; Glymour, M.; Chen, Y.-H.; Bibbins-Domingo, K.",,39,16

Reform Judaism, which supports modern liberal theology, has adopted the usage of technology for Shabbat services. The transition from the physical space to the virtual one challenges the performance of the ritual: Rabbis change the ritual's structure, and during online services, the congregants have different feelings toward the congregation and their own spiritual worship, made manifest in changes in their usual religious gestures. A positive result of the move to the virtual space is that though the Reform Jewish congregations, as non-Orthodox communities, have been excluded by the state, virtual prayers further expose Reform services to Israeli society. However, this might hinder societal support if it is shown that the community can conduct its services without an actual formal space. This study illuminates the intersection of virtual space, religious praxis, and political conflicts.","Ben-Lulu, Elazar",Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,39,24

Millions of users engage themselves with the posts circulated on these platforms. Despite the social regulations and protocols imposed by these platforms, it is difficult to restrict some objectionable posts carrying hateful content. Automatic hate speech detection on social media platforms is an essential task that has not been solved efficiently despite multiple attempts by various researchers. It is a challenging task that involves identifying hateful content from social media posts. These posts may reveal hate outrageously, or they may be subjective to the user or a community. Relying on manual inspection delays the process, and the hateful content may remain available online for a long time. The current state-of-the-art methods for tackling hate speech perform well when tested on the same dataset but fail miserably on cross-datasets. Therefore, we propose an ensemble learning-based adaptive model for automatic hate speech detection, improving the cross-dataset generalization. The proposed expert model for hate speech detection works towards overcoming the strong user-bias present in the available annotated datasets. We conduct our experiments under various experimental setups and demonstrate the proposed model’s efficacy on the latest issues such as COVID-19 and US presidential elections. In particular, the loss in performance observed under cross-dataset evaluation is the least among all the models. Also, while restricting the maximum number of tweets per user, we incur no drop in performance.","Agarwal, Shivang Chowdary C. Ravindranath",Expert Systems with Applications,39,1

AIM: This study purpose was to analyze the mental health status on the quality of life amongst medicine students during COVID-19 period. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey on 361 students from Faculty of Medicine Tanjungpura University. This study was conducted from June 2019 to November 2020 by spreading Depression Anxiety Stress Scale questionnaire and a WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire through online. The data analysis was administered using Kruskal–Wallis statistics. RESULT: The students’ mental health status was dominantly on the normal category with depression domain by 323 students (89.5%), anxiety domain by 311 students (86.1%), and stress domain by 343 students (95%). The quality of life measurement was in category medium in all domains which are physical health (88.6%), psychological health (92.5%), social relationships (50.7%), and environment (78.7%). There was significant effect of mental health status of depression and anxiety toward the aspect of physical health, psychological health, and social relationships (p < 0.05). Stress significantly influenced all domains of quality of life, and there was no significant effect of mental health status domain depression (p = 0.051) and anxiety (p = 0.881) toward the environment aspect. CONCLUSION: Students’ mental health status in this research belongs to the category normal with moderate level in quality of life. To compare, there was a significant effect of mental health status toward the quality of life domains.

This study aims at overcoming this gap in research by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the years to come. We use the Delphi technique to estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports by 2025. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results suggest substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the European traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on quality and sustainability rather than quantity. In addition, a significant growth in the world's demand for olive oil is expected in non-traditional markets, which will be driven by greater awareness of the positive health and sustainability attributes of this product, jointly with the changes in lifestyles and rising incomes of several consumer segments. These emerging markets offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Future international challenges facing the olive oil industry include new market entry, worldwide product promotion, quality standards' harmonization, enacting trade facilitation schemes, and dealing with the COVID-19 impacts. Findings improve market predictability and transparency, and ultimately support decision-making and strategic planning in the olive oil sector.","Mili, S.; Bouhaddane, M.",Agriculture,39,0

In phase 3 testing the complete remission (CR) rate was 41%, and response was higher in patients with lower tumor burden and lower titers of antidrug antibodies (ADA). Phase 1 testing indicated that most CRs were without minimal residual disease (MRD) and eradication of MRD was associated with prolonged CR duration. Monoclonal antibody (Mab) rituximab binds to CD20 on HCL cells and induces apoptosis or immune-mediated killing, but as a single-agent achieved only 13% CRs in relapsed HCL requiring therapy. In a phase 1 trial to determine safety, rituximab was combined with Moxe, with the goal to help reduce tumor burden and to prevent or delay ADA by killing normal B-cells. Methods: To allow rituximab sufficient time to accomplish both goals, it was infused 3 days before day 1 of cycle 1 at 375 mg/m2 , and Moxe was given by 30-minute infusion on days 1, 3 and 5. On repeat cycles of Moxe days 1, 3 and 5, rituximab was given on day 1. Cycles were generally spaced 4 weeks apart. Moxe was begun at a lower dose, 30 rather than the 40 mcg/kg dose used in phase 3 in case the rituximab would increase its toxicity. Bone marrow aspirate flow cytometry, which can detect 0.002% HCL cells, was the most sensitive test used for MRD detection, much more sensitive than BRAF V600E digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) or bone marrow biopsy immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients could receive 4 cycles past MRD-free CR, but not more than 8 cycles. Results: Three patients received Moxe at 30 mcg/Kg/dose and 6 received 40 mcg/Kg/dose, all without dose limiting toxicity (DLT). There was no evidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome or capillary leak syndrome. To prevent intravascular hypovolemia due to expected third spacing, patients were encouraged to drink one cup per hour of water or other fluid from days 1 to 8 and take dexamethasone 4 mg orally if headache or nausea prevented good oral hydration. Of the 9 patients, 7 (78%) achieved CR after 2 (n = 6) or 3 (n = 1) cycles, and achieved MRD-free CR after 2 (n = 3), 4 (n = 3) or 6 (n = 1) cycles. No patients became infected with COVID-19. Conclusions: This phase 1 trial met its primary endpoint of determining whether rituximab could be safely combined with Moxe and will enroll 4 additional patients to further access clinical activity. Further testing will determine whether addition of a CD20 Mab to Moxe significantly improves clinical outcome compared to Moxe alone, particularly long-term MRD-free CR rate.","Kreitman, R.

UCDP registered more than 80,100 deaths in organized violence in 2020, compared to 76,300 in 2019. The decrease in violence in Afghanistan and Syria was countered by escalating conflicts in, for example, Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), Azerbaijan and Tigray, Ethiopia. Moreover, the call for a global ceasefire following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic failed to produce any results. In fact, the number of active state-based and non-state conflicts, as well as the number of actors carrying out one-sided violence against civilians, increased when compared to 2019.

SPSS and Process Macro (Hays, 2020) were used.ResultsFCV-19 mean scores were significantly higher in women and significantly correlated with years of education (r=-.14) (p<.05). History of previous/current Covid-19 infection did not significantly distinguish FCV-19 scores and they did not correlate with perceived health. FCV-19 correlated significantly with neuroticism and PTQ total and dimensional scores (r>.20, p<.01). Both Repetitive thinking and Cognitive interference were mediators of the relationship between neuroticism and fear of COVID, even after controlling for gender and education.ConclusionsThis study provides preliminary evidence on individual factors that might be associated to the emotional response to the Covid-19 pandemics, aiming to facilitate public health initiatives to ease people’s fears in a near future.","Cabaços, C.; Pereira, A.

In order to define the optimal measures to take to curb the spread of the pandemic, our goal is to use adequate mathematical modeling tools and adapt agent-based models to simulate the evolution of the pandemic and its spread in Morocco. An analysis of the disease spread based on compartmental modeling leads to an ordinary differential equation governing the system. In addition, the agent-based approach uses artificial intelligence and makes it possible to deal with complexity, also permits to consider different scenarios. The obtained numerical simulations give a clear idea of the spread of a party's disease and for each of the measures that are taken into account during containment or during de-containment. These simulations are decision support efficient tools rendered on powerful modeling tools. The two approaches are complementary and give rise to successful models.","Aboulaich, R.; Bensaid, K.; Chabbar, S.; El Karkri, J.; Ieee,","2020 Ieee International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions",39,7

Providing a large number of these expensive devices in a short period of time is difficult, and providing suitable places for them is not easy. Hence the need to apply the concepts of reverse engineering in the design and manufacture of low-cost portable devices for use by patients, wherever they are. This chapter provides the main components of the mechanical ventilator and how it works as a first stage to apply the concepts of reverse engineering to the design and construction of a low-cost portable device as well as a cardiopulmonary resuscitation system. Wireless sensor network technologies were applied in order to access the device and adjust its main parameters by the specialist according to the patient’s condition. This device can be used at home, ambulances, health centers and remote hard-to-reach places. The main parameters of the device can be adjusted directly by the operator or remotely by a specialist according to the patient’s condition. Experimental results on the first prototype, when compared to available portable devices, indicate its ability to assist a patient with difficulty breathing. The prototype efficiently responds to the input settings provided by the paramedic or specialist, depending on the patient’s condition. The respirator prototype is small and weighs 4.7 kg, equipped with a wireless guidance system for CPR, and its cost does not exceed 800 USD. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Al-Mutairi, A.

The role of telemedicine in patients who undergo frequent on site treatment, such as radiation therapy, is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine telemedicine use, physician satisfaction and barriers to continued use in radiation oncology. Methods: An anonymous, electronic survey was distributed to radiation oncologists internationally. Participants described demographic and practice characteristics and a 5 point Likert scale assessed provider satisfaction, ease of use and overall utility of telemedicine. Analyses include descriptive statistics and subgroup comparisons using Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Results: 232/5343 (4.3%) completed the survey, 63.8% of whom were male, 52.6% age 50 or younger and 78.0% from the United States (U.S.). Only 14.2% used Telemedicine previously, which increased to 93.1% during COVID-19. Amongst all telemedicine users, usage rates were 77.9% for initial consultations, 97.2% for follow-up visits, and 35.9% for on-treatment visits. 69.8% report that &lt;25% of patients requiring treatment experienced delays due to COVID-19. Most conducted appointments from the workplace, with 40.1% also doing so from home. Satisfaction was high at 73.8%, perceived usefulness was 76.9% and 81.5% hope to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic. However, 82.4% had concerns with the inability to examine patients. Although 82.1 % believed that telemedicine would improve patient access to health care services overall, 63.0% were concerned with patient ability to access required technology. 49.5% had concerns regarding continued billing/reimbursement;less commonly at government centers (18.8%) compared to academic/satellite facilities (52.7%) and freestanding centers/community hospitals (50.7%), p=0.039 for both comparisons. These concerns were also significantly higher amongst US physicians (53.2% vs 34.9%, p=0.048). Conclusions: Widespread adoption of telemedicine by radiation oncologists occurred during COVID-19 with high rates of satisfaction and interest in continued use. Sustained reimbursement for telemedicine services is a significant concern, particularly in the US and outside of government facilities.","Deshane, A.; Damico, N.; Kharouta, M.; Wu, A.; Wang, G.

It is framed and analysed data using Khan’s eight dimensions of gauging successful e-learning experiences. Prior to COVID-19, many of the courses at the USP were offered in blended mode, which encompasses both online and face-to-face delivery. However, with a sudden move to fully online offerings, and the associated fears resulting from the unknowns of COVID-19, this was disruptive and traumatic for many students. However, analysis identified several key factors aiding student success including many Solomon Islands students being able to eventually cope with the disruption and displayed independence and resilience. It is also found that Solomon Island students got to experience new applications and tools such as, for example, having to be in Zoom or having to sit an online exam.

In fact, several retrospective studies, in addition to our own, as well as a systematic review, indicate that KIT mutations have a negative prognostic impact in AML with t(8;21) or, to a lesser extent, with inv(16)/t(16;16). In addition, gene expression studies found KIT to be highly expressed in CBFL regardless of its mutational status. Furthermore, recent studies have identified novel recurrent somatic mutations co-occurring with KITmut. In-vitro studies revealed that Midostaurin (Mido) is effective in inhibiting both wild type (WT) and a range of KIT mutants. In addition, it is proven to be effective in KIT-positive malignancies such as Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis (ASM), Mast Cell Leukemia (MCL), and SM with Associated Hematological Neoplasm (SM-AHN). With this background, we designed a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mido in association with Intensive Chemotherapy (IC), in CBFL regardless of KIT mutational status. Methods: The inclusion criteria were the following: age 18 to 60 years, diagnosis of de-novo CBFL, adequate organ function, signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria were: central nervous system involvement, uncontrolled infections, other active malignancies, a Qtc value greater than 470 ms (according to Bazett formula) at the electrocardiogram, significant uncontrolled or active cardiovascular diseases. Patients received standard induction therapy with an anthracycline containing regimen (“7+3”-like) + Mido, three cycles of post-remission consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine + Mido, and 12 months of Mido as Maintenance. The Mido dosage was: 50 mg orally twice a day, on days 8-21, in association with IC, and 50 mg orally twice a day as single agent maintenance. In order to attain a reduction in 2 years Relapse Incidence (RI), from the historical value of 48% to 28% (Primary Objective of the Study), we plan to enrol 39 patients (power 82%, alpha error 4,6%). At diagnosis all patients were studied by a comprehensive NGS panel targeting 40 DNA genes and 29 RNA fusion driver genes. MRD status was assessed by qPCR and high-resolution multicolor flow cytometry at established check-points during consolidation and maintenance therapy. Results: 17 patients were enrolled between December 2018 to April 2020 (table1). Overall, the CR rate was 94.2%. At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 3-19 months), we recorded a RI of 12.5%, an OS of 93.7%, and a DFS of 81.2%. 16 patients continue on study and 14 patients are in 1st CR, MRD-negative by flow cytometry and qPCR. Six patients (35.2 %) experienced 12 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), 10 out of whom were infections, with grade 3-4 neutropenia (Table 2). We only recorded one death from SARS-Cov2 infection (Interstitial Pneumonia) in a patient in MRD-negative complete remission. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: In patients with CBFL, the regimen consisting of intensive chemotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy in association with Mido, followed by Mido maintenance, had an acceptable safety profile and excellent response rates with a significant proportion of patients in MRD-negative complete remission.

However, little is known about how such facilities are financed. This issue creates potential knowledge gaps, one of which this study aims to address. This study examines the key drivers for green building project financing in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an explanatory sequential design with an initial quantitative instrument phase, followed by a qualitative data collection phase. An extensive critical comparative review of the literature resulted in the identification of eight potential drivers. One hundred and twenty-seven questionnaire responses based upon these drivers from the Ghanaian construction industry were received. Data were coded with SPSS v22, analysed descriptively (mean, standard deviation and standard error) and via inferential analysis (One Way ANOVA and One-Sample t-Test). These data were then validated through semi-structured interviews with ten industry professionals within the Ghana Green Building Council. Data obtained from the semi-structured validation interviews were analysed through the side-by-side comparison of the qualitative data with the quantitative data. Findings: Though all eight drivers are important, the five key drivers for the Ghanian construction industry were identified as, in order of importance, “high return on investment”, “emerging business opportunity”, “ethical investment”, “conservation of resources” and “mandatory regulations, standards, and policies”. The interviewees agreed to and confirmed the importance of these identified drivers for green building project financing from validating the survey's key findings. Research limitations/implications: Key limitations of this study are the restrictions regarding the geographical location of the collected data (i.e. Kumasi and Accra);timing of the study and sample size (i.e. the COVID-19 pandemic making it difficult to obtain adequate data). Practical implications: Though this study was conducted in Ghana, its implications could be useful to researchers, policymakers, stakeholders and practitioners in wider sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, financial institutions can invest in green buildings to expand their green construction and mortgage finance products to build higher value and lower risk portfolios. The findings from this study can provide investors with the enhanced certainty needed to help guide and inform their investment decisions, i.e. what to invest in, and when, by how much and how a scheme being “green” may influence their rate of return. Also, for building developers, it will give them a clearer understanding of the business case for green buildings and how to differentiate themselves in the market to grow their businesses. Originality/value: This study's findings provide insights into an under-investigated topic in Ghana and offer new and additional information and insights to the current state-of-the-art on the factors that drive green building project financing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agyekum, K.; Goodier, C.; Oppon, J.

In many companies, all quality methods seem to produce performance improvement at different levels, but lean management and kaizen were superior in preparing manufacturing companies to have high readiness levels when faced with a health pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Which quality method can help businesses in performing well during a health pandemic? In order to answer this question and be able to provide specific recommendations toward performing well in all future health pandemics, 500 manufacturing companies were selected and surveyed. The selected companies are known to use at least one quality method such as lean management, ISO 9001, European foundation for quality management (EFQM) and Six Sigma. Findings: EFQM comes second, then Six Sigma and ISO 9001. Lean creates a healthy workplace and enhances worker's health and well-being. This research helps quality professionals in following a precise framework that maintains performance during health pandemics. Whether the company uses lean or other quality methods, the framework helps in achieving pandemic readiness status. The framework is implemented in a company that does not currently use lean. Implementation resulted in significant improvement in pandemic preparedness, corporate performance and employee well-being. Originality/value: After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all companies should start thinking of creating a workplace that functions well during pandemics. To do that, companies should start including sanitation and health pandemic preparedness as part of their performance measurements. Using lean management and kaizen helps organizations to create a healthy workplace;clean and equipped with smaller number of workers. If organizations choose to use other quality methods, it is okay, but they should enhance these methods with lean tools such as elimination of the seven wastes, gemba, 5S and visual management. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abdallah, A.

We test these assertions using data from two rounds of surveys involving more than 11,000 firms from 28 countries both before and after COVID-19 was officially declared a global crisis. Our results provide prima facie evidence that innovators, in particular those who are younger (i.e. start-ups) and those who rely on internal sources of knowledge, are more likely to adapt to COVID-19 than non-innovators.

In humans, these spatial-regulatory connections are largely set during early development, when the cohesin complex plays an essential role in genome organisation and cell division. A full complement of the cohesin complex and its regulators is important for normal development, since heterozygous mutations in genes encoding these components are often sufficient to produce a disease phenotype. The implication that genes encoding the cohesin complex and cohesin regulators must be tightly controlled and resistant to variability in expression has not yet been formally tested. Here, we identify spatial-regulatory connections with potential to regulate expression of cohesin loci, including linking their expression to that of other genes. Connections that centre on the cohesin ring subunits (Mitotic: SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, STAG2, RAD21/RAD21-AS; Meiotic: SMC1B, STAG3, REC8, RAD21L1), cohesin-ring support genes (NIPBL, MAU2, WAPL, PDS5A and PDS5B), and CTCF provide evidence of coordinated regulation that has little tolerance for perturbation. We identified transcriptional changes across a set of genes co-regulated with the cohesin loci that include biological pathways such as extracellular matrix production and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Remarkably, many of the genes that are co-regulated with cohesin loci are themselves intolerant to loss-of-function. The results highlight the importance of robust regulation of cohesin genes, indicating novel pathways that may be important in the human cohesinopathy disorders.","Schierding, William; Horsfield, Julia; O’Sullivan, Justin",bioRxiv,39,1

The assets of such banks have been growing twice as fast as those of conventional banks. Islamic banks do not depend on con ventional interest, speculation, or complex derivatives stemming from banking operations. Instead, their actions in respect of profit/risk sharing, and the clarity of the contract are consistent with Islamic Shari. ah principles, which seek to promote a more equal society. Purpose of the article: This research aims to identify and compare factors influencing the liquidity of Islamic and conventional banks in Europe. Candidate factors are sought amongst profitability,credit quality, credit expansion and capital adequacy indicators. Methodology: First, relevant financial ratios for 249 observations on Islamic banks and 2,306 observations on conventional banks are selected and compared for the period 2013-2017. Second,liquidity is explained separately for each type of banks by panel data regression to identify its determinants in a comparative context. Findings & value added: The results indicate that the impact of the net interest margin on the liquidity ratio of Islamic banks is insignificant, which is obviously due to the prohibition of the use of interest (riba). To the contrary, in conventional banking a higher net interest margin results in a reduction in liquidity. Capital adequacy has a positive influence upon liquidity in both types of banks, but in Islamic banking, the influence is 5.4 times greater. The findings strongly suggest that the liquidity of Islamic and conventional banks is affected by different factors.","Musa, H.; Musova, Z.; Natorin, V.; Lazaroiu, G.; Bod'a, M.",Oeconomia Copernicana,39,7

Proteopathic seeds can be released into the extracellular space, secreted in association with extracellular vesicles (EV) or exchanged by direct cell-to-cell contact. The extent to which each of these pathways contributes to the prion-like spreading of protein misfolding is unclear. Exchange of cellular cargo by both direct cell-to-cell contact as well as via EV depends on receptor-ligand interactions and subsequent release of cargo into the cytosol. We hypothesized that enabling these interactions through viral ligands enhances the aggregate-inducing capacity of EV-associated proteopathic seeds. Using different cellular models propagating model prion-like protein aggregates, mouse-adapted prions or pathogenic Tau aggregates, we demonstrate that vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 spike S increase protein aggregate induction by direct cell-to-cell contact or via viral glycoprotein-decorated EV. Thus, receptor-ligand interactions are major determinants of intercellular aggregate dissemination. Further, our data raise the intriguing possibility that acute or latent viral infections contribute to proteopathic seed spreading by facilitating intercellular cargo transfer.

Unfortunately, a treatment agent specific for SARS-CoV-2 has not been developed yet. Favipiravir is one of the antiviral agents used experimentally in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to determine the frequency of side effects seen in patients hospitalized in our hospital and received favipiravir at any stage of their treatment. Methods: Our study is a retrospective observational study. Definite and probable COVID-19 cases hospitalized in our hospital between March 23, 2020, May 31, 2020 were determined, and those receiving favipiravir as initial or secondary therapy were included in the study. The demographic data, laboratory tests, observed side effects of the patients were recorded and analyzed statistically. Results: A total of 134 patients, 37.3% using favipiravir at the beginning and 62.7% as secondary, were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 66.8±15.7 years. 38.1% (n=51) of the group were female. Side effects were detected in 17 (13%) patients in the whole group. Hepatotoxicity (4.5%), increased serum uric acid (4.5%), nephrotoxicity (1.5%), gastro-intestinal side effects (1.5%), cardiac side effects (0.7%) were detected. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of adverse events between the patients who received favipiravir initially or later on disease course. Conclusions: Although some results support the short-term safety of favipiravir, more studies are needed for its long-term effects. Studies on hyperuricemia, QTc prolongation, use in pregnancy, use during lactation and use in children are insuf-ficient. Therefore, although Favipiravir appears to be a good alternative in the treatment of COVID-19, it should be used carefully because the data on its safety is still insufficient.","Doğan, E.; Çeviker, S.

LH031 is a highly selective inhibitor of kinesin spindle protein, which has demonstrated preclinical antimyeloma activity. This phase 1 study was conducted to evaluated dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determined a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for LH031 in Chinese patients with Refractory/Resistance Multiple Myeloma (RRMM).The pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of LH031 were also evaluated. METHODS: A non-randomized, single-center, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of single or multiple escalation dose (20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg) of LH031 given as schedule of oral once a day. LH031 was administered on Day 1~5 of each week for 3 weeks (21 days) per cycle. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design was employed. An expansion cohort was conducted at the MTD. Pharmacokinetics was evaluated in plasma. A major efficacy evaluation was performed at the end of each treatment cycle. RESULTS: The study is still on going, at present there are 6 patients received LH031 and completion of all visits, divided equally into 20mg and 30mg cohort. Patients in each cohort had received a median of 6 prior therapies. DLTs reported in two patients dosed at 30mg. Both of the DLTs were neutropenia. The most commonly reported treatment-related AEs were hematological toxicity (e.g. neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, leukocytopenia) that were similar to other Eg5 inhibitors. The main severe adverse events (CTCAE grade 3 or 4) in the 20mg and 30 mg dose groups were leukocytopenia and neutropenia, and they were all reversible. Neurotoxicity related to LH031 was not observed. Efficacy data demonstrated that the best response was Stable Disease(SD) and Disease Control Rate (DCR, ≥SD[≥8 weeks]) was 50%. The longest treatment time was 177 days, even though PFS was determined according to the last tumor evaluation before the COVID period (D88). The PK data shows that T1/2 are approximately 20h in Chinese patients, which is longer than Caucasian (10h);Chinese AUC for 20mg is also higher than that of Caucasian (1996 h*ng/ml vs. 476 h*ng/ml);the exposure at 20mg dose group is close to that at 50 mg dose in Caucasian. These PK parameter indicates that the elimination of LH031 is slower in Chinese patients compared with Caucasian. CONCLUSIONS: The current phase 1 study showed that LH031 was an accepted safety profile at 20mg. DLTs was expected and reversible. MTD is to be determined by recruiting 3 more subjects at 20mg dose. It demonstrated that the elimination rate of LH031 in Chinese patients was slower than Caucasian. The monotherapy showed some benefit to RRMM, Phase 2 clinical trials are being planned to include various combination therapies with existing treatments (e.g. lenalidomide, dexamethasone, bortezomib) for MM to benefit more potential refractory/resistance MM patients.

The study of the mechanism of contagion is one of the greatest challenges before a mass vaccination campaign that would protect populations. The study can support the development of knowledge and tools to develop possible strategies for containing its spread in future events. The saliva droplet aerosol expelled during breathing or coughing is the main cause for the propagation of the SARS-Cov-2. In this work, a URANS CFD approach was used to simulate the dispersion from the mouth of these particles in closed environments. The air conditioning system was considered. The conditions were varied to determine their impact on the diffusion of the aerosol. Lagrangian and Eulerian numerical approaches were used to model the coughing and the breathing events. These were validated with the puff theory, numerical and experimental results. A realistic case of a meeting room with two persons was simulated. Different characteristics of the expulsed aerosols and different ventilation system configurations were considered to demonstrate how these simulations can support management strategies for indoor occupation.

However, estimating the causal effect of increased hospital busyness on in-hospital mortality remains an elusive task due to statistical power challenges and the difficulty in separating shocks to occupancy from changes in patient composition. Using data from a large public hospital system in Mexico, we estimate the impact of congestion on in-hospital mortality by exploiting the shock in hospitalizations induced by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, instrumenting hospital admissions due to acute respiratory infections (ARIs) with measures of ARI cases at nearby healthcare facilities as a proxy for the size of the local outbreak. Our instrumental-variables estimates show that a 1% increase in ARI admissions in 2009 led to a 0.25% increase in non-ARI in-hospital mortality. We show that these effects are nonlinear in the size of the local outbreak, consistent with the existence of tipping points. We further show that effects are concentrated at hospitals with limited infrastructure, suggesting that supply-side policies that improve patient assignment across hospitals and strategically increase hospital capacity could mitigate some of the negative impacts. We discuss managerial implications, suggesting that up to 25%–30% of our estimated deaths at small and non-intensive-care-unit hospitals could have been averted by reallocating patients to reduce congestion.","Gutierrez, Emilio Rubli Adrian",Management Science,39,16

There is now extensive literature on its presentation and initial management. There is no literature however on what happens to these patients following discharge. Methods: We collected clinical data and samples from seven patients presenting with VITT and followed them up for 82-145 days. We also collected clinical samples from them at last follow-up. Testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies was done using an anti-PF4/heparin enzymatic immunoassay. Flow Cytometry was used to look at Fc{gamma}RIIa levels on patient platelets. Light Transmission Aggregometry with patient serum and healthy donor / patient platelets was used to analyse platelet responsiveness, in the presence and absence of PF4. Findings: All patients were discharged on direct oral anticoagulants. Two patients remain completely symptom free, three have ongoing headaches, two have residual neurological deficits. Two patients developed mild thrombocytopenia and worsening headache (but without cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and were retreated, one of these with rituximab. All patients, except the one treated with rituximab, had similar anti-PF4 antibody titres at 80-120 days to their levels at diagnosis. Platelets from patients at follow-up had normal levels of Fc{gamma}RIIa and had normal responses to thrombin and collagen-related-peptide. Patient serum from diagnosis strongly activated healthy donor platelets in the presence of PF4. Serum from follow-up was much weaker at stimulating platelets, even in the presence of PF4. Interpretation: This study shows that despite similar PF4 antibody titres at diagnosis and during follow-up, there are further differences in patient serum, that are not apparent from currently used testing, that result in lower levels of platelet activation during the follow-up period. Further understanding of these factors are important in order to assess duration of anticoagulation for these patients.","Nicolson, P. L.; Montague, S. J.; Smith, C. W.; Lodwick, C.

The issue of protection against vaccine-preventable diseases has acquired new urgency in connection with the decrease in the vaccination rate established by WHO against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. This creates the conditions for outbreaks and puts patients with immunopathological diseases at particular risk, who are most often not vaccinated from the moment of diagnosis Purpose of the study – to assess the safety of specific antibodies to measles, mumps, rubella and diphtheria in children with JIA, depending on the duration of vaccination, the duration of the disease and the therapy received. Materials and methods. The vaccination rate of 171 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) aged (11,31±0,31 years) with the duration of the disease at the time of examination was 4,69±0,29 years, who had previously received 1-2 vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella and 3-6 vaccinations against diphtheria. Antibodies to these infections were determined by ELISA. Results. 42.1% of children had no protective titers of antibodies to measles, 19,9% – to mumps, 9,4% – to rubella and 16,4% – to diphtheria. Among 93 vaccinated and revaccinated patients, there were no protective titers of antibodies to measles – 40,9% (38 children), mumps – 13,9% (13 people), rubella – 5,4% (5 children), and among 78 vaccinated once, respectively: measles – 43.6% (34 children), mumps – 25.6% (20 children), rubella – 14,1% (11). The level of protection against diphtheria was comparable for those who received 3-5 vaccinations. Depending on the therapy, 3 groups were identified: group 1-71 children received metatrexate and glucocorticosteroids, 2-82 children received modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) and 18 children without this therapy (Group 3). Children of the 2nd group were on average older (12,48±0,42 years) than in the 1st and 3rd groups (10,04±0,48 and 10,96±0,96 years, respectively), they had significantly more frequent systemic variant and polyarthritis (64,6% compared to 36,6% and 16,7%, px2<0,001). The number of vaccine doses received by children in all groups before the onset of the disease did not significantly differ. The average level of antibodies to measles in children of group 2 (0,32±0,07 IU/ml) was 2,8 times less than in group 3 and significantly less than in group 1 (0,78±0,16, Pt=0.009), the average value of antibodies to rubella was also significantly less in group 2 (84,48±7,34 IU/ml) than in group 1 (109,73±8,09, Pt=0,022) and in group 3 (120,01±15,42, Pt=0,042). The analysis showed that the safety of antibodies to antigens of live vaccines, especially against measles, is negatively affected by the duration of the disease and the nature of therapy. Children who received combined therapy with anti-TNF, anti-IL-6 and anti-CD-80 drugs had a longer duration of the disease (7,5±0,97 years)=0,00082 compared to those who received only anti-IL-6 (2,9±0,7 years) and anti-TNF therapy (6,1±0,5 years) and with a comparable number of vaccine doses received, significantly lower average values of antibodies and a larger number of unprotected ones. Conclusions. The duration of the disease, the lack of timely age-related revaccinations, as well as the presence of combination therapy aimed at suppressing various mechanisms of the immune response in children with JIA are factors that lead to an increase in the number of unprotected from controlled infections. Immunity to measles suffers the most – 40.9% of revaccinated people are unprotected.","Fridman, I. V.; Lybimova, N. A.; Goleva, O. V.; Konstantinova, Yu E.; Kostik, M. M.",Jurnal Infektologii,39,26

Current guideline recommendations for prophylactic platelet transfusions, to prevent bleeding in critically ill patients with thrombocytopaenia, are based on observational data. Recent studies conducted in non-critically ill patients have demonstrated harm associated with platelet transfusions and have also called into question the efficacy of platelet transfusion. To date, there are no well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating platelet transfusion in critically ill patients. To inform the design of such an RCT, we sought to characterise current clinical practice across four commonly encountered scenarios in non-bleeding critically ill adult patients with thrombocytopaenia. An online survey link was sent to Clinical Directors and contacts of all adult general ICUs participating in the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre Case Mix Programme national clinical audit (n=200). The survey collected data regarding the respondents place of work, training grade and their current individual practice and possible limits of equipoise for prescribing prophylactic platelet transfusions across four scenarios: prophylaxis but with no procedure planned (NPP); ultrasound guided insertion of a right internal jugular central venous catheter (JVI); percutaneous tracheostomy (PT); and surgery with a low bleeding risk (SLBR). After excluding nine responses with missing data on all four of the main questions, responses were received from 99 staff, covering 78 ICUs (39.0% of 200 ICUs invited to participate). While nearly all respondents (98.0%) indicated a platelet transfusion threshold of 30 x 10^9/L or less for patients with no planned procedure, thresholds for planned procedures varied widely and centred at medians of 40 x 10^9/L for JVI (range: 10 to 70), 50 x 10^9/L for SLBR (range: 10 to 100) and 70 x 10^9/L for PT (range: 20 to greater than 100). Current platelet transfusion practice in UK ICUs prior to invasive procedures with relatively low bleeding risks is highly variable. Well-designed studies are needed to determine the optimal platelet transfusion thresholds in critical care.","Shah, A.; Gould, D. W.; Doidge, J. C.; Mouncey, P.; Harrison, D.

Histologically it was characterized by a significant increase of subsynovial inflammation and synovial hyperplasia without changes in the level of cartilage and bone erosion. Immunohistologically, marked subsynovial and frequent synovial staining of MHC class II bearing cells was noted, along with the sporadic presence of CD3, CD4, and CD43 receptor-bearing cells in the subsynovium. Injection of physiological levels (0.08 mg/kg) of estradiol on days 2, 3, 9, 15 and 20 post-partum delayed and reduced the flare to 23% of the animals.

We have examined the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on the Golgi-localized synthesis and addition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate side chains. BFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation onto the core proteins of the melanoma-associated proteoglycan and the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain. In the presence of BFA, the melanoma proteoglycan core protein was retained in the ER but still acquired complex, sialylated, N-linked oligosaccharides, as measured by digestion with endoglycosidase H and neuraminidase. The initiation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis was not affected by BFA, as shown by the incorporation of [6-3H]galactose into a protein-carbohydrate linkage region that was sensitive to beta-elimination. The ability of cells to use an exogenous acceptor, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, to elongate and sulfate core protein-free glycosaminoglycans, was completely inhibited by BFA. The effects of BFA were completely reversible in the absence of new protein synthesis. These experiments indicate that BFA effectively uncouples chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan synthesis by segregating initiation reactions from elongation and sulfation events.

In the current situation that effective medical treatments such as antiviral drugs are not discovered yet, dynamical features of the epidemics should be clarified for establishing strategies for tracing, quarantine, isolation, and regulating social behavior of the public at appropriate costs. Here we propose a network model for SARS epidemics and discuss why superspreaders emerged and why SARS spread especially in hospitals, which were key factors of the recent outbreak. We suggest that superspreaders are biologically contagious patients, and they may amplify the spreads by going to potentially contagious places such as hospitals. To avoid mass transmission in hospitals, it may be a good measure to treat suspected cases without hospitalizing them. Finally, we indicate that SARS probably propagates in small-world networks associated with human contacts and that the biological nature of individuals and social group properties are factors more important than the heterogeneous rates of social contacts among individuals. This is in marked contrast with epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases or computer viruses to which scale-free network models often apply.","Masuda, Naoki; Konno, Norio; Aihara, Kazuyuki","Physical review.

Stents were placed in various stenotic lesions after percutaneous transhepatic portography. Pressure gradient across the stenotic segment was measured in 14 patients. Stents were placed when the pressure gradient across the stenotic segment was > 5 mmHg or PV stenosis was > 50%, as observed on transhepatic portography. Patients underwent follow-up abdominal CT and technical and clinical success, complications, and stent patency were evaluated. RESULTS Stent placement was successful in 21 patients (technical success rate: 95.5%). Stents were positioned through the main PV and superior mesenteric vein (n = 13), main PV (n = 2), right and main PV (n = 1), left and main PV (n = 4), or main PV and splenic vein (n = 1). Patients showed no complications after stent placement. The time between procedure and final follow-up CT was 41-761 d (mean: 374.5 d). Twenty stents remained patent during the entire follow-up. Stent obstruction - caused by invasion of the PV stent by a recurrent tumor - was observed in 1 patient in a follow-up CT performed after 155 d after the procedure. The cumulative stent patency rate was 95.7%. Small in-stent low-density areas were found in 11 (55%) patients; however, during successive follow-up CT, the extent of these areas had decreased. CONCLUSION Percutaneous transhepatic stent placement can be safe and effective in cases of PV stenosis after hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery. Stents show excellent patency in follow-up abdominal CT, despite development of small in-stent low-density areas.","Jeon, Ung Bae; Kim, Chang Won; Kim, Tae Un; Choo, Ki Seok; Jang, Joo Yeon; Nam, Kyung Jin; Chu, Chong Woo; Ryu, Je Ho",World journal of gastroenterology,39,17

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of HCA on CBF autoregulation with a validated method based on near-infrared spectroscopy. METHODS Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSco2) was monitored in 25 patients undergoing aortic reconstructive operations. HCA was used in 13 patients. Autoregulation was measured continuously during the operation by calculating the linear correlation coefficient between low-frequency changes in rSco2 and mean arterial pressure (MAP), generating the variable cerebral oximetry index (COx). When CBF autoregulation is functional, COx is near 0, because CBF and MAP are not correlated, but approaches 1 when autoregulation is impaired (ie, CBF is pressure passive). On the basis of prior studies, impaired autoregulation was defined as COx exceeding 0.3. RESULTS COx did not differ between HCA and non-HCA groups before cardiopulmonary bypass or during the cooling phase of the operation, although the lower limit of autoregulation tended to be lower in patients before HCA (p = 0.053). During patient rewarming, COx was lower in the HCA group (p = 0.045), and abnormal COx was less frequent (31% vs 75%, p = 0.047) compared with the non-HCA group. CONCLUSIONS During aortic reconstructive operations, CBF autoregulation is preserved during the cooling phase of the procedure in patients undergoing HCA. Perfusion maneuvers associated with HCA may be protective against impaired autoregulation during rewarming compared with the non-HCA group.","Ono, Masahiro; Brown, Charles; Lee, Jennifer K; Gottesman, Rebecca F; Kraut, Michael; Black, James; Shah, Ashish; Cameron, Duke E; Baumgartner, William; Hogue, Charles W",The Annals of thoracic surgery,39,16

METHODS In this retrospective study, factors associated with long-term (>21 days) severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a conhort of 609 patients from two hospitals in Wuhan. RESULTS The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding was 19 days (interquartile range, 10-28 days) among all patients. There were 42% of patients having prolonged viral shedding time (>21 days), in which the longest viral shedding time was 58 days. When comparing patients with early (≤21 days) and late viral RNA clearance (>21 days), prolonged viral shedding was associated with age <65 (P=0.015), female sex (P=0.028), cough (P=0.025), fatigue (P=0.035), sore throat (P=0.013), aspartate aminotransferase (P=0.038), procalcitonin (P=0.010), albumin (P=0.003), D-dimer (P=0.011), lung involvement (P=0.014), reticular shadow (P<0.001) and lung consolidation (P=0.004).

CONCLUSIONS Long-term viral shedding (>21 days) is not a rare phenomenon among COVID-19 infectious patients. Age range (<65) and female sex are independent risk factors for long-term viral shedding. Early antiviral treatment should be considered for COVID-19 patients with such risk factors. Further study should be conducted to know the infectivity of patients with long-term viral shedding in order to develop reasonable control measures.","Zhou, Miao; Yu, Fei-Fei; Tan, Li; Zhu, Yu-Dan; Ma, Ning; Song, Li-Jun; Li, Qi; Liu, Yang; Zou, Zui; Xu, Tian-Ying; Yu, Chao",American journal of translational research,39,11

To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. \emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on \textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic \& social activity.","Talekar, Alok; Shriram, Sharad; Vaidhiyan, Nidhin; Aggarwal, Gaurav; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Venkatramanan, Srini; Wang, Lijing; Adiga, Aniruddha; Sadilek, Adam; Tendulkar, Ashish; Marathe, Madhav; Sundaresan, Rajesh; Tambe, Milind",ArXiv,39,1

The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of BLRV were most similar to those of Soybean dwarf virus (SbDV). Phylogenetic analyses employing the neighbour-joining method and sister-scanning analysis indicated that the BLRV nonstructural proteins were closely related to those of Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV), a luteovirus: The region surrounding the frameshift at the junction between ORFs 1 and 2 also contained sequences very similar to those of BYDV-PAV and a Dianthovirus, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus. Similar analyses showed that the structural proteins were most similar to those of the Polerovirus genus. The 3'-noncoding regions downstream of ORF5 contained sequences similar to translational control elements identified in the BYDV-PAV genome. These data suggest that BLRV, like SbDV, is derived either through selection from a common ancestor with BYDV-PAV or that BLRV is the product of two recombination events between luteovirus-like and polerovirus-like ancestors where the 5' 2900 nt and 3' 700 nt of the BLRV genome are from a Luteovirus and the intervening sequences are derived from a Polerovirus:","Domier, Leslie L; McCoppin, Nancy K; Larsen, Richard C; D'Arcy, Cleora J",The Journal of general virology,39,17

By mid-April 2009, two pediatric patients were identified in the United States who were confirmed to be infected by a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain. The present article describes the first identified severe respiratory infection and the first death associated with pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) in Canada. METHODS Enhanced public health and laboratory surveillance for pH1N1 was implemented throughout Alberta on April 24, 2009. Respiratory specimens from all patients with a respiratory illness and travel history or those presenting with a severe respiratory infection requiring hospitalization underwent screening for respiratory viruses using molecular methods. For the first severe case identified and the first death due to pH1N1, histocompatibility leukocyte antigens were compared by molecular methods. RESULTS The first death (a 39-year-old woman) occurred on April 28, 2009, and on May 1, 2009, a 10-year-old child presented with severe respiratory distress due to pH1N1. Both patients had no travel or contact with anyone who had travelled to Mexico; the cases were not linked. Histocompatibility antigen comparison of both patients did not identify any notable similarity. pH1N1 strains identified in Alberta did not differ from the Mexican strain. CONCLUSION Rapid transmission of pH1N1 continued to occur in Alberta following the first death and the first severe respiratory infection in Canada, which were identified without any apparent connection to Mexico or the United States. Contact tracing follow-up suggested that oseltamivir may have prevented ongoing transmission of pH1N1.","Zahariadis, George; Joffe, Ari R; Talbot, James; Devilliers, Albert; Campbell, Patricia; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Wong, Sallene; Bastien, Nathalie; Li, Yan; Mitchell, Robyn L; Pang, Xiao-Li; Yanow, Stephanie; Chui, Linda; Predy, Gerald; Willans, David; Lee, Bonita E; Preiksaitis, Jutta K; Clement, Bev; Jacobs, Angela; Jaipaul, Joy; Fonseca, Kevin",The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,39,9

Therefore, LAB could be used for heterologous protein secretion and they are good potential candidates as antigen delivery vehicles. To develop such live vaccines, a better control of protein secretion is required. We developed an efficient secretion system in the model LAB, Lactococcus lactis. Staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) was used as the reporter protein. We first observed that the quantity of secreted Nuc correlated with the copy number of the cloning vector. The nuc gene was cloned on a high-copy number cloning vector and no perturbation of the metabolism of the secreting strain was observed. Replacement of nuc native promoter by a strong lactococcal one led to a significant increase of nuc expression. Secretion efficiency (SE) of Nuc in L. lactis was low, i.e., only 60% of the synthesized Nuc was secreted. Insertion of a synthetic propeptide between the signal peptide and the mature moiety of Nuc increased the SE of Nuc. On the basis of these results, we developed a secretion system and we applied it to the construction of an L. lactis strain which secretes a bovine coronavirus (BCV) epitopeprotein fusion (BCV-Nuc). BCV-Nuc was recognized by both anti-BCV and anti-Nuc antibodies. Secretion of this antigenic fusion is the first step towards the development of a novel antigen delivery system based on LAB-secreting strains.","Langella, P; Le Loir, Y",Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,39,1

We also found that two retroviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and murine leukemia virus, both expressing green fluorescent protein and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein or S-protein variants, efficiently infected HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2. Infection mediated by an S-protein variant whose cytoplasmic domain had been truncated and altered to include a fragment of the cytoplasmic tail of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein was, in both cases, substantially more efficient than that mediated by wild-type S protein. Using S-protein-pseudotyped SIV, we found that the enzymatic activity of ACE2 made no contribution to S-protein-mediated infection. Finally, we show that a soluble and catalytically inactive form of ACE2 potently blocked infection by S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus and by SARS-CoV.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other air pollutants measured in Seoul over the two 30 day periods before and after the start of social distancing are analyzed to assess the change in air quality during the period of social distancing. The 30 day mean PM2.5 concentration decreased by 10.4% in 2020, which is contrasted with an average increase of 23.7% over the corresponding periods in the previous 5 years. The PM2.5 concentration decrease was city-wide and more prominent during daytime than at nighttime. The concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) decreased by 16.9% and 16.4%, respectively. These results show that social distancing, a weaker forcing toward reduced human activity than a strict lockdown, can help lower pollutant emissions. At the same time, synoptic conditions and the decrease in aerosol optical depth over the regions to the west of Seoul support that the change in Seoul's air quality during the COVID-19 social distancing can be interpreted as having been affected by reductions in the long-range transport of air pollutants as well as local emission reductions.","Han, Beom-Soon; Park, Kyeongjoo; Kwak, Kyung-Hwan; Park, Seung-Bu; Jin, Han-Gyul; Moon, Sungju; Kim, Jong-Won; Baik, Jong-Jin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),39,3

Though the benefits of service learning are widely acknowledged within the literature, there is little documentation of the associated challenges. Drawing on reflections from our own practice, and those of colleagues from a variety of institutions across the UK, we propose four key areas of risk associated with the integration of service learning into undergraduate medical education: unsafe encounters, patient disempowerment, inequality of experience and misalignment of service and learning priorities. Considering each area in turn, we identify contributory factors alongside practical recommendations to mitigate these risks. Acknowledgement of this subject is timely as medical schools develop their curricula to reflect evolving service and patient priorities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to encourage discussion and debate amongst the medical education community at a time where emphasis is being increasingly placed on medical students as being active participants in the delivery of patient care.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the associated symptoms for COVID-19 cases, to estimate the proportion of contacts and to describe the clinical signs and behaviors among individuals with/without myocardial infarction history among cases and contacts. METHODS: A two-week cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted during the first lock-down period in France, from 2020 May 4th to 15th. A total of 668 households participated representing 703 individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the past two years and 849 individuals without myocardial infarction history. RESULTS: High rates of compliance with health measures were self-reported, regardless of age or risk factors. Four confirmed COVID-19 cases were registered from four different households. Based on deductive assumptions, 9.73% were identified as contacts of whom 71.52% were asymptomatic. Among individuals with myocardial infarction history, two were COVID-19 cases, and the estimated proportion of contacts was 8.68% of whom 68.85% were asymptomatic. The cases and contacts presented different symptoms, with more respiratory signs. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone survey could be a relevant tool for reporting the number of contacts on a limited period and territory, based on the presence of associated symptoms and COVID-19 cases in the households. This study advanced our knowledge to better prepare for future crises.","Fraticelli, Laurie; Freyssenge, Julie; Claustre, Clément; Martinez, Mikaël; Redjaline, Abdesslam; Serre, Patrice; Bochaton, Thomas; El Khoury, Carlos",,39,24

We have investigated the possibility of using the Stryker Flyte surgical helmet as a respiratory protective device against airborne- and droplet-transmitted disease, since the helmet shares many features with powered air-purifying respirators.Materials and methods - Using an aerosol particle generator, we determined the filtration capacity of the Stryker Flyte helmet by placing particle counters measuring the concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, and 5 µm particles inside and outside of the helmet.Results - We found that the helmet has insufficient capacity for filtrating aerosol particles, and, for 0.3 µm sized particles, we even recorded an accumulation of particles inside the helmet.Interpretation - We conclude that the Stryker Flyte surgical helmet should not be used as a respiratory protective device when there is a risk for exposure to aerosol containing SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, in accordance with the recommendation from the manufacturer.","Temmesfeld, Max Joachim; Jakobsen, Rune Bruhn; Grant, Peter",Acta Orthop,39,20

Further research is required to halt progression of multi-organ injury induced by hyper-inflammation. AREAS COVERED: PubMed/MEDLINETM databases were accessed between May 9th-June 9th, 2020, to review the latest perspectives on the treatment and pathogenesis of CRS. EXPERT OPINION: Over-activity of chemotaxis triggers a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and TNF- &#945; are at the forefront of hyper-inflammation. The inflammatory cascade induces endothelial activation and capillary leak, leading to circulatory collapse and shock. As endothelial dysfunction persists, there is activation of the clotting cascade and microvascular obstruction. Continued endothelial activation results in multi-organ failure, regardless of pulmonary tissue damage. We propose that targeting the endothelium may interrupt this cycle. Immuno-modulating therapies have been suggested, however, further data is necessary to confirm that they do not jeopardize adaptive immunity. Inhibition of IL-6 and the Janus Kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins pathway (JAK/STAT), are favorable targets. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces the inflammation of sepsis in animal models and should be considered as a low risk intervention, in combination with cardiovascular protection.","Pearce, Lucie; Davidson, Sean M; Yellon, Derek M",Expert Opin Ther Targets,39,6

The mechanism of their action is based on insulin-independent reduction of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, which leads to stimulation of its excretion in the urine and, accordingly, to a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood plasma. Drugs of this group demonstrate effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but their use may be associated with an increased frequency of urinary tract infections. Pharmacological glucosuria, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood, creates the preconditions for the occurrence of urinary tract infections. Urinary tract and genital infections are the most common adverse events associated with the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors.

AIM: This paper examines the possible clinical conditions that may require intervention by the paediatric dentist, distinguishing clinical situations that fall into the category of paediatric dental emergencies from conditions of oral pathologies that normally do not represent an emergency. The definition of rigorous and highly effective infection control protocols in the dental settings must therefore be complemented by the development and strengthening of remote communication techniques with the parents, who must be adequately educated on preventive and palliative measures for the management of their children's oral health, with the aim of postponing clinical attendance to when the circumstances become favourable. CONCLUSIONS: The experience gained with these approaches and models of treatment, where remote interaction techniques play a central role, will hone the communication skills of the paediatric dentist and will retain its usefulness even at the end of the current emergency period.","Luzzi, Valeria; Ierardo, Gaetano; Bossù, Maurizio; Polimeni, Antonella",Int. j. paediatr. dent,39,25

Suggestions for change include offering specific discussions from mental health professionals and peer workers, vaccine education and awareness focused for those with SMI, vaccination programmes within mental health services (with coexistent organisational change to facilitate this), alignment with other preventative health strategies (such as influenza vaccination, smoking cessation, metabolic monitoring), focused outreach and monitoring uptake.13 Monitoring of vulnerable groups vaccine uptake itself presents problems. In the case of mental illness, multiple long-term conditions across mental and physical health domains as well as socio-economic factors means that both vulnerability and inequality are likely to be additive.11 However, vaccine impact may be greater among the most vulnerable despite lower vaccine uptake because the baseline absolute risk is so high.15 Therefore, in the context of a COVID-19 vaccine programme, even if vaccine uptake falls short in some high-risk groups, even small increases in vaccine uptake will still have significant health benefits.14 Uptake of vaccination is crucial both for the individual and protection of others.","Smith, Katharine Lambe Sinéad Freeman Daniel Cipriani Andrea",Evidence - Based Mental Health,39,16

One of the interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options. This study will contribute to paving the way towards the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially for the immunocompromised individuals.","Han, Hyun Jee; Nwagwu, Chinekwu; Anyim, Obumneme; Ekweremadu, Chinedu; Kim, San",Int Immunopharmacol,39,1

Although glucose metabolism in neurons and astrocytes has been extensively studied, the glucose metabolism of microglia and oligodendrocytes, and their interactions with neurons and astrocytes, remain critical to understand brain function. Brain regions with heterogeneous cell composition and cell-type-specific profiles of glucose metabolism suggest that metabolic networks within the brain are complex. Signal transduction proteins including those in the Wnt, GSK-3ß, PI3K-AKT, and AMPK pathways are involved in regulating these networks. Additionally, glycolytic enzymes and metabolites, such as hexokinase 2, acetyl-CoA, and enolase 2, are implicated in the modulation of cellular function, microglial activation, glycation, and acetylation of biomolecules. Given these extensive networks, glucose metabolism dysfunction in the whole brain or specific cell types is strongly associated with neurologic pathology including ischemic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders. This review characterizes the glucose metabolism networks of the brain based on molecular signaling and cellular and regional interactions, and elucidates glucose metabolism-based mechanisms of neurological diseases and therapeutic approaches that may ameliorate metabolic abnormalities in those diseases.","Zhang, Shuai; Lachance, Brittany Bolduc; Mattson, Mark P; Jia, Xiaofeng",Prog Neurobiol,39,1

Earlier hospital discharge in low-risk patients who present with STEMI has been an area of focus in an attempt to reduce health care costs. As a result, discharge within 48-72 hours after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention has increasingly become routine practice. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to enormous pressure on health care systems to find ways to increase bed capacity, preserve resources, and reduce the risk of exposure to patients and health care workers. In response to this goal, the Ottawa Heart Institute has developed and implemented a novel Very Early Hospital Discharge (VEHD) protocol. The VEHD protocol is a simple, 4-step algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk STEMI patients who can be safely discharged between 20 and 36 hours after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention. When deemed eligible for VEHD predischarge tasks are completed by the treating medical and nursing team and the patient is discharged home. Follow-up is completed remotely via virtual care (48 hours, 7 days, 30 days), and in the outpatient cardiology clinic (4-6 weeks). Amid a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we believe the VEHD protocol is a crucial step in maintaining exceptional quality of care, in terms of patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, while concurrently decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections, and reducing resource utilization.","Marbach, Jeffrey A; Alhassani, Saad; Chong, Aun-Yeong; MacPhee, Erika; Le May, Michel",Can J Cardiol,39,26

The Difficult Airway Society developed an electronic database to facilitate this. Previous studies have surveyed attitudes and behaviours of anaesthetists and primary care physicians but not patients. Aim We sought opinions of patients who received a difficult airway database alert card (signifying their pre-consented registration) on a variety of topics. Methods We asked 10 questions regarding i) Quality of information received, ii) Views on the relevance of the alert card, iii) patients overall experience, iv) their opinion regarding paying a fee. Results All 402 patients on the database were contacted once (follow-up curtailed by COVID-19). We received 221 replies (55%). Ninety-seven percent (205/211) reported the card useful, 90% (191/211) recalling the information given. All those (49/203, 24%) having a further anaesthetic had presented their card to the anaesthetist/perioperative team. 6% (13/203) felt anxious having the card and almost one fifth (12/67) of the respondents suggested improved communication between anaesthetists, patients and primary care physicians (GPs). Half of responders were willing to pay for the service, while 17% (36/211) were not. Conclusion Difficult airway alert cards are well received by the patients and are re-presented when future anaesthetics are required. Improved transfer of information between anaesthetists, primary care physicians and patients was a popular theme in the feedback. The issuing of an airway alert card may prove to be a vehicle for this in the future.","Sajayan, Achuthan Mir Fauzia Quffa Leila Ponnusamy Karthik McNarry Alistair",Trends in Anaesthesia and Critical Care,39,20

Clinical manifestations vary widely among patients with MIS-C, and the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective surveillance study, patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (younger than 21 years, fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, admitted to hospital, multisystem [&#8805;2] organ involvement [cardiac, renal, respiratory, haematological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological], no alternative plausible diagnosis, and either laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or known COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks before symptom onset) were reported from state and local health departments to the CDC using standard case-report forms. Factors assessed for potential links to severe outcomes included pre-existing patient factors (sex, age, race or ethnicity, obesity, and MIS-C symptom onset date before June 1, 2020) and clinical findings (signs or symptoms and laboratory markers). Logistic regression models, adjusted for all pre-existing factors, were used to estimate odds ratios between potential explanatory factors and the following outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock, decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, and coronary artery abnormalities. FINDINGS: 1080 patients met the CDC case definition for MIS-C and had symptom onset between March 11 and Oct 10, 2020. ICU admission was more likely in patients aged 6-12 years (adjusted odds ratio 1·9 [95% CI 1·4-2·6) and patients aged 13-20 years (2·6 [1·8-3·8]), compared with patients aged 0-5 years, and more likely in non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with non-Hispanic White patients (1·6 [1·0-2·4]). ICU admission was more likely for patients with shortness of breath (1·9 [1·2-2·9]), abdominal pain (1·7 [1·2-2·7]), and patients with increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, troponin, ferritin, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro B-type BNP, or interleukin-6, or reduced platelet or lymphocyte counts. We found similar associations for decreased cardiac function, shock, and myocarditis. Coronary artery abnormalities were more common in male patients (1·5 [1·1-2·1]) than in female patients and patients with mucocutaneous lesions (2·2 [1·3-3·5]) or conjunctival injection (2·3 [1·4-3·7]).

Most of such schemes, however, are applicable to small molecules and can hardly be viewed as error-free for excited state geometries. In this study, a theoretical approach is presented in which the excited state geometries of molecules can be predicted by using vibrationally resolved experimental absorption spectrum in combination with the theoretical modelling of vibrational pattern based on Franck-Condon approximation. Huang-Rhys factors have been empirically determined and used as input for revealing the structural changes occurring between the ground and the excited state geometries upon photoexcitation. Naphthalene molecule has been chosen as a test case to show the robustness of the proposed theoretical approach. Predicted 1B2u excited state geometry of the naphthalene has similar but slightly different bond length alternation pattern when compared with the geometries calculated with CIS, B3LYP, and CC2 methods. Excited state geometries of perylene and pyrene molecules are also determined with the presented theoretical approach.

DESIGN: Thematic analysis of free-text responses to an open-ended online survey. SETTING: Between March and November 2019, we recruited 88 patients (82% women) and 14 carers aged &#8805;18 years from 16 English mental health trusts, community organisations, and via social media. RESULTS: Psychosocial assessments were experienced as helpful on some occasions but harmful on others. Participants felt better, less suicidal and less likely to repeat self-harm after good-quality compassionate and supportive assessments. However, negative experiences during the assessment pathway were common and, in some cases, contributed to greater distress, less engagement and further self-harm. Participants reported receiving negative and stigmatising comments about their injuries. Others reported that they were refused medical care or an anaesthetic. Stigmatising attitudes among some mental health staff centred on preconceived ideas over self-harm as a 'behavioural issue', inappropriate use of services and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight important patient experiences that can inform service provision and they demonstrate the value of involving patients/carers throughout the research process. Psychosocial assessments can be beneficial when empathetic and collaborative but less helpful when overly standardised, lacking in compassion and waiting times are unduly long. Patient views are essential to inform practice, particularly given the rapidly changing service context during and after the COVID-19 emergency.","Quinlivan, Leah M; Gorman, Louise; Littlewood, Donna L; Monaghan, Elizabeth; Barlow, Steven J; Campbell, Stephen M; Webb, Roger T; Kapur, Navneet",BMJ Open,39,1

Social media platforms such as Twitter have been widely used by individuals worldwide to express their responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal changes in the attitudes of Twitter users who used e-cigarettes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compare differences in attitudes between e-cigarette users and nonusers based on Twitter data. METHODS: The study dataset containing COVID-19-related Twitter posts (tweets) posted between March 5 and April 3, 2020, was collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface with COVID-19-related keywords. Twitter users were classified into two groups: Ecig group, including users who did not have commercial accounts but posted e-cigarette-related tweets between May 2019 and August 2019, and non-Ecig group, including users who did not post any e-cigarette-related tweets. Sentiment analysis was performed to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups and determine whether the sentiment expressed was positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling was performed to compare the main topics discussed between the groups. RESULTS: The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 4,500,248 COVID-19-related tweets collected from 187,399 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 11,479,773 COVID-19-related tweets collected from 2,511,659 unique Twitter users in the non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that Ecig group users had more negative sentiment scores than non-Ecig group users. Results from topic modeling indicated that Ecig group users had more concerns about deaths due to COVID-19, whereas non-Ecig group users cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that Twitter users who tweeted about e-cigarettes had more concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform public health practitioners to use social media platforms such as Twitter for timely monitoring of public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and educating and encouraging current e-cigarette users to quit vaping to minimize the risks associated with COVID-19.","Gao, Yankun; Xie, Zidian; Li, Dongmei",JMIR Public Health Surveill,39,24

Here we studied the medium term effects of COVID-19 on survivors of severe disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective, case series of 200 patients hospitalised across three large Birmingham hospitals with severe-to-critical COVID-19 infection 4-7 months from disease-onset. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical, laboratory, imaging, lung function test, quality of life and cognitive assessments. RESULTS: At 4-7 months from disease-onset, 63.2% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness, 53.5% complained of significant fatigue, 37.5% reduced mobility and 36.8% pain. Serum markers of inflammation and organ injuries that persisted at hospital discharge had normalised on follow-up indicating no sustained immune response causing chronic maladaptive inflammation. Chest radiographs showed a complete resolution in 82.8%; and significantly improved or no change in 17.2%. Lung function test (LFT) revealed gas transfer abnormalities in 80.0% and spirometry in 37.6% patients. Patients with breathlessness had significantly high incidence of comorbidities, abnormal residual chest X-ray and LFT (p<0.01 to all).

It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of""Is there any need for 6G?""by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of""What 6G may look like?"". This survey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and further investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G communications systems.","Jiang, Wei; Han, Bin; Habibi, Mohammad Asif; Schotten, Hans Dieter",,39,1

The present study utilized a hierarchical binary logistic regression model to assess demographic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, pre-existing medical conditions), political party membership, religious affiliation, level of religiosity, and fear of COVID-19 as predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ('Yes', would receive a vaccine or 'No', would not receive a vaccine) in a national sample of US adults (N = 249). Participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and completed several online questionnaires pertaining to mental health, health behaviors, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Democratic party membership and decreased level of religiosity predicted acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. This investigation supports political party membership and religiosity as influencers of COVID-19 vaccine willingness and suggests that these variables could represent potential targets for public health interventions aimed at increasing vaccine adoption.","Milligan, Megan A; Hoyt, Danielle L; Gold, Alexandra K; Hiserodt, Michele; Otto, Michael W",Psychol Health Med,39,1

Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses widely distributed among different animal species and humans in which they cause respiratory, enteric, liver and neurological symptomatology. Six species of coronavirus have been described (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) that cause cold-like symptoms in immunocompetent or immunocompromised subjects and two strains of sometimes fatal zoonotic origin that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).The SARS-CoV-2 strain is the emerging seventh member of the coronavirus family, which is actually determining a global emergency. In silico analysis is a promising approach for understanding biological events in complex diseases and due to serious worldwide emergency and serious threat to global health, it is extremely important to use bioinformatics methods able to study an emerging pathogen like SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report on in silico comparative analysis between complete genome of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 strains, to identify the occurrence of specific conserved motifs on viral genomic sequences which should be able to bind and therefore induce a subtraction of host's Transcription Factors (TFs) which lead to a depletion, an effect comparable to haploinsufficiency (a genetic dominant condition in which a single copy of wild-type allele at a locus, in heterozygous combination with a variant allele, is insufficient to produce the correct quantity of transcript and, therefore, of protein, for a correct standard phenotypic expression). In this competitive scenario, virus versus host, the proposed in silico protocol identified the TFs same as the distribution of TFBSs (Transcription Factor Binding Sites) on analyzed viral strains, potentially able to influence genes and pathways with biological functions confirming that this approach could brings useful insights regarding SARS-CoV-2. According to our results obtained by this in silico approach it is possible to hypothesize that TF-binding motifs could be of help in the explanation of the complex and heterogeneous clinical presentation in SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently predict possible interactions regarding metabolic pathways, and drug or target relationships.","Chetta, Massimiliano; Rosati, Alessandra; Tarsitano, Marina; Bukvic, Nenad",Heliyon,39,1

RANDOMISATION: Randomisation (with a 1:1 randomisation ratio) will be centrally performed by using a secure, web-based system, which will be developed by the Methodological and Statistical Unit at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Modena. Randomisation stratified by 4 factors: 1) Gender (M/F); 2) Age (<75/&#8805;75 years); 3) BMI (<30/&#8805;30); 4) Comorbidities (0-1/>2) with random variable block sizes will be generated by STATA software. The web-based system will guarantee the allocation concealment. Blinding (masking) The study is conceived as open-label: patients and all health-care personnel involved in the study will be aware of the assigned group. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that LMWH administered at high doses versus low doses will significantly reduce the risk of clinical worsening. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 300 with 150 in the Low-Dose LMWH control group and 150 in the High-Dose LMWH intervention group, recruited over 10-11 months. Assuming an alpha of 5% (two tailed) and a percentage of patients who experience clinical worsening in the control group being between 25% and 30%, the study will have 80% power to detect at least 50% relative reduction in the risk of death between low and high doses of heparin.

However, observational studies, including non-randomized cohort studies, as well as small RCTs have gained increasing attention especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where critical evaluation of limited therapeutic options are sought to improve patient care while awaiting results for subsequent RCTs. As the authors have previously discussed, RCTs and observational studies are complementary approaches which often appear synergistic with one another. While not all real-world studies are the same, the results of observational studies are notoriously subject to both known and unknown confounding factors. The utilization of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma is a timely illustration of evaluating the efficacy and safety of a COVID-19 therapy given the dangerous and often lethal effects of the virus and the limited approved therapeutic options for the disease. While awaiting the results of large RCTS of convalescent plasma, serval observational cohorts and small RCTs have attempted to assess the efficacy and safety of this approach with very mixed results. Among the likely reasons for this failure to provide a definitive answer concerning the value of convalescent plasma are the many limitations inherent to addressing treatment efficacy in non-randomized studies. While such studies are often able to capture information on large numbers of individuals rapidly, it is important to understand that although larger numbers may enhance the precision of estimates provided, larger numbers, in and of themselves, do not increase the accuracy of estimates due to patient selection and other biases. At the same time, both observational studies and small RCTS are at risk for publication bias due to investigator, reviewer and editorial bias toward positive studies. In this commentary we discuss the advantages and limitations of these methodologic approaches when addressing urgently needed evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapies in a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lyman, Gary H; Desai, Aakash; Leyfman, Yan; Kuderer, Nicole M",Cancer Invest,39,24

As such, the developing country like Indonesia has largely been suffering from this epidemic. In this context, this paper attempts to analyse some national security issues that are affecting Indonesia, which is currently struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed here are policy measures to combat both present and future challenges. The study uses secondary data collected from different sources concerning COVID-19 pandemic and security issues of Indonesia. The study analyses the data based on descriptive statistics, highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indonesian law enforcement issues, and security of health, food, supply chain management, industrial and other economic sectors. The study argues that if the vulnerability continues in these security-related issues due to pandemic, the country will face a harsh reality to manage the state-affairs. Therefore, the policy options are mainly concerned with the COVID-19 issue. Indonesia’s government should identify what measures to take by conducting rapid diagnostics and polymerase chain reaction tests in the laboratory, respectively. Moreover, the government and relevant stakeholders need to develop strategies that break the stranglehold of COVID-19 transmission in order to resolve Indonesian national security concern.","Alam, Md Mahmudul Fawzi Agung Masyad Islam Md Monirul Said Jamaliah",Security Journal,39,20

The quantification and localization analysis of the transcripts of a particular gene allows disease states to be characterized more directly compared to an analysis on the transcriptome wide level. This is particularly needed for the early detection of virus infections as now required for emergent viral diseases, e. g. Covid-19. In situ mRNA analysis, however, is a formidable challenge and currently performed with sets of single-fluorophore-containing oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the mRNA in question. Often a large number of probe strands (>30) are required to get a reliable signal. The more oligonucleotide probes are used, however, the higher the potential off-target binding effects that create background noise. Here, we used click chemistry and alkyne-modified DNA oligonucleotides to prepare multiple-fluorophore-containing probes. We found that these multiple-dye probes allow reliable detection and direct visualization of mRNA with only a very small number (5-10) of probe strands. The new method enabled the inâ situ detection of viral transcripts as early as 4 hours after infection.","Raddaoui, Nada; Croce, Stefano; Geiger, Florian; Borodavka, Alexander; Möckl, Leonhard; Stazzoni, Samuele; Viverge, Bastien; Bräuchle, Christoph; Frischmuth, Thomas; Engelke, Hanna; Carell, Thomas",Chembiochem,39,16

In favor of BTKi continuation, BTK plays an active role in macrophage polarization. By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID-19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections and impaired humoral immunity. We hypothesize that the potential benefit of blunting a hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 through attenuation of M1 polarization outweighs the potential risk of impaired humoral immunity, not to mention the risk of rapid progression of B-cell malignancy following BTKi interruption.

Currently, lack of data underlying how the human host interacts with viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limits effective therapeutic intervention. We introduce Viral-Track, a computational method that globally scans unmapped single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for the presence of viral RNA, enabling transcriptional cell sorting of infected versus bystander cells. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of Viral-Track to systematically detect viruses from multiple models of infection, including hepatitis B virus, in an unsupervised manner. Applying Viral-Track to bronchoalveloar-lavage samples from severe and mild COVID-19 patients reveals a dramatic impact of the virus on the immune system of severe patients compared to mild cases. Viral-Track detects an unexpected co-infection of the human metapneumovirus, present mainly in monocytes perturbed in type-I interferon (IFN)-signaling. Viral-Track provides a robust technology for dissecting the mechanisms of viral-infection and pathology.","Bost, Pierre; Giladi, Amir; Liu, Yang; Bendjelal, Yanis; Xu, Gang; David, Eyal; Blecher-Gonen, Ronnie; Cohen, Merav; Medaglia, Chiara; Li, Hanjie; Deczkowska, Aleksandra; Zhang, Shuye; Schwikowski, Benno; Zhang, Zheng; Amit, Ido",Cell,39,29

For instance, the genetic homology of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 80% and 50%, respectively, which may cause similar clinical features. Moreover, uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators (also called a cytokine storm) by activated immune cells in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 patients leads to severe phenotype development. Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the inflammatory cytokine profile associated with three strains of severe human coronavirus diseases (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Method: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published until July 2020. Randomized and observational studies reporting the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe and non-severe human coronavirus diseases, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval to estimate the pooled mean of inflammatory biomarkers. Results: A high level of circulating IL-6 could be associated with the severity of infection of the three coronavirus strains. TNF, IL-10, and IL-8 are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Increased circulating levels of CXCL10/IP10 and CCL2/MCP-1 might also be related to the severity of MERS. Conclusion: This study suggests that the immune response and immunopathology in the three severe human coronavirus strains are somewhat similar. The findings highlight that nearly all studies reporting severe cases of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have been associated with elevated levels of IL-6. This could be used as a potential therapeutic target to improve patients' outcomes in severe cases.

But this digital sphere requires comprehension of the new codes that have emerged, to lead to innovative synergies between the online and the offline world. Which only can be enhanced with bi-directional interaction, setting to interlock, involve and cause the spectator's attention. The arrival of Covid-19 to Ecuador has been a big opportunity to advance in ICT dissemination and digital mediation techniques, even though it's not enough to replace collective experience. This research is oriented to analyze the digital marketing strategies for artists and artistic products during the Covid-19 pandemic. It's an inductive quanti-qualitative approach, with a micro-ethnographic design, and we applied semi-structured interviews. We interviewed seventeen artists, producers, cultural managers, and cultural promotors from several fields of cultural activity in Cuenca, Ecuador. We looked for persons implicated in art projects during the sanitary emergency in the country. We've analyzed about nineteen projects in total, with a twenty questions questionary. The procedure of this research is to collect, systematize, and analyze all data we 're using with MAXQDA software. This study showed us that the arts and cultural sector are complex. Artists use to manage and promote events too, in other cases must generate formative processes like a sustainable source of income. This scenario turned out more complex, although, a part of the projects held on the pandemic and have created new kinds of entertaining and interactive content. Also, there is a thin line between entertaining and building community content. Finally, we found out that giving priority to customer loyalty is an indicator of high levels of cultural marketing practices.","Carmona, Medardo Amyr Sarmiento Torres-Toukoumidis Angel",Academy of Marketing Studies Journal,39,16

We aimed to study predictors of in-hospital death, characteristics of arrhythmias and the effects of QT-prolonging therapy in patients with cardiac injury. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between Jan. 29 and Mar. 8, 2020. Among patients who had cardiac injury, which we defined as an elevated level of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), we identified demographic and clinical characteristics associated with mortality and need for invasive ventilation. RESULTS: Among 1284 patients with severe COVID-19, 1159 had a cTnI level measured on admission to hospital, of whom 170 (14.7%) had results that showed cardiac injury. We found that mortality was markedly higher in patients with cardiac injury (71.2% v. 6.6%, p < 0.001). We determined that initial cTnI (per 10-fold increase, hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.66) and peak cTnI level during illness (per 10-fold increase, HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.38-2.10) were associated with poor survival. Peak cTnI was also associated with the need for invasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.02, 95% CI 1.92-4.98). We found arrhythmias in 44 of the 170 patients with cardiac injury (25.9%), including 6 patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, all of whom died. We determined that patients who received QT-prolonging drugs had longer QTc intervals than those who did not receive them (difference in medians, 45 ms, p = 0.01), but such treatment was not independently associated with mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.69-1.57). INTERPRETATION: We found that in patients with COVID-19 and cardiac injury, initial and peak cTnI levels were associated with poor survival, and peak cTnI was a predictor of need for invasive ventilation. Patients with COVID-19 warrant assessment for cardiac injury and monitoring, especially if therapy that can prolong repolarization is started.

Hence, it has become important to improve public understanding of science with a focus on explaining the nature of uncertainty in science and its impacts. The goal of the present study was to explore pre-service teachers' analysis of claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout an 8-week online implementation of a pre-service teachers' analysis task, focus group interviews, and instructor's feedback to this analysis in a course focusing on critical and analytical thinking. In order to achieve this purpose, the researchers used the claims that contain fallacies, conspiracy theories, and scientific arguments related to the COVID-19 pandemic as an assessment tool. The researchers developed and used a rubric consisting of the high, moderate, and low levels of analysis in three different categories including evaluation of claims, demarcation of fallacies and conspiracy theories from scientific arguments, and judgment of the credibility of sources. The findings indicate that the participants analyzed the claims rarely at a high level before the focus group interviews. However, after the focus group interviews, almost every participant's analysis scores of evaluation, demarcation, and judgment increased. The results also revealed their commitment to various fallacies and conspiracy theories while arguing the claims. Concluding remarks are made for the further implications of teaching critical evaluation of claims based on evidence.","Saribas, Deniz; Çetinkaya, Ertan",Sci Educ (Dordr),39,1

The next important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in underserved hypertension patients. METHODS: Implementation of Multifaceted Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. FQHC clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care. Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome. The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0 mmHg difference in systolic BP at a 0.05 significance level and 80% follow-up rate.

An internet-mediated research (IMR) approach is used to investigate the effectiveness of using technology and translational research as strategies for disseminating a rapidly produced digital guide, for promoting play-based learning at home, to parents. Lockdown with the closure of early years provision led to parents finding themselves isolated at home with young children. Early years educators were managing a unique set of circumstances where communication with families, including those 'harder-to-reach' was contextually problematic. Qualitative data using IMR captured online interactions by unobtrusive and obtrusive methods; unsolicited emails and social media comments and questionnaire responses. Conventional content analysis identified emerging themes of access, availability, reliability and readability. Analysis showed a combination of factors impacted on the speed and scale of sharing and downloading the digital guide. First, being digitally ready as platforms were already used by early years educators and Local Authorities. Second, the professional drive of Local Authorities and early years educators to support families during the crisis and third, the availability of an easily accessible online resource seen as valuable in improving play-based learning at home.","Laxton, Debra; Cooper, Linda; Younie, Sarah",British journal of educational technology,39,1

Clinical outcomes, stratified as outpatient treatment, inpatient without mechanical ventilation, inpatient with mechanical ventilation, or death, will be correlated with CT and biological markers. The main objective is to assess the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities-including pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac morphology, and vascular congestion. Secondary objectives include the predictive value of cardiovascular abnormalities in terms of disease severity and fatal outcome and the association of lung inflammation with vascular abnormalities at the segmental level. New quantitative approaches derived from CT imaging are developed and evaluated in this study. Patients with and without vascular abnormalities will be compared, which is supposed to provide insights into the prognostic role and potential impact of such signs on treatment strategy.

They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified. This review discusses various host and virus-mediated PTMs that play a role in the outcome during the infection.","Kumar, Ramesh; Mehta, Divya; Mishra, Nimisha; Nayak, Debasis; Sunil, Sujatha",Int. j. mol. sci.

Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7 ± 19.4 vs. 63.3 ± 18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) observed in the 30-39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p < 0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and intensive care unit admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p < 0.001. Conclusion: Our results indicate important sex-dependent differences in the diagnosis, clinical manifestation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19.

As an alternative, and to improve finite sample performance, this paper considers bootstrap-based inference for interval estimation and testing. Specifically, for a wide class of point process models we consider a novel bootstrap scheme labeled 'fixed intensity bootstrap' (FIB), where the conditional intensity is kept fixed across bootstrap repetitions. The FIB, which is very simple to implement and fast in practice, extends previous ideas from the bootstrap literature on time series in discrete time, where the so-called 'fixed design' and 'fixed volatility' bootstrap schemes have shown to be particularly useful and effective. We compare the FIB with the classic recursive bootstrap, which is here labeled 'recursive intensity bootstrap' (RIB). In RIB algorithms, the intensity is stochastic in the bootstrap world and implementation of the bootstrap is more involved, due to its sequential structure. For both bootstrap schemes, we provide new bootstrap (asymptotic) theory which allows to assess bootstrap validity, and propose a 'non-parametric' approach based on resampling time-changed transformations of the original waiting times. We also establish the link between the proposed bootstraps for point process models and the related autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models. Lastly, we show effectiveness of the different bootstrap schemes in finite samples through a set of detailed Monte Carlo experiments, and provide applications to both financial data and social media data to illustrate the proposed methodology.","Cavaliere, Giuseppe; Lu, Ye; Rahbek, Anders; Staerk-Ostergaard, Jacob",,39,26

Water scarcity at home increasingly compromises agricultural production. Farmland investments abroad have not matched ambitious related announcements due to a complex mixture of commercial, socio-economic and political factors. They do not contribute meaningful quantities to the Gulf countries' food imports. The failure of such strategies has prompted a shift of focus instead towards value chain management as a means to secure food availability. Rather than trying to fight food import dependence, the Gulf countries now accept and manage it. However, malnutrition that leads to high levels of obesity and diabetes constitutes a risk factor in the face of COVID-19.

The presence and localization of PE as well as the type and extent of pulmonary opacities on chest CT exams were examined and correlated with the information on comorbidities and laboratory values for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, pulmonary embolism was discovered in 24 patients. We observed that 87% of PE was found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 pneumonia.

Statistical models to evaluate the different outcomes of the study-arms will include study-arm as a factor along with any covariate that might affect the results. To ensure that the effects of the covariates are confounded to the least possible extent with the effects of the arms, stratified randomization can be applied. However, there is at present no clear-cut procedure when there are multiple covariates. METHODS: For parallel study designs with simultaneous enrollment of all subjects prior to intervention, we propose a D-optimal blocking procedure to allocate subjects with known values of the covariates to the study arms. We prove that the procedure minimizes the variances of the baseline differences between the arms corrected for the covariates. The procedure uses standard statistical software. RESULTS: We demonstrate the potential of the method by an application to a human parallel nutritional intervention trial with three arms and 162 healthy volunteers. The covariates were gender, age, body mass index, an initial composite health score, and a categorical indicator called first-visit group, defining groups of volunteers who visit the clinical centre on the same day (17 groups). Volunteers were allocated equally to the study-arms by the D-optimal blocking procedure. The D-efficiency of the model connecting an outcome with the study-arms and correcting for the covariates equals 99.2%. We simulated 10,000 random allocations of subjects to arms either unstratified or stratified by first-visit group. Intervals covering the middle 95% of the D-efficiencies for these allocations were [82.0, 92.0] and [93.2, 98.4], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Allocation of volunteers to study-arms with a D-optimal blocking procedure with the values of the covariates as inputs substantially improves the efficiency of the statistical model that connects the response with the study arms and corrects for the covariates.

It was initially thought to be specific to children, but recent reports have shown that it can also occur in adults. MIS-C is characterized by a number of multisystemic manifestations resembling other known previously described illnesses, mainly Kawasaki disease, especially in cases with shock, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. Available literature shows that our knowledge of MIS-C is largely incomplete. Its development in strict relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection seems documented and, in most cases, can be considered a post-infectious manifestation secondary to an abnormal immune response for some aspects, similar to that seen in adults several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in a minority of cases, a clinical picture with symptoms fulfilling criteria for MIS-C diagnosis develops during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly likely that the criteria currently used to diagnose MIS-C are too broad, meaning that children with different diseases are included. As clarity on the pathogenesis of MIS-C is lacking, different therapeutic approaches have been used, but no specific therapy is currently available. Further studies are urgently needed to improve our definition of MIS-C, to define the real impact on child health, and to elucidate the best clinical and therapeutic approach and true prognosis.","Esposito, Susanna; Principi, Nicola",Paediatr. drugs (Online),39,23

In the light of the arrival of a novel contagious and life-threatening virus, the NHS has responded by making difficult decisions to maintain care for patients and protect staff. The response has been frequently amended following updates in the UK Government policy as scientific understanding of the virus has improved. Our Plastic Surgery practice has adapted to mitigate risk to patients by reducing face-to-face contact, downgrading emergency procedures and deferring elective surgery where possible. This has inevitably resulted in a backlog in elective surgery and outpatient appointments. An assessment of the long-term health, social and economic impact of NHS wide service reconfiguration upon patient outcomes is yet to be seen. In this paper, we review the demonstrable early effects of service changes upon our unit and compare those to national and internationally published data.

Compassion is defined as noticing, feeling and responding to suffering. However, compassion is typically seen as an individual rather than a more systemic response to suffering and cannot match the scale of the problem as a result. The authors develop a model of a compassion system and details its antecedents (leader behaviors and a compassionate human resource (HR) bundle), its climate or the extent that the organization values, supports and rewards expression of compassion and the behaviors and practices through which it is enacted (standardization and customization) and its effects on efficiently reducing suffering and delivering high quality care.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses a conceptual approach that synthesizes the literature in health services, HR management, organizational behavior and service operations to develop a new conceptual model.FindingsThe paper makes three key contributions. First, the authors theorize the central importance of compassion and a collective commitment to compassion (compassion system) to reducing pervasive patient and care provider suffering in health care. Second, the authors develop a model of an organizational compassion system that details its antecedents of leader behaviors and values as well as a compassionate HR bundle. Third, the authors theorize how compassion climate enhances collective employee well-being and increases standardization and customization behaviors that reduce suffering through more efficient and higher quality care, respectively.Originality/valueThis paper develops a novel model of how health care organizations can simultaneously achieve efficiency and quality through a compassion system. Specific leader behaviors and practices that enable compassion climate and the processes through which it achieves efficiency and quality are detailed. Future directions for how other service organizations can replicate a compassion system are discussed.","Vogus, Timothy J.; McClelland, Laura E.; Yuna, S. H.

However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as well as the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. METHODS: We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020, when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. A total of 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 nonusers) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (&#967;262=335.3; P<.05; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI]=0.92; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06) and suicidal ideation (&#967;234=50.8; P<.05; CFI=0.99; NNFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (ß=-.07; P=.04) but not among younger people (ß=.04; P=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger people (ß=.09; P=.02) and older people (ß=.10; P=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (ß=-.01; P=.04) but not among younger people (ß=.01; P=.31). The direct effect of social media use on suicidal ideation was not statistically significant in either age group (P>.05). The indirect effects via PTSD symptoms were statistically significant among younger people (ß=.02; P=.04) and older people (ß=.03; P=.01). Social loneliness was not a significant mediator between social media use and suicidal ideation among either age group (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Social media may be a ""double-edged sword"" for psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its roles vary across age groups. The mediators identified in this study can be addressed by psychological interventions to prevent severe mental health problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Xue; Yip, Benjamin H K; Mak, Arthur D P; Zhang, Dexing; Lee, Eric K P; Wong, Samuel Y S",JMIR Public Health Surveill,39,16

DESIGN: Original Article. SETTING: Intensive care units at a single-center teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients under contact and special droplet precautions. INTERVENTIONS: Relocation of intravenous pumps for COVID-19 patients from bedside to outside the patient room using extension tubing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary objective of the study was to measure the impact of this strategy on COVID-19 exposure, utilizing the number of nurse entries into the patient room as a surrogate endpoint, and extrapolation of this data to determine the reduction or PPE usage. Secondary endpoints included incidence of extravasation, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and diagnosis of CLABSI/bacteremia. A statistically significant reduction in the primary endpoint of the study was observed as room entries prior to pump relocation averaged 15.36 (± 4.10) as opposed to an average of 7.92 (± 2.19) following pump relocation (p < 0.0001). In both pre- and post-pump relocation groups, there was no incidence of extravasation or CLABSI. No significant differences were noted in number of patients experiencing hyperglycemia, hypotensive episodes, or bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant decrease in COVID-19 exposure based on the number of nurse entries following the relocation of intravenous pumps from inside to outside of the patient room.

The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted in different phases of the outbreak in a COVID-19 hospital hub, with a particular focus on age, multimorbidity, and functional dependency. The clinical records of 1264 patients with clinical and radiological features compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in February-June, 2020, were analyzed, retrieving demographical, clinical, laboratory data, and outcomes. All variables were compared after stratification by the period of admission (first phase: rising slope of pandemic wave; second phase: plateau and falling slope), age, results of the first reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), multimorbidity (&#8805;2 chronic diseases), and presence of disability. Factors independently associated with hospital mortality were determined by multivariate forward-selection logistic regression. Patients admitted during the second phase were older, more frequently multimorbid, disabled, and of female gender. However, on admission they exhibited milder respiratory impairment (PaO2/FiO2 268, IQR 174-361, vs. 238, IQR 126-327 mmHg, p < 0.001) and lower mortality (22% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Age, respiratory exchanges, positive RT-PCR test, number of chronic diseases (odds ratio (OR) 1.166, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.036-1.313, p = 0.011), and disability (OR 1.927, 95% CI 1.027-3.618, p = 0.022) were positively associated with mortality, while admission during the second phase exhibited an inverse association (OR 0.427, 95% CI 0.260-0.700, p = 0.001). In conclusion, older multimorbid patients were mainly hospitalized during the second phase of the pandemic wave. The prognosis was strongly influenced by the COVID-19 phenotype and period of admission, not just by age, multimorbidity, and disability.","Ticinesi, Andrea; Nouvenne, Antonio; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Parise, Alberto; Prati, Beatrice; Guerra, Angela; Meschi, Tiziana",,39,16

These include non-specific symptoms (e.g., headaches and fatigue) which were found to be affected by psychological processes in other disorders (e.g., post-concussion syndrome, PCS, after mild traumatic brain injury). The current study assessed the impact of diagnosis threat (i.e., information regarding the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19) and suggestibility on endorsed symptoms of both recovered patients and healthy controls. Method: Recovered patients (nâ¯=â¯90) and healthy controls (nâ¯=â¯210) described their cognitive functioning after being randomly assigned to: (a) Experimental group: These participants read an article that explored long-term neurological symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. (b) Control group: These participants read an article providing general information regarding the disease. Results: Recovered patients, but not healthy controls, endorsed more symptoms in the experimental condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, suggestibility was correlated with endorsement of symptoms. Conclusions: Post COVID-19 neurological symptoms may, at least partially, be affected by non-neurological factors such as diagnosis threat. Information regarding long-term effects of COVID-19 may skew reported symptoms with highly suggestible individuals particularly susceptible to these effects. Further research, however, is needed to validate and elaborate upon these initial findings.","Winter, Daniella; Braw, Yoram",Int J Clin Health Psychol,39,30

The worldwide consensus that physical distancing is an effective instrument for mitigating the spread of the virus has led policymakers to temporarily limit the freedom of movement of people between and within countries, cities, and even neighborhoods. These public health-related restrictions on human mobility yielded an unprecedented fragmentation of international and national food distribution systems. Focusing on food retailing - usually being modestly oligopolistic - we take a micro-economic perspective as we analyze the potential consequences this disruption has for the physical as well as for the economic access of households to food at the local level. As the mobility constraints implemented substantially reduced competition, we argue that food retailers might have been tempted to take advantage of the implied fragmentation of economic activity by exploiting their temporarily raised market power at the expense of consumers and farmers. We illustrate our point by providing empirical evidences of rising wholesale-retail as well as farm-retail price margins observed during the Covid-19 crisis. Subsequently, we review existing empirical approaches that can be used to quantify and decompose the micro-economic effects of crises on food demand and supply as well as the size and structure of the market, costs of trade, and economic welfare. The employment of such approaches facilitates policymakers' understanding of micro-economic effects of public health-induced mobility restrictions on economic activity.","Ihle, Rico; Rubin, Ofir D; Bar-Nahum, Ziv; Jongeneel, Roel",Food Secur,39,26

Participants completed a newly developed COVID-19 Fear (Higher Education) scale to measure three domains of fear including fear of infection, fear of instability and fear of insecurity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. They also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) on the severity of anxiety symptoms. About 9.6% of the participants could be classified as exhibiting high anxiety level according to the GAD-7. More students studying overseas (about 15%) were classified into the high GAD group when compared to students studying in both mainland China (6.6%) and Hong Kong (6.1%). MANOVA results showed that students studying in Hong Kong and overseas had more concerns related to preventive measures related to COVID-19 than their mainland counterparts did. We concluded that international students studying away from their home country would have higher risk to develop anxiety problems during a collective trauma such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hence, this study aims to investigate adolescents' self-concept before and during a lockdown period in relation to gender and type/amount of physical activity or sports. The pre-lockdown sample of 366 adolescents were aged 13-17 years (M = 15.51 +or- 0.65), of whom 192 (52.5%) were females and 174 (47.5%) were males. During the lockdown, the age range of the sample was 13-17 years (M = 14.57 +or- 1.47), of whom 82 (60.3%) were females, and 54 (39.7%) were males. The Form-5 Self-concept Questionnaire (AF-5) was used to measure adolescents' self-concept. There was a reduction in adolescents' overall self-concept during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was positively associated with emotional well-being, with family and peers being essential factors in the development of an appropriate self-concept. Furthermore, girls' self-concept, especially academic self-concept, was higher than that of boys during the lockdown. However, both physical and emotional self-concept were higher for boys than girls before the COVID-19 lockdown, although no differences were found during the lockdown. The findings reveal that physical activity was positively correlated to self-concept before and during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Gonzalez-Valero, G.; Zurita-Ortega, F.; Lindell-Postigo, D.; Conde-Pipo, J.; Grosz, W.

Although there are multiple articles evaluated the imaging findings in HRCT of COVID-19 patients that helped in understanding the disease course and potential complications in the chest, yet there are—to our knowledge—limited data about the abdominal imaging findings of the course and potential abdominal complications of COVID-19 notably in the intensive care units (ICU). Results: Forty-one sonographic examinations were done for 30 confirmed COVID-intensive care patients presented with abdominal symptoms. Of the 30 patients, 26 were males (86.66%), and 4 were females (13.3%), the average age of the patients was 57.7 years old.

For instance, COVID-19 and climate change affect deprived and vulnerable communities the most, which implies that effectively designed policies that mitigate these risks may also reduce the widening inequalities that they cause. Both problems can be characterized as low-probability-high consequence (LP-HC) risks, which are associated with various behavioral biases that imply that individual behavior deviates from rational risk assessments by experts and optimal preparedness strategies. One could view the COVID-19 pandemic as a rapid learning experiment about how to cope more effectively with climate change and develop actions for reducing its impacts before it is too late. However, the ensuing question relates to whether the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath will speed up climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, which depends on how individuals perceive and take action to reduce LP-HC risks. Using insights into behavioral biases in individual decisions about LP-HC risks based on decades of empirical research in psychology and behavioral economics, we illustrate how parallels can be drawn between decision-making processes about COVID-19 and climate change. In particular, we discuss six important risk-related behavioral biases in the context of individual decision making about these two global challenges to derive lessons for climate policy. We contend that the impacts from climate change can be mitigated if we proactively draw lessons from the pandemic, and implement policies that work with, instead of against, an individual's risk perceptions and biases. We conclude with recommendations for communication policies that make people pay attention to climate change risks and for linking government responses to the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath with environmental sustainability and climate action.","Botzen, Wouter; Duijndam, Sem; van Beukering, Pieter",World Dev,39,24

However, most previous methods only utilized the limited information of RGB images and may fail to discover the potential pedestrians in unconstrained environments. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people. Furthermore, to facilitate the multimodal crowd counting, we propose a cross-modal collaborative representation learning framework, which consists of multiple modality-specific branches, a modality-shared branch, and an Information Aggregation-Distribution Module (IADM) to fully capture the complementary information of different modalities. Specifically, our IADM incorporates two collaborative information transfer components to dynamically enhance the modality-shared and modality-specific representations with a dual information propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for RGBT crowd counting. Moreover, the proposed approach is universal for multimodal crowd counting and is also capable to achieve superior performance on the ShanghaiTechRGBD dataset.","Liu, Lingbo; Chen, Jiaqi; Wu, Hefeng; Li, Guanbin; Li, Chenglong; Lin, Liang",,39,13

These are the viral loop, the hyperinflammatory loop, the non-canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis loop, and the hypercoagulation loop. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2 lights the wick by infecting alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and downregulating the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (Ang-1-7)/Mas1R axis. The viral feedback loop includes evading the host's innate response, uncontrolled viral replication, and turning on a hyperactive adaptative immune response. The inflammatory loop is composed of the exuberant inflammatory response feeding back until exploding in an actual cytokine storm. Downregulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1R axis leaves the lung without a critical defense mechanism and turns the scale to the inflammatory side of the RAS. The coagulation loop is a hypercoagulable state caused by the interplay between inflammation and coagulation in an endless feedback loop. The result is a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state producing acute immune-mediated lung injury and eventually, adult respiratory distress syndrome.","Domingo, Pere; Mur, Isabel; Pomar, Virginia; Corominas, Héctor; Casademont, Jordi; de Benito, Natividad",EBioMedicine,39,21

Methods: The COVID-19 cases in Guangdong Province onset from January 1 to February 29, 2020 were collected from Chinese information system for disease control and prevention and Emergency Public Reporting System. Obtain the epidemiological survey data of the cluster epidemic situation, and clarify the scale of cluster epidemic situation, the characteristics of the index cases, family and non-family subsequent cases. Calculate serial interval according to the onset time of the index cases and subsequent cases, secondary attack rate based on the close contacts tracking results, the characteristics of different cases in the clustered epidemic were compared. Results: A total of 283 cluster were collected, including 633 index cases, 239 subsequent cases. Families are mainly clustered, the total number involved in each cluster is in the range of 2-27, M (P25, P75) are 2.0 (2.0, 4.0). During January 15 to February 29, the secondary attack rate is 2.86% (239/8 363) in Guangdong Province, the family secondary attack rate was 4.84% (276/3 697), and the non-family secondary attack rate was 1.32% (61/4 632). According to the reporting trend of the number of cases in Guangdong Province, it can be divided into four stages, the rising stage, the high platform stage, the descending stage and the low level fluctuation period. The secondary attack rate of the four stages were 3.5% (140/3 987), 2.3% (55/2 399), 2.6% (37/1 435), 1.3% (7/542), respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.003). Conclusion: COVID-19 cluster mainly occurs in families in Guangdong Province. The scale of the clustered epidemic was small; the serial interval was short; and the overall secondary attack rate was low.","Zhuang, Y L; Zhang, Y T; Li, M; Luo, M; Zhu, Z H; Tan, X H; Yi, Y; Chen, X G; Deng, A P; Zheng, H Z; Kang, M; Song, T; Sun, L M",Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,39,20

Unlike most of the other reported studies on COVID-19 lockdown, this study provides variations over a unique tropical rural environment located at a scientifically strategic location in the Southern Indian peninsula. Striking differences in the time series and diurnal variability have been observed in different phases of the lockdown. The levels of most species that are primarily emitted from anthropogenic activities reduced significantly during the lockdown which also impacted the levels and diurnal variability of secondary species like O3. When compared with the same periods in 2019, short-lived trace gas species such as NO, NO2, SO2 which have direct anthropogenic emission influence have shown the reduction over 50%, whereas species like CO and O3 which have direct as well as indirect impacts of anthropogenic emissions have shown reductions up to 10%. Long-lived species (CO2 and CH4) have shown negligible difference (<1%). BC and AOD have shown reductions over 20%. Particulate Matter (1, 2.5 and 10) reductions have been in the range of 40 to 50% when compared to the pre-lockdown period. The changes in shortwave downward radiation at the surface, diffuse component due to the scattering and diffuse fraction have been +2.2%, -4.1% and -2.4%, respectively, in comparison with 2019. In contrast with the studies over urban environments, air quality category over the rural environment remained same during the lockdown despite reduction in pollutants level. All the variations observed for different species and their associated chemistry provides an excellent demonstration of rural atmospheric chemistry and its intrinsic links with the precursor concentrations and dynamics.","Jain, Chaithanya D; Madhavan, B L; Singh, Vikas; Prasad, P; Sai Krishnaveni, A; Ravi Kiran, V; Venkat Ratnam, M",Environ Res,39,16

This paper reports on a trans-national, qualitative study in which practitioners in England, Scotland and New Zealand have been trained in Foebelian storytelling techniques and rigorous documentation and analysis of children's narratives. These have beeen used in their pedagogy to encourage young children to express and explore their COVID experiences through their sequenced play narratives, which have been documented, curated and then analysed by their key practitioners in dialogue with a team of early year's researchers. The praxeological project is informed by Freirean theoretical concepts of empowerment, conscientization, agency and voice. An initial thematic analysis of the play narratives reveals children are expressing a desire to regain their daily life and routines, be with their friends, have extended time to play, be outdoors, and have authentic information.

Most governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by imposing a lockdown. Some evidence suggests that a period of isolation might have led to a spike in alcohol misuse, and in the case of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), social isolation can favour lapse and relapse. The aim of our position paper is to provide specialists in the alcohol addiction field, in psychopharmacology, gastroenterology and in internal medicine, with appropriate tools to better manage patients with AUD and COVID-19,considering some important topics: (a) the susceptibility of AUD patients to infection;(b) the pharmacological interaction between medications used to treat AUD and to treat COVID-19;(c) the reorganization of the Centre for Alcohol Addiction Treatment for the management of AUD patients in the COVID-19 era (group activities, telemedicine, outpatients treatment, alcohol-related liver disease and liver transplantation, collecting samples);(d) AUD and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Telemedicine/telehealth will undoubtedly be useful/practical tools even though it remains at an elementary level;the contribution of the family and of caregivers in the management of AUD patients will play a significant role;the multidisciplinary intervention involving experts in the treatment of AUD with specialists in the treatment of COVID-19 disease will need implementation. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly leading addiction specialists towards a new governance scenario of AUD, which necessarily needs an in-depth reconsideration, focusing attention on a safe approach in combination with the efficacy of treatment.","Testino, Gianni Vignoli Teo Patussi Valentino Allosio Pierluigi Amendola Maria Francesca Aricò Sarino Baselice Aniello Balbinot Patrizia Campanile Vito Fanucchi Tiziana Macciò Livia Meneguzzi Cristina Mioni Davide Parisi Michele Renzetti Doda Rossin Raffaella Gandin Claudia Bottaro Luigi Carlo Caio Giacomo Lungaro Lisa Zoli Giorgio Scafato Emanuele Caputo Fabio",Addiction Biology,39,20

This MD-informed attention model was integrated into BioBERT and tested on 2 public machine reading comprehension benchmarks for clinical trial publications: Evidence Inference 2.0 and PubMedQA. We also curated a small set of recently published articles reporting randomized controlled trials on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) following the Evidence Inference 2.0 guidelines to evaluate the model's robustness to unseen data. RESULTS: The integration of MD-informed attention head improves BioBERT substantially in both benchmark tasks-as large as an increase of +30% in the F1 score-and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on the Evidence Inference 2.0.

Neurotrauma/traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause activation of glial cells, neurons, and neuroimmune cells in the brain to release neuroinflammatory mediators. Neurotrauma leads to immediate primary brain damage (direct damage), neuroinflammatory responses, neuroinflammation, and late secondary brain damage (indirect) through neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondary brain damage leads to chronic inflammation and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective and specific therapeutic options to treat these brain damages or neurodegenerative diseases. Flavone luteolin is an important natural polyphenol present in several plants that show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, cytoprotective, and macrophage polarization effects. In this short review article, we have reviewed the neuroprotective effects of luteolin in neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disorders and pathways involved in this mechanism. We have collected data for this study from publications in the PubMed using the keywords luteolin and mast cells, neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and TBI. Recent reports suggest that luteolin suppresses systemic and neuroinflammatory responses in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Studies have shown that luteolin exhibits neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms, including suppressing immune cell activation, such as mast cells, and inflammatory mediators released from these cells. In addition, luteolin can suppress neuroinflammatory response, activation of microglia and astrocytes, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the severity of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and TBI pathogenesis. In conclusion, luteolin can improve cognitive decline and enhance neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases, TBI, and stroke.","Kempuraj, Duraisamy; Thangavel, Ramasamy; Kempuraj, Deepak D; Ahmed, Mohammad Ejaz; Selvakumar, Govindhasamy Pushpavathi; Raikwar, Sudhanshu P; Zaheer, Smita A; Iyer, Shankar S; Govindarajan, Raghav; Chandrasekaran, Premkumar Nattanmai; Zaheer, Asgar",Biofactors,39,22

The input of orthogeriatric teams is invaluable in coordinating secondary fragility fracture prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid restructuring of health care teams and led to the redeployment of orthogeriatricians. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact COVID-19 had on the secondary prevention of fragility fractures among patients with femoral neck fractures, and to optimize management in this population. METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of patients with femoral neck fractures before and after the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. A reaudit was conducted following the development of our new mnemonic, ""MRS BAD BONES,"" which addressed key factors in the assessment and management of osteoporosis: medication review, rheumatology/renal advice, smoking cessation; blood tests, alcohol limits, DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan; bone-sparing medications, orthogeriatric review, nutrition, exercise, supplements. The Fisher exact test was used for comparison analyses between each phase. RESULTS: Data for 50 patients were available in each phase. The orthogeriatric team reviewed 88% (n=44) of patients prelockdown, which fell to 0% due to redeployment, before recovering to 38% (n=19) in the postintervention period. The lockdown brought a significant drop in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements from 81.6% (n=40) to 58.0% (n=29) (P=.02); of bone-sparing medications from 60.7% (n=17) to 18.2% (n=4) (P=.004), and DEXA scan requests from 40.1% (n=9) to 3.6% (n=1) (P=.003). Following the implementation of our mnemonic, there was a significant increase in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements to 85.7% (n=42) (P=.003), bone-sparing medications to 72.4% (n=21) (P<.001), and DEXA scan requests to 60% (n=12) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The redeployment of the orthogeriatric team, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in the study population. The ""MRS BAD BONES"" mnemonic significantly improved management and could be used in a wider setting.","Stephens, Alastair; Rudd, Hannah; Stephens, Emilia; Ward, Jayne",JMIR Aging,39,16

Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value <0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18-6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18-17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46-6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71-14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96-7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06-5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15-15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41-8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.","Belete, Zebader Walle; Berihun, Gete; Keleb, Awoke; Ademas, Ayechew; Berhanu, Leykun; Abebe, Masresha; Gizeyatu, Adinew; Hassen, Seada; Teshome, Daniel; Lingerew, Mistir; Feleke, Alelgne; Natnael, Tarikuwa; Adane, Metadel",PLoS One,39,18

Therefore, there is a crucial need for safe and effective therapies. Ultraviolet-A (UVA) phototherapy is FDA-approved for several dermatological diseases but not for internal applications. We investigated UVA effects on human cells in vitro, mouse colonic tissue in vivo, and UVA efficacy against bacteria, yeast, coxsackievirus group B and coronavirus-229E. Several pathogens and virally transfected human cells were exposed to a series of specific UVA exposure regimens. HeLa, alveolar and primary human tracheal epithelial cell viability was assessed after UVA exposure, and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine was measured as an oxidative DNA damage marker. Furthermore, wild-type mice were exposed to intracolonic UVA as an in vivo model to assess safety of internal UVA exposure. Controlled UVA exposure yielded significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridioides difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. UVA-treated coxsackievirus-transfected HeLa cells exhibited significantly increased cell survival compared to controls. UVA-treated coronavirus-229E-transfected tracheal cells exhibited significant coronavirus spike protein reduction, increased mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein and decreased coronavirus-229E-induced cell death. Specific controlled UVA exposure had no significant effect on growth or 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in three types of human cells. Single or repeated in vivo intraluminal UVA exposure produced no discernible endoscopic, histologic or dysplastic changes in mice. These findings suggest that, under specific conditions, UVA reduces various pathogens including coronavirus-229E, and may provide a safe and effective treatment for infectious diseases of internal viscera. Clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of UVA in humans.","Rezaie, Ali; Leite, Gabriela G S; Melmed, Gil Y; Mathur, Ruchi; Villanueva-Millan, Maria Jesus; Parodi, Gonzalo; Sin, Jon; Germano, Juliana F; Morales, Walter; Weitsman, Stacy; Kim, Seung Young; Park, Jae Ho; Sakhaie, Siamak; Pimentel, Mark",PLoS One,39,6

Three types of doubly strapped TADAPs were prepared as nickel(II) complexes using meso-N-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-substituted TADAP and the corresponding aliphatic diacids as precursors. Theoretical calculations revealed that regardless of their oxidation states, all strapped TADAPs had essentially flat &#960;-planes. It was found that the alkyl-chain straps slightly affected the optical and electrochemical properties of the DAP rings, particularly in the oxidized forms. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the antiaromatic character of the 20&#960; TADAPs and the aromatic character of the 18&#960; TADAP dications, and it was observed that they displayed paratropic and diatropic ring-current effects, respectively, on the chemical shifts of methylene protons in the spatially separated alkyl chains. The degree of shielding and deshielding depended on the position of the methylene units; it decreased with increase in separation from the &#960;-plane and central axis of the porphyrin ring. The NMR experiments also revealed that the degree of the diatropic ring currents was clearly related to the &#960;-electron density of the porphyrin ring; the ring-current effects decreased as the charge increased from 0 to +2. These findings are also qualitatively supported by the nucleus-independent chemical shifts.","Ochiai, Hikari; Furukawa, Ko; Nakano, Haruyuki; Matano, Yoshihiro",J. org. chem,39,18

It has appeared in 196 countries around the world. We aimed to clarify the associations between fasting plasma glucose levels and mortality of COVID-19 in patients without diabetes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center study of 151 patients without diabetes in Tongji Hospital from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020. Past medical histories, clinical features and laboratory parameters were collected in these patients. RESULTS: Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to have underlying medical conditions including hypertension and chronic pulmonary diseases. Non-survivors had higher C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) levels, while lower lymphocyte counts as compared with those of survivors (all P<0.05). Besides, patients with higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) had higher IL-6, IL-8, CRP levels and mortality; while lower lymphocyte counts. After adjusting for age and gender, each tertile increment of FPG levels conferred 3.54-fold higher risks of death (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidential interval, 1.25-10.06, P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Non-survivors combined with more comorbidities, more severe infection, and worse liver, kidney and cardiac function in patients without diabetes. Additionally, fasting plasma glucose levels were significantly associated with the risk of death in patients even with normal FPG and HbA1c levels.","Huang, Yun; Guo, Heming; Zhou, Yan; Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Tiantian; Zhao, Xuming; Li, Hui; Sun, Yihui; Bian, Xuna; Fang, Chen",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,39,15

To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first method to precisely estimate upto 25 skeletal key-points using mmWave radar data alone. Skeletal pose estimation is critical in several applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, patient monitoring, gait analysis, to defense security forensics, and aid both preventative and actionable decision making. The use of mmWave radars for this task, over traditionally employed optical sensors, provide several advantages, primarily its operational robustness to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions, where optical sensor performance degrade significantly. The mmWave radar point-cloud (PCL) data is first voxelized (analogous to tokenization in NLP) and $N$ frames of the voxelized radar data (analogous to a text paragraph in NLP) is subjected to the proposed mmPose-NLP architecture, where the voxel indices of the 25 skeletal key-points (analogous to keyword extraction in NLP) are predicted. The voxel indices are converted back to real world 3-D coordinates using the voxel dictionary used during the tokenization process. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the accuracy of the proposed system against the ground truth, with the proposed mmPose-NLP offering<3 cm localization errors in the depth, horizontal and vertical axes. The effect of the number of input frames vs performance/accuracy was also studied for N = {1,2,..,10}. A comprehensive methodology, results, discussions and limitations are presented in this paper.

We reported our Institutional Experience, with specific aims to describe the distribution and type of treated injuries, and the organizational setup of our hospital. Methods: Data of fractured patients admitted for surgical treatment in the time frames 9 March 2020–4 May 2020 and 1 March 2019–31 May 2019 were collected and compared. Furthermore, surgery duration and some parameters of effectiveness in health management were compared. Results: A total of 498 patients were included. Mean age significantly lower age in 2019 and femoral fractures were significantly more frequent 2020. Mean surgery time was significantly longer in 2020. Mortality rate difference between the two years was found to be statistically significant. Time interval between diagnosis and surgery and between diagnosis and discharge/decease was significantly lower in 2020. In 2020, no patient admitted with a negative swab turned positive in any of the following tests for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the epidemiology of hospitalized patients for traumatic reasons, leading to an increased admission of older patients with femoral fractures. Nevertheless, our institutional experience showed that an efficient change in the hospital organization, with an improvement of several parameters of effectiveness in health management, led to a null infection rate between patients.","Brayda-Bruno, M.; Giorgino, R.; Gallazzi, E.; Morelli, I.; Manfroni, F.; Briguglio, M.; Accetta, R.; Mangiavini, L.; Peretti, G.

Early uptake among HCWs was 62.3% (1409/2260), however there were significant differences in uptake between age groups, ethnic origins, and job roles. Uptake increased to 72.9% after a vaccine hesitancy working group implemented specific measures. In the 42 days after vaccination, 49 new cases of COVID-19 were identified, of which 7 (14.3%) occurred in HCWs who were beyond 10 days of vaccination. Kaplan-Meier curves for partially vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were congruent until day 14 and continued to diverge up to 42 days. Cox regression analysis showed a 70.0% (95%CI 6.0-91.0; p=0.04) risk reduction for COVID-19 infection in partially vaccinated HCWs.

In this viewpoint, we assess how the Commission has considered health co-benefits in the key response domains. Extrapolating UK evidence to the New Zealand context suggests climate change mitigation strategies that reduce air pollution, transition the population towards plant-based diets and increase physical activity via active transport could prevent thousands of deaths per year in coming decades. Substantial health co-benefits would also arise from improved housing, cleaner water, noise reductions, afforestation and more compact cities. The Commission's draft report only briefly mentions many of these health co-benefits, and some are completely absent. We recommend the Commission's final report: (i) use health co-benefits as an explicit frame;(ii) ensure the government's Treaty of Waitangi obligations are met in all the domains covered to maximise benefits for Maori health and wellbeing;(iii) build on the successful COVID-19 response that demonstrated rapid, science-informed and vigorous government action can address major global health threats;(iv) include both public health expertise and Maori health expertise among its commissioners;(v) explain how health co-benefits are likely to generate major cost-savings to the health system.","Chambers, T.; Hales, S.; Shaw, C.; Baker, M.; Ball, J.; Cleghorn, C.; Wilson, N.",New Zealand Medical Journal,39,32

Online exams can facilitate cheating when there is no direct proctoring. To provide some form of control in unproctored exams, Cluskey et al. (2011) suggested having substantial time pressure;yet there are no clear recommendations on how to implement it. We conducted an experiment comparing three implementations of time pressure (individual allocation of time, equal time for each task, and time-based on task length) in a low-stakes educational sciences exam. Students differed in their answering strategies and objective performance but not in their evaluations of the different conditions. We suggest having equal time for each task to maximize students’ performance with minimal opportunities to cheat.

Older adults (over age 65) are perceived as most physiologically vulnerable to COVID-19 and at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to social isolation imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias we used a random sampling of older adults to understand uptake and acceptance of technologies to support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in technology use for virtual socialization amongst older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based regionally representative survey using random-digit dialing to participants over age 65 living in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with open-text responses analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults with an average age of 72 years old and 63.7% female. Most respondents (89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others and slightly more than half (56%) reported using technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. 55.9% of respondents reported adopting new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported key barriers to using technology including: (1) lack of access (including finance, knowledge, and age); (2) lack of interest (including a preference for telephone, and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults reported numerous facilitators, including: (1) knowledge of technologies (whether self-taught or via external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searching); (3) technology accessibility (including environments, user-friendly technology, and receiving clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (because everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults use of technology is limited by sampling biases, but the current study that used random sampling demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Virtual socialization is most promising to mitigate potential mental health effects related to virus containment strategies. Addressing barriers by mobilizing telephone training and task lists, and mobilizing facilitators described by participants such as facilitated socialization activities are important strategies that can be implemented within and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.","Haase, Kristen R; Cosco, Theodore; Kervin, Lucy; Riadi, Indira; O039,; Connell, Megan E",,39,17

However, AZM-associated QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias have been reported. Integrated mechanistic information on AZM actions on human ventricular excitation and conduction is lacking. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the actions of AZM on ventricular cell and tissue electrical activity. The O'Hara- Virag-Varro-Rudy dynamic (ORd) model of human ventricular cells was modified to incorporate experimental data on the concentration-dependent actions of AZM on multiple ion channels, including INa, ICaL, IKr, IKs, IK1 and INaL in both acute and chronic exposure conditions. In the single cell model, AZM prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner, which was predominantly attributable to IKr reduction in the acute condition and potentiated INaL in the chronic condition. High concentrations of AZM also increased action potential (AP) triangulation (determined as an increased difference between APD30 and APD90) which is a marker of arrhythmia risk. In the chronic condition, the potentiated INaL caused a modest intracellular Na + concentration accumulation at fast pacing rates. At the 1D tissue level, the AZM-prolonged APD at the cellular level was reflected by an increased QT interval in the simulated pseudo-ECG, consistent with clinical observations. Additionally, AZM reduced the conduction velocity (CV) of APs in the acute condition due to a reduced INa, and it augmented the transmural APD dispersion of the ventricular tissue, which is also pro-arrhythmic. Such actions were markedly augmented when the effects of chronic exposure of AZM were also considered, or with additional IKr block, as may occur with concurrent use of other medications. This study provides insights into the ionic mechanisms by which high concentrations of AZM may modulate ventricular electrophysiology and susceptibility to arrhythmia.","Liu, Yizhou Zhang Rai Hancox Jules C.; Zhang, Henggui",Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports,39,16

Outcomes based on primary tumor location after salvage hepatic radioembolization with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres (Y90) are not well studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess survival outcomes in patients with advanced chemorefractory mCRC treated with Y90 radioembolization, stratified by primary tumor location, and to explore potential factors predictive of survival. METHODS: A total of 99 patients with mCRC liver metastases progressive on systemic therapy treated with Y90 at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. In 89 patients, tumor response on first imaging follow-up (CT or MRI at 1.9 ± 0.9 months after Y90) was evaluated using RECIST. Overall survival (OS), post-Y90 OS, and hepatic progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Outcomes, and associations of outcomes with tumor response, were compared between patients with left- and right-sided tumors. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients had left-sided colon cancer, and 25 patients had right-sided colon cancer. Median OS from the time of mCRC diagnosis was 37.2 months, median post-Y90 OS was 5.8 months, and median hepatic PFS was 3.3 months. Based on RECIST, progressive disease on first imaging follow-up was observed in 38 patients (43%) post-Y90 and was associated with shorter post-Y90 OS compared to disease control on first imaging follow-up (4.0 vs 10.5 months, p < .001). Patients with right-sided primaries showed decreased post-Y90 OS compared to patients with left-sided primaries (5.4 vs 6.2 months, p = .02). Right- and left-sided primaries showed no significant difference in RECIST tumor response, hepatic PFS, or extrahepatic disease progression (p > .05). Post-Y90 survival was significantly lower in patients with progressive disease than with disease control among left-sided primaries (4.2 vs 13.9 months, p < .001), though not for right-sided primaries (7.2 vs 3.3 months, p = .05). CONCLUSION: Right-sided primary tumor was independently associated with decreased survival in patients with chemorefractory mCRC after Y90 radioembolization, despite similar RECIST tumor response, hepatic PFS, and extrahepatic disease progression compared to those with left-sided primary tumors. CLINICAL IMPACT: Primary colon cancer location impacts outcomes after salvage Y90 radioembolization and may help guide patient selection.","Wu, Vincent; Li, Matthew D; Goodwin, J Scott; Wehrenberg-Klee, Eric P; Zurkiya, Omar; Kalva, Sanjeeva P; Ganguli, Suvranu",,39,0

A significant deterioration in air quality was experienced in Australia's most populous cities, Melbourne and Sydney, as a result of fires during the so-called Black Summer which ran from November 2019 through to February 2020. Following this period, social, mobility and economic restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented in Australia. We quantify the air quality impact of these contrasting periods in the south-eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) using a meteorological normalisation approach. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was used to compute baseline time series' of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide CO and particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5), based on a 19 year, detrended training dataset. Across Victorian sites, large increases in CO (188%), PM2.5 (322%) and ozone (22%) were observed over the RF prediction in January 2020. In NSW, smaller pollutant increases above the RF prediction were seen (CO 58%, PM2.5 80%, ozone 19%). This can be partly explained by the RF predictions being high compared to the mean of previous months, due to high temperatures and strong wind speeds, highlighting the importance of meteorological normalisation in attributing pollution changes to specific events. From the daily observation-RF prediction differences we estimated 249.8 (95% CI: 156.6-343.) excess deaths and 3490.0 (95% CI 1325.9-5653.5) additional hospitalisations were likely as a result of PM2.5 and O3 exposure in Victoria and NSW. During April 2019, when COVID-19 restrictions were in place, on average NO2 decreased by 21.5 and 8% in Victoria and NSW respectively. O3 and PM2.5 remained effectively unchanged in Victoria on average but increased by 20 and 24% in NSW respectively, supporting the suggestion that community mobility reduced more in Victoria than NSW. Overall the air quality change during the COVID-19 lockdown had a negligible impact on the calculated health outcomes.","Ryan, Robert G; Silver, Jeremy D; Schofield, Robyn",Environ Pollut,39,16

METHODS: From April 1 to April 28, 2020, the authors conducted a national survey advertised via e-mail lists, social media, and direct e-mail. Participants were self-selecting, U.S.-based volunteers. Scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C were used. The relationships between personal resilience and risk factors, work culture and stressors and supports, and COVID-19-related events were examined. RESULTS: Of 1,685 participants (76% female, 88% White), 31% (404 of 1,311) endorsed mild anxiety, and 33% (427 of 1,311) clinically meaningful anxiety; 29% (393 of 1,341) reported mild depressive symptoms, and 17% (233 of 1,341) moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 5% (64 of 1,326) endorsed suicidal ideation; and 14% (184 of 1,300) screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder.

Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with cognitive impairment in older adults. However, less is known regarding the association between CBF and functional decline, and whether CBF predicts functional decline beyond cerebrovascular and metabolic risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between regional CBF and functional decline in nondemented older adults. METHOD: One hundred sixty-six (Nâ=â166) participants without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Pulsed arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging was acquired to quantify resting CBF. Everyday functioning was measured using the Functional Assessment Questionnaire at baseline and annual follow-up visit across three years. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, education, sex, cognitive status, depression, white matter hyperintensity volume, cerebral metabolism, and reference (precentral) CBF, linear mixed effects models showed that lower resting CBF at baseline in the medial temporal, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal lobe was significantly associated with accelerated decline in everyday functioning. Results were similar after adjusting for conventional AD biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-ß (Aß) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) É4 positivity. Individuals who later converted to dementia had lower resting CBF in the inferior temporal and parietal regions compared to those who did not. CONCLUSION: Lower resting CBF in AD vulnerable regions including medial temporal, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal lobes predicted faster rates of decline in everyday functioning. CBF has utility as a biomarker in predicting functional declines in everyday life and conversion to dementia.","Sanchez, Danielle L; Thomas, Kelsey R; Edmonds, Emily C; Bondi, Mark W; Bangen, Katherine J",J. alzheimers dis,39,1

The available data on COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is limited but generally indicate that there is an increased risk of developing COVID-19 infection in diabetic patients, which ultimately impact the overall patient's survival. Various aspects might be involved however, the exact mechanisms and interrelationships between diabetes and the novel COVID-19 have not yet been fully elucidated. This review summarizes the possible mechanisms by which present diabetes predispose individuals to COVID-19 infection, modulates the host-viral interactions and increases the risk of mortality.

This study aimed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and mortality in residential care facilities and to compare them with those recorded in nursing homes. DESIGN: Nationwide observational study conducted by French health authorities. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Since March 1, 2020, all LTCFs in France reported all COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths among their residents. METHODS: Possible cases were those with COVID-19-related symptoms without laboratory confirmation and confirmed cases those with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test or serology positive for SARS-CoV-2. We included facilities with at least 1 confirmed case of COVID-19 and estimated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality due to COVID-19 reported until June 30, 2020, using the maximum bed capacity as a denominator. RESULTS: Of the 2288 residential care facilities, 310 (14%) and, of the 7688 nursing homes, 3110 (40%) reported COVID-19 cases among residents (P < .001). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower in residential care facilities as compared with nursing homes (1.10 vs 9.97 per 100 beds, P < .001). Mortality due to COVID-19 was also lower in residential care facilities compared with nursing homes (0.07 vs 1.29 per 100 beds, P < .001). Case fatality was lower in residential care facilities (6.49% vs 12.93%, P < .001). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: French residential care facilities experienced a much lower burden from COVID-19 than nursing homes. Our findings may inform the implementation of better infection control practices in these settings.","Belmin, Joël; Georges, Scarlett; Franke, Florian; Daniau, Come; Cochet, Amandine; Durand, Cécile; Noury, Ursula; Gomes do Espirito Santo, Maria Eugênia; Fonteneau, Laure; Pariel, Sylvie; Lafuente-Lafuente, Carmelo; Danis, Kostas",J Am Med Dir Assoc,39,25

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during May 2020, using an online survey via Google forms. A self-administered validated structured questionnaire was applied, which comprised 28 questions among health care students/professionals at a tertiary care centrein North India. RESULTS: A total of 956 respondents were included (10.2% nurses, 45.2% medical students, 24.3% paramedical students, 11.7% resident doctors and 8.6% consultant doctors). Overall knowledge score was 9.3/15; the highest for preventive practices (4/5), followed by clinical knowledge (2.7/5) and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2.6/5). The overall score was the highest in consultant doctors (10.8) while the lowest in nurses (8.5) and paramedical students (8.4) (p < 0.001). Less than half of the respondents had knowledge about the correct sequence of doffing PPE and the use of N95 mask. About 21.8% of the participants experienced moderate to severe anxiety; higher among nurses (38%), followed by paramedical students (29.3%); and anxiety was higher when knowledge score was low (27.6% vs 14.7%); both factors were independent predictors on multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). Only 18.1% of the respondents applied HCQ prophylaxis - the highest proportion constituted consultants (42.7%), and the least - paramedical students (5.2%); (p < 0.001) and HCQ use was more frequently used if they had a family member of extreme age group at home (23.3% vs 12.2%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge about correct PPE usage is low among all groups of HCWs and students, and there is a high prevalence of anxiety due to COVID-19. The lower COVID-19 knowledge scores were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of anxiety and inadequate use of HCQ prophylaxis. The appliance of HCQ prophylaxis had no significant association with anxiety levels of the respondents.","Jindal, Vinita; Mittal, Saurabh; Kaur, Tanvir; Bansal, Avtar Singh; Kaur, Prabhjot; Kaur, Gurmeet; Sati, Hem C; Garg, Avneet",Adv Respir Med,39,9

The overall cesarean section rate was recorded, and the size, cesarean section rate, and absolute and relative contributions were calculated within each group. RESULTS: The overall cesarean section rate was 56.8%. The highest relative contribution to this rate came from Robson groups 5, 2 and 10, respectively. A decrease in cesarean section rate was noted in 2020 among women admitted for induction of labor (groups 2 and 4) following the implementation of new department policies and the restrictions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. CONCLUSION: More than 50% of the deliveries in our department were by cesarean sections (CS). Strategies to reduce this rate should include stricter departmental policies for avoidance of unindicated primary CS and raising practitioners' and patients' awareness about trial of labor after cesarean section.","Abdallah, Wael; Abi Tayeh, Georges; Cortbaoui, Emilia; Nassar, Malek; Yaghi, Nancy; Abdelkhalek, Yara; Kesrouani, Assaad; Finan, Ramzi; Mansour, Fersan; Attieh, Elie; Suidan, Joe; El Kassis, Nadine; Aouad, Norma; Atallah, David",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,39,25

Sodium fluoride existing in the vacutainer tubes was used to inhibit esterase activity to protect the clevidipine from hydrolysis as soon as blood was collected. Ascorbic acid and formic acid were added to the separated plasma samples to avoid the oxidation and further hydrolysis of clevidipine and H152/81. The further sample preparation was accomplished through a single step liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by ethyl acetate. The chromatography separation was carried out on an ACE Excel 3 µm SuperC18 (2.1 × 50 mm, id, ACE, United Kingdom) column with gradient elution using 10 mM ammonium acetate water solution and methanol as the mobile phase. Detection was performed in the negative ion electrospray ionization mode using multiple reaction monitoring (clevidipine: m/z 454.1 â 234.0; clevidipine-d7: m/z 461.1 â 240.1; H152/81: m/z 354.0 â 208.0; H152/81-13CD3: m/z 358.0 â 212.0). The method exhibited good linearity over the concentration ranges of 0.100 to 40.0 ng/mL for clevidipine and 5.00 to 400 ng/mL for H152/81. The intra- and inter-batch precision and accuracy of clevidipine and H152/81 were all within the acceptable criteria.

A return to pre-pandemic growth patterns will take time and depend on the depth and extent of the recession sparked by COVID-19. The recovery phase will overlap with global efforts to deal with the evolving climate crisis. For the tourism industry to thrive in a future world it must look beyond the temptation of adopting strategies based on a return to the pre-COVID-19 normal of the past and instead seek to understand how it should respond to the emerging transformation of the global economy to carbon neutrality. Many of the lessons that emerged from the pandemic can be applied to strategies to deal with climate change. Of most interest is the success of strategies such as “flattening the curve”. Application of similar strategies plus adoption of the circular economy model to wind back Green House Gas emissions will help avert the global environmental disaster that will occur if global temperatures continue to increase. These strategies point to what a future carbon-neutral economic production system might look like, the path to which could offer the tourism industry numerous opportunities to transform from the current model that favours a high resource consumption model to one that is environmentally friendly and resource neutral.","Prideaux, Bruce; Thompson, Michelle; Pabel, Anja",Tour.

Besides, their social behavior and stress level regarding COVID-19 infection were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, and applied health science students in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak quarantine in March 2020. The questionnaire comprised 38 questions assessing demographic data, knowledge, attitude, risk perception, and stress level toward COVID-19. Questions regarding infection control measures and social behavior after the quarantine were also included. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Independent samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square at a significance level of 5% were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total number of 935 responses were collected. The knowledge score of 55.72% of participants was satisfactory and it was higher for the clinical years' students compared with the basic years' students (p = 0.000) (descending order: sixth year > fifth year > fourth year > third year > first year > second year). Also, knowledge scores were significantly higher for medical and dental students than other disciplines (descending order: medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing/applied) (p = 0.000). The social media (89.1%) and TV or radio (69.5%) were mainly routes through which participants heard about COVID-19. Moderate and justifiable feelings about COVID-19 were found in the majority of the participants. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of students showed good knowledge scores, few of them appeared to have a serious lack of knowledge. Therefore, proper education and mentoring are necessary for students before reopening the university campuses.","Mustafa, Ruba M; Alrabadi, Nasr N; Alshali, Ruwaida Z; Khader, Yousef S; Ahmad, Dana M",European journal of dentistry,39,24

Considering the repercussion of these unique social experiences in infant's health, this study aims to assess the early impact of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital admissions for acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: Data from hospitalizations of acute bronchiolitis in infants under one year were obtained from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health database (DATASUS) for the period between 2016 and 2020. These data were also analyzed by macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest). To evaluate the effect of social distancing strategy on the incidence of acute bronchiolitis, the absolute and relative reduction was calculated by analyzing the yearly subsets of 2016vs2020, 2017vs2020, 2018vs2020, and 2019vs2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in all comparisons, ranging from -78% [IRR 0.22 (0.20 to 0.24)] in 2016vs2020 at -85% [IRR 0.15 (0.13 to 0.16)] in 2019vs2020, for the data from Brazil. For analyzes by macro-regions, the reduction varied from -58% [IRR 0.41 (0.37 to 0.45)] in the Midwest in 2016vs2020 to -93% [IRR 0.07 (0.06 to 0.08)] in the South in 2019vs2020. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in hospitalization for acute bronchiolitis in children under one year old, in Brazil, of the order of more than 70% for most analysis. Our data suggest an important impact of social distance on reducing the transmission of viruses related to acute bronchiolitis. Such knowledge may guide strategies for prevention of viruses spread.","Friedrich, Frederico; Ongaratto, Renata; Scotta, Marcelo C; Veras, Tiago N; Stein, Renato; Lumertz, Magali Santos; Jones, Marcus Herbert; Comaru, Talitha; Pinto, Leonardo Araújo",Clin Infect Dis,39,24

Therefore, many elective diagnostic and surgical procedures are being suspended or significantly delayed. Moreover, patients might find it difficult to refer to physicians and delay the diagnostic and even the therapeutic procedures because of emotional or logistic problems. The effect of diagnostic and therapeutic delay on survival in patients affected by gastrointestinal malignancies is still unclear. METHODS: We carried out a review of the available literature, in order to determine whether the delay in performing diagnosis and curative-intent surgical procedures affects the oncological outcomes in patients with oesophageal, gastric, colorectal cancers, and colorectal liver metastasis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that for oesophageal, gastric and colon cancers delaying surgery up to 2 months after the end of the staging process does not worsen the oncological outcomes. Oesophageal cancer should undergo surgery within 7-8 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Rectal cancers should undergo surgery within 31 days after the diagnostic process and within 12 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy should start within 4 weeks after surgery, especially in gastric cancer; a delay up to 42 days may be allowed for oesophageal cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal malignancies can be safely managed taking into account that reasonable delays of planned treatments appear a generally safe approach, not having a significant impact on long-term oncological outcome.","DE Rosa, Michele; Pasculli, Alessandro; Rondelli, Fabio; Mariani, Lorenzo; Avenia, Stefano; Ceccarelli, Graziano; Testini, Mario; Avenia, Nicola; Bugiantella, Walter",,39,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty systemically healthy patients (44.38 ± 8.2 years old, 11 smokers, 19 women) diagnosed with periodontitis stages III-IV were included. Each patient, with one single-rooted tooth, with one probing pocket depth (PD) &#8805; 6 mm associated with horizontal bone loss, was treated by means of simplified papilla preservation flap (SPPF) and randomized to either test treatment (careful removal of the calculus with the tip of a blade, air polishing of the root surfaces with erythritol) or to the control group (scaling and root planing with hand curettes, ultrasonic instruments). PD, clinical attachment (CAL), bone sounding (BS), and radiographic bone level (BL) were evaluated at baseline and 12 months postsurgically. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the 12-month follow-up (test: n = 14, control: n = 13). In both groups, statistically significant improvements were obtained (p < 0.05, mean CAL gain/PD reduction: test, 2.50 ± 1.60 mm/3.00 ± 0.96 mm; control, 2.85 ± 1.21 mm/3.38 ± 1.12 mm). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for any of the investigated parameters (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Within their limits, the present results indicate that the use of air polishing with an erythritol powder during periodontal surgery may represent a valuable minimally invasive adjunct following calculus removal by means of hand and ultrasonic instruments or a valuable alternative to these, for root surfaces without calculus. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of air polishing with an erythritol powder during periodontal surgery appears to represent a valuable minimally invasive adjunct following calculus removal by means of hand and ultrasonic instruments or a valuable alternative to these, for root surfaces without calculus.","Cosgarea, Raluca; Jepsen, Søren; Fimmers, Rolf; Bodea, Aura; Eick, Sigrun; Sculean, Anton",,39,1

The wide spectrum of clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 illness suggests that individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in determining the clinical course after first infection. Immunological studies have focused on patients with moderate to severe disease, demonstrating excessive inflammation in tissues and organ damage. In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; eight patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and eight cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.","Carsetti, Rita; Zaffina, Salvatore; Piano Mortari, Eva; Terreri, Sara; Corrente, Francesco; Capponi, Claudia; Palomba, Patrizia; Mirabella, Mattia; Cascioli, Simona; Palange, Paolo; Cuccaro, Ilaria; Milito, Cinzia; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maeurer, Markus; Camisa, Vincenzo; Vinci, Maria Rosaria; Santoro, Annapaola; Cimini, Eleonora; Marchioni, Luisa; Nicastri, Emanuele; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Agrati, Chiara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Porzio, Ottavia; Concato, Carlo; Onetti Muda, Andrea; Raponi, Massimiliano; Quintarelli, Concetta; Quinti, Isabella; Locatelli, Franco",Front Immunol,39,24

The observed problems with the efficiency of the vaccination campaigns in numerous countries around the world, as well as the approach used at the initial stage of the National Immunization Program in Poland, prompted us to analyse the possibility of using GIS technology to optimize the distribution of vaccines to vaccination sites so as to minimize the period needed to vaccinate individual population groups. The research work was carried out on the example of Warsaw, the capital of Poland and the city with the largest population in the country. The analyses were carried out for the 60-70 and 50-60 age groups, in various approaches and for vaccines of different companies (Moderna, BioNTech, AstraZeneca), used to vaccinate people in Poland. The proposed approach to optimize vaccine distribution uses Thiessen's tessellation to obtain information on the number of people in a given population group living in the area of each vaccination site, and then to estimate the time needed to vaccinate that group. Compared to the originally used vaccination scenario with limited availability of vaccines, the proposed approach allows practitioners to design fast and efficient distribution scenarios. With the developed methodology, we demonstrated ways to achieve uniform vaccination coverage throughout the city.

BACKGROUND: To meet the workforce needs of nurses who care for adults with cancer, an academic-practice partnership was created in 2016. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing, North Carolina Cancer Hospital and UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center collaborated to provide structured clinical and didactic practice experiences for undergraduate nursing students interested in oncology nursing. With COVID-19, nursing students were not permitted to be in the clinical setting. DESIGN: Discursive paper. METHOD: An innovative and collaborative partnership created reflective and interactive activities. The majority of the learning activities were created at the revised Bloom's taxonomy level of application or higher, with some encompassing multiple levels. Students engaged in a variety of meaningful experiences requiring multiple learning processes that promoted professional development in the interpersonal and critical thinking domains. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the delivery of oncology nurse fellowship was successful because of innovative virtual strategies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our academic-practice partnership allowed the nursing students to develop their interpersonal and critical thinking skills without entering the clinical site. This is an approach encouraged by the authors for other schools of nursing.

This brief commentary examines the deficits of current models and proposes several improved alternates. The existing single transgene mouse models poorly mimic the clinical features of COVID-19; those strains get a milder disease than human COVID-19 disease. Many of the current transgenic models utilize random integration of several copies of single ACE2 transgenes, resulting in unnatural gene expression and exhibit rapid lethality. We suggest preparing precision knock-in of selected human mini genes at the mouse initiation codon and knock-out of the mouse homolog as a better option. Three genes critical for infection are suggested targets, ACE2 (the viral cellular receptor), its co-infection protease TMRPSS2, and the primary antibody clearance receptor FcÎ³RT. To offer the best platform for COVID 19 research, preparation of single, double, and triple humanized combinations offers the researcher the opportunity to better understand the contributions of these receptors, coreceptors to therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we propose to create the humanized strains in the C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2 responders, respectively, and allow modeling of the variability seen in human pathology including lung pathology and late sequelae of COVID-19 disease (BALB/c). We suggest the need to do a thorough characterization of both the short-term and long-term effects of SAR-CoV-2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, hematologic, and immunologic levels. We expect the multiply humanized strains will be superior to the single-gene and multiple-gene-copy transgenic models available to date. These mouse models will represent state-of-the-art tools for investigating mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity and developing vaccines and drugs.","Jarnagin, Kurt; Alvarez, Oscar; Shresta, Sujan; Webb, David R",Biochem Pharmacol,39,32

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 seen from 3 March to 29 October 2020. We described the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care metrics, demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators across race groups. We also described clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality. We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of them, 57.8% were female, 58.4% black, 29.5% white, 8.5% Hispanic and 3.6% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the federal poverty line (12.4%) and in more deprived locations (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4% (n=827) of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest rates of ICU admission (53.1%) and mechanical ventilation (21.9%). Among all patients, Hispanics (adjusted 1.60, 95% CI (1.08, 2.37)), blacks (1.43 (1.13, 1.83)), age in years (1.03 (1.02, 1.04)) and living in a zip code with high unemployment (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.59 (1.67, 4.02)), chronic heart failure (1.79 (1.31, 2.45)), immunocompromised (1.77 (1.16, 2.70)), with glycated haemoglobin >8% (1.68 (1.19, 2.38)), depression (1.60 (1.24, 2.06)), hypertension (1.5 (1.21, 1.87)) and physical inactivity (1.25 (1.03, 1.51)) had higher odds of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic KPGA patients were at higher odds of hospitalisation, but not mortality, compared with other race groups. Beyond previously reported sociodemographics and comorbidities, factors such as quality of care, lifestyle behaviours and SDOH indicators should be considered when designing and implementing interventions to reduce COVID-19 racial disparities.","Lobelo, Felipe; Bienvenida, Alan; Leung, Serena; Mbanya, Armand; Leslie, Elizabeth; Koplan, Kate; Shin, Sangmin Ryan",BMJ Open,39,24

The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed aims to deliver a vaccine in the near future, even though no American or European COVID-19 vaccine has yet completed Phase 3 trials. The administration has used the emergency use authorization mechanism to fast track therapeutic products through the Food and Drug Administration and has not ruled out using the mechanism to fast track a COVID-19 vaccine.

Methods: According to ""The Prevention and Control Protocol for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Third Edition)"" issued by the National Health Commission, a field epidemiological survey was conducted for the 5 cases in January 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from them for the detection of 2019-nCoV by real time RT-PCR. Multi prevention and control measures were taken, such as tracking and screening close contacts, medical isolation observation, investigating the epidemiological link, analyzing transmission chain. Results: Case 1, who had common environmental exposure with other COVIDâ19 cases, got sick on 20 January, 2020 and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 2 became symptomatic on 22 January and was confirmed on 27 January. Case 3 got sick on 25 January and was confirmed on 30 January. Case 4 had illness onset on 20 January and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 5 got sick on 23 January and was confirmed on 31 January. Among the 5 cases, case 2 died and the illness of other cases were effectively controlled. After exclusion of other common exposure factors, case 1 had a 6-hour meeting with case 2 and case 3 on 19 January. Case 2 and case 3 might be infected by case 1 during the incubation period. It is the key point for epidemiological investigation. Conclusion: The epidemiological investigation indicates that the transmission might occur in the incubation period of COVID-19 case, close attention should be paid to it in future COVID-19 prevention and control.","Xiao, W J; Gao, Q; Jin, K; Gong, X H; Han, R B; Jiang, C Y; Jiang, X J; Jin, B H; Fang, Q W; Pan, H; Wu, H Y; Sun, X D",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,39,33

D-dimer elevation is particularly frequent, and values higher than 1µg/mL have been associated with disease severity and in-hospital mortality. Previous retrospective studies found a high pulmonary embolism (PE) prevalence, however, it should be highlighted that diagnoses were only completed when PE was clinically suspected. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single-center prospective cohort study. Between April 6th and April 17th 2020, consecutive confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with D-dimer >1 µg/mL underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to investigate the presence and magnitude of PE. Demographic and laboratory data, comorbidities, CTPA scores, administered treatments, and, clinical outcomes were analysed and compared between patients with and without PE. RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients (11 women) were included. PE was diagnosed in 15 patients (50%). In patients with PE, emboli were located mainly in segmental arteries (86%) and bilaterally (60%). Patients with PE were significantly older (median age 67.0 (IQR 63.0-73.0) vs. 57.0 (IQR 48.0-69.0) years, p = .048) and did not differ in sex or risk factors for thromboembolic disease from the non-PE group. D-dimer, platelet count, and, C reactive protein values were significantly higher among PE patients. D-dimer values correlated with the radiologic magnitude of PE (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer values higher than 1 µg/mL presented a high prevalence of PE, regardless of clinical suspicion. We consider that these findings could contribute to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, by initiating anticoagulant therapy when a PE is found.","Alonso-Fernández, Alberto; Toledo-Pons, Nuria; Cosío, Borja G; Millán, Aina; Calvo, Néstor; Ramón, Luisa; de Mendoza, Sara Hermoso; Morell-García, Daniel; Bauça-Rossello, Josep Miquel; Núñez, Belén; Pons, Jaume; Palmer, Juan A; Martín, Luisa; Peñaranda, María; Pou, Joan A; Sauleda, Jaume; Sala-Llinas, Ernest",PLoS One,39,9

Fucoidan has displayed potent 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazil radical scavenging and reduction power activities. It significantly inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme (IC50 4.3 µg mL-1) with a greater selectivity index (lg(IC80 COX-2/IC80COX-1), -1.55) than the synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin (lg(IC80 COX-2/IC80COX-1), -0.09). A concentration-dependent inhibition of hyaluronidase enzyme with an IC50 of 2.9 µg mL-1 was observed. Fucoidan attenuated the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Our findings suggest that the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) (IC50 1.11 µg mL-1) is one of the possible mechanisms involved in the anti-hyperglycemic activity of fucoidan. At a concentration of 3.2 µg mL-1, fucoidan prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time by 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold compared with a control, respectively. A significant increase of prothrombin time was observed after the concentration of fucoidan was increased above 80 µg mL-1. This evidenced that fucoidan may have an effect on intrinsic/common pathways and little effect on the extrinsic mechanism. This study sheds light on the multiple pathways of the bioactivities of fucoidan. As far as we know, the inhibition of hyaluronidase and DPP-IV by high molecular fucoidan was studied for the first time in this work. Our results and literature data suggest that molecular weight, sulfate content, fucose content, and polyphenols may contribute to these activities. It seems that high molecular weight fucoidan has promising therapeutic applications in different pharmacological settings. Anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant drugs have been used for the management of complications of COVID19. Taken as a whole, fucoidan could be considered as a prospective candidate for the treatment of patients with COVID19; however, additional research in this field is required.","Pozharitskaya, Olga N; Obluchinskaya, Ekaterina D; Shikov, Alexander N",Mar. drugs,39,7

Previously we reported our hypothesis that the antiviral drugs with high lung distributions might benefit COVID-19 patients by reducing viral loads. So far, chloroquine, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ribavirin, darunavir, remdesivir, and umifenovir have been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here we validated our hypothesis by comparing the pharmacokinetics profiles of these drugs and their capabilities of reducing viral load in clinical trials. According to bulk RNA and single cell RNA sequencing analysis, we found that high expression of both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) makes the lung and intestine vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. Lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution profiles. We concluded here that the antiviral drugs should be distributed straight to the lung tissue for reducing viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, to better evaluate antiviral effects of drugs that target the intestine, the stool samples should also be collected for viral RNA test in the future.","Wang, Yan; Chen, Lei",Eur J Pharmacol,39,1

Those with mental health problems are particularly at risk of disengagement with work and study and need effective support. The headspace Work and Study (hWS) service is an innovative online platform implemented in Australia to support young people aged 15-25 years with mental health problems to achieve work and study goals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether the hWS service has been implemented as planned, provides appropriate support for young people, and achieves its main goals. METHODS: Data were collected via 2 methodologies: (1) the hWS Minimum Data Set, which includes data on all clients in the service (n=1139), services delivered, and service impact; and (2) a survey of hWS clients who volunteered to participate in an evaluation of the hWS service (n=137). RESULTS: The service was accessed by its defined target group, young people aged 15-25 years with mental health and work and study difficulties. Young people found the online platform to be acceptable, and the assistance provided and clinical integration useful; many young people achieved positive work and study outcomes, particularly those who engaged more times with the service. More assistance was sought for work than study goals, suggesting that the transition to work may be particularly challenging for young people. One-third (298/881, 33.8%) of the sample for the service impact analyses achieved at least 1 primary work or study outcome, and this increased to 44.5% (225/506) for those who engaged with 5 or more sessions, demonstrating that greater engagement with the service produced better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Critical work and study support can be effectively delivered via an online modality to young people with common mental health problems. Digital services are scaleable to reach many young people and are of particular value for those with difficulty accessing in-person services.","Rickwood, Debra; Kennedy, Vanessa; Miyazaki, Koki; Telford, Nic; Carbone, Stephen; Hewitt, Ella; Watts, Carolyn",JMIR Ment Health,39,30

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and 'other clinical' (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Significant factors inversely correlated with burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.","Denning, Max; Goh, Ee Teng; Tan, Benjamin; Kanneganti, Abhiram; Almonte, Melanie; Scott, Alasdair; Martin, Guy; Clarke, Jonathan; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Markar, Sheraz; Przybylowicz, Jan; Chan, Yiong Huak; Sia, Ching-Hui; Chua, Ying Xian; Sim, Kang; Lim, Lucas; Tan, Lifeng; Tan, Melanie; Sharma, Vijay; Ooi, Shirley; Winter Beatty, Jasmine; Flott, Kelsey; Mason, Sam; Chidambaram, Swathikan; Yalamanchili, Seema; Zbikowska, Gabriela; Fedorowski, Jaroslaw; Dykowska, Grazyna; Wells, Mary; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Kinross, James",PLoS One,39,2

RESULTS: Seventy-four per cent and 94 per cent of participants reported that the Vitom 3D was ergonomic and comfortable to use respectively. Whilst colour fidelity and image quality were very good, 50 per cent of participants reported image distortion and pixilation at the highest magnification. All participants agreed that there was an increased educational value to exoscope technology. Half the participants preferred the microscope over the Vitom 3D for fine otological work, which may reflect the learning curve. CONCLUSION: The Vitom 3D exoscope is a promising and viable alternative for performing otological surgery when using full personal protective equipment in the coronavirus disease 2019 era.","Yeung, W; Vakharia, N; Johnatty, C; Achar, P; Kasbekar, A V",J Laryngol Otol,39,16

We cross-validated manual and automated high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads in nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS), lower respiratory fluids, and plasma, and analyzed detection rates after lockdown and relaxation measures. METHODS: Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas®6800-Target1 and Target2 were prospectively validated in 1344 NOPS submitted during the first pandemic peak (Week 13). Follow-up cohort (FUP) 1, 2, and 3 comprised 10,999, 10,147, and 19,389 NOPS submitted during a 10-week period until Weeks 23, 33, and 43, respectively. RESULTS: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%), including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman's r > .95; p < .001) for all assays and high precision by Bland-Altman analysis. Discordant samples (N = 36, 3%) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 loads (p < .001). Following lockdown, detection rates declined to <1% in FUP-1, reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% and 12% in FUP-2 and -3, but infected patients were younger than during lockdown (34 vs. 52 years, p < .001). In 261 patients providing 936 NOPS, SARS-CoV-2 loads declined by three orders of magnitude within 10 days postdiagnosis (p < .001). SARS-CoV-2 loads in NOPS correlated with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids or in plasma but remained detectable in some cases with negative follow-up NOPS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Manual and automated assays significantly correlated qualitatively and quantitatively. Following a successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require independent dual-target confirmation for reliable assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be obtained within <5 days and consider lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.","Leuzinger, Karoline; Gosert, Rainer; Søgaard, Kirstine K; Naegele, Klaudia; Bielicki, Julia; Roloff, Tim; Bingisser, Roland; Nickel, Christian H; Khanna, Nina; Sutter, Sarah Tschudin; Widmer, Andreas F; Rentsch, Katharina; Pargger, Hans; Siegemund, Martin; Stolz, Daiana; Tamm, Michael; Bassetti, Stefano; Osthoff, Michael; Battegay, Manuel; Egli, Adrian; Hirsch, Hans H",J Med Virol,39,23

Currently, viruses of two distinct lineages of parvoviruses (PVs, family Parvoviridae; subfamily Hamaparvovirinae) infect penaeid shrimp. Here, a PV was isolated and cloned from Vietnamese P. monodon specimens, designated Penaeus monodon metallodensovirus (PmMDV). This is the first member of a third divergent lineage shown to infect penaeid decapods. PmMDV has a transcription strategy unique among invertebrate PVs, using extensive alternative splicing and incorporating transcription elements characteristic of vertebrate-infecting PVs. The PmMDV proteins have no significant sequence similarity with other PVs, except for an SF3 helicase domain in its nonstructural protein. Its capsid structure, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3-Å resolution, has a similar surface morphology to Penaeus stylirostris densovirus, despite the lack of significant capsid viral protein (VP) sequence similarity. Unlike other PVs, PmMDV folds its VP without incorporating a ßA strand and displayed unique multimer interactions, including the incorporation of a Ca2+ cation, attaching the N termini under the icosahedral fivefold symmetry axis, and forming a basket-like pentamer helix bundle. While the PmMDV VP sequence lacks a canonical phospholipase A2 domain, the structure of an EDTA-treated capsid, determined to 2.8-Å resolution, suggests an alternative membrane-penetrating cation-dependent mechanism in its N-terminal region. PmMDV is an observed example of convergent evolution among invertebrate PVs with respect to host-driven capsid structure and unique as a PV showing a cation-sensitive/dependent basket structure for an alternative endosomal egress.","Pénzes, Judit J; Pham, Hanh T; Chipman, Paul; Bhattacharya, Nilakshee; McKenna, Robert; Agbandje-McKenna, Mavis; Tijssen, Peter",Proc.

At the cellular level, SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - accesses the vascular endothelium through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and induces proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses. At the clinical level, these pathways lead to thromboembolic events that affect the pulmonary, extracranial, mesenteric, and lower extremity vessels. At the population level, the presence of vascular risk factors predisposes individuals to more severe forms of COVID-19, whereas the absence of vascular risk factors does not spare patients with COVID-19 from unprecedented rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism and acute limb ischemia. Finally, at the community and global level, the fear of COVID-19, measures taken to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reallocation of limited hospital resources have led to delayed presentations of severe forms of ischemia, surgery cancellations and missed opportunities for limb salvage. The purpose of this narrative review is to present some of the data on COVID-19, from cellular mechanisms to clinical manifestations, and discuss its impact on the local and global surgical communities from a vascular perspective.","Strauss, Shira A; Seo, Chanhee; Carrier, Marc; Jetty, Prasad",Can J Surg,39,30

The molecular clocks driving circadian rhythmic changes are based on intertwined transcriptional/translational feedback loops that combine with a range of environmental and metabolic stimuli to generate daily internal programing. Understanding how biological rhythms are generated throughout the body and the reasons for their dysregulation can provide avenues for temporally directed therapeutics. Summary: In recent years, microRNAs have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of the circadian clock, particularly in Drosophila, but also in some small animal and human studies. This review will summarize our current understanding of the role of miRNAs during clock regulation, with a particular focus on the control of clock regulated gene expression.","Ma, Qianwen; Mo, Genlin; Tan, Yong",Afr Health Sci,39,6

It is, however, necessary to consider some national specificities, including the small size of the country, its young population, and the political imperative to drive this program forward. Israel also has a number of other advantages, including a strong public health infrastructure. The lessons that can be learnt include the importance of coordinating delivery mechanisms with the inevitable prioritisation of groups within the population, timely deployment of a skilled cadre of health workers, a recognition that not everyone in the population shares in the benefits of digital connectedness, the need to reach out to disadvantaged groups, based on an understanding of the barriers that they face, and the importance of placing COVID-19 vaccination within a comprehensive response to the pandemic.","McKee, Martin; Rajan, Selina",Isr J Health Policy Res,39,16

While such data are essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a guilt-free strategy recently proposed to lessen this constraint are generalizable across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our findings show that the guilt-free strategy is a useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents' proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims to provide crucial data on the current pandemic.","Daoust, Jean-François; Bélanger, Éric; Dassonneville, Ruth; Lachapelle, Erick; Nadeau, Richard; Becher, Michael; Brouard, Sylvain; Foucault, Martial; Hönnige, Christoph; Stegmueller, Daniel",PLoS One,39,13

This drug, called AB569, consists of acidified nitrite (A-NO2-) and EDTA, of which there is no mechanism of resistance. Using both chemistry-, genetic-, and bioinformatics-based techniques, we first discovered that AB569 was able to generate bactericidal levels of nitric oxide (NO), while the EDTA component stabilized S-nitrosyl thiols, thereby furthering NO and downstream reactive nitrogen species production.

The pure sensory form of MM occurs rarely. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass deficiency is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Up to 50% of adults with selective subnormal IgG1 levels or selective IgG1 deficiency have a concomitant autoimmune disorder. Herein, we report the case of a patient with MM and selective IgG1 deficiency who showed remarkable clinical improvement after 2-year combination therapy with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin plus vitamin D3. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old man developed numbness in right hand and forearm. After 6 months, the patient developed left forefoot numbness. Approximately 8 years later, the patient started to develop numbness also in the right forefoot, along with symptoms of evening fatigue and occasional orthostatic hypotension. The patient also reported recurrent candidiasis in glans and intergluteal areas since adolescence. Electromyoneurography of lower and upper limbs revealed the presence of multiple mononeuropathies. Protein electrophoresis showed hypogammaglobulinemia and low serum IgG1 levels. Sural nerve biopsy showed the presence of perineuritis. The patient was diagnosed with MM due to perineuritis probably secondary to IgG1 deficiency. We, then, proposed combination therapy with sitagliptin and vitamin D3 in the attempt to achieve immunomodulation. At the last follow-up visit (2 years), the patient showed persistent clinical improvement, increase in IgG1 levels and normalization of protein electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case showing a remarkable clinical improvement of MM and selective IgG1 deficiency achieved through a combination therapy with sitagliptin and vitamin D3.","Maia Pinheiro, M; Moura Maia Pinheiro, F; Pires Amaral Resende, L L; Nogueira Diniz, S; Fabbri, A; Infante, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,39,6

When the restrictions due to the Covid19 pandemic were put into place and it became clear that learning would not occur on campus and in our labs, we wanted to ensure that the students still had access to 3-dimensional learning from prosections. We built on our experience in 3D photogrammetry and 3D scanning and integrated these specimens into a custom-built 3D virtual anatomy lab environment. The aim of the design was to create a sense of space and professionalism in the virtual experience. The VanVR application was created using Unity Engine and WebGL with 3D scanning/photogrammetry, and programmed for use on desktop browsers to increase accessibility. The goal of this application is not only to show 3D specimens, but also create an anatomy one-stop teaching and study tool that includes related reference material for each specimen, such labelled images, videos, web modules, etc. Within this virtual space, students can rotate, zoom and compare specimens, which would be difficult to do during an in-person anatomy class. The VanVR app has been the main anatomy teaching tool at the University of British Columbia during the pandemic lockdown. Once in-person teaching resumes, this app will be available as a reference tool for study and review. Feedback from the students about their learning experience has been positive and the VanVR app proved to be a good approach to anatomy education for remote and online learning.","Pennefather, Patrick Scott Dan Dunne Connor Dixit Ishan Dykstra Mark Fejtek Monika Jeon Sean Xu Ziyi Zhang Wentao Li Zichun Yan Nathan Chen Karen Lin Terry Meyers Cara Krebs Claudia",The FASEB Journal,39,11

However, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to health care workers through aerosolization and airborne transmission during rhinologic surgery remains incompletely characterized. The objective of this study was to quantify the number concentrations of aerosols generated during rhinologic surgery with and without interventions involving 3 passive suction devices. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver simulation. SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a simulation of rhinologic procedures with and without different passive suction interventions, the concentrations of generated aerosols in the particle size range of 0.30 to 10.0 µm were quantified with an optical particle sizer. RESULTS: Functional endoscopic sinus surgery with and without microdebrider, high-speed powered drilling, use of an ultrasonic aspirator, and electrocautery all produced statistically significant increases in concentrations of aerosols of various sizes (P < .05). Powered drilling, ultrasonic aspirator, and electrocautery generated the highest concentration of aerosols, predominantly submicroparticles <1 µm. All interventions with a suction device were effective in reducing aerosols, though the surgical smoke evacuation system was the most effective passive suction method in 2 of the 5 surgical conditions with statistical significance (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Significant aerosol concentrations were produced in the range of 0.30 to 10.0 µm during all rhinologic procedures in this cadaver simulation. Rhinologic surgery with a passive suction device results in significant mitigation of generated aerosols.","Sharma, Dhruv; Ye, Michael J; Campiti, Vincent J; Rubel, Kolin E; Higgins, Thomas S; Wu, Arthur W; Shipchandler, Taha Z; Sim, Michael W; Burgin, Sarah J; Illing, Elisa A; Park, Jae Hong; Ting, Jonathan Y",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,39,1

This study theorizes that when government policy performance worsens, people get angry or frustrated and send uncivil messages to the government. To test this theory, the current study classifies tweets directed at U.S. state governors as uncivil or not, using a neural network machine-learning model, and examines the impact of worsening state-level COVID-19 indicators on the number of uncivil tweets directed at the state governors. The results show that increasing state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths lead to higher numbers of uncivil tweets directed at state governors.

Our aim was to investigate the therapeutic effects of infliximab, intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) or combination therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: In this observational research, we studied 104 intubated adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection (based on clinical symptoms, and radiographic or CT scan parameters) who were admitted to the ICU of a multispecialty hospital during March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. All cases received standard treatment regimens as local protocol (Oseltamivir + hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or sofosbuvir or atazanavir ± ribavirin). The cases were grouped as controls (n = 43), infliximab (n = 27), IVIg (n = 23) and combination (n = 11). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between controls and treatment groups in terms of underlying diseases or the number of underlying diseases. The mean age (SD) of cases was 72.42 (16.06) in the control group, 64.52 (12.965) in IVIg, 63.40 (17.57) in infliximab and 64.00 (11.679) in combination therapy; (P = 0.047, 0.031 and 0.11, respectively). Also, 37% in the infliximab group, 26.1% in IVIg, 45.5% in combination therapy, and 62.8% in the control group expired (all P < 0.05).

In this study, the occurrence of Sb and other toxic metal(loid)s near an operating Sb refinery and near-field landfill site were investigated. Topsoil samples near the refinery had high Sb levels (â¼3250 mg kg-1) but relatively low concentrations of other toxic metal(loid)s. However, several soil samples taken at greater depth from the near-field landfill site contained high concentrations of As and Pb, as well as extremely high Sb contents (â¼21,400 mg kg-1). X-ray absorption fine structure analysis showed that Sb in the soils from both sites was present as Sb(V) in the form of tripuhyite (FeSbO4), a stable mineral. Three-dimensional principal coordinate analysis showed that microbial community compositions in samples with high toxic metal(loid)s concentrations were significantly different from other samples and had lower microbial populations (â¼104 MPN g-1). Sequential extraction results revealed that Sb is present primarily in the stable residual fraction (â¼99 %), suggesting low Sb bioavailability. However, microbial redundancy analysis suggested that the more easily extractable Pb might be the major factor controlling microbial community compositions at the site.","Park, Soo-Chan; Boyanov, Maxim I; Kemner, Kenneth M; O039,; Loughlin, Edward J; Kwon, Man Jae",J Hazard Mater,39,22

Herein we searched SU efficiency according to the genotype-phenotype correlation, dosage used and side effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Systematic review conducted according the PRISMA control criteria identifying relevant studies evaluating the in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of ATP-dependent potassium channels according to the characteristics of genetic mutation. RESULTS: 103 selected articles with complete data in 502 cases in whom 413 (82.3%) had mutations in KCNJ11 (#64) and 89 in ABCC8 (# 56). Successful transfer from insulin to SU was achieved in 91% and 86.5% patients, respectively at a mean age of 36.5 months (0-63 years). Among patients with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations 64 & 46 were associated with constant success,5 & 5 to constant failure, and 10 and 4 to variable degrees of reported success rate, respectively. The glibenclamide dosage required for each genotype ranged from 0.017 to 2.8 mg / kg / day. Comparing both the in vivo and in vitro susceptibility results, some mutations appear more sensitive than others to sulfonylurea treatment. Side effects were reported in 17 /103 of the included articles: mild gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycaemia were the most common. One premature patient had an ulcerative necrotizing enterocolitis which association with SU is difficult to ascertain. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfonylurea are an effective treatment for monogenic diabetes due to KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes mutations. The success of the treatment is conditioned by differences in pharmacogenetics, younger age, pharmacokinetics, compliance and maximal dose used. This article is protected by copyright.

The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its correlation with D dimer levels and pharmacological prophylaxis. METHODS: This was a cohort study of critically ill patients due to COVID-19. All patients admitted to the intensive care unit on the same day of April 2020 were selected, regardless of length of stay, and a single bilateral venous duplex ultrasound in the lower extremities was performed up to 72 hours later. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed by computed tomography angiography. Asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE were registered, including pre-screening in hospital VTE. Characteristics of patients, blood test results, doses of thromboprophylaxis received, VTE events, and mortality after seven day follow up were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 230 critically ill patients were studied. The median intensive care unit stay of these patients was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5 - 19 days). After seven days follow up, the frequency of patients with VTE, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was 26.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21% - 32%) (69 events in 61 patients): 45 with DVT and 16 with PE (eight of them with concomitant DVT). The cumulative frequency of symptomatic VTE was 8.3% (95% CI 4.7% - 11.8%). D dimer values &#8805; 1 500 ng/mL were diagnostic of VTE, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 42%. During follow up after screening, six patients developed new VTE. Three of them developed a recurrence after a DVT diagnosed at screening, despite receiving therapeutic doses of heparin. Mortality rates at seven day follow up were the same for those with (6.6%) and without (5.3%) VTE. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 infection are at high risk of VTE, and further new symptomatic VTE events and recurrence can occur despite anticoagulation. The prophylactic anticoagulant dose may need to be increased in patients with a low risk of bleeding.","Bellmunt-Montoya, Sergi; Riera, Claudia; Gil, Daniel; Rodríguez, Manuela; García-Reyes, Marvin; Martínez-Carnovale, Lucía; Marrero, Carlos; Gil, Miquel; Ruiz-Rodríguez, Juan Carlos; Ferrer, Ricard; de Nadal, Miriam; Monreal, Manel; Llagostera, Secundino",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,39,26

Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the impacts of coinfection on disease severity are less understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in Nepal. Prospective weekly household-based active surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RT-PCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses detected as part of the same illness episode. RESULTS: Of 1730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected in their primary illness episode. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. The cohort of infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting &#8805; 4 days (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and so did the subset of coinfected infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7).

Coinfection was associated with greater odds of fever lasting for four or more days, but not with increased illness severity by other measures.","Emanuels, Anne; Hawes, Stephen E; Newman, Kira L; Martin, Emily T; Englund, Janet A; Tielsch, James M; Kuypers, Jane; Khatry, Subarna K; LeClerq, Steven C; Katz, Joanne; Chu, Helen Y",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,39,24

For this purpose, we include three uni-variate time series models, i.e., ARIMA, Naive, Exponential smoothing, and one multivariate model, i.e., NARDL. This is the first of its kind endeavor to combine univariate models along with NARDL to the best of our knowledge. Utilizing monthly data from January 2011 to December 2020, we predict the Chinese Yuan against the US dollar by two combination criteria i.e. var-cor and equal weightage. After finding out the individual accuracy, the models are then assessed through equal weightage and var-cor methods. Our results suggest that Naive outperforms all individual & combination of time series models. Similarly, the combination of NARDL and Naive model again outperformed all of the individual as well as combined models except the Naive model, with the lowest MAPE value of 0764. The results suggesting that the Chinese Yuan exchange rate against the US Dollar is dependent upon the recent observations of the time series.

However, although critical internal processing is executed while decisions are being made, little is known about the role of dopamine neurons during this period. We found that dopamine neurons exhibited dynamically changing signals related to the internal processing while rhesus monkeys were making decisions. These neurons encoded the value of an option immediately after it was offered and then gradually changed their activity to represent the animal's upcoming choice. Similar dynamics were observed in the orbitofrontal cortex, a center for economic decision-making, but the value-to-choice signal transition was completed earlier in dopamine neurons. Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons are a key component of the neural network that makes choices from values during ongoing decision-making processes.","Yun, Mengxi; Kawai, Takashi; Nejime, Masafumi; Yamada, Hiroshi; Matsumoto, Masayuki",Sci.

[...]social or physical distancing can reduce spread within communities. To date, the most effective methods of control appear to be self-isolation, contact tracing, quarantining of exposed persons, workplace measures, closing borders to travelers, and social distancing.3 Because this virus spreads via close contact between individuals within communities, lowering overall morbidity and mortality rates will reduce burdens on the health care system. Measures such as isolation and quarantine can break the cycle of spread, and social distancing measures have served as essential components of public health responses to influenza pandemics in the past.4 High-risk groups include individuals over 70 years old;those who have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, heart disease, kidney or liver disease, and cancer;patients on steroids or undergoing chemotherapy;and those who are pregnant. People visiting patients in hospitals are at high risk as well, as these droplets exist on many surfaces. [...]it is imperative to restrict visitors in hospitals and primary health care facilities to reduce and delay the magnitude of the outbreak.7,8 Social distancing practices can help prevent the spread of the virus, as reducing social contact, refraining from handshakes and hugs, maintaining a distance of 1 meter from one another, closing schools and public places, and avoiding mass gatherings (such as weddings and funerals) can delay transmission and reduce the extent of an outbreak.","Jahan, Firdous",Malaysian Family Physician,39,16

Many of those with severe COVID-19 showed persisting fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle mass loss and deconditioning. This resulted in decreased exercise tolerance, in addition to ongoing complex psychological and health concerns. There is significant evidence to support PR as a means of improving mental and physical health in many respiratory conditions. 2 A bespoke face to face COVID-19 pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme was therefore setup to maximise patient recovery.Aim: 1. To assess the impact of PR on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. 2. To assess the impact of PR on six minute walk test, sit to stand test and Borg dyspnoea score 3. To identify patients most likely to benefit from PR in the future.Method: Patients were identified as 'severe COVID-19' and referred for PR following a consultant case review of patients requiring non-invasive and invasive ventilation in either the respiratory high care unit (RHCU) or intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were then assessed by a multidisciplinary team to ensure consent and appropriateness for the PR programme.Patients completed MFIS and were assessed on a variety of other physical and psychological measures, including: six minute walk test, sit to stand test and Borg dyspnoea score. During weekly PR sessions the patients engaged with a tailored programme of cardio and strengthening exercises as well as Pilates to improve movement and flexibility. Patients repeated the assessments after six weeks.Results: A total of 31 patients attended the programme. 97% of patients attended 80-100% of sessions. The median change in total MFIS was -16%. There were also improvements seen in the six minute walk test with a median increase of 23% and sit to stand with a median increase of 36%. Median change in BORG score -0.5(-50%).Graph 1: Conclusion: Face to face pulmonary rehab is an effective treatment for patients who have been diagnosed with severe COVID-19 following resolution of their acute illness. PR has resulted in improved physical abilities and psychological wellbeing. Improvements were seen in MFIS in all three MFIS severity categories and PR should be offered to all patients recovering from severe COVID-19.","Lucey, A.; Lewis, V.; Jones, S.; Fairbairn, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,39,1

RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions. Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines. RESULTS: Ninety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells. Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth. Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511). There was no growth in samples with a Ct > 24 or STT > 8 days. Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds ratio for positive viral culture of 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.84, p<0.001) for every one unit increase in Ct. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Ct vs. positive culture was OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97, p<0.001), with 97% specificity obtained at a Ct of >24. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct < 24 and STT < 8 days. Infectivity of patients with Ct >24 and duration of symptoms >8 days may be low. This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions. Further studies of larger size are needed.","Bullard, Jared; Dust, Kerry; Funk, Duane; Strong, James E; Alexander, David; Garnett, Lauren; Boodman, Carl; Bello, Alexander; Hedley, Adam; Schiffman, Zachary; Doan, Kaylie; Bastien, Nathalie; Li, Yan; Van Caeseele, Paul G; Poliquin, Guillaume",Clin. infect. dis,39,24

Cohorting patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) into""bubbles""has been proposed as an infection-control mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel and flexible model for clustering patient care in healthcare facilities into bubbles in order to minimize infection spread. Our model aims to control a variety of costs to patients/residents and HCPs so as to avoid hidden, downstream adverse effects of clustering patient care. This model leads to a discrete optimization problem that we call the BubbleClustering problem. This problem takes as input a temporal visit graph, representing HCP mobility, including visits by HCPs to patient/resident rooms. The output of the problem is a rewired visit graph, obtained by partitioning HCPs and patient rooms into bubbles and rewiring HCP visits to patient rooms so that patient-care is largely confined to the constructed bubbles. Even though the BubbleClustering problem is intractable in general, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem that can be solved optimally for problem instances that arise from typical hospital units and long-term-care facilities. We call our overall solution approach Cost-aware Rewiring of Networks (CoRN). We evaluate CoRN using fine-grained-movement data from a hospital-medical-intensive-care unit as well as two long-term-care facilities. These data were obtained using sensor systems we built and deployed. The main takeaway from our experimental results is that it is possible to use CoRN to substantially reduce infection spread by cohorting patients and HCPs without sacrificing patient-care, and with minimal excess costs to HCPs in terms of time and distances traveled during a shift.","Hasan, D.

An ecological study was conducted using data derived from the Office for National Statistics data at a Local Authority District (LAD) level in England between 1st March and 17th April 2020. The primary analysis examined how age adjusted COVID-19 mortality depends on ethnicity, deprivation, and the interaction between the two using linear regression. The secondary analysis using spatial regression methods allowed for the quantification of the extent of LAD spillover effect of COVID-19 mortality. We find that in LADs with the highest deprivation quartile, where there is a 1 percentage point increase in ""Black-African (regression coefficient 2.86; 95% CI 1.08-4.64)"", ""Black-Caribbean (9.66: 95% CI 5.25-14.06)"" and ""Bangladeshi (1.95: 95% CI 1.14-2.76)"" communities, there is a significantly higher age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality compared to respective control populations. In addition, the spatial regression results indicated positive significant correlation between the age-adjusted mortality in one LAD and the age-adjusted mortality in a neighbouring LAD, suggesting a spillover effect.

We studied Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-antibody seroprevalence in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County. METHODS: On 3 and 4 April 2020, we tested 3328 county residents for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a rapid lateral-flow assay (Premier Biotech). Participants were recruited using advertisements that were targeted to reach county residents that matched the county population by gender, race/ethnicity and zip code of residence. We estimate weights to match our sample to the county by zip, age, sex and race/ethnicity. We report the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We adjust for test-performance characteristics by combining data from 18 independent test-kit assessments: 14 for specificity and 4 for sensitivity. RESULTS: The raw prevalence of antibodies in our sample was 1.5% [exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.0%]. Test-performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95% CI 99.2-99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95% CI 76.0-88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test-performance characteristics was 1.2% (95% CI 0.7-1.8%). After weighting for population demographics, the prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI 1.3-4.2%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds.

METHODS: The authors queried the New York University Langone Medical Center's records for hospitalized patients who were polymerase chain reaction-positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) and performed chart reviews on patients with cancer diagnoses to identify patients with active cancer and patients with a history of cancer. Descriptive statistics were calculated and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations between clinical, demographic, and laboratory characteristics with outcomes, including death and admission to the intensive care unit. RESULTS: A total of 4184 hospitalized SARS CoV-2+ patients, including 233 with active cancer, were identified. Patients with active cancer were more likely to die than those with a history of cancer and those without any cancer history (34.3% vs 27.6% vs 20%, respectively; P < .01).

The aim of this survey is threefold: first, we want to provide the researchers interested in this multidisciplinary and challenging area with a network-based analysis of the existing literature to assist them with a visual exploration of papers that can be of interest; second, we present a selection of the main results achieved so far adopting the network as an unifying framework to represent and make sense of data, to model diffusion processes, and to evaluate different debunking strategies. Finally, we present an outline of the most relevant research trends focusing on the moving target of fake-news, bots, and trolls identification by means of data mining and text technologies; despite scholars working on computational linguistics and networks traditionally belong to different scientific communities, we expect that forthcoming computational approaches to prevent fake news from polluting the social media must be developed using hybrid and up-to-date methodologies.","Ruffo, Giancarlo; Semeraro, Alfonso; Giachanou, Anastasia; Torino, Paolo Rosso Universita degli Studi di; University, Utrecht; Valencia, Universitat Politecnica de",,39,16

These newer sutures were preceded by several iterations of nonabsorbable counterparts, all of which were eventually removed from the market because of complications. OBJECTIVE: This review will provide a history of suture lift experience, review the published evidence on the safety and efficacy of currently available absorbable suture lift materials, and detail the clinical experience of the authors using these products. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of relevant clinical terms was performed on PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. All articles were reviewed, and further studies examined from citations of selected articles. Articles that focused on suture lifting using extensive dissection were excluded. RESULTS: Twelve studies detailed the results of absorbable suture lifting largely through patient satisfaction surveys or retrospective chart review of cases. No randomized controlled studies were available. CONCLUSION: Data on suture lifting are limited, with largely descriptive and retrospective case reports available in the literature entailed Oxford Centre evidence-based medicine Levels 2a to 5. Based on the available data, suture lifting appears to be safe and well tolerated, with patient satisfaction similar to or above that reported for other noninvasive lifting and tightening procedures. However, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, the authors give the suture lifting Strength of Recommendation Level C. Further controlled studies are necessary to determine efficacy, longevity, and safety of this technology.","McClean, Megan E; Boen, Monica; Alhaddad, Marwan; Hoss, Elika; Kollipara, Ramya; Butterwick, Kimberly",Dermatol Surg,39,1

METHODS: To understand which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimated change points in COVID-19 dynamics from official Italian data. RESULTS: We found an excellent correlation between nationwide lockdown and the epidemic peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we found a change point in mid-April, which did not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions. Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlated well with local distribution of free face masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions showed no change point during April. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of the observed correlation between face mask use and disease dynamics lend further support to the importance of face masks in addition to lockdowns and other restrictions for the control of COVID-19.","Pedersen, Morten Gram; Meneghini, Matteo",Infect Dis (Lond),39,2

These manifestations range from headache and dizziness to altered mental status and consciousness, anosmia, ageusia, sensory disturbances, and stroke. The mechanisms by which the neurological symptoms arise are not yet determined but may either proceed as an indirect consequence of systemic hyperinflammation or result from the direct invasion of the virus to neural and glial cells. The neural invasion can explain both the retrograde pathway of encephalitis and the early manifestation of anosmia by invading the olfactory bulb. Moreover, in the case of attacking the brain stem, it may take part in the early apnea manifestation reported by patients. Additionally, neurotropism of the virus could be the cause of acute hemorrhagic encephalitis. Hyperinflammation can have acute and prolonged effects in the nervous system, such as acute demyelination and predisposition to multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory state contributes to hypercoagulation, which in turn could result in cerebrovascular injuries in COVID-19 patients.

We analysed observational data and clinical trials to explore whether use of DPP-4i modifies the risk of pneumonia. METHODS: We identified patients with diabetes in the Veneto region administrative database and performed propensity score matching between new users of DPP-4 inhibitors and new users of other oral glucose-lowering medications (OGLMs). We compared the rate of hospitalization for pneumonia between matched cohorts using the Cox proportional hazard model. The same analysis was repeated using the database of a local diabetes outpatient clinic. We retrieved similar observational studies from the literature to perform a meta-analysis. Results from trials reporting pneumonia rates among patients randomized to DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo/active comparators were also meta-analysed. RESULTS: In the regional database, after matching 6495 patients/group, new users of DPP-4 inhibitors had a lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia than new users of other OGLMs (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.95). In the outpatient database, after matching 867 patients/group, new users of DPP-4 inhibitors showed a non-significantly lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.41-1.04). The meta-analysis of observational studies yielded an overall non-significant lower risk of hospitalization for pneumonia among DPP-4 inhibitor users (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.65-1.01). The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed no overall effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on pneumonia risk (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93-1.20). CONCLUSION: The use of DPP-4 inhibitors can be considered as safe with regard to the risk of pneumonia.","Morieri, Mario Luca; Bonora, Benedetta Maria; Longato, Enrico; Di Camilo, Barbara; Sparacino, Giovanni; Tramontan, Lara; Avogaro, Angelo; Fadini, Gian Paolo",Diabetes obes. metab,39,16

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) surface receptor via the spike (S) receptor-binding protein (RBD) on the virus envelope. Global data on a similar infectious disease spread by SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 indicated improved stability of the virus at lower temperatures facilitating its high transmission in the community during colder months (December-February). Seasonal viral transmissions are strongly modulated by temperatures, which can impact viral trafficking into host cells; however, an experimental study of temperature-dependent activity of SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking. We mimicked SARS-CoV-2 with polymer beads coated with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to study the effect of seasonal temperatures on the binding of virus-mimicking nanospheres to lung epithelia. The presence of the S protein RBD on nanosphere surfaces led to binding by Calu-3 airway epithelial cells via the ACE-2 receptor. Calu-3 and control fibroblast cells with S-RBD-coated nanospheres were incubated at 33 and 37 °C to mimic temperature fluctuations in the host respiratory tract, and we found no temperature dependence in contrast to nonspecific binding of bovine serum ablumin-coated nanospheres. Moreover, the ambient temperature changes from 4 to 40 °C had no effect on S-RBD-ACE-2 ligand-receptor binding and minimal effect on the S-RBD protein structure (up to 40 °C), though protein denaturing occurred at 51 °C. Our results suggest that ambient temperatures from 4 to 40 °C have little effect on the SARS-CoV-2-ACE-2 interaction in agreement with the infection data currently reported.","Kumar, Sachin; Paul, Alexandra; Chatterjee, Sayantan; Pütz, Sabine; Nehra, Natasha; Wang, Daniel S; Nisar, Arsalan; M Jennings, Christian; Parekh, Sapun H",Biointerphases,39,20

This study may shed light on whether a severe economic contraction following a natural disaster, such as that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will further contribute to that decline, using data on hurricanes followed by economic contraction or growth. For the analysis, U.S. counties hit by severe hurricanes between 2004 and 2012 are identified and differentiated according to whether there was substantial employment decline from the year prior to the year after the hurricane. Bank offices in these counties are tracked for seven years in terms of stayers, leavers, and new offices owned by community or large banks. The results reveal that areas with substantial employment decline are associated with higher rates of persistence and new openings among the community banks. Where hurricanes were followed by less severe contraction or economic growth, larger banks held an advantage in terms of both persistence and new offices. It is suggested that the value of soft information held by community banks is enhanced by severe adversity.","Kashian, Russ; Buchman, Tracy; Peralta, Kevin",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,39,1

We aimed to assess the impact of a large-scale COVID-19 telemedicine system on emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Brazil. METHODS: From March 18-May 18, 2020 we evaluated the database of a cooperative private health insurance, with 1.28 million clients. The COVID-19 telemedicine system consisted of: a) mobile app, which redirects to teleconsultations if indicated; b) telemonitoring system, with regular phone calls to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases to monitor progression; c) emergency ambulance system (EAS), with internet phone triage and counselling. ED visits and hospital admissions were recorded, with diagnoses assessed by the Diagnosis Related Groups method. COVID-19 diagnosis and deaths were identified from the patients' registries, and outcomes assessed until June 1st. RESULTS: In 60 days, 24,354 patients accessed one of the telemedicine systems. The most frequently utilized was telemonitoring (16,717, 69%), followed by teleconsultation (13,357, 55%) and EAS (687, 3%). The rates of ED and hospital admissions were: telemonitoring 19.7% (3,296) and 4.7% (782); teleconsultation 17.3% (2,313) and 2.4% (318) and EAS: 55.9% (384) and 56.5% (388) patients. At total 4.1% (1,010) had hospital admissions, 36% (363) with respiratory diseases (44 requiring mechanical ventilation) and 4.4% (44) with cardiovascular diagnoses. Overall, 277 (1.1%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and 160 (0.7%) died, 9 with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine resulted in low rates of ED visits and hospital admissions, suggesting positive impacts on healthcare utilization. Cardiovascular admissions were remarkably rare.","Nascimento, Bruno R; Brant, Luisa Cc; Castro, Ana Cristina T; Froes, Luiz Eduardo V; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz P; Cruz, Larissa V; Araújo, Cynthia B; Souza, Charles F; Froes, Eduardo T; Souza, Soraya D",J Telemed Telecare,39,16

Particularly, we choose Bi-GRU as the encoder and decoder component of CVAE, and learn the latent variable distribution from input news. A higher level latent variable distribution is learnt from a corpus set of news-report data, respectively extr acted for each input news, to provide background knowledge to previously learnt latent variable distribution. Then, a teacher-student network is employed to distill knowledge to refine theoutput of the decoder component. To evaluate the model performance of the proposed approach, extensive experiments are preformed on a public dataset and two widely adopted evaluation criteria, i.e., BLEU and ROUGE, are chosen in the experiment.

In this technical note, we provide guidance to mitigate transmission risk and maintain patient safety during each step of the death by neurologic criteria evaluation. Clinicians should put on appropriate personal protective equipment before performing the death by neurologic criteria evaluation. Risk of aerosol generation and viral transmission during the apnea test can be mitigated by using continuous positive airway pressure delivered via the ventilator as a means of apneic oxygenation. Physicians should assess the risk of transporting coronavirus disease 2019 patients to the nuclear medicine suite to perform a radionucleotide cerebral blood flow study, as disconnections to and from the ventilator for transport and inadvertent ventilator disconnections during transport can increase transmission risk.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to the restructuring of traditional clinical activity by adopting telemedicine. Our objectives were to evaluate patients' satisfaction with headache teleconsultation by telephone during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and assess patients' preferred model of appointment (face-to-face, teleconsultation by telephone, or both). METHODS: Patients with a previous diagnosis of primary headache or neuropathies and facial pain disorders, and at least one telephone headache visit during the first wave of COVID-19, filled out an online questionnaire regarding sociodemographic parameters, satisfaction with teleconsultation, and preferred model of appointment. RESULTS: We included 83 patients (valid response rate of 64.3%); most had migraine (83.1%). Regarding teleconsultation, 81.9% considered this model adequate for follow-up, 88.0% were satisfied with the information provided about the disease/treatment, and 73.5% were satisfied with the medication modification. Ninety percent would agree with a new tele-evaluation if stable after the pandemic. The mixed model was the preferred medical consultation type for the postpandemic period (43.4%), followed by face-to-face visits (33.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients were satisfied with the headache teleconsultation during the COVID-19 era. However, an exclusive model of telemedicine does not seem suitable for monitoring all patients. A mixed approach could be integrated into clinical practice after the pandemic to optimize health care.","Dias, Leonor; Martins, Bárbara; Pinto, Maria João; Rocha, Ana Luísa; Pinto, Madalena; Costa, Andreia",Eur. j. neurol,39,16

We aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on ED visits for acute otolaryngologic complaints in New York City, one of the first epicenters of the pandemic in the US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who presented to the ED with a primary diagnosis of an acute otolaryngologic complaint between March 1 and May 31 in 2019 and 2020. This was a multicenter study, including two tertiary care hospital systems encompassing Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Long Island. RESULTS: A total of 10,162 patients were identified. Significantly fewer patients presented to the ED for acute otolaryngologic complaints in 2020 (7332 vs 2830, p < 0.001). The rate of total otolaryngology-related ED visits was decreased by a factor of 0.635 (95% CI 0.6079 to 0.6634). In a subgroup analysis of each individual diagnosis, there was a significant decrease in rate of ED visits for 13 out of 18 diagnoses, including for life-threatening conditions, such as anaphylaxis. There was no significant difference based on which borough in New York City. Pediatric patients (age 0-17) were more significantly impacted by the pandemic compared to other age groups. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in the utilization of ED for acute otolaryngologic complaints, including those requiring emergent management, and an even more significant reduction in the pediatric population. Healthcare providers should encourage patients to seek appropriate care, particularly for those illnesses with significant associated morbidity and mortality.","Patel, Viraj M; Kominsky, Evan; Tham, Tristan; Bottalico, Danielle; Setzen, Michael; Ferastraoaru, Denisa; Akbar, Nadeem; Fastenberg, Judd H",Am J Otolaryngol,39,6

At the beginning of the pandemic, media and case reports described pressure for medical interventions, visitor restrictions, separation from newborns, and an increase in patient demand for community birth (home and birth center). The purpose of this study was to describe birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic centering the birthing person's perspective. METHODS: A survey was e-mailed to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app reaching a national convenience sample who gave birth between March 1, 2020, and June 11, 2020. Survey topics included birth location, the Mothers on Respect index, and open-ended questions capturing patient perspectives on the pandemic's effect on their birth experiences. Differences were assessed based on state-level COVID rate and by race. Content analysis was performed to analyze open-ended responses. RESULTS: Respondents from highly impacted COVID-19 states more frequently changed or considered changing their birth location. Racial differences were also found with Black respondents reporting significantly more preterm births and lower respect scores when compared to White respondents. Six themes emerged from the content analysis: Institutional Policies, Changes in Care, Hospital Staff Interactions, Sub-par Care, Issues of Support, and Mental Health. DISCUSSION: The health care community must continue to adapt policies and procedures to best support birthing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The community must also continue to address the reality that Black patients receive less respectful care compared with White patients.","Breman, Rachel Blankstein; Neerland, Carrie; Bradley, Dani; Burgess, Adriane; Barr, Erik; Burcher, Paul",Birth,39,6

Despite the various impacts, the pandemic has improved the quality of the environment and thereby creating an opportunity to restore the degraded ecosystems. This study presents the imprints of COVID-19 lockdown on the surface water quality and chemical characteristics of the urban-based Bagmati River Basin (BRB), Nepal. A total of 50 water samples were collected from 25 sites of BRB during the monsoon season, in 2019 and 2020. The water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity were measured in-situ, while the major ions, total hardness, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed in the laboratory. The results revealed neutral to mildly alkaline waters with relatively moderate mineralization and dissolved chemical constituents in the BRB. The average ionic abundance followed the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > NH4+ for cations and HCO3-> Cl- > SO42- > NO3- > PO43- for anions. Comparing to the pre-lockdown, the level of DO was increased by 1.5 times, whereas the BOD and COD were decreased by 1.5 and 1.9 times, respectively during the post-lockdown indicating the improvement of the quality water which was also supported by the results of multivariate statistical analyses.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases until October 28, 2020. Studies covering COVID-19's severity classification data and COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke were included. Two independent evaluators extracted data, and the random effects model was used to calculate the risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19's severity. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were included, involving 5266 patients. Among all COVID-19 patients, the total incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.76% (95% CI: 0.82-3.01).

For those with a chronic, immune-related condition such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) serves to exacerbate the inflammatory burden. Serum levels of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a primary mediator of cell adhesion express in the inflammatory process, are often used to indicate the gravity of all inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate serum ICAM-1 levels before and after debridement in patients with DFUs who were also diagnosed as COVID-19 positive compared with those who were COVID-19 negative. Methods: 20 patients with DFUs were screened for COVID-19 and then divided into COVID-19 positive and negative groups according to the results. Before debridement, chest x-rays and blood analysis, including ICAM-1 serum levels, were performed in both groups. Only ICAM-1 serum levels were measured after debridement. Results: Of the 20 patients included in this study, 55% were male (nâ¯=â¯11) and 45% were female (nâ¯=â¯9). The mean age was 52.9â¯±â¯1.9 years. ICAM-1 levels in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group (median 317.2 vs 149.2, respectively; pâ¯<â¯0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 reduced significantly in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group after debridement (median 312.5 vs 130.3; pâ¯<â¯0.001).

Engineering cellular pathways related to cell death, metabolism and glycosylation in CHO cell is desired but challenging. Here we present a novel approach that exploits CRISPR-Cas13d for gene silencing and CHO cell engineering. CRISPR-Cas13d is a burgeoning system that exploits Cas13d nuclease and guide RNA (gRNA) for RNA cleavage and gene knockdown. We first showed that CRISPR-Cas13d effectively knocked down exogenous genes in CHO cell lines (K1, DG44 and DUXB11) commonly used for recombinant protein production. We next demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas13d robustly suppressed the expression of exogenous genes and various endogenous genes involved in gene amplification, apoptosis, metabolism and glycosylation (e.g. GS, BAK, BAX, PDK1 and FUT8) in CHO cells with efficiencies ranging from 60-80%, simply by transient transfection. By integrating the entire CRISPR-Cas13d system with the Sleeping Beauty system and optimal gRNA design, we further improved the knockdown efficiency and rapidly generated stable cells with ï»80-90% knockdown. With this approach, we knocked down FUT8 expression for >90% and significantly attenuated the IgG fucosylation.

This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (QoL) of Malaysian healthcare workers and its predictive factors. An online sample of 389 university-based healthcare workers completed questionnaires on demographics, clinical features, COVID-19-related stressors, psychological experiences, and perceived social support after the movement lockdown was lifted. All domains of QoL were within the norms of the general population except for social relationship QoL, which was lower than the norm. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., stress due to annual leave being frozen, loss of daily routine, and frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients) and psychological sequelae (e.g., greater severity of depression, anxiety, and stress) predicted lower QoL. Conversely, greater perceived social support from friends and significant others predicted higher QoL. Clinical and demographic characteristics predicted QoL to a lesser extent: A history of pre-existing medical illness was associated only with lower physical health QoL, whereas older age and being single, divorced, or widowed were only predictive of higher environmental QoL. Efforts to enhance QoL among healthcare workers in response to the pandemic should focus on mitigating COVID-19-related stressors and psychological sequelae and facilitating social support.","Woon, L.

Six patients experienced depression during the pandemic. The pandemic caused all severely affected patients but one (n: 11, 92%) to abandon replacement therapy. However, two received on-demand therapy after exacerbation of their bleeding. Only one (25%) of four patients on prophylaxis received in-home therapy, whereas the others (75%) abandoned prophylaxis. It seems that COVID-19 infection has great consequences on the lives of patients with CBDs, causing some to take dangerous actions, such as abandonment of their treatment. Healthcare systems, and healthcare providers, should have an appropriate strategy for management of patients with CBDs that prevents infection and provides timely replacement therapy.","Dorgalaleh, Akbar; Tabibian, Shadi; Baghaipour, Mohammad Reza; Dabbagh, Ali; Bahoush, Gholamreza; Jazebi, Mohammad; Bahraini, Mehran; Fazeli, Alieh; Yousefi, Forough",Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,39,17

The article does not provide a review of the field, but rather a personal view of the authors, informed by contributions of all participants, on new directions in active matter research. The topics highlighted include: the ubiquitous occurrence of spontaneous flows and active turbulence and the theoretical and experimental challenges associated with controlling and harnessing such flows; the role of motile topological defects in ordered states of active matter and their possible biological relevance; the emergence of non-reciprocal effective interactions and the role of chirality in active systems and their intriguing connections to non-Hermitian quantum mechanics; the progress towards a formulation of the thermodynamics of active systems thanks to the feedback between theory and experiments; the impact of the active matter framework on our understanding of the emergent mechanics of biological tissue. These seemingly diverse phenomena all stem from the defining property of active matter - assemblies of self-driven entities that individually break time-reversal symmetry and collectively organize in a rich variety of nonequilibrium states.","Bowick, Mark J.; Fakhri, Nikta; Marchetti, M.

Specific antibodies against SAS-COV-2 could be detected in COVID-19 patients' serum or plasma, but the clinical values of these antibodies as well as the effects of clinical drugs on humoral responses have not been fully demonstrated. In this study, 112 plasma samples were collected from 36 patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The IgG and IgM antibodies against receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike protein subunit 1 (S1) of SAS-COV-2 were detected by ELISA. We found that COVID-19 patients generated specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after infection, and the levels of anti-RBD IgG within 2 to 3 weeks from onset were negatively associated with the time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Patients with severe symptoms had higher levels of anti-RBD IgG in 2 to 3 weeks from onset. The use of chloroquine did not significantly influence the patients' antibody titer but reduced C-reaction protein (CRP) level. Using anti-viral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol) reduced antibody titer and peripheral lymphocyte count. While glucocorticoid therapy developed lower levels of peripheral lymphocyte count and higher levels of CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), &#945;-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase(&#945;-HBDH), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL). From these results, we suggested that the anti-RBD IgG may provide an early protection of host humoral responses against SAS-COV-2 infection within 2 to 3 weeks from onset, and clinical treatment with different drugs displayed distinct roles in humoral and inflammatory responses.","Wei, Liwen; Shang, Yuqi; Liu, Xi; Li, Xinghua; Chen, Gongqi; Liang, Siping; Zou, Zhengyu; Ding, Tao; Hong, Zhongsi; Wu, Minhao; Xia, Jinyu",Front Immunol,39,1

Even though the indicator does not provide information about the behaviour of individuals, it captures valuable insights into the mobility patterns of the population in the EU and it is expected to inform responses against the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatio-temporal harmonisation is carried out so that the indicator can provide mobility estimates comparable across European countries. The indicators are provided at a high spatial granularity (up to NUTS3). As an application, the indicator is used to study the impact of COVID-19 confinement measure on mobility in Europe. It is found that a large proportion of the change in mobility patterns can be explained by these measures. The paper also presents a comparative analysis between mobility and the infection reproduction number R t over time. These findings will support policymakers in formulating the best data-driven approaches for coming out of confinement, mapping the socio-economic effects of the lockdown measures and building future scenarios in case of new outbreaks.","Santamaria, Carlos; Sermi, Francesco; Spyratos, Spyridon; Iacus, Stefano Maria; Annunziato, Alessandro; Tarchi, Dario; Vespe, Michele",Saf Sci,39,14

The Government of India, State governments, and healthcare organizations have developed various mobile apps for the containment of COVID-19. This study was aimed to systematically review COVID-19 related mobile apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives. Methods: Google Play and the Apple app stores were searched using the terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', and 'epidemic' in the first week of April 2020. A list of COVID-19-specific functions was compiled based on the review of the selected apps, the literature on epidemic surveillance, and national and international media reports. The World Health Organization guideline on Digital Health Interventions was used to classify the app functions under the categories of the general public, health workers, health system managers, and data services. Results: The search yielded 346 potential COVID-19 apps, of which 50 met the inclusion criteria. Dissemination of untargeted COVID-19-related information on preventative strategies and monitoring the movements of quarantined individuals was the function of 27 (54%) and 19 (32%) apps, respectively. Eight (16%) apps had a contact tracing and hotspot identification function. Interpretation & conclusions: Our study highlights the current emphasis on the development of self-testing, quarantine monitoring, and contact tracing apps. India's response to COVID-19 can be strengthened by developing comprehensive mHealth solutions for frontline healthcare workers, rapid response teams and public health authorities. Among this unprecedented global health emergency, the Governments must ensure the necessary but least intrusive measures for disease surveillance.","Bassi, Abhinav; Arfin, Sumaiya; John, Oommen; Jha, Vivekanand",Indian journal of medical research,39,1

Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 from 21 hospitals in Hubei province, China between December 31, 2019 and April 21, 2020. Patients who were aged < 18 or &#8805; 85 years old, in pregnancy, with acute lethal organ injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, severe acute pancreatitis, acute stroke), hypothyroidism, malignant diseases, severe malnutrition, and those with normal lipid profile under lipid-lowering medicines (e.g., statin, niacin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and ezetimibe) were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at 1:1 ratio was performed to minimize baseline differences between patient groups of hyperlipidemia and non-hyperlipidemia. PSM analyses with the same strategies were further conducted for the parameters of hyperlipidemia in patients with increased triglyceride (TG), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Mixed-effect Cox model analysis was performed to investigate the associations of the 28-days all-cause deaths of COVID-19 patients with hyperlipidemia and the abnormalities of lipid parameters. The results were verified in male, female patients, and in patients with pre-existing CVDs and type 2 diabetes. Results Of 10 945 inpatients confirmed as COVID-19, there were 9822 inpatients included in the study, comprising 3513 (35.8%) cases without hyperlipidemia and 6309 (64.2%) cases with hyperlipidemia. Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after PSM at 1:1 ratio, hyperlipidemia was not associated with increased or decreased 28-day all-cause death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.95-1.44), P =0.151]. We found that the parameters of hyperlipidemia were not associated with the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality [adjusted HR, 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.55), P = 0.075 in TG increase group; 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07), P = 0.123 in LDL-C increase group; and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.9-1.39), P = 0.299 in HDL-C decrease group, respectively]. Hyperlipidemia was also not significantly associated with the increased mortality of COVID-19 in patients accompanied with CVDs or type 2 diabetes, and in both male and female cohorts. Conclusion Our study support that the imbalanced lipid profile is not significantly associated with the 28-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients, even in those accompanied with CVDs or diabetes. Similar results were also obtained in subgroup analyses of abnormal lipid parameters. Therefore, hyperlipidemia might be not a major causative factor for poor outcome of COVID-19, which provides guidance for the intervention of inpatients during the epidemic of COVID-19.","Wu, Bin; Zhou, Jiang Hua; Wang, Wen Xin; Yang, Hui Lin; Xia, Meng; Zhang, Bing Hong; She, Zhi Gang; Li, Hong Liang",Chin Med Sci J,39,1

As a consequence, many follow-up visits in patients with previously excised skin cancers were delayed. The aim of this retrospective real-life case-control study is demonstrating that delay in follow-up led to an increased incidence of advanced melanoma and keratinocyte cancers on the total of surgically excised skin cancers. METHODS: The incidence of excised advanced melanoma and keratinocyte cancers in our dermato-surgery division in the period May 18 to November 18, 2020, was compared to the same time span of 2019. All data were collected from the electronic database of our department. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the risk of excised advanced skin cancers in 2020 compared to 2019. RESULTS: From May to November 2019, we performed 265 surgical excisions, while during the pandemic in 2020, we completed 280 surgeries. The number of advanced skin cancers excised between May 18 and November 18, 2020, was significantly higher compared with the same period in 2019 (54 vs. 22, OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.56-4.47; P = 0.0003). Significant differences were also observed regarding the number of surgically removed advanced BCCs (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.14-4.07; P = 0.0187) and advanced SCCs (OR 4.60; 95% CI 1.31-16.18; P = 0.0175). CONCLUSION: These results confirm that delay in follow-up and, consequently, postponed surgical excisions are related to an increased incidence of advanced skin tumors, resulting in poorer prognosis lifelong. Follow-up visits should be carried on even during COVID-19 pandemic, avoiding significant delays as much as possible.","Valenti, Mario; Pavia, Giulia; Gargiulo, Luigi; Facheris, Paola; Nucca, Ombretta; Mancini, Luca; Sacrini, Francesco; Borroni, Riccardo G; Narcisi, Alessandra; Costanzo, Antonio",Int J Dermatol,39,21

Clinical trials have shown SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to be highly efficacious against both disease and infection. However, those currently in use were primarily tested against early lineages. Data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against variants of concern (VOC), including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), remain limited. To examine the effectiveness of vaccination in Utah we compared the proportion of cases reporting vaccination to that expected at different VEs, then estimated the combined daily vaccine effectiveness using a field evaluation approach. Delta has rapidly outcompeted all other variants and, as of June 20th, represents 70% of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses sequenced in Utah. If we attribute the entire change in VE to the Delta variant, the estimated vaccine effectiveness against Delta would be 82% (95% CI: 78%, 85%). We show a modest reduction in vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 in Utah corresponding to the expansion of the Delta lineage in the state.

However, manifestations in other organs should not be ignored since they can also be a mode of transmission. We sought to describe the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 and investigate the association between ocular involvement and clinical presentation and laboratory outcomes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Ninety-three sequentially hospitalized and clinically confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The systemic and ocular symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 93 COVID-19 patients, 54 (58.1%) were male, and 39 (41.9%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 39.4 ± 21.9 (min 7, max 88) years. Twenty patients (n 21.5%) had at least one ocular abnormality. Most common findings included hyperemia (n = 20), epiphora (n = 9), increased secretion (n = 6), chemosis (n = 3), follicular conjunctivitis (n = 2), and episcleritis (n = 2). The most common symptom was photophobia (n 15). Patients with ocular involvement were more likely to have higher neutrophil counts (p = 0.001), and increased CRP (p < 0.001), PCT (p = 0.001), and ESR levels (p < 0.001). Mean lymphocyte count was statistically lower in patients with ocular manifestations (p = 0.001). Mean age and number of patients with fever over 37.3 °C in the ocular involvement group was found to be higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Older age, high fever, increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and high levels of acute phase reactants seemed to be risk factors for ocular involvement.","Bostanci Ceran, Basak; Ozates, Serdar",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,39,3

In the absence of vaccines that provide complete protection against these viruses, viral surveillance can identify disease burden and target virus-specific preventative measures. Influenza infection, in particular, has significant adverse effects on force readiness. METHODS: We tracked the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center tested for during routine patient care using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen testing. We collected data on the date and location of the testing, as well as the age of the individual tested from two consecutive respiratory viral seasons. RESULTS: During the first year of data compilation (2017-2018), 2556 tests were performed; 342 (13.4%) were positive for influenza A and 119 (4.7%) were positive for influenza B. After influenza, the most common families of viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus (490 [19.2%]). During the second year (2018-2019), 4,458 tests were run; 564 (12.7%) were positive for influenza A and 35 (0.79%) were positive for influenza B, while rhino/enterovirus was identified in 690 (15.4%). Influenza peaked early during the 2017-2018 season and later during the 2018-2019 season. Importantly, during the 2017-2018 season, the vaccine was less effective for the H3N2 strain circulating that year and viral surveillance quickly identified a hospital-specific outbreak and a larger disease burden. This was in contrast to the 2018-2019 vaccine which exhibited higher effectiveness for circulating strains. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the seasonality of respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza. By tracking respiratory viruses in Department of Defense communities, we may be able to predict when influenza may cause the greatest burden for distinct organizational regions and prescribe with greater precision preventative protocols by location, as well as rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Our current data suggest that when vaccine strains are mismatched, rapid upfront targeting of antivirals may be warranted, but when the vaccine strains are better matched, late season peaks of disease may indicate waning immunity and should be monitored.","Crouch, Elena; Gonzalez, Jonathan; Jacobs, Erin; Schaecher, Kurt; Kehl, Margaret; Ottolini, Martin; Malloy, Allison",Mil Med,39,16

Corpus analysis is also a part of big data analysis. For many cases of statistic-based corpus techniques adopted to analyze English for specific purposes (ESP), researchers extracted critical information by retrieving domain-oriented lexical units. However, even if corpus software embraces algorithms such as log-likelihood tests, log ratios, BIC scores, etc., the machine still cannot understand linguistic meanings. In many ESP cases, function words reduce the efficiency of corpus analysis. However, many studies still use manual approaches to eliminate function words. Manual annotation is inefficient and time-wasting, and can easily cause information distortion. To enhance the efficiency of big textual data analysis, this paper proposes a novel statistic-based corpus machine processing approach to refine big textual data. Furthermore, this paper uses COVID-19 news reports as a simulation example of big textual data and applies it to verify the efficacy of the machine optimizing process. The refined resulting data shows that the proposed approach is able to rapidly remove function and meaningless words by machine processing and provide decision- makers with domain-specific corpus data for further purposes.","Chen, Liang-Ching; Chang, Kuei-Hu; Chung, Hsiang-Yu",Appl.

However, nAb response against SARS-CoV-2, when present, decays rapidly. Given the myriad roles of antibodies in immune responses, it is possible that antibodies could also mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 via effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which we sought to explore here. METHODS: Plasma of 3 uninfected controls and 20 subjects exposed to, or recovering from, SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in the plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing capability of these plasmas was assessed with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. ADCC activity was assessed with a calcein release assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in all COVID-19 subjects studied. All but three COVID-19 subjects contained nAb at high potency (>80% neutralization). Plasma from 19/20 of COVID-19 subjects also demonstrated strong ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including two individuals without nAb against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing COVID-19 plasmas can mediate ADCC. Our findings argue that evaluation of potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should include investigation of the magnitude and durability of ADCC, in addition to nAb.","Tso, For Yue; Lidenge, Salum J; Poppe, Lisa K; Peña, Phoebe B; Privatt, Sara R; Bennett, Sydney J; Ngowi, John R; Mwaiselage, Julius; Belshan, Michael; Siedlik, Jacob A; Raine, Morgan A; Ochoa, Juan B; Garcia-Diaz, Julia; Nossaman, Bobby; Buckner, Lyndsey; Roberts, W Mark; Dean, Matthew J; Ochoa, Augusto C; West, John T; Wood, Charles",PLoS One,39,1

Despite the availability of vaccine to prevent HPV types 6 and 11, the cause of >95% anogenital warts, they remain an important and frequent health problem. The previous systematic review of randomized controlled trials for anogenital warts was updated. The changes in the present guideline include the following: Updated background information on the prevalence, natural history and transmission of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and anogenital warts. Key recommendations for diagnosis and treatment have been graded according to the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence. 5-fluorouracil, local interferon and photodynamic therapy have been evaluated and included as potential second-line treatment options. Evidence of the impact of HPV vaccination on the incidence of anogenital warts has been updated.","Gilson, R; Nugent, D; Werner, R N; Ballesteros, J; Ross, J",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,39,24

While journalism is meant to process yet unknown events by design, the dynamically evolving situation affected all aspects of life in such profound ways that even the routines of crisis reporting seemed to be insufficient. Critics noted tendencies to horse-race reporting and uncritical coverage, with journalism being too close to official statements and too affirmative of political decisions. However, empirical data on the performance of journalistic news media during the crisis has been lacking thus far. The current study analyzes the Facebook messages of journalistic news media during the early Coronavirus crisis, based on a large German data set from January to March 2020. Using computational content analysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors, negativity of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and conspiracy theories were examined. The topical structure of the near-time Facebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis, with just partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat lacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage on Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media covered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false claims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of journalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did not find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities. Overall, journalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling, information-poor pandemic news, but they responded with a multi-perspective coverage of the crisis.","Quandt, Thorsten; Boberg, Svenja; Schatto-Eckrodt, Tim; Frischlich, Lena",,39,20

Objectives: To examine differences in COVID-19 hospital mortality rates between Black and White patients and to assess whether the mortality rates reflect differences in patient characteristics by race or by the hospitals to which Black and White patients are admitted. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assessed Medicare beneficiaries admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 to 1188 US hospitals from January 1, 2020, through September 21, 2020. Exposure: Hospital admission for a diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary composite outcome was inpatient death or discharge to hospice within 30 days of admission. We estimated the association of patient-level characteristics (including age, sex, zip code-level income, comorbidities, admission from a nursing facility, and days since January 1, 2020) with differences in mortality or discharge to hospice among Black and White patients. To examine the association with the hospital itself, we adjusted for the specific hospitals to which patients were admitted. We used simulation modeling to estimate the mortality among Black patients had they instead been admitted to the hospitals where White patients were admitted. Results: Of the 44â¯217 Medicare beneficiaries included in the study, 24â¯281 (55%) were women; mean (SD) age was 76.3 (10.5) years; 33â¯459 participants (76%) were White, and 10â¯758 (24%) were Black. Overall, 2634 (8%) White patients and 1100 (10%) Black patients died as inpatients, and 1670 (5%) White patients and 350 (3%) Black patients were discharged to hospice within 30 days of hospitalization, for a total mortality-equivalent rate of 12.86% for White patients and 13.48% for Black patients. Black patients had similar odds of dying or being discharged to hospice (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.12) in an unadjusted comparison with White patients. After adjustment for clinical and sociodemographic patient characteristics, Black patients were more likely to die or be discharged to hospice (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19). This difference became indistinguishable when adjustment was made for the hospitals where care was delivered (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10). In simulations, if Black patients in this sample were instead admitted to the same hospitals as White patients in the same distribution, their rate of mortality or discharge to hospice would decline from the observed rate of 13.48% to the simulated rate of 12.23% (95% CI for difference, 1.20%-1.30%). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that Black patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had higher rates of hospital mortality or discharge to hospice than White patients after adjustment for the personal characteristics of those patients. However, those differences were explained by differences in the hospitals to which Black and White patients were admitted.","Asch, David A; Islam, Md Nazmul; Sheils, Natalie E; Chen, Yong; Doshi, Jalpa A; Buresh, John; Werner, Rachel M",JAMA Netw Open,39,6

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of sleep disturbances during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This web-based cross-sectional study recruited 1138 Hong Kong adults using convenience sampling over a two-week period from 6th April 2020. The survey collected data on sleep disturbances, mood, stress, stock of infection control supplies, perceived risk of being infected by COVID-19, and sources for acquiring COVID-19 information. The participants were asked to compare their recent sleep and sleep before the outbreak. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to assess their current insomnia severity. Prevalence was weighted according to 2016 population census. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of worsened sleep quality, difficulty in sleep initiation, and shortened sleep duration since the outbreak were 38.3%, 29.8%, and 29.1%, respectively. The prevalence of current insomnia (ISI score of &#8805;10) was 29.9%. Insufficient stock of masks was significantly associated with worsened sleep quality, impaired sleep initiation, shortened sleep duration, and current insomnia in multivariate logistic regression (adjusted OR = 1.57, 1.72, 1.99, and 1.96 respectively, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of people in Hong Kong felt that their sleep had worsened since the COVID-19 outbreak. Insufficient stock of masks was one of the risk factors that were associated with sleep disturbances. Adequate and stable supply of masks may play an important role to maintain the sleep health in the Hong Kong general population during a pandemic outbreak.","Yu, Branda Yee-Man; Yeung, Wing-Fai; Lam, Jason Chun-Sing; Yuen, Sam Chun-Sum; Lam, Simon Ching; Chung, Vincent Chi-Ho; Chung, Ka-Fai; Lee, Paul Hong; Ho, Fiona Yan-Yee; Ho, Janice Yuen-Shan",Sleep Med,39,30

This would apply to dental students as well. Thus, it is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination rates in this group. Further, as healthcare providers, they are entrusted with providing health recommendations and advocating for their patients, community, and profession, including vaccinations. METHODS: Using ualtricsXM an online platform, in 2020, a survey was administered anonymously to dental students at three dental schools to assess the attitudes of dental students to the novel COVID-19 vaccine. Factors and reasons associated with vaccine hesitancy and acceptance toward the COVID-19 vaccine and likelihood of recommending and giving the vaccination to patients were assessed. RESULTS: Nearly, all participants had positive attitudes toward vaccines in general, agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19, and personally knew someone who had COVID-19; however, only 56% are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as an FDA-approved vaccine was available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine, 63% reported they would take it if mandated by the health systems/dental school; however, 16.3% of the overall respondents would not take the COVID-19 vaccine even if mandated. Several factors are associated with vaccine acceptance and the likelihood of recommending the vaccination, such as trusting public health experts, concerns about side effects, and agreeing with vaccine mandates. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine.","Mascarenhas, Ana Karina; Lucia, Victoria C; Kelekar, Arati; Afonso, Nelia M",J. dent. educ,39,16

Selenoprotein S is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane associated selenoprotein that is involved in protein degradation and NF?? signaling. It also contributes to reducing proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-6. Selenoprotein S is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein (nsp7), which is part of the virus replication machine. However, it is not clear whether they interact directly and whether selenoprotein S can still bind nsp7 once it is in complex with the virus? replication machinery. The role of selenoprotein S in the replication complex is unknown. We used biochemical assays to investigate these open questions and to identify which segment of selenoprotein S is involved in the interaction and which segment is free to recruit other human or viral proteins. We show that selenoprotein S binds tightly and directly to nsp7. Selenoprotein S is a membrane protein and its hydrophobic region is the main segment involved in binding nsp7. The soluble cytosolic segment cannot bind to nsp7. Therefore, it is free for binding to other protein partners. In addition, selenoprotein S was able to bind the nsp7 and nsp8 complex suggesting that it can bind the core replication complex directly. Thus, we suggest that selenoprotein S is a component of the virus core replication complex and may be responsible for recruiting other human proteins to the replication complex.","Ghelichkhani, Farid Cheng Rujin Gonzalez-Arias Fabio Rozovsky Sharon",The FASEB Journal,39,33

We report a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia leading to ARDS and subsequent development of an alveolopleural fistula who was successfully treated with multiple endobronchial valves. Case: The Patient was a 55-year-old Hispanic male who presented with 2 days of dry cough and shortness of breath. Vital signs on admission showed an oxygen saturation of 68% on ambient air and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. He was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have a positive SARS-Cov2 infection. Initial CT chest without contrast showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. His oxygen requirement increased as well as his work of breathing requiring BiPAP, and subsequent intubation. On the 10th day of admission, he developed a right-sided pneumothorax, requiring chest tube placement. A tracheostomy was completed on day 14 for further ventilator weaning. On day 20, he developed persistent air leak concerning for an alveolopleural fistula, repeat CT chest concerning for a moderate-sized pneumothorax and findings concerning for post ARDS fibrotic lungs. He continued to have persistent air leak but was not deemed to be a surgical candidate hence he was referred for endobronchial valve placement to facilitate chest tube removal and ventilator weaning. Bronchoscopy was done on day 41 of admission. Total 6 endobronchial valves were placed (right middle and lower lobes). Over next few days his leak completely resolved. Patient was weaned off of positive pressure a week later to trach collar, and the chest tube was subsequently removed. Discussion: Alveolopleural fistula is a communication or fistula between a alveoli and the pleural space. Patient's with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 requiring high amounts of PEEP and are at higher risk in developing a pneumothorax. Endobronchial valves (EBV) have been used since 2005 to treat alveolopleural and bronchopleural fistula in patients who are not considered a good surgical candidate. This is the first documented use of an EBV in the setting of COVID-19 that we could find. The placement of the valves, allowed a significant reduction in the air leak. This assisted in the patient's breathing trials on the ventilator and tracheostomy collar trials by reducing the overall volume loss through the fistula, ultimately allowing the patient to successfully liberated from the ventilator and have his chest tubes removed.","Pathak, V.; Chalise, S.

The robot has already been deployed in several health care facilities, where it is functioning autonomously, assisting staff and patients on an everyday basis. Lio is intrinsically safe by having full coverage in soft artificial-leather material as well as collision detection, limited speed and forces. Furthermore, the robot has a compliant motion controller. A combination of visual, audio, laser, ultrasound and mechanical sensors are used for safe navigation and environment understanding. The ROS-enabled setup allows researchers to access raw sensor data as well as have direct control of the robot. The friendly appearance of Lio has resulted in the robot being well accepted by health care staff and patients. Fully autonomous operation is made possible by a flexible decision engine, autonomous navigation and automatic recharging. Combined with time-scheduled task triggers, this allows Lio to operate throughout the day, with a battery life of up to 8 hours and recharging during idle times. A combination of powerful computing units provides enough processing power to deploy artificial intelligence and deep learning-based solutions on-board the robot without the need to send any sensitive data to cloud services, guaranteeing compliance with privacy requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lio was rapidly adjusted to perform additional functionality like disinfection and remote elevated body temperature detection. It complies with ISO13482 - Safety requirements for personal care robots, meaning it can be directly tested and deployed in care facilities.","Miseikis, Justinas; Caroni, Pietro; Duchamp, Patricia; Gasser, Alina; Marko, Rastislav; Miseikiene, Nelija; Zwilling, Frederik; De Castelbajac, Charles; Eicher, Lucas; Fruh, Michael; Fruh, Hansruedi",IEEE Robot.

Whilst this is good practice for non-chemotherapyprescriptions, it is not a requirement of the Clinical TrialRegulations.[2] Interruption to validate trial prescriptionscan have a negative impact on pharmacists' duty and consequently patient outcomes. With limited data available, thisissue has been highlighted by anecdotal evidence. Due to theoften complex requirements associated with trials, the research team are responsible for assessing the suitability oftreatment. This includes checking interactions with concomitant medication, reviewing blood results and patient counselling. The clinical aspect of the pharmacist validation istherefore removed, allowing technicians to be involved in thescreening of suitable prescriptions. Much is written on technicians extending their roles in the clinical setting, but thisservice improvement focuses on enhancing their role withinthe pharmacy clinical trials department.Aim: To evaluate the amount of pharmacists' time savedby the introduction of technician screening of clinical trialprescriptions.Method: A risk-based proforma was created and usedby a pharmacist to assess clinical trial prescriptions for thesuitability of screening by a Band 7 technician. Only prescriptions with pre-printed doses, no aseptic preparationor additional medicines, were approved for technicianscreening. The process of screening therefore only involvesthe checking of patient and prescriber details, allergy statusand possibly a medication randomisation. The techniciansunder-went an in-house training including the screening ofprescriptions under pharmacist supervision. A quantitativedata collection tool was used to review the screening/validation of all nonchemotherapy clinical trial prescriptionsreceived at two sites over a two-week period in September2020. The data collection tool was piloted and all data wasanalysed using Microsoft Excel. Results: A total of 89 prescriptions were received. 56(63%) were eligible for technician screening, of which a suitable technician validated 50%.Across both sites a total time of 360 minutes were spentvalidating/screening prescriptions including solving prescription related issues. Combining the time taken by a pharmacistto return from a clinical area and screening time consequentlysaved a total of 227 minutes of pharmacists' time.Conclusion: Distributing the workload amongst trainedstaff saves pharmacist's time, which can be utilised on clinical and complex tasks. This does not eliminate the requirement of a pharmacist to validate prescriptions however;itreduces the frequency and streamlines the service. Furtherdata collection is required to analyse the direct impact onpatients' and any changes in the number of reported errors.A limitation to the study is the lack of data prior to implementation as a comparator. Additionally, during data collection there were no suitable technicians available at onesite due to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in only 50%of eligible prescriptions being screened by a technician.Ultimately, this does not change the outcome;enhancingtechnician's roles allows pharmacists' time to be used moreefficiently.","Mistry, D.; Awan, S.; Lundy, E.; Bedford, C.; Thorp, H.; Houseman, K.; Chapman, J.; Smalley, P.; Stradling, J.",International Journal of Pharmacy Practice,39,26

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between January 18 and March 20, 2020, including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in 3 Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions. Noncritical events were seen in fewer than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic, and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in 9. Findings from lumbar puncture in 3 with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache, or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and with neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness.

Clinical data and epidemiologic history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing. Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days. There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment. All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.

Children were reported to manifest mild to moderate symptoms and mortality was primarily observed in patients aged <1 year and having underlying comorbidities. The majority of the cases were asymptomatic in children, hence, posing a challenge for pediatric surgery centers to take drastic measures to reduce the virus transmission. Telemedicine was introduced and outpatient consultations were conducted online as out-patient clinics were closed. Elective surgeries were postponed with delayed appointments while the healthcare sector was diverted towards tackling COVID-19. Case urgency was classified and triaged, leading to limited surgeries being performed only in COVID-19 negative patients following an extensive screening process. The screening process consisted of online history taking and RT-PCR tests. Newer practices such as mouth rinse, video laryngoscopy, and anesthesia were introduced to restrict patients from crying, coughing, and sneezing, as an attempt to avoid aerosolization of viral particles and safely conduct pediatric surgeries during the pandemic. Surgical trainees were also affected as the smaller number of surgeries conducted reduced the clinical experience available to medical enthusiasts.

The coronavirus is more dangerous to the elderly and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions which is precisely the profile of lung cancer patients. Essential cancer services should be delivered but all steps should be taken to protect patients and the health workforce from infection with COVID-19. This presents a major challenge to radiotherapy (RT) departments worldwide. An international panel with expertise in the management of lung cancer in high-volume comprehensive centres has come together to share its experience on COVID-19 preparedness to deliver optimal care in such exceptional circumstances. A comprehensive systematic review of the literature through a PubMed search was undertaken. Twelve recommendations including, among others, the consideration of shorter courses, delays, and the omission of RT for lung cancer are proposed by the panel. In summary, we recommend the screening of every single person accessing the treatment room, the consideration of hypofractionation and to delay postoperative RT for non-small cell lung cancer, to avoid twice-daily treatments and delay or deliver prophylactic cranial irradiation during radio(chemo)therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, review image guided RT images for suspicious image findings, and the use of single-fraction RT for the palliative treatment of stage IV lung cancer patients. Given that lung cancer is one of the most common and severe pathologies in radiation oncology departments, the following recommendations require particularly urgent consideration. The decision-making paths strongly depend on locally available resources, and a tailored approach should be used to attend lung cancer patients during this pandemic.","Liao, Zhongxing; Rivin Del Campo, Eleonor; Salem, Ahmed; Pang, Qingsong; Liu, Hui; Lopez Guerra, Jose Luis",Lung Cancer,39,22

The tube was made of two-layer of PTFE membrane measuring 8 * 6 mm with a thickness of 1.8 mm and a silicone tube. The rabbits and the human eyes underwent surgical implantation of the tube in the anterior chamber. The histopathologic evaluation was done using H&E staining. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure and the number of glaucoma medications were assessed before and after the surgery. Results: In the histopathologic evaluation, subconjunctival polarizing fibers of a synthetic mesh infiltrated by fibrovascular septa was seen. A granulomatous inflammatory reaction composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells were seen around and between the synthetic bundles. The average age of patients was 63 ± 5.5 years. The mean IOP reached from 36.6 ± 5.7 mmHg at baseline to 16.2 ± 8.9 mmHg at the final follow-up. Patients were followed for an average of 6.6 ± 4.5 months. One patient found hypotony refractory to medical and surgical treatment, which led to implant removal. One patient had uncontrolled IOP and finally led to phthisis bulbi following slow CPC. The remaining four eyes did well during the follow-up. Conclusion: The use of PTFE as a new polymer in tube shunt construction was reported. Larger studies, modification of the PTFE membranes like changing the porosity amount, and size of PTFE membranes might result in different conclusions.","Samaeili, Azadeh; Rahmani, Saeed; Hassanpour, Kiana; Meshksar, Aidin; Ansari, Iman; Afsar-Aski, Sasha; Einollahi, Bahram; Pakravan, Mohammad",Rom J Ophthalmol,39,16

However, much uncertainty surrounds intensification of high-magnitude events that are often inadequately resolved by global climate models. In this analysis, we develop a framework involving targeted dynamical downscaling of historical and future extreme precipitation events produced by a large ensemble of a global climate model. This framework is applied to extreme ""atmospheric river"" storms in California. We find a substantial (10 to 40%) increase in total accumulated precipitation, with the largest relative increases in valleys and mountain lee-side areas. We also report even higher and more spatially uniform increases in hourly maximum precipitation intensity, which exceed Clausius-Clapeyron expectations. Up to 85% of this increase arises from thermodynamically driven increases in water vapor, with a smaller contribution by increased zonal wind strength. These findings imply substantial challenges for water and flood management in California, given future increases in intense atmospheric river-induced precipitation extremes.","Huang, Xingying; Swain, Daniel L; Hall, Alex D",Sci Adv,39,1

We aimed to determine the feasibility of automated lung volume measurements, including ground-glass volumes, on the CT of suspected COVID-19 patients. Our goal was to create an automated and quantitative measure of ground-glass opacities from lung CT images that could be used clinically for diagnosis, triage and research. DESIGN: Single centre, retrospective, observational study. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic data, respiratory support treatment (synthetised in the maximal respiratory severity score) and CT-images were collected. Volume of abnormal lung parenchyma was measured with conventional semi-automatic software and with a novel automated algorithm based on voxels X-Ray attenuation. We looked for the relationship between the automated and semi-automated evaluations. The association between the ground-glass opacities volume and the maximal respiratory severity score was assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the main outcome analysis. The mean duration of automated and semi-automated volume measurement process were 15 (2) and 93 (41) min, respectively (p = 8.05*10-8). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the semi-automated and automated measurement of ground-glass opacities and restricted normally aerated lung were both superior to 0.99. The association between the automated measured lung volume and the maximal clinical severity score was statistically significant for the restricted normally aerated (p = 0.0097, effect-size: -385 mL) volumes and for the ratio of ground-glass opacities/restricted normally aerated volumes (p = 0.027, effect-size: 3.3). CONCLUSION: The feasibility and preliminary validity of automated impaired lung volume measurements in a high-density COVID-19 cluster was confirmed by our results.","Noll, Eric; Soler, Luc; Ohana, Mickael; Ludes, Pierre-Olivier; Pottecher, Julien; Bennett-Guerrero, Elliott; Veillon, Francis; Goichot, Bernard; Schneider, Francis; Meyer, Nicolas; Diemunsch, Pierre",Anaesth.

Interestingly, our results show a significant variation of the relevant immune subset composition among CP donors. Regarding innate immunity, both non-classical monocytes, and CD11b- granulocytes had fully recovered at eight months post COVID-19 infection. Intermediate monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells had already been restored at the two-month evaluation and remained stable. Regarding adaptive immunity, the COVID-19-related skewed Th1 and Th2 cell polarization remained at the same levels as in two months. However, low levels of total B cells were detected even after eight months from infection. A persisting reduction of CD8+ Tregs and changes in the NKT cell compartment were also remarkable. CP donors present with a unique immune landscape at eight months post COVID-19 infection, which is characterized by the notable restoration of the components of innate immunity along with a persisting imprint of SARS-CoV-2 in cells of the adaptive immunity.","Kostopoulos, Ioannis V; Orologas-Stavrou, Nikolaos; Rousakis, Pantelis; Panteli, Chrysanthi; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Charitaki, Ioanna; Korompoki, Eleni; Gavriatopoulou, Maria; Kastritis, Efstathios; Trougakos, Ioannis P; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Tsitsilonis, Ourania E; Terpos, Evangelos",,39,30

This study aimed to evaluate staff awareness of PPE guidance, perceptions of PPE measures, and concerns regarding PPE use while caring for COVID-19 patients. In addition, responses of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals (OHCPs) were compared. Methods: The inclusion criteria were all staff working in clinical areas of the hospital. Staff were invited to take part using a link to an online questionnaire advertised by email, posters displayed in clinical areas, and social media. Questions grouped into the three key themes - staff awareness, perceptions, and concerns - were answered using a five-point Likert scale. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare results across all three groups of staff. Results: Overall, 315 staff took part in our study. There was a high awareness of PPE guidance at 84.4%, but only 52.4% of staff reported adequate PPE provision. 67.9% were still keen to come to work, despite very high levels of anxiety relating to contracting COVID-19 despite wearing PPE. Doctors had significantly higher ratings for questions relating to PPE awareness compared to other staff groups, while nursing staff and OHCPs had significantly higher levels of anxiety compared to doctors in relation to PPE and contracting COVID-19 (p < 0.05 using a Kruskal-Wallis test). Conclusion: We believe four recommendations are key to improve PPE measures and decrease anxiety: 1) nominated ward/department PPE champions; 2) anonymized reporting for PPE concerns; 3) formal PPE education sessions; and 4) drop-in counselling sessions for staff. We hope the insight and recommendations from this study can improve the PPE situation and maintain the health and wellbeing of the clinical work force, in order to care for COVID-19 patients safely and effectively.","Key, Thomas; Mathai, Naveen J; Venkatesan, Aakaash Sethuraman; Farnell, Damian; Mohanty, Khitish",Bone Jt Open,39,1

These relationship networks can create value and resources for organizations and individuals. This current study aimed to explore the potential impact of workplace social capital on the association between perceived stress and professional identity in clinical nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 308 Chinese clinical nurses filled out the Chinese Workplace Social Capital Scale, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and the Chinese Nurse's Professional Identity Scale. Descriptive analysis, independent samples t test, analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analyses, and bootstrap method were performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Perceived stress was negatively correlated with professional identity (r = -0.455, p < .001). Workplace social capital was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived stress and professional identity (95% CI -0.03 to- 0.06, p = .47 > .05). Instead, it mediated that relationship (95% CI -0.61 to -0.19, p < .05), and its mediating effect was -0.37. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, workplace social capital among the investigated clinical nurses failed to buffer the negative impact of perceived stress on professional identity, but it did play a part in mediating perceived stress and professional identity.

The total number of the infected has reached 313,844 and the number of deaths has reached 4,379 as of 16 January 2021. This article reviews the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021 in order to provide a reference for the next step in epidemic prevention and control. The Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on 7 April 2020, which suppressed the increase in the number of the infected by curtailing economic activity. The first wave peaked at 701 new cases a day and it decreased to 21 new cases on May 25 when the state of emergency was lifted. However, the number of the infected increased again due to the resumption of economic activity, with a peak of 1,762 new cases a day during the second wave. Although the situation was worse than that during the first wave, the government succeeded in limiting the increase without declaring a state of emergency again, and that may be attributed to a decrease in crowd activities and an increase in the number of inspections. During the third wave, the number of the infected continued to exceed the peak during previous waves for two months. Major factors for this rise include the government's implementation of further policies to encourage certain activities, relaxed immigration restrictions, and people not reducing their level of activity. An even more serious problem is the bed usage for patients with COVID-19; bed usage exceeds 50% not only in major cities but also in various areas. On 7 January 2021, 5,953 new cases were reported a day; this greatly exceeded the previous peak, and the state of emergency was declared again. Although Japan has been preparing its medical system since the first wave, maintaining that system has imposed a large economic burden on medical facilities, hence stronger measures and additional support are urgently needed to combat COVID-19 in the coming few months.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei; Kokudo, Norihiro",Biosci Trends,39,28

Here, we report our finding that even in a molecule with D and A not resolvable, CT can be induced by electronic state mixing (ESM) in a symmetric multi-chromophore system (MCS), namely 1,4-di(1-pyrenyl)benzene (Py-Benz-Py). Unlike Py and Py-Benz, Py-Benz-Py exhibits unique photophysical properties attributable to the reduction of the energy gap between two electronic states induced by ESM. The ESM for Py-Benz-Py is due to the extended &#960;-conjugation owing to the further introduction of Py into Py-Benz, and consequently leads to the favorable intramolecular CT, followed by the planarization due to the twisting motion between Py and phenyl moieties. Time-resolved spectroscopic data demonstrate that the twisting process of the Py moiety in acetonitrile occurs with two unequal time constants, suggesting the localized CT state and the asynchronous twisting dynamics of two Py moieties unlike the delocalized CT state in nonpolar and low-polarity solvents leading to the synchronous twisting of two Py moieties. This means that the symmetry-breaking CT in MCSs can induce an asynchronous twisting motion. The results reported here support that a molecule without CT can be turned into another molecule with CT induced by ESM and demonstrate that the excited-state relaxation dynamics can be regulated through the ESM induced by introducing the substituents or changing the environmental factors such as solvent polarities.","Kim, Siin; Ahn, Doo-Sik; Ahn, Mina; Wee, Kyung-Ryang; Choi, Jungkweon; Ihee, Hyotcherl",,39,33

It has been observed that the antifungals are not as effective as they used to be. Aims: To determine the effectiveness of terbinafine and itraconazole in different doses and in combination in the treatment of tinea infection. Materials and Methods: Study design was a randomized parallel group trial. Patients were randomly divided into five parallel arms in which two of the standard drugs in recommended doses were compared with their double doses and with combination of both the drugs. Patients were followed up every 2 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks. Cure was considered as complete clinical resolution of the lesions. Fungal culture and sensitivity were done by disk diffusion method for all patients. Parametric one-way analysis of variance (F test) and Chi-square test were used for the analysis. Results: Two-hundred seventy-five patients were included in the study. Itraconazole containing groups showed significantly higher cure rates than terbinafine only groups both at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.001). Itraconazole containing groups, when compared against each other, were not found to be significantly different. The outcomes between terbinafine only groups were also not significantly different. Cure rates at 8 weeks were found to be greater than that at 4 weeks for all groups which were found to be highly significant (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Itraconazole seems to be more effective than terbinafine. There is no benefit in increasing the dose or using a combination regimen in the treatment of tinea.

STUDY DESIGN: Bench testing. SETTING: Mannequin testing. METHODS: The mask was designed in SolidWorks and 3-dimensional printed. Mannequins were fitted with a nebulizer to generate aerosols. Commercial particle counters were used to measure mask performance. RESULTS: The ACM has 2 ports on either side for instruments and endoscopes, a port for a filter, and a port that can evacuate aerosols contained within the mask via a standard suction pump. The mask contained aerosols on a mannequin with and without facial hair when the suction was set to 18.5 L/min. Other types of masks demonstrated substantial aerosol leakage under similar conditions. In a subsequent experiment, the ACM contained aerosols generated by a nebulizer up to the saturation of the particle detector without measurable leakage with or without suction. CONCLUSION: The ACM will accommodate rigid and flexible endoscopes plus instruments and prevent leakage of patient-generated aerosols, thus avoiding contamination of the room and protecting health care workers from airborne contagions.

Seventeen OPOs responded to the survey (response rate of 89.5%). Organ authorization decreased by 11% during the current pandemic (n = 1379 vs n = 1552, P = .0001). Organ recovery for transplantation fell by 17% (P = .0001) with a further 18% decrease in the number of organs transplanted (P = .0001). Donor cause of death demonstrated a 4.5% decline in trauma but a 35% increase in substance abuse cases during the COVID-19 period. All OPOs reported significant modifications in response to the pandemic, limiting the onsite presence of staff and transitioning to telephonic approaches for donor family correspondence.

HRV analysis was performed through an assessment of time-domain indices (SDNN and RMSSD). Group analysis did not reveal any statistical difference between HRV metrics before, during, and after COVID-19. However, HRV at the individual level showed a statistically significant individual change during COVID-19 in some users. These data further support the usefulness of using individual-level HRV tracking for the detection of early diseases inclusive of COVID-19.","Ponomarev, Alexey; Tyapochkin, Konstantin; Surkova, Ekaterina; Smorodnikova, Evgeniya; Pravdin, Pavel",,39,1

Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","Liu, Qian; Zheng, Zequan; Zheng, Jiabin; Chen, Qiuyi; Liu, Guan; Chen, Sihan; Chu, Bojia; Zhu, Hongyu; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit",J Med Internet Res,39,1

Our approach applies computational and mathematical formulations to extract quantitative information from biomedical images. Our study explores the longitudinal OASIS-3 dataset, which consists of 4096 brain MRI scans collected over a period of 15 years. We perform feature extraction using Pyradiomics python package that quantizes brain MRI images using different texture analysis methods. Studies indicate that Radiomics has rarely been used for analysis of brain cognition; hence, our study is also a novel effort to determine the efficiency of Radiomics features extracted from structural MRI scans for classification of brain degenerative diseases and to create awareness about Radiomics. For classification tasks, we explore various ensemble learning classification algorithms such as random forests, bagging-based ensemble classifiers, and gradient-boosted ensemble classifiers such as XGBoost and AdaBoost. Such ensemble learning classifiers have not been used for biomedical image classification. We also propose a novel texture analysis matrix, Decreasing Gray-Level Matrix or DGLM. The features extracted from this filter helped to further improve the accuracy of our decision support system. The proposed system based on XGBoost ensemble learning classifiers achieves an accuracy of 97.38%, with sensitivity 99.82% and specificity 97.01%.","Jain, Manju; Rai, C S; Jain, Jai",Comput Math Methods Med,39,16

SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of COVID-19, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. For RNA viruses, virus-encoded RNA helicases have long been recognized to play pivotal roles during viral life cycles by facilitating the correct folding and replication of viral RNAs. Here, our studies show that SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) possesses the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) and RNA helicase activities that can hydrolyze all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices dependently of the presence of NTP, and further characterize the biochemical characteristics of these two enzymatic activities associated with SARS-CoV-2 nsp13. Moreover, we found that some bismuth salts could effectively inhibit both the NTPase and RNA helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, our findings demonstrate the NTPase and helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, which may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and serve as a target for antivirals.","Shu, Ting; Huang, Muhan; Wu, Di; Ren, Yujie; Zhang, Xueyi; Han, Yang; Mu, Jingfang; Wang, Ruibing; Qiu, Yang; Zhang, Ding-Yu; Zhou, Xi",Virol Sin,39,1

We thus sought to assess the effect of high-flow nasal oxygen on ventilator-free days, compared to early initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, on adult patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre cohort study using a prospectively collected database of patients with COVID-19 associated acute respiratory failure admitted to 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs). Main exposure was the use of high-flow nasal oxygen (conservative group), while early invasive mechanical ventilation (within the first day of ICU admission; early intubation group) served as the comparator. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days at 28 days. ICU length of stay and all-cause in-hospital mortality served as secondary outcomes. We used propensity score matching to adjust for measured confounding. RESULTS: Out of 468 eligible patients, a total of 122 matched patients were included in the present analysis (61 for each group). When compared to early intubation, the use of high-flow nasal oxygen was associated with an increase in ventilator-free days (mean difference: 8.0 days; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.4 to 11.7 days) and a reduction in ICU length of stay (mean difference: - 8.2 days; 95% CI - 12.7 to - 3.6 days). No difference was observed in all-cause in-hospital mortality between groups (odds ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.25 to 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: The use of high-flow nasal oxygen upon ICU admission in adult patients with COVID-19 related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may lead to an increase in ventilator-free days and a reduction in ICU length of stay, when compared to early initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation. Future studies should confirm our findings.","Mellado-Artigas, Ricard; Ferreyro, Bruno L; Angriman, Federico; Hernández-Sanz, María; Arruti, Egoitz; Torres, Antoni; Villar, Jesús; Brochard, Laurent; Ferrando, Carlos",Crit Care,39,15

Decisions on how to promote employees' health whilst working at home (WAH) need to be based on the best available evidence to optimise worker outcomes. The aim of this rapid review was to review the impact of WAH on individual workers' mental and physical health, and determine any gender difference, to develop recommendations for employers and employees to optimise workers' health. METHOD: A search was undertaken in three databases, PsychInfo, ProQuest, and Web of Science, from 2007 to May 2020. Selection criteria included studies which involved employees who regularly worked at home, and specifically reported on physical or mental health-related outcomes. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, one author extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments with review by a second author. RESULTS: Twenty-three papers meet the selection criteria for this review. Ten health outcomes were reported: pain, self-reported health, safety, well-being, stress, depression, fatigue, quality of life, strain and happiness. The impact on health outcomes was strongly influenced by the degree of organisational support available to employees, colleague support, social connectedness (outside of work), and levels of work to family conflict. Overall, women were less likely to experience improved health outcomes when WAH. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified several health outcomes affected by WAH. The health/work relationship is complex and requires consideration of broader system factors to optimise the effects of WAH on workers' health. It is likely mandated WAH will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future; organisations will need to implement formalised WAH policies that consider work-home boundary management support, role clarity, workload, performance indicators, technical support, facilitation of co-worker networking, and training for managers.","Oakman, Jodi; Kinsman, Natasha; Stuckey, Rwth; Graham, Melissa; Weale, Victoria",BMC Public Health,39,16

Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SG), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the co-expression of methylarginine reader TDRD3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pre-treatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Since type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.","Cai, Ting; Yu, Zhenbao; Wang, Zhen; Liang, Chen; Richard, Stéphane",J Biol Chem,39,26

The aim was to assess the quality of sleep (QoS) and fatigue in patients with the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: The study included 67 patients with RRMS and 85 healthy control subjects. RRMS patients, who were tested in first half of 2019, were retested in April and May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected sociodemographic and clinical data, and also used the following questionnaires: Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54). RESULTS: The FSS score and PSQI global score were significantly higher in patients with RRMS than in the control group (p < 0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results during the COVID-19 pandemic in PSQI global score (p < 0.01) and all subscores. Higher disability status was an independent predictor of the worse PSQI scores. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak worse QoS were noticed in RRMS patients than in healthy individuals. Also, QoS of RRMS patients is more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic than in regular circumstances. High levels of sleep disturbance and fatigue in RRMS patients correlates with worse life quality, female gender, lower educational level and partner status. The results of the present study provide evidence in support of regular screening and monitoring of fatigue and QoS in this patient population, especially during the pandemic states.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Vojinovic, Slobodan; Stojanov, Jelena; Malobabic, Marina; Stevic, Milos; Milosevic, Vuk; Stanojevic, Goran",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,39,21

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary academic center. A national survey of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was administered. Descriptive analyses were performed to determine how telehealth was employed in otolaryngologists' practices. Results: A total of 184 surveys were completed. Telehealth technology was used by 50% of otolaryngologists surveyed. Regions with the largest percentage of physicians using telehealth were the Mid-Atlantic region (84%) and West Coast (67%). Most otolaryngologists indicated that they were familiar with telehealth or any of its components and how it is used in practice (52-83%), they had heard of telehealth or any of its components but were unsure what the terms specifically entailed (17-42%); 53% were satisfied with their current use of telehealth and electronic medical record (EMR); and 72% were comfortable utilizing smart devices for patient care. Most otolaryngologists (65%) indicated reimbursement as the biggest limitation to implementing telehealth, and 67% believed that typing was a hindrance to EMR utility. Conclusion: Half of the surveyed otolaryngologists used some form of telehealth at the time of the survey. The most commonly cited obstacle to physician adoption of telehealth was reimbursement. Although the adoption of telehealth technology was still limited in the field of otolaryngology based on this study, we are now seeing significant change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, James C; Elson, Nora C; Epperson, Madison V; Doarn, Charles R; Altaye, Mekibib; Tabangin, Meredith E; Patil, Reena Dhanda; Patil, Yash J",Telemed. j. e. health,39,24

DESIGN.: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING.: ICU of an academic county hospital in Los Angeles, CA admitted from March 15-June 20, 2020. PATIENTS.: 77 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 75 patients met inclusion criteria. RESULTS.: 21% of patients with severe COVID-19 sustained barotrauma (33% of patients receiving IMV, 8% of patients receiving (NIV). There were no differences between the barotrauma and non-barotrauma groups regarding demographics, illness severity, or medications received, nor tidal volume or average/peak airway pressures in those receiving IMV. In the barotrauma group there was a greater proportion of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (81% vs. 47%, p = 0.023) and ventilated using airway pressure release ventilation mode (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.043). Barotrauma was associated with increased likelihood of receiving a tracheostomy (OR 2.58 [0.23-4.9], p = 0.018]), longer median ICU length of stay (17 days vs. 7 days, p = 0.03), and longer median length of hospitalization (26 days vs. 14 days, p < 0.001). There was also a trend toward prolonged median duration of IMV (12.5 days vs 7 days, p = 0.13) and higher average mortality (56% vs 37%, p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS.: Barotrauma is seen in 5-12% of patients with ARDS receiving IMV and is exceedingly rare in patients receiving NIV. We report a high incidence of barotrauma observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring either NIV or IMV. While there was a trend toward increased mortality in patients with barotrauma, this did not reach statistical significance. The increased incidence of barotrauma with COVID-19 may be a product of the pathophysiology of this disease state and a heightened inflammatory response causing rampant acute lung injury.

Remote examination of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) brings particular challenges, given the propensity of HS to affect intimate body areas. To understand the impact of remote consultations on the care of patients with HS, a retrospective analysis was conducted of all consultations from 2 April to 29 October 2020 at the HS clinic at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. In this group of patients with HS, 46.3% were black, compared with 7.0% of patients attending general dermatology clinics (P < 0.001). The majority (65.9%) of patients had previously received or were currently taking adalimumab. All consultations were performed by telephone and in 50.7% of the consultations, patients were assessed as having unstable (u)HS, with 81.1% of these uHS episodes leading to a change in pharmacological therapy. The decision-making process was aided by patient-submitted photographs at only 8.1% of consultations involving uHS, for reasons of patient privacy, comfort and data security. The data suggest that HS is an inherently unstable disease despite maximal medical therapy, and this study highlights important reasons for the assessment of patients with HS by FTF consultations where safely possible.","Patel, N P",Clin. exp. dermatol,39,6

The secondary objective was to identify explanatory factors associated with outcome of critical illness defined by a composite index of in-hospital mortality and organ system support requirement. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-eight PICUs within the Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study registry from March 2020 to January 2021. PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related illness with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 394 patients, 171 (43.4%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were more likely younger (2-12 yr vs adolescents; p < 0.01), Black (35.6% vs 21.9%; p < 0.01), present with fever/abdominal pain than cough/dyspnea (p < 0.01), and less likely to have comorbidities (33.3% vs 61.9%; p < 0.01) compared with those without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Inflammatory marker levels, use of inotropes/vasopressors, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants were higher in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients (p < 0.01). Overall mortality was 3.8% (15/394), with no difference in the two groups. Diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was associated with longer duration of hospitalization as compared to nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (7.5 d[interquartile range, 5-11] vs 5.3 d [interquartile range, 3-11 d]; p < 0.01). Critical illness occurred in 164 patients (41.6%) and was more common in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children compared with those without (55.6% vs 30.9%; p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis failed to show an association between critical illness and age, race, sex, greater than or equal to three signs and symptoms, or greater than or equal to two comorbidities among the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children cohort. Among nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients, the presence of greater than or equal to two comorbidities was associated with greater odds of critical illness (odds ratio 2.95 [95% CI, 1.61-5.40]; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study delineates significant clinically relevant differences in presentation, explanatory factors, and outcomes among children admitted to PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related illness stratified by multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.","Tripathi, Sandeep; Gist, Katja M; Bjornstad, Erica C; Kashyap, Rahul; Boman, Karen; Chiotos, Kathleen; Gharpure, Varsha P; Dapul, Heda; Sayed, Imran A; Kuehne, Joshua; Heneghan, Julia A; Gupta, Manoj; Khandhar, Paras B; Menon, Shina; Gupta, Neha; Kumar, Vishakha K; Retford, Lynn; Zimmerman, Jerry; Bhalala, Utpal S",Pediatric critical care medicine,39,20

Although a number of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, we still lack an understanding of the overall landscape of B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in COVID-19 patients. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of BCR repertoires collected over multiple time points during an infection to characterize statistical and dynamical signatures of the B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 patients with different disease severities. Based on principled statistical approaches, we determined differential sequence features of BCRs associated with different disease severity. We identified 34 significantly expanded rare clonal lineages shared among patients as candidates for a specific response to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we identified natural emergence of a BCR with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a number of patients.

Anthracnose disease is caused by the ascomycetes fungal species Colletotrichum, which is responsible for heavy yield losses in chilli and tomato worldwide. Conventionally, harmful pesticides are used to contain anthracnose disease with limited success. In this study, we assessed the potential of Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS) approach to target the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides COM1 (CgCOM1) developmental gene involved in the fungal conidial and appressorium formation, to restrict fungal infection in chilli and tomato fruits. For this study, we have developed stable transgenic lines of chilli and tomato expressing CgCOM1-RNAi construct employing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic plants were characterized by molecular and gene expression analyses. Production of specific CgCOM1 siRNA in transgenic chilli and tomato RNAi lines was confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. Fungal challenge assays on leaves and fruits showed that the transgenic lines were resistant to anthracnose disease-causing C. gloeosporioides in comparison to wild type and empty-vector control plants. RT-qPCR analyses in transgenic lines revealed extremely low abundance of CgCOM1 transcripts in the C. gloeosporioides infected tissues, indicating near complete silencing of CgCOM1 gene expression in the pathogen. Microscopic examination of the Cg-challenged leaves of chilli-CgCOM1i lines revealed highly suppressed conidial germination, germ tube development, appressoria formation and mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides, resulting in reduced infection of plant tissues. These results demonstrated highly efficient use of HIGS in silencing the expression of essential fungal developmental genes to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi, thus providing a highly precise approach to arrest the spread of disease.","Mahto, Binod Kumar; Singh, Anjulata; Pareek, Manish; Rajam, Manchikatla V; Dhar-Ray, Swatismita; Reddy, Pallavolu M",Plant mol. biol,39,16

Here we describe a strategy utilizing pan-family viral assays to improve early accessibility of large-scale nucleic acid testing. METHODS: Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were used as a case-study for assessing utility of pan-family viral assays during the early stages of a novel pandemic. Specificity of a pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) assay for a novel pathogen was assessed using the frequency of common human coronavirus (HCoV) species in key populations. A reported Pan-CoV assay was assessed to determine sensitivity to 60 reference coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The resilience of the primer target regions of this assay to mutation was assessed in 8893 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict ongoing utility during pandemic progression. RESULTS: Due to common HCoV species, a Pan-CoV assay would return false positives for as few as 1% of asymptomatic adults, but up to 30% of immunocompromised patients with respiratory disease. Half of reported Pan-CoV assays identify SARS-CoV-2 and with small adjustments can accommodate diverse variation observed in animal coronaviruses. The target region of one well established Pan-CoV assay is highly resistant to mutation compared to species-specific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: Despite cross-reactivity with common pathogens, pan-family assays may greatly assist management of emerging pandemics through prioritization of high-resolution testing or isolation measures. Targeting highly conserved genomic regions make pan-family assays robust and resilient to mutation. A strategic stockpile of pan-family assays may improve containment of novel diseases prior to the availability of species-specific assays.","Erlichster, Michael; Chana, Gursharan; Zantomio, Daniela; Goudey, Benjamin; Skafidas, Efstratios",Clin. infect. dis,39,16

We investigated the optimal BMI and WC cut-offs for identifying hyperglycemia in the predominantly Afro-Caribbean population of Barbados. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 865 individuals aged &#8805;25 years without known diabetes or cardiovascular disease was conducted. Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose &#8805;5.6 mmol/L or hemoglobin A1c &#8805;5.7% (39 mmol/mol). The Youden index was used to identify the optimal cut-offs from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Further ROC analysis and multivariable log binomial regression were used to compare standard and data-derived cut-offs. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperglycemia was 58.9% (95% CI 54.7% to 63.0%). In women, optimal BMI and WC cut-offs (27 kg/m2 and 87 cm, respectively) performed similarly to standard cut-offs. In men, sensitivities of the optimal cut-offs of BMI &#8805;24 kg/m2 (72.0%) and WC &#8805;86 cm (74.0%) were higher than those for standard BMI and WC obesity cut-offs (30.0% and 25%-46%, respectively), although with lower specificity. Hyperglycemia was 70% higher in men above the data-derived WC cut-off (prevalence ratio 95% CI 1.2 to 2.3). CONCLUSIONS: While BMI and WC cut-offs in Afro-Caribbean women approximate international standards, our findings, consistent with other studies, suggest lowering cut-offs in men may be warranted to improve detection of hyperglycemia. Our findings do, however, require replication in a new data set.","Wade, Alisha N; Hambleton, Ian R; Hennis, Anselm J M; Howitt, Christina; Jeyaseelan, Selvi M; Ojeh, Nkemcho O; Rose, Angela M C; Unwin, Nigel",,39,18

It has been suggested that men are more severely affected by the viral disease (COVID-19) than women. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic literature review (SRL) and meta-analysis was to analyse the influence of gender on COVID-19 mortality, severity, and disease outcomes. A SRL was performed in PubMed and Embase, searching terms corresponding to the 'PEO' format: population = adult patients affected with COVID-19; exposure = gender; outcome = any available clinical outcomes by gender, including mortality and disease severity. The search covered the period from January 1 to April 30, 2020. Exclusion criteria were: case reports/series, reviews, commentaries, languages other than English. Full-text, original articles were included. Data on study type, country, and patients' characteristics were extracted. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). From a total of 950 hits generated by the database search, 85 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected. RESULTS: A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to compare mortality, recovery rates, and disease severity in men compared with women. The male to female ratio for cases was 1:0.9. A significant association was found between male sex and mortality (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.25-2.62), as well as a lower chance of recovery in men (OR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.55-0.95). Male patients were more likely to present with a severe form of COVID-19 (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.10-1.94). CONCLUSIONS: Males are slightly more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, present with a more severe disease, and have a worse prognosis.

METHODS: Clinical indicators of COVID-19 patients from two independent cohorts (Training data: Hefei Cohort, 82 patients; Validation data: Nanchang Cohort, 169 patients) were retrospected. Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using Hefei Cohort was performed and prediction models were deduced. Prediction results were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) in above two cohorts. RESULTS: SPCA using Hefei Cohort revealed that the first 13 principal components (PCs) account for 80.8% of the total variance of original data. The PC1 and PC12 were significantly associated with disease severity with odds ratio of 4.049 and 3.318, respectively. They were used to construct prediction model, named Model-A. In disease severity prediction, Model-A gave the best prediction efficiency with area under curve (AUC) of 0.867 and 0.835 in Hefei and Nanchang Cohort, respectively. Model-A's simplified version, named as LMN index, gave comparable prediction efficiency as classical clinical markers with AUC of 0.837 and 0.800 in training and validation cohort, respectively.

Reliance upon digital computational methods restricts the value of natural experience reportable by patients, often considered subjective. In the course of modeling phosphate metabolism in the context of clinical practice it has become evident that use of categories based on normality, as definition of health, is inconsistent with the experience of patients. Given the opportunity, patients can provide detailed observations upon their experience of heat as the principle component of metabolism. It seems logical that heat should also be the foundational principal component of models developed for the translation of data to clinical care. This strategy has been applied to modeling the role of ACE2 in the expression of variable phenotypes of COVID 19. Attempts to engage massive data and super-computing to the modeling of COVID 19 supported the assumption that ACE2 is a critical component causing disease. The finding is attributed to an influence, not on heat, but instead suggested bradykinin that has long been a proposed explanation for ACE inhibition on chronic cough. Our modeling would posit that the ACE system engages aldosterone and subsequent influence on heat and acid/base balance as the mediators of variance in the expression of individual phenotypes. This clarification has been useful for addressing complexity in the presentation of metabolic disorders including thyroid disease, Diabetes, bone health, sleep disorders, vascular disease and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It appears that the risk of developing ARDS shares a predisposition to chronic kidney disease mediated by excessive FGF23 effects, while the asymptomatic spreaders are more Klotho dependent. The vitamin D system is also complex and involved in the modulation of heat and phosphate. These and other components can be extended to understanding bone and the hematopoietic marrow niche governing immune responses and includes a role for modulation of the microbiome influences by ACE2.","Fredericks, Robert S.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,39,10

Here, we contextualize SARS-CoV-2 among other coronaviruses and identify what is known and what can be inferred about its behavior once inside a human host. Because the genomic content of coronaviruses, which specifies the virus's structure, is highly conserved, early genomic analysis provided a significant head start in predicting viral pathogenesis and in understanding potential differences among variants. The pathogenesis of the virus offers insights into symptomatology, transmission, and individual susceptibility. Additionally, prior research into interactions between the human immune system and coronaviruses has identified how these viruses can evade the immune system's protective mechanisms. We also explore systems-level research into the regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response. Understanding the structure and behavior of the virus serves to contextualize the many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic and can influence efforts to control the virus and treat the disease.","Rando, Halie M.; MacLean, Adam L.; Lee, Alexandra J.; Lordan, Ronan; Ray, Sandipan; Bansal, Vikas; Skelly, Ashwin N.; Sell, Elizabeth; Dziak, John J.; Shinholster, Lamonica; McGowan, Lucy D'Agostino; Guebila, Marouen Ben; Wellhausen, Nils; Knyazev, Sergey; Boca, Simina M.; Capone, Stephen; Qi, Yanjun; Park, YoSon; Sun, Yuchen; Mai, David; Boerckel, Joel D.; Brueffer, Christian; Byrd, James Brian; Kamil, Jeremy P.; Wang, Jinhui; Velazquez, Ryan; Szeto, Gregory L; Barton, John P.; Goel, Rishi Raj; Mangul, Serghei; Lubiana, Tiago; Consortium, COVID-19 Review; Gitter, Anthony; Greene, Casey S.",,39,28

Whether maternal leptin is associated with risk of asthma in offspring is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether leptin levels in maternal obesity predict preschool asthma. METHODS: In this birth cohort study, we divided pregnant women into three weight categories during the first obstetric visit: normal (""NL""), overweight (""OW"") and obese (""OB""). RESULTS: We followed the offspring recording atopy, wheezing, and other respiratory illnesses through 30 months of age. Cord blood and peripheral blood at 30 months of age were taken to measure cytokines, adipokines, metabolic biomarkers, and specific IgE. Adjusted regression models were used to evaluate the association between maternal obesity and offspring asthma risk, defined by a positive Asthma Predictive Index (API). 339 mothers were recruited; 140 offspring were born from NL, 80 from OW, and 119 from OB mothers. OB women were older, less educated, had higher parity, and higher C-section frequency. Offspring from OB women had higher birthweight, head circumference, and placental weight compared to other groups. The proportion of API+ at 30 months of age was 12.2% in the NL, 14.7% in the OW, and 16.8% in the OB group (p=0.18). Offspring from OB women had higher leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, IL-10 and insulin than the OW group; and higher leptin than the NL group. In the adjusted analysis, offspring from OB mothers with high cord-blood leptin had increased risk of asthma (aOR=1.30 [95%CI=1.1-1.55], p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Offspring from obese mothers with high cord blood leptin have 30% higher asthma risk at age 3.

In the current work, a new proposed SEIR model as a mathematical model for the outbreak of novel coronaviruses COVID-19 will be constructed. The new proposed SEIR pandemic model provides a new vision for evaluations and management of the epidemic of COVID-19 infection. For mathematical modeling and dynamic analyses, this paper uses the real data of spreading COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The dynamics of the proposed SEIR model are presented with the reproduction number and the extensive stability analysis. We discussed the domain of the solution and equilibrium situation based on the proposed SEIR model by using Jacobian's method of linearization. The condition of equilibrium and its uniqueness has been proved, and the stability analysis of disease-free equilibrium has been introduced. A sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number against its internal parameters has been done. The global stability of the equilibrium of this model has been proved by using Lyapunov's Stability theorem. A numerical verification and predictions of the proposed SEIR model have been made with comparing the results based on the SEIR model and the real data due to the spreading of the COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.

Blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and SARS-CoV-2 major protease (Mpro) share over 80% homology at the three-dimensional protein level. Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards Mpro, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In this context, apixaban may display a dual mechanism of action by targeting FXa to prevent coagulopathy and, at some level, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Chaves, Otavio Augusto; Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Temerozo, Jairo Ramos; Pereira-Dutra, Filipe; Mizurini, Daniella M.; Monteiro, Robson Q.; Vazquez, Leonardo; Bozza, Patricia T.; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo Caire; Souza, Thiago Moreno L.",,39,30

Various forms of RNAs may be used to selectively act on proteins, transcripts, and genes that cannot be targeted by conventional small molecules or proteins. Although development of RNA drugs faces unparalleled challenges, many strategies have been developed to improve RNA metabolic stability and intracellular delivery. A number of RNA drugs have been approved for medical use, including aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib) that mechanistically act on protein target and small interfering RNAs (e.g., patisiran and givosiran) and antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., inotersen and golodirsen) that directly interfere with RNA targets. Furthermore, guide RNAs are essential components of novel gene editing modalities, and mRNA therapeutics are under development for protein replacement therapy or vaccination, including those against unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, functional RNAs or RNA motifs are highly structured to form binding pockets or clefts that are accessible by small molecules. Many natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, oxazolidinones, and phenicols) can directly bind to ribosomal RNAs to achieve the inhibition of bacterial infections. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing RNA-targeted small-molecule drugs amenable to oral administration, and some (e.g., risdiplam and branaplam) have entered clinical trials. Here, we review the pharmacology of novel RNA drugs and RNA-targeted small-molecule medications, with a focus on recent progresses and strategies. Challenges in the development of novel druggable RNA entities and identification of viable RNA targets and selective small-molecule binders are discussed. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: With the understanding of RNA functions and critical roles in diseases, as well as the development of RNA-related technologies, there is growing interest in developing novel RNA-based therapeutics. This comprehensive review presents pharmacology of both RNA drugs and RNA-targeted small-molecule medications, focusing on novel mechanisms of action, the most recent progress, and existing challenges.","Yu, Ai-Ming; Choi, Young Hee; Tu, Mei-Juan",Pharmacol Rev,39,15

With this purpose, several aspects have been deepened: i) viruses in soil ecosystems; ii) direct and indirect impact on the soil before and after the pandemic, and iii) methods for quantification of viruses and SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in soil. Viruses are present in soil (i.e. up to 417 × 107 viruses per g TS-1 in wetlands) and can affect the behavior and ecology of other life forms (e.g. bacteria), which are remarkably important for maintaining environmental equilibrium. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in soil (i.e. up to 550 copies·g-1). Considering that the SARS-CoV-2 is very recent, poor knowledge is available in the literature on persistence in the soil and reference has been made to coronaviruses and other families of viruses. For instance, the survival of enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV) can reach 90 days in soils with 10% of moisture content at ambient. In such a context, the possible spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in the soil was evaluated by analyzing the possible contamination routes.","Anand, Uttpal; Bianco, Francesco; Suresh, S; Tripathi, Vijay; Núñez-Delgado, Avelino; Race, Marco",Environ Res,39,10

OBJECTIVE: To perform a follow-up survey to assess changes in PPE-preparedness across six Asia-Pacific countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective follow-up cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between 10/08/2020 to 01/09/ 2020, five months after the initial Phase 1 survey. The survey was sent to the same 231 intensivists across the six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore) that participated in Phase 1. The main outcome measure was to identify any changes in PPE-preparedness between Phases 1 and 2. FINDINGS: Phase 2 had responses from 132 ICUs (57%). Compared to Phase 1 respondents reported increased use of PPE-based practices such as powered air-purifying respirator (40.2% vs. 6.1%), N95-masks at all times (86.4% vs. 53.7%) and double-gloving (87.9% vs. 42.9%). The reported awareness of PPE stocks (85.6% vs. 51.9%), mandatory showering policies following PPE-breach (31.1% vs. 6.9%) and safety perception amongst HCWs (60.6% vs. 28.4%) improved significantly during Phase 2. Despite reported statistically similar adoption rate of the buddy system in both phases (42.4% vs. 37.2%), there was a reported reduction in donning/doffing training in Phase 2 (44.3% vs. 60.2%). There were no reported differences HCW training in other areas, such as tracheal intubation, intra-hospital transport and safe waste disposal, between the 2 phases. CONCLUSIONS: Overall reported PPE-preparedness improved between the two survey periods, particularly in PPE use, PPE inventory and HCW perceptions of safety. However, the uptake of HCW training and implementation of low-cost safety measures continued to be low and the awareness of PPE breach management policies were suboptimal. Therefore, the key areas for improvement should focus on regular HCW training, implementing low-cost buddy-system and increasing awareness of PPE-breach management protocols.","Gullapalli, Navya; Lim, Zheng Jie; Ramanathan, Kollengode; Bihari, Shailesh; Haji, Jumana; Shekar, Kiran; Wong, Wai Tat; Rajamani, Arvind; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Aust. crit. care,39,16

The story, still unfolding, has all the elements of a recipe for disaster: one of the most elderly populations in the world; a weakened SNS, the result of a litany of policies and interventions by the 'Troika' (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund); a health care delivery system focused on non-communicable diseases and long-term care; the growing public distrust in public services, compared to private, hotel-like health care facilities. We are aware that these are still the early days of the epidemic, yet it is safe to say that algorithmic scenarios of doom and gloom have so far been averted. In the past six months of the pandemic, the level of trust of the Portuguese population in the SNS and its health personnel has significantly improved, while the government has started to provide additional funding and to work for the expansion of the public system. At the very inception of the pandemic, private hospitals practically closed their doors to COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly a new disease, COVID-19, by definition the foe of any health system, has granted the opportunity for a rare consensus amongst different key political and/or corporate actors in a long-called-for reform of the SNS.

One particular challenge of assessing volatility forecasts is how to construct a robust proxy for the unknown true volatility. In this work, we show that the empirical loss comparison between two volatility predictors hinges on the deviation of the volatility proxy from the true volatility. We then establish non-asymptotic deviation bounds for three robust volatility proxies, two of which are based on clipped data, and the third of which is based on exponentially weighted Huber loss minimization. In particular, in order for the Huber approach to adapt to non-stationary financial returns, we propose to solve a tuning-free weighted Huber loss minimization problem to jointly estimate the volatility and the optimal robustification parameter at each time point. We then inflate this robustification parameter and use it to update the volatility proxy to achieve optimal balance between the bias and variance of the global empirical loss. We also extend this Huber method to construct volatility predictors. Finally, we exploit the proposed robust volatility proxy to compare different volatility predictors on the Bitcoin market data. It turns out that when the sample size is limited, applying the robust volatility proxy gives more consistent and stable evaluation of volatility forecasts.","Wang, Weichen; An, Ran; Zhu, Ziwei",,39,29

Established risk factors for burn injury include male gender, racial minority, children and elderly individuals, poverty, and substandard housing characteristics. In North Carolina, the rate of residential fire injuries and deaths is higher than the national average. Therefore, we sought to describe residential fire hospitalizations at a large regional burn center and describe the neighborhoods in which they live. We hypothesized that patients living in areas with higher Area Deprivation Index (ADI) are more likely to have major residential burns. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of burn admissions from January 2002 to December 2015. We dichotomized patients into two cohorts: residential and non-residential burns and performed a bivariate analysis. Multivariate Poisson regression models were utilized to determine if ADI was associated with inhalation injury and &#8805;20% total body surface area burn. RESULTS: Of the 10,506 patients presented during the study period. Of these, 10,016 (95.3%) patients resided in North Carolina, and 7894 (78.8%) had a residential burn. Of the overall cohort, 6.0% (n=458) of patients had &#8805;20% TBSA burns and 6.4% (n=506) had inhalation injury. The majority of patients were in the highest (most disadvantaged) ADI quartile (n=3050, 39.5%), and only 6.8% of patients (n=525) were in the lowest (least disadvantaged) ADI quartile. In the Poisson multivariate regressions to determine if the ADI was associated with severe burns, patients in the highest ADI quartile had an increased relative risk of &#8805;20% TBSA burn (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.68) and inhalation injury (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76) when compared to patients in the second-lowest ADI quartile when controlled for pertinent covariates. CONCLUSION: Residential structure fires represent the major source of burns and fatalities. People who reside in the highest ADI quartile are more like to present with higher burn injury severity in terms of burn size and the presence of inhalation injury. The use of the ADI to target neighborhoods for burn prevention is imperative.","Purcell, Laura N; Bartley, Coleen; Purcell, Michael E; Cairns, Bruce A; King, Booker T; Charles, Anthony",Burns,39,16

The goal of this study is to evaluate fear of relapse, social support, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress level) of Iranian patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic stage. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. We asked all cases to fill valid and reliable Persian version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), perceived social support, and fear of relapse scale questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. Female to male ratio was (F/M) = 4.6. Mean age and mean duration of disease were 35.3±8.6 and 7.1±5 years, respectively. Mean scores of social support, DASS, and FoR questionnaires were 63.1±16.8, 16.4±13.4, and 51.4±17.3, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between social support and FoR scores and also significant positive correlations between components of DASS and FoR. Linear regression analysis by considering FoR as dependent variable and age, sex, marital status, duration of the disease, and EDSS as dependent variables showed that sex was an independent predictor of FoR score.

Our aim was to correlate the liver-to-spleen ratio (L/S), clinical, laboratory findings, and lung CT scores of patients with COVID-19 who had two consecutive chest CTs. METHODS: A retrospective search was performed between March 1, 2020 and April 26, 2020 to identify patients who had positive RT-PCR tests and two unenhanced chest CTs. Scans that were obtained at hospital admission and follow-up were reviewed to assess L/S and lung CT scores. Patients were divided into two groups based on lung CT scores (non-progressive vs progressive). Patient demographics, laboratory findings, length of hospital stay, and survival were noted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Twenty patients in the progressive group and 7 patients in the non-progressive group were identified. The mean L/S of the progressive group (1.13 ± 0.3) was lower than that of the non-progressive group (1.21 ± 0.29) at hospital admission but there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.547). L/S at follow-up was significantly different between the groups as the mean L/S values of the progressive and non-progressive groups were 1.02 ± 0.23 and 1.25 ± 0.29, respectively (p = 0.009). L/S was negatively correlated with AST and ALT (r = - 0.46, p = 0.016 and r = - 0.534, p = 0.004, respectively). There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts that were obtained at hospital admission. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer in patients in the progressive group (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Decrease in L/S may be observed in patients with elevated lung CT scores at follow-up. WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts at hospital admission may predict the progression of COVID-19.","Guler, Ezgi; Unal, Nalan Gulsen; Cinkooglu, Akin; Savas, Recep; Kose, Timur; Pullukcu, Husnu; Harman, Mustafa; Elmas, Nevra Z; Ramaiya, Nikhil H; Ozutemiz, Ahmet Omer",Abdom. radiology (Internet),39,20

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a 4-year database of five fertility centres. The study population included women with normal/high ovarian reserve, who underwent autologous MS-IVF (daily &#8804;150 IU gonadotrophin) with fresh and subsequent frozen embryo transfer(s) (FET) from surplus embryos. Only the first cycle of each patient was included. Cycles with >150 IU daily average of gonadotrophin were excluded. 'Freeze-all embryo' (FAE) cycles were analysed separately. RESULTS: A total of 862 consecutive cycles fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 592 were eligible for fresh embryo transfer, 239 had non-elective 'freeze-all' cycles. Median age (25-75th percentile) of women who had fresh embryo transfer was 35 (32-37) years, median antral follicle count 19 (14-28) and anti-Müllerian hormone 19.2 (13-28.9) pmol/l. LBR/fresh cycle and CLBR inclusive of FAE cycles in the <35, 35-37, 38-39 and 40-42 year age groups were 37.8% and 45.1%, 36.0% and 41.6%, 18.4% and 29.1%, and 8.9% and 18.1%, respectively. The LBR following fresh embryo transfer plateaued after nine oocytes (40.3%) or four embryos (40.8%). The CLBR optimized when 12 oocytes (42.9%) or nine embryos (53.8%) were obtained. The LBR per oocyte peaked in women under 35 years when <5 oocytes were retrieved (11.4%), then declined with age and with higher oocyte yield. There were no cases of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). CONCLUSION: Nine oocytes, or four embryos, can optimize fresh transfer cycle LBR in MS-IVF. The CLBR are optimized with 12 oocytes, or nine embryos in predicted normal responders, while safeguarding against OHSS.","Datta, Adrija Kumar; Campbell, Stuart; Felix, Nirmal; Singh, Jasdev Singh Harbhajan; Nargund, Geeta",Reprod. biomed. online,39,1

To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications.

Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder - i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities - are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",Encephale,39,20

We have found different areas for improvement for RHISs according to the three determinants of the PRISM framework that influence the configuration of RHISs: technical, organizational, or behavioral elements. (4) Conclusions: RHIS interventions in the European region are promising. However, new global and international strategies and the development of tools and mechanisms should be promoted to highly integrate platforms among European countries.","Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Pereyra-Rodríguez, José Juan; Torrent-Sellens, Joan; Eguia, Hans; Azzopardi-Muscat, Natasha; Novillo-Ortiz, David",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),39,3

The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019-20 academic year following the March-May 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement. METHODS: Ninety-seven university teachers (51.5% women; most represented age group 60-69 years range, 40.2%) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 - September 30, 2020, on the advantages and disadvantages of DE, developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbach's alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study. RESULTS: Teachers reported difficulties in technical aspects, and in psychological factors, as the discomfort of ""speaking in the void"" (64.7%). The absence of ""face-to-face"" eye contact with the students was complained by 81% of teachers. Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported, with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues. A quarter of teachers showed depressive symptoms of varying severity. The most satisfied teachers were those most stimulated by DE (r = 0.752, p < 0.000), who showed a lower impact of depressive symptoms (r = - 0.289, p = 0.005). The teaching load in hours influenced the perception of disadvantages (r = 0.214, p = 0.035) and contributed to a lower appreciation of the challenges of DE. The more significant the manifestation of depressive symptoms during the lockdown was, the greater the subjective recovery of a good emotional condition once the domestic confinement was over (r = 0.344, p = 0.001), despite maintaining DE. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the impact of technical, didactic, and psychological difficulties of DE, reported by our teachers. The appreciation of their new learning promoted by DE seemed related to better emotional well-being of university teachers accepting this ""challenge"" in their important role in the high-education system, influencing good learning and promoting students' professional success.","Casacchia, Massimo; Cifone, Maria Grazia; Giusti, Laura; Fabiani, Leila; Gatto, Roberto; Lancia, Loreto; Cinque, Benedetta; Petrucci, Cristina; Giannoni, Mario; Ippoliti, Rodolfo; Frattaroli, Anna Rita; Macchiarelli, Guido; Roncone, Rita",BMC Med Educ,39,16

The exact mechanism how this virus will affect the liver remained elusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the liver function in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and potential causes of hepatic enzymes disease in these patients. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were collected from patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the corona center in Erbil city/Kurdistan region of Iraq, from March 10 to July 10, 2020. Serum was collected from patients with COVID-19 and liver enzyme tests were measured. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL) were analyzed in these patients. Of the 74 patients, 25 (34.7%) had abnormal ALT activity, 28 (40%) had abnormal AST activity, 12 (20.3%) had abnormal ALP activity, and 39 (52.7%) had abnormal total bilirubin P-value < 0.05. The inflammatory biomarkers CRP and IL-6 in COVID-19 patients with abnormal liver function test (4.9 ± 1.0 mg/dl) and (231.2 ± 35.7 pg/ml) respectively. The levels of both biomarkers were statistically significantly higher than COVID-19 patients with normal liver function test (2.1 ± 0.5 mg/dl) and (2.1 ± 0.5 mg/dl) respectively, P-value < 0.05. However, CRP and IL-6 were not statistically significant different between male and female COVID-19 patients P-value < 0.05. In conclusion, we found that most of the patients with SARS-CoV-2 have abnormal hepatic enzyme activities and that is might related to virus replication in the liver.","Hwaiz, Rundk; Merza, Mohammed; Hamad, Badraldin; HamaSalih, Shirin; Mohammed, Mustafa; Hama, Harmand",Int Immunopharmacol,39,22

Herein, a high-throughput serum peptidome profiling method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is developed for efficient detection of COVID-19. We analyzed the serum samples from 146 COVID-19 patients and 152 control cases (including 73 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical symptoms, 33 tuberculosis patients, and 46 healthy individuals). After MS data processing and feature selection, eight machine learning methods were used to build classification models. A logistic regression machine learning model with 25 feature peaks achieved the highest accuracy (99%), with sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%, for the detection of COVID-19.

However, often ignored complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic.

Individuals with correct understanding about the risks and severity of the disease are more likely to respond positively and practice recommended preventive measures. Objectives: To assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures among residents of Nigeria. Methods: The study was cross-sectional and involved 469 participants from 1st July to 31st August 2020. A 36-item questionnaire with Cronbach alpha of 0.753 was adapted and administered through an online survey tool. A snowball sampling approach was employed whereby the questionnaire link was distributed through social media networks including WhatsApp©, Facebook© and Instagram©. Data was analysed using SPSS 23 and a statistical significance level of 0.05 was used. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were employed to determine factors affecting the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Results: The mean age of participants was 39±11.29years. Majority (54%) of the participants heard about COVID-19 through mass and social media. The study found that 71.6% of the participants had good knowledge, just 31.3% had a good attitude while 84.9% of them had good practices towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. The high rates of the knowledge and practices were driven by income, age, education and marital status. Conclusions: Majority of the study participants showed correct knowledge and adhered to recommended practices towards COVID- 19.

A disproportionately higher number of African Americans are afflicted with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity), and SARS-CoV-2 has helped expose these health disparities. Several factors including socioeconomic status, inferior health care, and work circumstances contribute to these disparities. Identifying potential inflammatory biomarkers and decreasing basal levels in high-risk individuals with comorbidities through preventive measures is critical. Immune cells, particularly neutrophils, protect us against pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) through increased generation of free radicals or oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that ensnare pathogens, killing them extracellularly. However, continued generation of NETs coupled with the lack of prompt removal pose danger to host cells. NET levels are increased during pro-inflammatory diseases. COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated NET levels, depending upon disease severity. Conceivably, high-risk individuals with elevated basal NET levels would exhibit hyper-inflammation when infected with SARS-CoV-2, amplifying disease severity and deaths. Drugs inhibiting oxidant formation and vitamin supplements decreased NET formation in mice models of inflammation. Thus, it is conceivable that preventive treatments lowering NET levels and inflammation in high-risk individuals could mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.","Kalyanaraman, Balaraman",Redox Biol,39,33

As the corona crisis escalated in 2020, island authorities initially were able to keep COVID-19 cases low and mitigate their spread by implementing unprecedented actions, foremost among them border closures. However, as the realities of economic stresses surfaced, due to the decline in tourism, especially in the Caribbean, the need to balance COVID-19 spread and economic propriety posed a challenge. In this regard, the corona crisis illuminated spatial notions of islandness: boundedness, smallness, isolation and fragmentation. This perspective essay explores islandness in the context of the actions taken in the case study tri-island state of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Being a tri-island state, the nuances of islandness, experienced in an archipelagic context (an archipelago within the Caribbean archipelago) are emphasized.

Here, for the first time we provide a daily CO$_2$ emission dataset for the whole year of 2020 calculated from inventory and near-real-time activity data (called Carbon Monitor project: https://carbonmonitor.org). It was previously suggested from preliminary estimates that did not cover the entire year of 2020 that the pandemics may have caused more than 8% annual decline of global CO$_2$ emissions. Here we show from detailed estimates of the full year data that the global reduction was only 5.4% (-1,901 MtCO$_2$, ). This decrease is 5 times larger than the annual emission drop at the peak of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, global CO$_2$ emissions gradually recovered towards 2019 levels from late April with global partial re-opening. More importantly, global CO$_2$ emissions even increased slightly by +0.9% in December 2020 compared with 2019, indicating the trends of rebound of global emissions. Later waves of COVID-19 infections in late 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused further CO$_2$ emissions reductions particularly in western countries, but to a much smaller extent than the declines in the first wave. That even substantial world-wide lockdowns of activity led to a one-time decline in global CO$_2$ emissions of only 5.4% in one year highlights the significant challenges for climate change mitigation that we face in the post-COVID era. These declines are significant, but will be quickly overtaken with new emissions unless the COVID-19 crisis is utilized as a break-point with our fossil-fuel trajectory, notably through policies that make the COVID-19 recovery an opportunity to green national energy and development plans.","Liu, Zhu; Deng, Zhu; Ciais, Philippe; Tan, Jianguang; Zhu, Biqing; Davis, Steven J.; Andrew, Robbie; Boucher, Olivier; Arous, Simon Ben; Canadel, Pep; Dou, Xinyu; Friedlingstein, Pierre; Gentine, Pierre; Guo, Rui; Hong, Chaopeng; Jackson, Robert B.; Kammen, Daniel M.; Ke, Piyu; Quere, Corinne Le; Monica, Crippa; Janssens-Maenhout, Greet; Peters, Glen; Tanaka, Katsumasa; Wang, Yilong; Zheng, Bo; Zhong, Haiwang; Sun, Taochun; Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim",,39,1

This reality was especially accentuated in Ecuador where, the shortage of healthcare workers combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors has led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation of final-year medical students on the front line is indispensable. Appropriate training on COVID-19 is an urgent requirement that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Ecuadorian final-year medical students that could potentially guide the design of better medical education curricula regarding COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 2020 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian final-year medical students. It was sent by email, Facebook, and WhatsApp. RESULTS: A total of 309 students responded to the survey. Out of which 88% of students scored high (&#8805; 70% correct) for knowledge of the disease. The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of COVID-19 and volunteering during the outbreak in Ecuador (77%, and 58% of the students, respectively). Moreover, 91% of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment. The latter finding was significantly associated with negative attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Although a large number of students displayed negative attitudes, the non-depreciable percentage of students who were willing to volunteer and the coexisting high level of knowledge displayed by students, suggests that Ecuador has a capable upcoming workforce that could benefit from an opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training in preparation for COVID-19. Not having personal protective equipment was significantly associated to negative attitudes. Providing the necessary tools and creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways to ensure all students are trained, whilst simultaneously focusing on the students' most pressing concerns. With this additional training, negative attitudes will improve and students will be better qualified.","Lincango-Naranjo, Eddy; Espinoza-Suarez, Nataly; Solis-Pazmino, Paola; Vinueza-Moreano, Paul; Rodriguez-Villafuerte, Santiago; Lincango-Naranjo, Jose; Barberis-Barcia, Giuseppe; Ruiz-Sosa, Carlos; Rojas-Velasco, Giovanni; Gravholt, Derek; Golembiewski, Elizabeth; Soto-Becerra, Percy; Khan, Maryam; Ortiz-Prado, Esteban",BMC Med Educ,39,21

The adaptive immune response is the second line of defense and is specific to the pathogen. Innate immunity occurs immediately while adaptive immunity develops upon pathogen exposure, and is long-lasting, highly specific, and sustained by memory T cells. Respiratory virus infection typically induces effective immunity but over-exuberant responses are associated with pathophysiology. Cytokines expressed in response to viral infection can enhance biological responses, activate, and trigger signaling pathways leading to adaptive immunity that involves B cell-mediated humoral and T cell-mediated cellular immune responses. Vaccines induce immunity, specifically B cell and T cell responses. Vaccination targeting respiratory viruses like influenza is generally efficacious, but for many viruses, our understanding of vaccination strategies and immunity is incomplete or in its infancy. Studies that examine innate and adaptive immune responses to respiratory virus infection will aid vaccine development and may reduce the burden of respiratory viral disease. AREAS COVERED: A literature search was performed using PubMed, a search engine maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) bibliographic database. The areas of search covered: innate, adaptive, respiratory virus, vaccine development, B cell, and T cell. EXPERT OPINION: Immunity rests on two pillars, i.e. the innate and adaptive immune system, which function together on different tasks to maintain homeostasis. A better understanding of immunity is necessary for disease prevention and intervention.","Stambas, John; Lu, Chunni; Tripp, Ralph A",,39,18

Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms. AIM: To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made. METHOD: Contacts were identified and risk categorized as 'close' or 'casual' for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of 'close contact'. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.","Wong, S C Y; Kwong, R T-S; Wu, T C; Chan, J W M; Chu, M Y; Lee, S Y; Wong, H Y; Lung, D C",J Hosp Infect,39,9

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed.","Ocampo, Lanndon; Yamagishi, Kafferine",Socioecon Plann Sci,39,1

Materials and Methods: This systematic review was carried out based on the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Three databases were analyzed (Pubmed, Web of science and Scopus) by three independent researchers. From the 18 identified studies, 10 of them met the inclusion criteria. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 or its entry factors (angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS), and furin) was analyzed in these 10 studies during the pandemic. Results: ACE2 expression was analyzed in 9 of the 10 studies. ACE2 is expressed mainly in the tongue, oral mucosa, salivary glands and epithelial cells. The expression of the TMPRSS2 gene or protein was analyzed in 6 studies. These studies reported that the expression of TMPRSS2 was mainly in the salivary glands, tongue, sulcular epithelium and oral mucosa; as well as in cells of the salivary glands (ductal, acinar and myoepithelial cells) and the tongue (the spinous-based cell layer, horny layer and the epithelial surface). Other TMPRSS were also reported. The expression of TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS5, TMPRSS7 and TMPRSS11D was reported mainly in salivary glands and in epithelial-type cells. Furan expression was analyzed in three studies. The expression of furin was detected mainly in epithelial cells of the tongue. A variety of methods were used to carry out the detection of SARS-CoV-2 or its input molecules. Conclusions: These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide variety of oral tissues and cells, and that together with the theories dedicated to explaining the oral symptoms present in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, it provides us with a good scientific basis for understanding the virus infection in the oral cavity and its consequences.","Salas Orozco, Marco Felipe; Niño-Martínez, Nereyda; Martínez-Castañón, Gabriel-Alejandro; Patiño Marín, Nuria; Sámano Valencia, Carolina; Dipp Velázquez, Farid Alonso; Sosa Munguía, Paulina Del Carmen; Casillas Santana, Miguel Angel",Medicina (Kaunas),39,21

Some have reported relationships with various environmental variables, suggesting that spread of the disease is enhanced in colder and drier climates. However, evidence is still scarce and mostly limited to a few countries, particularly from Asia. We examined the potential role of multiple environmental variables in COVID-19 infection rate [measured as mean relative infection rate = (number of infected inhabitants per week / total population) × 100.000) from February 23 to August 16, 2020 across 360 cities of Chile. Chile has a large climatic gradient (&#8776; 40º of latitude, &#8776; 4000 m of altitude and 5 climatic zones, from desert to tundra), but all cities share their social behaviour patterns and regulations. Our results indicated that COVID-19 transmission in Chile was mostly related to three main climatic factors (minimum temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity). Transmission was greater in colder and drier cities and when atmospheric pressure was lower. The results of this study support some previous findings about the main climatic determinants of COVID-19 transmission, which may be useful for decision-making and management of the disease.","Correa-Araneda, Francisco; Ulloa-Yáñez, Alfredo; Núñez, Daniela; Boyero, Luz; Tonin, Alan M; Cornejo, Aydeé; Urbina, Mauricio A; Díaz, María Elisa; Figueroa-Muñoz, Guillermo; Esse, Carlos",Sci Rep,39,16

Here we investigate the impact of colloidal aggregation, a common artifact in early drug discovery, in these repurposing screens. We selected 56 drugs reported to be active in biochemical assays and tested them for aggregation by both dynamic light scattering and by enzyme counter screening with and without detergent; seventeen of these drugs formed colloids at concentrations similar to their literature reported IC50s. To investigate the occurrence of colloidal aggregators more generally in repurposing libraries, we further selected 15 drugs that had physical properties resembling known aggregators from a common repurposing library, and found that 6 of these aggregated at micromolar concentrations. An attraction of repurposing is that drugs active on one target are considered de-risked on another. This study suggests not only that many of the drugs repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical assays are artifacts, but that, more generally, when screened at relevant concentrations, drugs can act artifactually via colloidal aggregation. Understanding the role of aggregation, and detecting its effects rapidly, will allow the community to focus on those drugs and leads that genuinely have potential for treating COVID-19.

Current perceptions of small health care businesses toward remote care, particularly perceptions of whether RVC adoption will synergistically improve business sustainability, would highlight the pros and cons of rapidly adopting RVC technology among policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceptions of small health care businesses regarding the impact of RVC on their business sustainability during COVID-19, gauge their perceptions of their current levels of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models and analyze how well that aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and determine whether these perceptions influence their view of their midterm sustainability (SUST). METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and sought assistance from a consulting firm to collect survey data in July 2020. Focal estimated study effects were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: In total, 270 respondents, including 82 clinics, 99 small physician offices, and 89 pharmacies, across Colorado were included. SRVC and SCBS had direct, significant, and positive effects on SUST. However, we investigated the effect of the interaction between SRVC and SCBS to determine whether RVC adoption aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of business sustainability. Effects differed among the three groups. The interaction term SRVC×SCBS was significant and positive for clinics (P=.02), significant and negative for physician offices (P=.05), and not significant for pharmacies (P=.76). These variations indicate that while clinics positively perceived RVC alignment with the current business scenario, the opposite held true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide and RVC adoption progresses rapidly, it is critical to understand the impact of RVC on small health care businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. Small physician practices cannot harness RVC developments and, in contrast with clinics, consider it incompatible with business survival during and after COVID-19. If small health care firms cannot compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually become nonoperational, the resulting damage to traditional health care services may be severe, particularly for critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. Our results have implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.","Parthasarathy, Madhavan; Khuntia, Jiban; Stacey, Rulon",J Med Internet Res,39,19

Many countries have regulated non-prescription medications available for use in self-medication. However, in countries such as Rwanda, where prescriptions are not required to purchase medications, prescription, non-prescription and traditional medications have been used for self-medication. Objectives: To determine the reported self-medication use in Rwanda and to determine attitudes and reasons associated with parental decisions to self-medicate their children. Methods: A cross-sectional multi-center questionnaire based quantitative study of 154 parents/caregivers of children under ten years undertaken in private and public health facilities. Results: The use of self-medication was reported to be 77.9%. Among these parents/caregivers, 50.8% used modern self-medication only, 15.8% used traditional self-medication only and 33.3% used both types of self-medication. Paracetamol was the most commonly used drug in modern self-medication; the traditional drugs used were Rwandan local herbs. Parents/caregivers who used modern medicines had slightly more confidence in self-medication than self-medication users of traditional medicines (p=0.005). Parents/caregivers who used modern self-medication reported barriers to consultation as a reason to self-medicate more frequently than those who used traditional drugs. Having more than one child below 10 years of-age was the only socio-demographic factor associated with having used self-medication (AOR=4.74, CI: 1.94-11.58, p=0.001). Being above 30 years (AOR= 5.78, CI: 1.25-26.68, p=0.025) and living in Kigali (AOR=8.2, CI: 1.58-43.12, p=.0.012) were factors associated with preference of modern self- medication compared to traditional self-medication. Conclusion: Self-medication is common in Rwanda.

Consequently, the virus could generate fear and anxiety that must be managed in a new and unknown situation, such as that of lockdown, with potential consequences for mental health outcomes. Therefore, with the theoretical guide of the Polyvagal perspective, this research aimed to analyse the mediation of social support, passive aggression, avoidance and dissociation in the relationship between fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: During the national COVID-19 lockdown phase, a sample of 992 Italian participants with a mean age of 35.07 years (SD = 12.11) completed the Ten Penn State Worry Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – Form X3, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced and Forty Item Defense Style Questionnaire, after providing written informed consent. Results: Results showed that fear affected anxiety, both directly and indirectly, highlighting a serial multiple mediation model with two parallel chain of mediators. Social support coping strategy negatively influenced fear and passive aggression, which instead were positively associated. Furthermore, in the second chain, avoidance directly induced fear in the presence of anxiety, opposite of dissociation defense mechanism. Conclusions: Such findings highlighted some possible answers that could be implemented as a consequence of the fear perception during the COVID-19 lockdown, according to the framework of the Polyvagal Theory. These data could provide an important contribution in shedding light on mechanisms put in place during the pandemic, promoting valuable information for a more effective clinical practice. © Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology, Messina, Italy","Gori, A.; Topino, E.; Craparo, G.; Grotto, R.

Lessons from psychotherapist experiences with technology prior to the outbreak can offer recommendations for practitioners and professional regulators. In this study, psychotherapists were interviewed about their use of technology in practice and interviews were analyzed for consistency with current literature on usual practice and professional regulations. The researchers used actor-network theory to map and explore the links and themes that emerged from the research. We found that technology use was more integrated with psychotherapy practice and psychotherapists were more confident and comfortable with telepsychotherapy than the literature predicted. Key themes arising from the interviews were psychotherapist responsibility and trust that included expanded psychotherapist responsibility, client trust, psychotherapists' self-trust, and trust of information sources. Telepsychotherapy can be enhanced by reflective, intentional practice, making space to examine routine behaviors, and developing strategies to counteract the unreliability of technology. Further, professional and regulatory bodies can support effective practice by developing clear and achievable technological competence responsibilities and by integrating technology training with mandatory psychotherapy education.","MacMullin, Karen; Jerry, Paul; Cook, Karen",J.

For this reason, a detailed evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating in different geographic regions of the world was performed. A compositional analysis as well as a Bayesian coalescent analysis of complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains recently isolated in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia was performed. The results of these studies revealed a diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains in three different genetic clades. Co-circulation of different clades in different countries, as well as different genetic lineages within different clades were observed. The time of the most recent common ancestor was established to be around 1st November 2019. A mean rate of evolution of 6.57 × 10-4 substitutions per site per year was found. A significant migration rate per genetic lineage per year from Europe to South America was also observed. The results of these studies revealed an increasing diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains.

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of the S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, pangolin coronavirus (PgCoV), RaTG13, and LyRa11, a bat virus similar to SARS-CoV-1, to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the PgCoV RBD bound human ACE2 at least as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and that both RBDs bound pangolin ACE2 efficiently. We also observed a high level of variability in binding to closely related horseshoe-bat ACE2 orthologs consistent with the heterogeneity of their RBD-binding regions. However five consensus horseshoe-bat ACE2 residues enhanced ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by an enzymatically inactive immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (hACE2-NN-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses. An hACE2-NN-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virus more efficiently than wild-type hACE2-NN-Fc. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of soluble ACE2.","Mou, Huihui; Quinlan, Brian D; Peng, Haiyong; Liu, Guanqun; Guo, Yan; Peng, Shoujiao; Zhang, Lizhou; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Gardner, Matthew R; Crynen, Gogce; DeVaux, Lindsey B; Voo, Zhi Xiang; Bailey, Charles C; Alpert, Michael D; Rader, Christoph; Gack, Michaela U; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",PLoS Pathog,39,11

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis facilities require specific protocols to be planned and promptly executed for the management of suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 with respect to prevention, protection, screening, and isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our Hemodialysis Unit, we adopted individual protection measures accompanied by measures to minimize contacts among hemodialysis patients with suspicious symptoms as well as other patients and medical staff. We provided our patients detailed instructions to be followed in the event of their having symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Ultimately, four possible scenarios and care paths were developed and implemented in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Units at the Padua University Hospital. RESULTS: The application of this strategy has resulted in the nearly 200 patients treated in our hemodialysis facilities while there were only 2 cases of COVID-19 (1% incidence rate) with no deaths. CONCLUSION: We attribute the low COVID-19 incidence noted so far for patients in our hemodialysis facilities to the early detection and prompt isolation of suspected patients per our specific plan along with the prompt application of preventive measures.","Dian, Silvia; Simeone, Monica; Rossi, Barbara; Scaparrotta, Giuseppe; Fragasso, Antonio; Carretta, Giovanni; Capizzi, Alfio; Donato, Daniele; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Calò, Lorenzo A",Clin. nephrol,39,7

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to address all these issues. METHODS: In a case-controlled survey, we interviewed 1,486 PD patients attending a single tertiary center in Lombardy, Italy and 1,207 family members (controls). RESULTS: One hundred five (7.1%) and 92 controls (7.6%) were identified as COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 patients were younger, more likely to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to be obese, and vitamin D nonsupplemented than unaffected patients. Six patients (5.7%) and 7 family members (7.6%) died from COVID-19. Patients were less likely to report shortness of breath and require hospitalization.

One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized replication competent SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. There was no enhancement of pseudovirus infection in cells expressing Fcγ receptors at any concentration. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 potently neutralized mouse ACE2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild type BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2 expressing transgenic mice. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted. A total of 396 respondents completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. A previously adapted self-administered pretested standard questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R-22) was used to measure post-traumatic stress disorder. Data was entered into Epi data version 4.4.2 then exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Descriptive and analytical statistical procedures, bivariate, and multivariate binary logistic regressions with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were employed. The level of significance of association was determined at a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among health care providers in this study was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.3, 59.6). Lack of standardized PPE supply (AOR = 2.5 7,95CI;1.37,4.85), respondents age > 40 years (AOR = 3.95, 95CI; 1.74, 8.98), having medical illness (AOR = 4.65, 95CI;1.65,13.12), perceived stigma (AOR = 1.97, 95CI;1.01, 3.85), history of mental illness(AOR = 8.08,95IC;2.18,29.98) and having poor social support (AOR = 4.41,95CI;2.65,7.3) were significantly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder at p-value < 0.05.

Educators began to design alternative ways to conduct some meaningful learning activities for their students. However, not all subject disciplines could be easily transformed online, especially for those requiring much social interaction and creation processes. In this article, we explore the learning processes through learning Shubailan, a form of music folk-talk-singing, with a mobile instrument application called muyu in an online flipped classroom among 122 secondary school students in Hong Kong. The opportunities can encourage students to learn music theories and instruments about Shubailan, and create a Shubailan piece through 6-lesson music learning. To gain more online face-to-face time for collaboration, flipping the online classroom is adopted in this study to engage students in lesson preparations via preassigned recorded videos and collaborative activities during face-to-face online lessons. In this study, a mixed research method was employed with the use of a learning satisfaction survey, teachers’ observations and semi-structured interviews. We found that this strategy could effectively motivate students to learn music and improve their music knowledge in Shubailan. This article presents evidence of implementing the online flipped classroom approach to enhance students’ satisfaction and knowledge acquisition throughout Shubailan music making processes, and offers recommendations for online music educators.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of methylprednisolone on mortality rate in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia‐induced severe systemic inflammation (PI‐SSI). METHODS: Between 9 March and 5 May 2020 (final follow‐up on 2 July 2020), a retrospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalised patients with COVID‐19 PI‐SSI (≥2 inflammatory biomarkers [IBs]: temperature ≥38℃, lymphocyte ≤800 cell/µL, C‐reactive protein ≥100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase ≥300 units/L, ferritin ≥1000 mcg/L, D‐dimer ≥500 ng/mL). Patients received 0.5‐1.0 mg/kg of methylprednisolone for 5‐10 days or standard of care. The primary outcome was 28‐day all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included ≥2 points improvement on a 7‐item WHO‐scale (Day 14), transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) (Day 28) and adverse effects. Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression were implemented to analyse the time to event outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (corticosteroid group n = 72, control group n = 70) were included. A significant reduction in 28‐day all‐cause mortality was shown with methylprednisolone in patients with respiratory support (HR: 0.15; 95% CI 0.03‐0.71), with ≥3 (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.05‐0.61) or ≥4 altered IB (HR: 0.15; 95% CI 0.04‐0.54) and in patients with both respiratory support and ≥3 (HR: 0.11; 95% CI 0.02‐0.53] or ≥4 altered IB (HR: 0.14; 95% CI 0.04‐0.51). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Intermediate to high doses of methylprednisolone, initiated between 5 and 12 days after symptom onset, was associated with a significant reduction in 28‐day all‐cause mortality in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia and ≥3 o ≥ 4 altered IB, independently of the need of respiratory support.","Climente‐Martí, Mónica; Ruiz‐Millo, Oreto; López‐Cruz, Ian; Atienza‐García, Ángel; Martínez‐Moragón, Eva; Garijo‐Gómez, Emilio; López‐Grima, María Luisa; Zaragoza‐Crespo, Rafael; Llau‐Pitarch, Juan Vicente; Bautista‐Rentero, Daniel; Nogueira‐Coito, José Miguel; Ripollés‐González, Tomás; Marco‐Artal, María Antonia; Romero‐Serrano, Ramón; Dolz‐Sinisterra, Francisco; López‐Estudillo, Rosario",Int J Clin Pract,39,16

Intramolecular hydrogen (H)-bonds play an extremely important role in stabilizing protein structures. To form these intramolecular H-bonds, nascent unfolded polypeptide chains need to escape from hydrogen bonding with surrounding polar water molecules under the solution conditions that require entropy-enthalpy compensations, according to the Gibbs free energy equation and the change in enthalpy. Here, by analyzing the spatial layout of the side-chains of amino acid residues in experimentally determined protein structures, we reveal a protein-folding mechanism based on the entropy-enthalpy compensations that initially driven by laterally hydrophobic collapse among the side-chains of adjacent residues in the sequences of unfolded protein chains. This hydrophobic collapse promotes the formation of the H-bonds within the polypeptide backbone structures through the entropy-enthalpy compensation mechanism, enabling secondary structures and tertiary structures to fold reproducibly following explicit physical folding codes and forces. The temperature dependence of protein folding is thus attributed to the environment dependence of the conformational Gibbs free energy equation. The folding codes and forces in the amino acid sequence that dictate the formation of β-strands and α-helices can be deciphered with great accuracy through evaluation of the hydrophobic interactions among neighboring side-chains of an unfolded polypeptide from a β-strand-like thermodynamic metastable state. The folding of protein quaternary structures is found to be guided by the entropy-enthalpy compensations in between the docking sites of protein subunits according to the Gibbs free energy equation that is verified by bioinformatics analyses of a dozen structures of dimers. Protein folding is therefore guided by multistage entropy-enthalpy compensations of the system of polypeptide chains and water molecules under the solution conditions.","Li, Jiacheng; Hou, Chengyu; Ma, Xiaoliang; Guo, Shuai; Zhang, Hongchi; Shi, Liping; Liao, Chenchen; Zheng, Bing; Ye, Lin; Yang, Lin; He, Xiaodong",Int J Mol Sci,39,24

The fabricated samples were examined for the variation in physical, structural, elastic, and radiation-shielding properties with the Bi(2)O(3) concentration. The structural and compositional evaluations are done using XRD and FTIR spectra. The BZX matrixes consist of the trigonal-planar and tetrahedral groups of borates, BiO(3) and BiO(6) units of Bi(2)O(3), and the non-bridging oxygen in general. The average single-bond strength values substantiate the increasing ionic nature of the BZX glasses. The variation in the density and molar volume of the BZX series discussed in terms of various structural and elastic properties. The glass-coded BZ15 was found to be the best candidate for the sound-resistant applications based on the atomic packing fraction and the acoustic impedance studies. With MCNP5 simulation, the mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) values of all the samples were calculated and compared with a theoretical approach using the XCOM program. As the amount of Bi(2)O(3) increases, the linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) increases with it at all energies. The LAC values varied between 0.2805 and 0.5269 cm(−1) for the investigated glasses at 0.81 MeV. BZ30 glass is the more effective shield due to the highest MAC and LAC values.

Virus has been found in conjunctiva of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Conjunctivitis has also been reported as a presenting symptom of disease. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctiva and throat among patients presenting at the emergency outpatient ophthalmological healthcare facility at a county hospital along with investigating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among staff at the department. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Swabs from conjunctiva and throat of patients were analysed with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples for serological analysis were obtained from staff. A questionnaire was used to investigate symptoms associated with COVID-19 during the last 3 months as well as symptoms for which the patients were seeking ophthalmological healthcare. RESULTS: In total, 68 patients and 70 individuals from the staff were included in the study. Conjunctivitis was observed in 7% of patients. One patient, presenting with reduced visual acuity due to preretinal haemorrhage in the macula, was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab. Contact tracing was negative.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide insights in the representation of this group among reported cases, indicating susceptibility and exposure. METHODS: All laboratory‐confirmed cases including basic demographic and limited clinical information that were reported to the FluZone surveillance system between April and October 2009 were retrieved. Missing ethnicity data were imputed using the previously developed and validated South Asian Names and Group Recognition Algorithm (SANGRA). Differences between ethnic groups were calculated using chi‐square, log‐rank and t tests and rate ratios. Geographic clustering was compared using Ripley's K functions. RESULTS: SANGRA identified 2447 (28%) of the total of 8748 reported cases as South Asian. South Asian cases were younger (P < .001), more often male (P = .002) and more often from deprived areas (P < .001) than cases of other ethnic groups. Time between onset of symptoms and laboratory sampling was longer in this group (P < .001), and they were less often advised antiviral treatment (P < .001), however, declined treatment less.

Strong evidence of a male bias in COVID-19 disease severity is hypothesized to be mediated by sex differential immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis is based on data from other viral infections, including influenza viruses, HIV, hepatitis viruses, and others that have demonstrated sex-specific immunity to viral infections. Although males are more susceptible to most viral infections, females possess immunological features that render them more vulnerable to distinct immune-related disease outcomes. Both sex chromosome complement and related genes as well as sex steroids play important roles in mediating the development of sex differences in immunity to viral infections.","Jacobsen, Henning; Klein, Sabra L.",Front Immunol,39,16

Several lines of evidence have suggested a relationship between the vitamin D endocrine system and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We present a retrospective survival study that includes all Andalusian patients hospitalized between January and November 2020 because of COVID-19 infection. Based on a central registry of electronic health records (the Andalusian Population Health Database, BPS), prescription of vitamin D or its metabolites within 15-30 days before hospitalization were recorded. The effect of treatment with vitamin D metabolites for other indication previous to the hospitalization was studied with respect to patient survival by means of Kaplan-Meyer survival curves and Log Hazard Ratios, using a propensity score to compensate the disbalance of compared classes and the confounding factors. The availability of detailed patient data in the BPS allowed to obtain Real-World Evidence (RWE) of the effects of prior use of vitamin D or its metabolites on the mortality due to COVID-19 infection. Findings: A retrospective cohort of 16.401patients was extracted from the BPS, which includes all the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis between January and November 2020 in Andalusia, one of the largest regions in Europe with the size of an average median country. A total of 358 patients were found with cholecalciferol, and 193 with calcifediol, prescriptions 15 days before hospitalization. For a period extended to 30 days before hospitalization, the numbers increase to 416 and 210 and, respectively. Kaplan-Meyer survival curves and hazard ratios support an association between consumption of these metabolites and patient survival. Such association was stronger in calcifediol (Log Hazard Ratio, LHR = -1.27{+/-}0.32) than in cholecalciferol (LHR= -0.56{+/-}0.15), when prescribed 15 days before hospitalization This effect decreases when a larger 30 days period is considered (calcifediol LHR= -1.01{+/-}0.27 and cholecalciferol LHR= -0.27{+/-}0.12), suggesting that the closer was the treatment to the hospitalization the stronger the association. Conclusions: A significant reduction in mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with the prescription of vitamin D, especially calcifediol, within 15-30 days prior to hospitalization.","Loucera, C.; Pena-Chilet, M.; Esteban-Medina, M.; Munoyerro-Muniz, D.; Villegas, R.; Lopez-Miranda, J.; Rodriguez-Bano, J.; Tunez, I.; Bouillon, R.; Dopazo, J.; Quesada Gomez, J.

Many patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome, even are in danger of death. This is the first study to evaluate dynamic changes of D-Dimer and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Count Ratio (NLR) as a prognostic utility in patients with COVID-19 for clinical use. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we collected data from 349 hospitalized patients who diagnosed as the infection of the COVID-19 in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. We used ROC curves and Cox regression analysis to explore critical value (optimal cut-off point associated with Youden index) and prognostic role of dynamic changes of D-Dimer and NLR. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-nine participants were enrolled in this study and the mortality rate of the patients with laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 was 14.9%. The initial and peak value of D-Dimer and NLR in deceased patients were higher statistically compared with survivors (P < 0.001). There was a more significant upward trend of D-Dimer and NLR during hospitalization in the deceased patients, initial D-Dimer and NLR were lower than the peak tests (MD) -25.23, 95% CI: − 31.81- -18.64, P < 0.001; (MD) -43.73, 95% CI:-59.28- -31.17, P < 0.001. The test showed a stronger correlation between hospitalization days, PCT and peak D-Dimer than initial D-Dimer. The areas under the ROC curves of peak D-Dimer and peak NLR tests were higher than the initial tests (0.94(95%CI: 0.90–0.98) vs. 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73–0.87); 0.93 (95%CI:0.90–0.96) vs. 0.86 (95%CI:0.82–0.91). The critical value of initial D-Dimer, peak D-Dimer, initial NLR and peak NLR was 0.73 mg/L, 3.78 mg/L,7.13 and 14.31 respectively. 35 (10.03%) patients were intubated. In the intubated patients, initial and peak D-Dimer and NLR were much higher than non-intubated patients (P < 0.001). The critical value of initial D-Dimer, peak D-Dimer, initial NLR and peak NLR in prognosticate of intubation was 0.73 mg/L, 12.75 mg/L,7.28 and 27.55. The multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.07, P = 0.01), the peak D-Dimer (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04, P < 0.001) were prognostic factors for COVID-19 patients’ death. CONCLUSIONS: To dynamically observe the ratio of D-Dimer and NLR was more valuable during the prognosis of COVID-19. The rising trend in D-Dimer and NLR, or the test results higher than the critical values may indicate a risk of death for participants with COVID-19.","Ye, Wenjing; Chen, Guoxi; Li, Xiaopan; Lan, Xing; Ji, Chen; Hou, Min; Zhang, Di; Zeng, Guangwang; Wang, Yaling; Xu, Cheng; Lu, Weiwei; Cui, Ruolin; Cai, Yuyang; Huang, Hai; Yang, Ling",Respir Res,39,24

COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by the coronavirus, involves diverse pathologies beyond those of a respiratory disease, including micro-thrombosis (micro-clotting), cytokine storms, and inflammatory responses affecting many organ systems. Longer-term chronic illness can persist for many months, often well after the pathogen is no longer detected. A better understanding of the proteins that ACE2 interacts with can reveal information relevant to these disease manifestations and possible avenues for treatment. We have undertaken an approach to predict candidate ACE2 interacting proteins which uses evolutionary inference to identify a set of mammalian proteins that “coevolve” with ACE2. The approach, called evolutionary rate correlation (ERC), detects proteins that show highly correlated evolutionary rates during mammalian evolution. Such proteins are candidates for biological interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The approach has uncovered a number of key ACE2 protein interactions of potential relevance to COVID-19 pathologies. Some proteins have previously been reported to be associated with severe COVID-19, but are not currently known to interact with ACE2, while additional predicted novel ACE2 interactors are of potential relevance to the disease. Using reciprocal rankings of protein ERCs, we have identified strongly interconnected ACE2 associated protein networks relevant to COVID-19 pathologies. ACE2 has clear connections to coagulation pathway proteins, such as Coagulation Factor V and fibrinogen components FGA, FGB, and FGG, the latter possibly mediated through ACE2 connections to Clusterin (which clears misfolded extracellular proteins) and GPR141 (whose functions are relatively unknown). ACE2 also connects to proteins involved in cytokine signaling and immune response (e.g. XCR1, IFNAR2 and TLR8), and to Androgen Receptor (AR). The ERC prescreening approach has elucidated possible functions for relatively uncharacterized proteins and possible new functions for well-characterized ones. Suggestions are made for the validation of ERC-predicted ACE2 protein interactions. We propose that ACE2 has novel protein interactions that are disrupted during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the spectrum of COVID-19 pathologies.","Varela, Austin A.; Cheng, Sammy; Werren, John H.",PeerJ,39,16

METHODS: A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay. RESULTS: Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+ (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848–0.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882–0.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871–0.985), respectively. The three mPCRs were comparable in terms of detection of FluA. CONCLUSIONS: Point estimates calculated from eligible studies showed that the three mPCRs (FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+) are highly accurate and may provide important diagnostic information for early identification of respiratory virus infections. In patients with low pretest probability for FluA, these three mPCRs can predict a low possibility of infection and may justify withholding empirical antiviral treatments.","Huang, H.-S.; Tsai, C.-L.; Chang, J.; Hsu, T.-C.; Lin, S.; Lee, C.-C.",Clin Microbiol Infect,39,5

A case of severe tracheobronchitis in a laryngectomee is presented that illustrates the risks and difficulties encountered in managing this infection in a neck breather. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old Caucasian man, a laryngectomee, presented with bacterial tracheobronchitis and conjunctivitis due to beta-lactamase-producing nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. He was febrile (38.9 °C; 102.0 F), and had repeated episodes of hypertension. He was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg/day, ciprofloxacin eye drops, acetaminophen, and guaifenesin. Humidification of his trachea and the airway was sustained by insertions of saline into the stoma as well as breathing humidified air. The main challenge was to maintain the patency of his airway as the mucus was very dry and viscous and tended to stick to the walls of his trachea and the stoma. His condition improved within 7 days and he had a complete recovery.

Here, we will consider this question, and the role in this respect of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Emerging evidence suggests that AMPK facilitates central and peripheral reflexes that coordinate breathing and oxygen supply, and contributes to the central regulation of feeding and food choice. We propose, therefore, that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat, but also nutrient-based diet selection, and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect. Currently available information on how oxygen supply may be aligned with feeding and food choice, or vice versa, through our motivation to breathe and select particular nutrients is sparse, fragmented and lacks any integrated understanding. By addressing this, we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential, by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise, in part, to known associations between metabolic disease, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, sleep-disordered breathing, pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Evans, A.

The protocols already set in place can be further challenged when the facility reaches its capacity to manage the patients. To fulfill the goal of providing adequate management to the SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women and their infants, avoid variation from suggested guidelines, and decrease risk of exposure of the health care workers, the health care provider team needs to review the variations regularly. While familiarity can be achieved by reviewing the guidelines, clinical case simulations provide a more hands-on approach. Using case-based simulations and current guidance from the Center for Disease Control, American Academy of Pediatrics, and recent reviews, we discuss a management guideline developed at our institution to facilitate provision of care to SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women during delivery and to their infants, while protecting health care providers from exposure, and in keeping with the local facility logistics. Key Points: Simulation of delivery of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women can minimize the risk of exposure to healthcare professionals. Four common scenarios of delivery as described can be adapted for the evolving guidelines for the management of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. Integrating simulations of management of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women is feasible in daily clinical routine.","Rastogi, Shantanu",Am J Perinatol,39,2

The assessment of febrile returning child travelers is becoming more frequent and challenging. The question of previous travel should be foremost in the checklist of the interview of any febrile child traveler, because this implies a possible tropical disease such as malaria that may be life-threatening. These need to be investigated and treated effectively and rapidly. There are highly contagious infections that could pose public health risks requiring implementation of hygienic and public health measures. A detailed immunization, medical, and travel history for exposure to infectious risks using geographic, seasonal, environmental, sociocultural, and epidemiological data are needed. Along with clinical examination and elementary first-line investigations, the history should guide second-line exams, which will provide the etiology and optimal treatment in approximately 75 % of cases. The majority of children will have a cosmopolitan infection that resolves spontaneously or is simple to treat. Malaria will need urgent and specific treatment.

MS appears not to be a risk factor for severe adverse COVID-19 outcomes (though patients with advanced disability or a progressive phenotype are at higher risk). Disease-modifying therapy (DMT)-based care appears generally safe for patients with MS who develop COVID-19 (although there may be an increased risk of adverse outcomes with anti-CD20 therapy). Interferon-β, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab and cladribine tablets are unlikely to increase the risk of infection; fingolimod, anti-CD20 agents and alemtuzumab may confer an intermediate risk. Existing DMT therapy should be continued at this time. For patients requiring initiation of a DMT, all currently available DMTs except alemtuzumab can be started safely at this time; initiate alemtuzumab subject to careful individual risk–benefit considerations. Patients should receive vaccination against COVID-19 where possible, with no interruption of existing DMT-based care. There is no need to alter the administration of interferon-β, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod or cladribine tablets for vaccination; new starts on other DMTs should be delayed for up to 6 weeks after completion of vaccination to allow the immune response to develop. Doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine may be scheduled around doses of anti-CD20 or alemtuzumab. Where white cell counts are suppressed by treatment, these should be allowed to recover before vaccination.","Inshasi, Jihad; Alroughani, Raed; Al-Asmi, Abdullah; Alkhaboury, Jaber; Alsalti, Abdullah; Boshra, Amir; Canibano, Beatriz; Deleu, Dirk; Ahmed, Samar Farouk; Shatila, Ahmed; Thakre, Mona",Neurol Ther,39,20

As Costa et al. discuss in their article, when public services are implemented via competing systems, service providers contend to provide good services with the ultimate objective of gaining market quota. This is known as managed competition (MC), as the authorities will have to manage the panoply of public and private organizations offering the service. The alternative is to manage the service more centrally, in what it is identified as vertical integration. As the authors describe, several governments around the globe have abandoned their vertical integrated models in favour of decentralized models. This is the case, as the authors recall, for most health services in Europe. While there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that decentralized MC outperforms vertically integrated models both in terms of efficiency and in terms of service quality, little is known on how these systems react under different circumstances. This means, for example, how these systems can cope with a sudden increase in their service demands.","Bel, Germà; Esteve, Marc","Health economics, policy, and law",39,16

METHODS: We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in the lung and other organs. RESULTS: Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes, and/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions, and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis, or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e., lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney, and brain). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, autopsies revealed a great heterogeneity of COVID-19-associated organ injury and the remarkable absence of any specific viral lesions, even when RT-PCR identified the presence of the virus in many organs.","Remmelink, Myriam; De Mendonça, Ricardo; D’Haene, Nicky; De Clercq, Sarah; Verocq, Camille; Lebrun, Laetitia; Lavis, Philomène; Racu, Marie-Lucie; Trépant, Anne-Laure; Maris, Calliope; Rorive, Sandrine; Goffard, Jean-Christophe; De Witte, Olivier; Peluso, Lorenzo; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Decaestecker, Christine; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Salmon, Isabelle",Crit Care,39,24

This paper reports a study that analysed selected ‘COVID art forms’ through arts and health and critical health psychology frameworks. Art forms produced between March and July 2020, and available in the public sphere - traditional media, social media and public spaces - were collated. The data consisted of comedy, cartoons, songs, murals and textile designs. Three key functions emerged from analysis: health promotion (comedy, cartoons, songs); disease prevention (masks); and improving the aesthetics of the healthcare environment (murals). Textile designs performed broader socio-cultural functions of memorialising and political advocacy. Similar to earlier HIV/AIDS and Ebola arts interventions in other African countries, these Ghanaian COVID art forms translated public health information on COVID-19 in ways that connected emotionally, created social awareness and improved public understanding. However, some art forms had limitations: for example, songs that edutained using fear-based strategies or promoting conspiracy theories on the origins and treatment of COVID-19, and state-sponsored visual art that represented public health messaging decoupled from socio-economic barriers to health protection. These were likely to undermine the public health communication goals of behaviour modification. We outline concrete approaches to incorporate creative arts into COVID-19 public health interventions and post-pandemic health systems strengthening in Ghana.

In this study, we screened a library of compounds that are biologically active and structurally diverse for inhibitory activity against influenza neuraminidase (NA). We found that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) is a potent inhibitor of NA activity of both group-1 and group-2 influenza viruses with IC(50)s (effective concentration to inhibit NA activity by 50%) values at low micromolar concentrations. ATA was equally potent in inhibiting the NA activity derived from wild-type NA and its H274Y mutant which renders NA resistance to inhibition by oseltamivir. Although ATA is structurally distinct from sialic acid, molecular modeling experiments suggested that ATA binds to NA at the enzyme’s substrate binding site. These results indicate that ATA may be a good starting material for the design of a novel class of NA inhibitors for the treatment influenza viruses.","Hung, Hui-Chen; Tseng, Ching-Ping; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Ju, Yi-Wei; Tseng, Sung-Nain; Chen, Yen-Fu; Chao, Yu-Sheng; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Shih, Shin-Ru; Hsu, John T.-A.",Antiviral Res,39,3

In the central nervous system (CNS), many complement proteins are locally produced and regulate nervous system development and physiological processes such as neural plasticity. However, aberrant complement activation has been implicated in neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s disease. There is a growing list of pathogens that have been shown to interact with the complement system in the brain but the short- and long-term consequences of infection-induced complement activation for neuronal functioning are largely elusive. Available evidence suggests that the infection-induced complement activation could be protective or harmful, depending on the context. Here we summarize how various infectious agents, including bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus spp.), viruses (e.g., HIV and measles virus), fungi (e.g., Candida spp.), parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp.), and prion proteins activate and manipulate the complement system in the CNS.

In the absence of reinfection, it is proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for R0 < 1. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R0 to changes in any of the parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play a major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of symptomatic patients to control the disease.","Kassa, Semu; Njagarah, Hatson John Boscoh; Terefe, Yibeltal Adane",,39,1

In this study, a killed vaccine against TGEV-like CCoV strains, included in the new subtype CCoV-IIb, was developed through inactivation with betapropiolactone and emulsification with MF59™ adjuvant. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the developed vaccine were evaluated in vivo. Five 10-week-old beagle pups were administered (three weeks apart) two vaccine doses, whereas two animals served as unvaccinated controls.

Serum antibodies against CCoV were detected in vaccinates starting from study day 14 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or 28 (by virus neutralisation test). Subsequent challenge with virulent CCoV-IIb resulted in the development of mild gastroenteric disease in control pups, whereas vaccinates did not display clinical signs. Faecal shedding of the challenge virus occurred in both treatment groups, but vaccinated dogs were found to shed very low viral titres in comparison to controls.

Pn3Pase is a glycoside hydrolase that we have previously shown to be highly effective in degrading the capsular polysaccharide of type 3 Spn, sensitizing it to host immune clearance. To begin assessing the value and safety of this enzyme for future clinical studies, we investigated the effects of high doses of Pn3Pase on host cells and immune system. METHODS: We assessed the enzyme’s catalytic activity following administration in mice, and performed septic infection models to determine if prior administration of the enzyme inhibited repeat treatments of Spn3-challenged mice. We assessed immune populations in mouse tissues following administration of the enzyme, and tested Pn3Pase toxicity on other mammalian cell types in vitro. RESULTS: Repeated administration of the enzyme in vivo does not prevent efficacy of the enzyme in promoting bacterial clearance following bacterial challenge, with insignificant antibody response generated against the enzyme. Immune homeostasis is maintained following high-dose treatment with Pn3Pase, and no cytotoxic effects were observed against mammalian cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that Pn3Pase has potential as a therapy against Spn3.

Screw-assisted EAM has gained importance as an enabling technology to expand the range of 3D printing materials, reduce costs associated with feedstock fabrication, and increase the material deposition rate compared to traditional fused filament fabrication (FFF). Many experimental printheads and commercial systems that use some screw-processing mechanism can be found in the literature, but the design diversity and lack of standard terminology make it difficult to determine the most suitable solutions for a given material or application field. Besides, the few previous reviews have offered only a glimpse into the topic, without an in-depth analysis about the design of the extruders and associated capabilities. A systematic procedure was devised to identify the screw-assisted EAM systems that can print directly from granulated materials, resulting in 61 articles describing different pieces of equipment that were categorized as experimental printheads and commercial systems, for small- and large-scale applications. After describing their main characteristics, the most significant extruder modifications were discussed with reference to the materials processed and performance requirements. In the end, a general workflow for the development of 3D printers based on screw extrusion was proposed.

Methods: We synthesized 41 peptides ranging in size from 16 to 25 amino acid residues of relatively high hydrophilicity. The immunoreactivities of the peptides with SARS patient sera were determined by ELISA. Results: Four epitopic sites, S599, M137, N66, and N371-404, located in the SARS-coronavirus S, M, and N proteins, respectively, were detected by screening synthesized peptides. Notably, N371 and N385, located at the COOH terminus of the N protein, inhibited binding of antibodies to SARS-coronavirus lysate and bound to antibodies in >94% of samples from SARS study patients.

Conversely, prior contact with neighbors (B = −0.165, p = 0.010) predicted worsening loneliness among Profile 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on the mental health trajectories of aging adults with social ties of different strengths. Stronger neighborhood networks are important to mitigate poor mental health outcomes among vulnerable older adults during a crisis. Older adults who are living alone and had relied on non-friend neighbors for social connectedness require additional community supports. Policy interventions are required to mitigate the mental health impact of future pandemics.","Gan, Daniel R. Y.; Best, John R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,39,20

The aim of this study was to review current scientific reports assessing the impact of the pandemic on the physical activity, mental state, and quality of life of professional athletes. Popular scientific databases—PubMed, Scopus, and Embase—were systematically searched from the beginning of the pandemic until 12 July 2021. According to the adopted criteria, 14 articles were included in the review. Ten of the qualified studies determined the impact of the pandemic on the physical activity of athletes. The authors of 11 papers assessed the mental state and quality of life of athletes during the pandemic. The studies showed negative effects of the pandemic: a decrease in overall physical fitness and number of days and hours of training, as well as an increase in the occurrence of negative emotions (stress, fatigue, and depression) and a decrease in sleep quality. Changes in physical activity had an impact on overall well-being ratings, which depended on the sex of the subjects. Women were more likely to experience negative emotions compared to men. The mental state of the athletes affected the quality of sleep.

The COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to suspend cancer screening services as part of their response to the pandemic. The International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN) carried out an online survey to assess the effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening. A 33-item survey was distributed to 834 email addresses to gather information about settings and assess decision-making processes that led to cancer screening suspension. Information about communication, impact on resources, and patient follow-up was collected. Quantitative data was analyzed as frequencies overall and by setting, while a comment section under each survey item captured nuanced details. Responses were recategorized into 66 settings, representing 35 countries. Most settings suspended cancer screening services (n = 60, 90.9%) in March 2020 (n = 45, 68.2%), guided by a government decision (n = 51, 77.3%). Few settings made the decision whether to suspend services based on a preparedness plan (n = 17, 25.8%). In most settings, professionals were reassigned (n = 41, 62.1%) and infrastructure repurposed (n = 35, 53.0%). The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on cancer screening worldwide, including the suspension of services in almost all settings. Most settings were unprepared to deal with the scale of the pandemic but demonstrated flexibility in the response. These results contribute to inform, through experiences and lessons learned, the next steps for the global cancer screening community to further evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and prepare for future disruptions.","Puricelli Perin, Douglas M.; Elfström, K.

This paper uses the low-energy-intensive incentive support policy implemented by the Chinese government as a trial and explores the impact of fiscal policy on the green recovery of firms. Using Chinese listed-firm data from 2019Q1 to 2021Q1, we use the difference-in-differences method to estimate policy effects, leading to several findings. First, our fundamental results show that the government's low-energy-intensive support policy can significantly improve low-energy-intensive firm performance more than that of high-energy-consuming firms, with respect to return on assets, return on equity and Tobin’s Q. Second, regarding the mechanisms involved, our estimation results indicate that the low-energy-intensive support policy works by alleviating financial constraints to improve firm performance. Third, our empirical findings indicate that low-energy-intensive support policy can increase current ratio, liquidity and cash flow, resulting in improved firm financial resources. Finally, the fiscal support policy reduces management and financial costs, thus improving firm performance. Our findings recommend adoption of well-designed fiscal policies in regions where green economic recovery is needed.","Zhang, Dongyang",Econ Change Restruct,39,1

Here we show that human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV papain-like proteases (PLP) antagonize innate immune signaling mediated by STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as MITA/ERIS/MYPS). STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon activation, forms dimers which assemble with MAVS, TBK-1 and IKKε, leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon (IFN). We found that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) or SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) inhibits STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters. Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated with STING, and viral replicase proteins co-localize with STING in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation and negatively regulates assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKKε complexes required for activation of IRF-3. STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM, likely contributing to disruption of signaling required for IFN induction. These results describe a new mechanism used by CoVs in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN induction.","Sun, Li; Xing, Yaling; Chen, Xiaojuan; Zheng, Yang; Yang, Yudong; Nichols, Daniel B.; Clementz, Mark A.; Banach, Bridget S.; Li, Kui; Baker, Susan C.; Chen, Zhongbin",PLoS One,39,14

To explore S requirements for entry under BSL2 conditions, S has been pseudotyped onto vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or retroviral particles with varied success. Several alterations to S were demonstrated to improve pseudoparticle titers, but they have not been systematically compared. In this study, we produced pseudotyped VSV particles with multiple modifications to S, including truncation, mutation, and tagging strategies. The main objective of this study was to determine which modifications of the S protein optimize cell surface expression, incorporation into pseudotyped particles, and pseudoparticle entry. Removal of the last 19 residues of the cytoplasmic tail produced a hyper-fusogenic S, while removal of 21 residues increased S surface production and VSV incorporation. Additionally, we engineered a replication-competent VSV (rVSV) virus to produce the S-D614G variant with a truncated cytoplasmic tail.

Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [Image: see text]) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that [Image: see text] has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in [Image: see text], suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission.","Blumberg, Seth; Funk, Sebastian; Pulliam, Juliet R.

Results: Derangement of LBT occurred in 2854/3812 (74.9%) of patients, most frequently due to elevation of AST (61.6%), GGT (46.1%) and ALT (33.4%). Elevated AST, ALT, GGT and low albumin were associated with more severe disease at admission.

METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD 2010) methodology to estimate the country-level burden of disease in KSA. We used data from systematic reviews of the literature, household survey data, antenatal clinic surveillance data, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions data, outpatient visit data, population-based cancer registries, active screening data, and other administrative data. RESULTS: Noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries became the leading cause of death and disability in KSA in 2010. Elevated body mass index was the leading risk factor for disease (7.02% for males and 4.61% for females in 2010). High glucose levels were the second leading disease risk factor for females (3.28%) and third for males (6.25%) in 2010. Preterm birth complications were the main cause for DALYs in 1990; however, in 2010, the leading cause of DALYs for males was road traffic injuries (12.40%) and for females it was major depressive disorder (7.88%). CONCLUSION: KSA is facing a rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries as a result of rapid changes in behaviors. Our results demonstrate the need for major intervention to reduce these burdens and to engage other sectors of the government and the community in these efforts.","Memish, Ziad A.; Jaber, Sara; Mokdad, Ali H.; AlMazroa, Mohammad A.; Murray, Christopher J.L.; Al Rabeeah, Abdullah A.",Prev Chronic Dis,39,22

OBJECTIVE: This article describes the components and determinants of these anxiety symptoms, potential resilience and risk factors and appropriate recommendations for action. METHODS: The article presents an overview of research results regarding COVID-19 and previous epidemics and pandemics (e.g., HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola and swine flu). Furthermore, official recommendations for action are presented. RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms frequently occur in epidemics and pandemics, especially in the early phase and usually decrease in the further course. Although other aspects of different infectious diseases vary, the associated fears are similar and include e.g. the fear of health-related, social and economic consequences. Resilience and risk factors in various epidemics and pandemics are comparable. Self-efficacy expectation, tolerance of uncertainty, normalization, routines, safety and social support usually have a protective effect. In contrast, excessive media consumption, female gender, work in a medical context, suppression, pre-existing diseases, unhealthy behavior and closer exposure to the virus are often accompanied by more severe anxiety. CONCLUSION: Fears should be observed and addressed in order to reduce pathological processes, especially in vulnerable groups. It is advisable to promote resilience factors and to counteract risk factors with preventive and therapeutic measures. For this purpose, the development and empirical testing of specific interventions as well as further longitudinal studies are needed.","Bendau, A.; Petzold, M.

In the present study, 40 Holstein calves were used to examine the effects of supplemental lactoferrin (0, 1, 2, or 3 g/d) on health, growth, and feed intake from 3 d of age to 2 wk postweaning. Lactoferrin was mixed and fed with a nonmedicated milk replacer. Calves were housed in individual pens and offered a textured, nonmedicated starter and water for ad libitum consumption. Body weight and heart girth were measured weekly. Intakes of milk replacer and starter were determined daily. Fecal consistency was monitored three times per week. Calves were weaned when they met certain criteria based on body weight gain and starter intake. Preweaning fecal score responded quadratically, with the group fed 1 g/d of lactoferrin having the lowest score. Overall and preweaning number of days medicated responded in the same manner as fecal score. Preweaning average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio increased linearly with lactoferrin supplementation, whereas postweaning gain-to-feed ratio decreased linearly with lactoferrin. Overall average daily heart girth gain increased linearly with lactoferrin. Body weight, weaning age, and dry matter intake were not different among treatments. Based on the observed improved gain-to-feed ratios, increased average daily gains, improved fecal scores, and reduced morbidity in preweaned calves, it appears that lactoferrin may be a beneficial supplement in the diets of neonatal calves prior to weaning.","Robblee, E.D.; Erickson, P.S.; Whitehouse, N.L.; McLaughlin, A.M.; Schwab, C.G.; Rejman, J.J.; Rompala, R.E.",J Dairy Sci,39,13

Respiratory cilia are also one of the first contact points between host and inhaled pathogens. Impaired ciliary function is a common pathological feature in patients with chronic airway diseases, increasing susceptibility to respiratory infections. Common respiratory pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been shown to target cilia and/or ciliated airway epithelial cells, resulting in a disruption of mucociliary clearance that may facilitate host infection. Despite being an integral component of airway innate immunity, the role of respiratory cilia and their clinical significance during airway infections are still poorly understood. This review examines the expression, structure, and function of respiratory cilia during pathogenic infection of the airways. This review also discusses specific known points of interaction of bacteria, fungi, and viruses with respiratory cilia function. The emerging biological functions of motile cilia relating to intracellular signaling and their potential immunoregulatory roles during infection will also be discussed.","Kuek, Li Eon; Lee, Robert J.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,39,6

However, it is unclear if there are shared patterns between general vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection, or if these are two different concepts. This study characterized rejection of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine, and compared patterns of association between general vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection. The survey was conducted online March 20-22, 2020. Participants answered questions on vaccine hesitancy and responded if they would accept the vaccine given different safety and effectiveness profiles. We assessed differences in COVID-19 rejection and general vaccine hesitancy through logistic regressions. Among 713 participants, 33.0% were vaccine hesitant, and 18.4% would reject a COVID-19 vaccine. Acceptance varied by effectiveness profile: 10.2% would reject a 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, but 32.4% would reject a 50% effective vaccine. Those vaccine hesitant were significantly more likely to reject COVID-19 vaccination [odds ratio (OR): 5.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.39, 9.11]. In multivariable logistic regression models, there were similar patterns for vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection by gender, race/ethnicity, family income, and political affiliation. But the direction of association flipped by urbanicity (P=0.0146, with rural dwellers less likely to be COVID-19 vaccine rejecters but more likely to be vaccine hesitant in general), and age (P=0.0037, with fewer pronounced differences across age for COVID-19 vaccine rejection, but a gradient of stronger vaccine hesitancy in general among younger ages). During the COVID-19 epidemic’s early phase, patterns of vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection were relatively similar. A significant minority would reject a COVID-19 vaccine, especially one with less-than-ideal effectiveness. Preparations for introducing the COVID-19 vaccine should anticipate substantial hesitation and target concerns, especially among younger adults.","Shih, Shu-Fang; Wagner, Abram L.; Masters, Nina B.; Prosser, Lisa A.; Lu, Yihan; Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J.",Front Immunol,39,33

Governments are using various approaches from general advice to full lockdown. There is a need to describe and understand adherence to public health actions. Methods Participants from two ongoing cohorts, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and The Norwegian Influenza Pregnancy Cohort (NorFlu), answered questionnaires every 14 days since March 2020. From the summer of 2020, testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 became easily available. Recommendations were that respiratory symptoms should lead to testing, and that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be followed by quarantine. We estimated the adherence to these guidelines in responses from cohort participants in the period August to October 2020. Results Less than 40% of men who were ill and less than 45% of women who were ill, tested themselves for SARS-CoV-2 during the same 14-day periods. Among subjects tested for COVID-19, about 53% of men and 59% of women reported quarantine. For subjects with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, the proportions quarantined were 65% for men and 72% for women. Conclusions Public adherence to governmental recommendations regarding testing and quarantine were lower than expected in a country with high trust in government. This leaves considerable room for improvement in adherence, possibly reducing the need for more restrictive interventions.","Carlsen, E. O.; Caspersen, I.

In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.","Li, Hongdou; Wang, Shuang; Zhong, Fan; Bao, Wuyin; Li, Yipeng; Liu, Lei; Wang, Hongyan; He, Yungang",Front Med (Lausanne),39,16

We aimed to compare self-perceived proficiency of PPE use and objective performance, and identify predictors of low compliance and PPE misuse. METHODS: An observational study combined with subjective questionnaires were carried out during a bioterror simulation drill. Forty-two observers evaluated performance under PPE. Mistakes were recorded and graded using a structured observational format and were correlated with the subjective questionnaires and with demographic parameters. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight HCWs from community clinics and hospitals were included. The mean self-perceived proficiency was high (6.1 out of 7), mean level of comfort was moderate (4.0 out of 7), and mean objective performance was intermediate (9.5 out of 13). There was no correlation between comfort and objective performance scores. Self-perceived proficiency was in correlation with donning and continuous performance with PPE but not with doffing. Clinic personnel performed better than personnel in hospitals (40.3% vs 67.8% with 3 or more mistakes, respectively; P = .001).

While a higher severity of these patients could be expected from the addition of both respiratory and neurological injury, COVID-19 patients with strokes can present with mild or none respiratory symptoms. We aimed to compare anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes severity between patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a comparative cohort study between patients with COVID-19 who had anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and early brain imaging within 3 hours from onset, in our institution during the 6 first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak and a control group admitted during the same calendar period in 2019. RESULTS: Twelve COVID-19 patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and early brain imaging were included during the study period and compared with 34 control patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and early brain imaging in 2019. Patients in the COVID-19 group were younger (P=0.032) and had a history of diabetes mellitus more frequently (P=0.039). Patients did not significantly differ on initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale nor time from onset to imaging (P=0.18 and P=0.6, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 had more severe strokes than patients without COVID-19, with a significantly lower clot burden score (median: 6.5 versus 8, P=0.016), higher rate of multivessel occlusion (50% versus 8.8%, P=0.005), lower DWI-ASPECTS (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging–Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Scores; median: 5 versus 8, P=0.006), and higher infarct core volume (median: 58 versus 6 mL, P=0.004). Successful recanalization rate was similar in both groups (P=0.767). In-hospital mortality was higher in the COVID-19 patients’ group (41.7% versus 11.8%, P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Early brain imaging showed higher severity large vessel occlusion strokes in patients with COVID-19. Given the massive number of infected patients, concerns should be raised about the coming neurovascular impact of the pandemic worldwide.","Escalard, Simon; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Escalard, Clément; Redjem, Hocine; Delvoye, François; Hébert, Solène; Smajda, Stanislas; Ciccio, Gabriele; Desilles, Jean-Philippe; Mazighi, Mikael; Blanc, Raphael; Maïer, Benjamin; Piotin, Michel",Stroke,39,6

We conducted a survey one year before the pandemic, at its outbreak and during de-escalation (N = 1706). Despite the lockdown, most respondents tolerated being controlled by authorities, and acknowledged the importance of group necessities over individual rights. However, de-escalation resulted in a belief change towards the intrusiveness of authorities and the preeminence of individual rights. Besides, transcendental beliefs–God answering prayers and the existence of an afterlife–declined after the outbreak, but were strengthened in the de-escalation. Results were strongly influenced by political ideology: the proportion of left-sided voters who saw authorities as intrusive greatly decreased, and transcendental beliefs prevailed among right-sided voters.

Its drastic impact on the global population and international health care is swift, evolving, and unpredictable. The effects on orthopaedic surgery departments are predominantly indirect, with widespread cessation of all nonessential orthopaedic care. Although this is vital to the system-sustaining measures of isolation and resource reallocation, there is profound detriment to orthopaedic training programs. METHODS: In the face of new pressures on the finite timeline on an orthopaedic residency, the Emory University School of Medicine Department of Orthopaedics has devised a 5-pronged strategy based on the following: (1) patient and provider safety, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) system sustainability, (4) adaptability, and (5) preservation of vital leadership structures. RESULTS: Our 5 tenants support a 2-team system, whereby the residents are divided into cycling “active-duty” and “working remotely” factions. In observation of the potential incubation period of viral symptoms, phase transitions occur every 2 weeks with strict adherence to team assignments. Intrateam redundancy can accommodate potential illness to ensure a stable unit of able residents. Active duty residents participate in in-person surgical encounters and virtual ambulatory encounters, whereas remotely working residents participate in daily video-conferenced faculty-lead, case-based didactics and pursue academic investigation, grant writing, and quality improvement projects. To sustain this, faculty and administrative 2-team systems are also in place to protect the leadership and decision-making components of the department. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus has decimated the United States healthcare system, with an unpredictable duration, magnitude, and variability. As collateral damage, orthopaedic residencies are faced with new challenges to provide care and educate residents in the face of safety, resource redistribution, and erosion of classic learning opportunities. Our adaptive approach aims to be a generalizable tactic to optimize our current landscape.","Schwartz, Andrew M.; Wilson, Jacob M.; Boden, Scott D.; Moore, Thomas J.; Bradbury, Thomas L.; Fletcher, Nicholas D.",JB JS Open Access,39,1

This retrospective study examined the fecal tests records from 1111 dogs and 203 cats with diarrhea submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in the city of Medellin between January and May 2018. The detection of parasites was carried out by direct smears and simple flotation methods. Parasitic organisms were detected in feces from 464 (41.7%) dogs and 96 (47.3%) cats. In order of decreasing prevalence, the parasites detected in dogs were: Giardia intestinalis (13%), ancylostomids (12.6%), Entamoeba spp. (6.1%), coccidian oocysts (5.8%), Toxocara spp. (5.6%) and Dipylidium caninum (1.3%). In cats, the prevalence was: Giardia intestinalis (20%), coccidian oocysts (8.9%), Entamoeba spp. (7.9%), ancylostomids (6.4%), Toxocara spp. (2.5%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%). Age, but not gender, was a predisposing factor, as puppies and kittens had significantly higher infection rates that older age categories. The majority of Giardia intestinalis positive cases occurred in puppies (109/145, 75.2%) and kittens (19/36, 52.8%), making this parasite the most prevalent in amongst animals with diarrhea. Out of 117 positive infections in the adult dog population, ancylostomids accounted for 56 cases (47.9%) and was the most common parasite in this age group. In conclusion, although these results do not imply a cause and effect relationship, they are an estimate of the type of parasites that may be most commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs and cats. The lower diagnostic sensitivity of the traditional methods used here as compared to more contemporary techniques like fecal flotation with centrifugation and PCR, may have underestimated the actual prevalence and diminished the detection of co-infections. Future studies should aim to have diagnostic panels that also screen for other enteric pathogens, including bacterial and viral agents.","López-Arias, Ánderson; Villar, David; López-Osorio, Sara; Calle-Vélez, Daniela; Chaparro-Gutiérrez, Jenny Jovana",Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports,39,29

We furthermore tested our method in transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, showing that our method not only correctly identified all positive samples but also substantially improved detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold value across all viral titers tested was 3.1. Finally, we illustrate that our method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, as we observed considerable improvement in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from sample volumes of up to 10 mL.","Barclay, R.

There are extensive publications on the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, with ground-glass opacities (GGO) and mixed GGO and consolidation being the most common findings. Those with interstitial thickening manifesting as reticular opacities typically show superimposed ground-glass opacities, giving a crazy-paving pattern. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 77-year-old man with a background of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS) who presented with progressive cough and shortness of breath for 2 days. He was in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The initial chest radiograph was negative for lung consolidation and ground-glass opacities. During admission, he had worsening shortness of breath with desaturation, prompting a chest CT examination, which was performed on day 14 of illness. The chest CT revealed an atypical finding of predominant focal subpleural interstitial thickening in the right lower lobe. He was provided supportive treatment along with steroid and antibiotics. He recovered well and subsequently tested negative for 2 consecutive swabs. He was discharged after 34 days. CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial thickening or reticular pattern on CT has been described in COVID-19 pneumonia, but largely in association with ground-glass opacity or consolidation. This case demonstrates an atypical predominance of interstitial thickening on chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia on day 14 of illness, which is the expected time of greatest severity of the disease.","Lau, Jaclyn Yee Cheun; Khoo, Hau Wei; Hui, Terrence Chi Hong; Kaw, Gregory Jon Leng; Tan, Cher Heng",Am J Case Rep,39,28

Recent mathematical models are aimed at studying dynamics of some specific types of infectious diseases. In this paper we propose a new model for infectious diseases spread having susceptible, infected, and recovered populations and study its dynamics in presence of incubation delays and relapse of the disease. The influence of treatment and vaccination efforts on the spread of infection in presence of time delays are studied. Sufficient conditions for local stability of the equilibria and change of stability are derived in various cases. The problem of global stability is studied for an important special case of the model. Simulations carried out in this study brought out the importance of treatment rate in controlling the disease spread. It is observed that incubation delays have influence on the system even under enhanced vaccination. The present study has clearly brought out the fact that treatment rate even in presence of time delays would contain the disease as compared to popular belief that eradication can only be done through vaccination.","Raja Sekhara Rao, P.; Naresh Kumar, M.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,39,16

Due to the great demand for effective COVID-19 testing programmes to control the spread of the disease, we have suggested such a testing programme that includes a rapid RT-qPCR approach without RNA extraction. The Direct-One-Step-RT-qPCR (DIOS-RT-qPCR) assay detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one hour while maintaining the high sensitivity and specificity required of diagnostic tools. This optimised protocol allows for the direct use of swab transfer media (14 μL) without the need for RNA extraction, achieving comparable sensitivity to the standard method that requires the time-consuming and costly step of RNA isolation. The limit of detection for DIOS-RT-qPCR was lower than seven copies/reaction, which translates to 550 virus copies/mL of swab. The speed, ease of use and low price of this assay make it suitable for high-throughput screening programmes. The use of fast enzymes allows RT-qPCR to be performed under standard laboratory conditions within one hour, making it a potential point-of-care solution on high-speed cycling instruments. This protocol also implements the heat inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (75 °C for 10 min), which renders samples non-infectious, enabling testing in BSL-2 facilities. Moreover, we discuss the critical steps involved in developing tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19. Implementing rapid, easy, cost-effective methods can help control the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 infection.","Kriegova, Eva; Fillerova, Regina; Kvapil, Petr",Diagnostics (Basel),39,20

Perceived clinical competence and learning needs of students in a simulation environment were also measured. BACKGROUND: Evidence showed virtual simulation education programmes provided better knowledge acquisition. However, these studies to date did not incorporate virtual simulation in the combination of a debriefing model in nursing students. DESIGN: A one‐group pre‐test and post‐test design. METHODS: 188 final year undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. Linear mixed model analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the programme. RESULTS: Students have perceived a significant improvement in clinical competence and nursing process. Self‐efficacy has also boosted. Communication and critical thinking were applied better in the traditional clinical environment. CONCLUSION: Perceived clinical competence of Chinese nursing students has significant improvements by using virtual simulation combining a debriefing model during the COVID‐19 period. Virtual simulation met students' learning needs. Future studies should include a control group for comparison and long‐term measurement.

DesignThis retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions. MethodsBaseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured. ResultsAt baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%). ConclusionsAnxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.","Bonner, Carissa; Cvejic, Erin; Ayre, Julie; Isautier, Jennifer; Semsarian, Christopher; Nickel, Brooke; Batcup, Carys; Pickles, Kristen; Dodd, Rachael; Cornell, Samuel; Copp, Tessa; McCaffery, Kirsten J",,39,1

Out of these motor symptoms, tremor and bradykinesia, are relatively prevalent in all stages of this disease. The assessment of these symptoms is usually performed by traditional methods where the accuracy of results is still an open question. This research proposed a solution for an objective assessment of tremor and bradykinesia in subjects with PD (10 older adults aged greater than 60 years with tremor and 10 older adults aged greater than 60 years with bradykinesia) and 20 healthy older adults aged greater than 60 years. Physical movements were recorded by means of an AWEAR bracelet developed using inertial sensors, i.e., 3D accelerometer and gyroscope. Participants performed upper extremities motor activities as adopted by neurologists during the clinical assessment based on Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). For discriminating the patients from healthy controls, temporal and spectral features were extracted, out of which non-linear temporal and spectral features show greater difference. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning classifiers provide good results. Out of 40 individuals, neural net clustering discriminated 34 individuals in correct classes, while the KNN approach discriminated 91.7% accurately. In a clinical environment, the doctor can use the device to comprehend the tremor and bradykinesia of patients quickly and with higher accuracy.","Channa, Asma; Ifrim, Rares-Cristian; Popescu, Decebal; Popescu, Nirvana",Sensors (Basel),39,22

These measures may affect health behaviours of the population such as eating habits, physical activity and alcohol consumption, which in turn can lead to weight gain resulting in overweight and obesity, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases, but also of severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of confinement measures on health behaviours and their associations with weight gain. METHODS: Data were derived from the second national COVID-19 health survey. Data were collected between the 16th and the 23rd of April 2020. The recruitment of participants was based on snowball sampling via Sciensano’s website, invitations via e-mail and social media. The study sample includes participants aged 18 years and over with no missing data on the variables of interest (n = 28,029). The association between self-reported weight gain and health behaviour changes, adjusted for gender, age group and household composition was assessed through OR’s (95% CI) calculated with logistic regression models, using post-stratification weights. RESULTS: Overall, 28.6% reported weight gain after 6 weeks of confinement. Higher odds of weight gain were observed among participants who increased or decreased their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR = 1.39 (1.15–1.68) and 1.29 (1.04–1.60), respectively), among those who increased their consumption of sweet or salty snacks (OR = 3.65 (3.27–4.07)), among those who became less physically active (OR = 1.91 (1.71–2.13)), and among those who increased their alcohol consumption (OR = 1.86 (1.66–2.08)). CONCLUSIONS: The most important correlates of weight gain during confinement were an increased consumption of sweet or salty snacks and being less physically active. These findings confirm the impact of diet and exercise on short term weight gain and plead to take more action, in supporting people to achieve healthier behaviours in order to tackle overweight and obesity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Drieskens, Sabine; Berger, Nicolas; Vandevijvere, Stefanie; Gisle, Lydia; Braekman, Elise; Charafeddine, Rana; De Ridder, Karin; Demarest, Stefaan",Arch Public Health,39,1

In sports, the fulfillment of individuals’ basic psychological needs depends mostly on support from others, such as that from a coach in a sports team context. However, a possible way for individuals to fulfill their basic psychological needs is by enhancing mindfulness rather than depending on others. Therefore, building on SDT and mindfulness, this study examines the mediating effect of basic psychological needs on mindfulness to predict subjective vitality and athlete burnout in professional golfers. The participants were 120 golfers (47% females), with a mean age and golf experience of 22.28 and 9.48 years, respectively. The association between mindfulness and subjective vitality was partially mediated by the need for autonomy and relatedness. By contrast, the association between mindfulness and burnout was partially mediated by the need for competence and relatedness, thus supporting our mediation analysis. Overall, the study highlights mindfulness as a potential mechanism to ensure the fulfillment of basic psychological needs in golf training, which could enhance golfers’ subjective vitality and reduce the occurrence of burnout.","Chuang, Hsin-Yun; Wang, Fong-Jia; Chi, Li-Kang",Curr Psychol,39,29

Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics.","Han, Jie; He, Shanshan",Sci Total Environ,39,16

Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of 235 randomly selected patients admitted to a major health care system with a diagnosis of PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Severe disease was defined as the presence of any of the following: respiratory rate ≥30, oxygen saturation ≤89% at rest, requirement of mechanical ventilation, non-respiratory organ failure, septic shock, or death. Presence of these symptoms were assessed for each patient upon initial presentation to the emergency department, and in their overall hospital course. Socioeconomic status was estimated by extrapolating US census data for median household income from each patient’s zip code. Household incomes were then separated into quintiles. The percentage of patients within each quintile who were severe upon presentation and severe overall was determined. Demographic data for each subject was collected and logistic regression was used to control for confounding variables. Results: Of the 235 patients, the income quintiles were as follows: q1: <source -38,100;q2: $38,101-46,700;q3: $46,701-56,600;q4: $56,601-72,000;q5: $72,001+. The population was 43% White, 24% American Indian or Alaska Native, 19% Black, 5% Asian, 1% Pacific Islander, 1% Middle Eastern, and 8% two or more races. 27% of the study population was of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Using a logistic regression to control for confounding variables, a statistically significant association was seen between median income and likelihood of severe disease on presentation (odds ratio with each increasing quintile 0.80;95% CI 0.66-0.96) as well as between median income and likelihood of severe disease overall (odds ratio with each increasing quintile 0.74;95% CI 0.59-0.93). Severe disease upon presentation to the emergency department was associated with a longer length of stay (3.6 days longer on average, p = 0.002) and an increased likelihood of death (odds ratio 3.6;95% CI 1.58-8.02). Conclusions: Lower socioeconomic status as measured by median household income for a person’s home zip code is associated with a higher rate of severe COVID-19 disease both on presentation to the emergency department and during their overall hospital course. For each 1-quintile increase in median household income, the odds of severe disease on presentation decreases by 20% (p = 0.018) and the odds of severe disease overall decreases by 26% (p = 0.009). Particular strengths of this data set include a large quantity of highly granular clinical data as well as a diverse population in both urban and rural settings. This data can better inform public health officials, medical professionals, and policymakers of the impact of socioeconomic status on vulnerability to disease and encourage progressive policy in providing vaccination and resources for these populations.","Enright, B.; Heise, C.

While some individuals remain nearly asymptomatic, others suffer from severe respiratory failure. It has been hypothesized that previous vaccinations for other pathogens, in particular tetanus, may provide protection against severe COVID-19. Methods: We made use of data on COVID-19 testing from 103,049 participants of the UK Biobank (mean age 71.5 years, 54.2% female), coupled to immunization records of the last ten years. Using logistic regression, covarying for age, sex, respiratory disease diagnosis, and socioeconomic status, we tested whether individuals vaccinated for tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis, differed from individuals that had only received other vaccinations on 1) undergoing a COVID-19 test, 2) the outcome of this test, and 3) whether they developed severe COVID-19. Results: We found that individuals with registered diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations were less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than people who had only received other vaccinations (diphtheria OR=0.46, p=3.6x10-4; tetanus OR=0.50, p=5.8x10-4). Discussion: These results indicate that a history of diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations is associated with less severe manifestations of COVID-19. These vaccinations may protect against severe COVID-19 symptoms by stimulating the immune system. We note the correlational nature of these results, yet the possibility that these vaccinations may influence the severity of COVID-19 warrants follow-up investigations.","Monereo-Sanchez, J.; Luykx, J.; Pinzon-Espinosa, J.

METHODS: We performed a descriptive and retrospective analysis of 41 diffuse glioma patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Confusion with or without fever was the most common neurological symptom (32%) supporting SARS-CoV2 testing in glioma patients with acute and unexplained confusion. Sixteen patients (39%) died after a median delay of 13 days. While multiple clinical, biological, and pathological features, COVID-19- or diffuse glioma-related, at hospital admission appeared to have a pejorative prognostic impact, none was significantly associated with death. Oncological treatments were interrupted at COVID-19 diagnosis and re-initiated with a median delay of 30 days after the end of COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, our retrospective study describes for the first time the characteristics of a cohort of diffuse glioma patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Diffuse glioma patients with poorly symptomatic COVID-19 did not come to the attention of physicians and were not enrolled in the study skewing the denominator for prognostic analysis.

These drugs block formation of the nodosome. The studies were prompted by the observation that infection of human fetal brain cells with Zika virus (ZIKV) induces expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a host factor that was found to promote ZIKV replication and spread. A drug that targets NOD2 was shown to have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses, alphaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Another drug that inhibits the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The broad-spectrum action of nodosome targeting drugs is mediated, at least in part, by enhancement of the interferon response. Together, these results suggest that further preclinical investigation of nodosome inhibitors as potential broad-spectrum antivirals is warranted.","Limonta, Daniel; Dyna-Dagman, Lovely; Branton, William; Makio, Tadashi; Wozniak, Richard W.; Power, Christopher; Hobman, Tom C.",bioRxiv,39,1

Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with survey participants’ self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents’ probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 1 000 000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, −0.03; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: −0.13 [95% CI, −0.15 to −0.11]; UK: −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants’ willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.","Kreps, Sarah; Prasad, Sandip; Brownstein, John S.; Hswen, Yulin; Garibaldi, Brian T.; Zhang, Baobao; Kriner, Douglas L.",JAMA Netw Open,39,20

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the Pakistani population’s attitude and preferences towards the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out through an online self-administered questionnaire from 27 September 2020 to 11 October 2020. A total of 883 people responded to the survey. The questionnaire included the participants’ socio-demographic variables, attitudes, beliefs towards the COVID-19 vaccine and acceptance and rejection of vaccination, and reasons for them. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the predictors for vaccine acceptance and willingness to pay for the vaccine. RESULTS: A majority (70.8%) of respondents will accept the COVID-19vaccine if available, and 66.8% showed a positive attitude towards vaccination. Monthly family income, education level, self-diagnosis of COVID-19 or a friend, family member, or colleague are significant factors influencing the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. The dogma of being naturally immune to COVID-19 was a key reason for the refusal of the vaccine. Less than half (48%) of those who refuse will vaccinate themselves if government officials have made it compulsory. A third (33.9%) of participants were willing to pay up to (7 USD) 1000 Pkr (Pakistani Rupees) for the vaccine. CONCLUSION: The population’s positive attitude should be improved by increasing awareness and eradicating false myths about vaccines through large-scale campaigns.

Despite immense potential, a viral siRNA efficacy prediction algorithm is still not available. Moreover, performances of the existing general mammalian siRNA efficacy predictors are not satisfactory for viral siRNAs. Therefore, we have developed “VIRsiRNApred” a support vector machine (SVM) based method for predicting the efficacy of viral siRNA. METHODS: In the present study, we have employed a new dataset of 1725 viral siRNAs with experimentally verified quantitative efficacies tested under heterogeneous experimental conditions and targeting as many as 37 important human viruses including HIV, Influenza, HCV, HBV, SARS etc. These siRNAs were divided into training (T(1380)) and validation (V(345)) datasets. Important siRNA sequence features including mono to penta nucleotide frequencies, binary pattern, thermodynamic properties and secondary structure were employed for model development. RESULTS: During 10-fold cross validation on T(1380) using hybrid approach, we achieved a maximum Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.55 between predicted and actual efficacy of viral siRNAs. On V(345) independent dataset, our best model achieved a maximum correlation of 0.50 while existing general siRNA prediction methods showed PCC from 0.05 to 0.18. However, using leave one out cross validation PCC was improved to 0.58 and 0.55 on training and validation datasets respectively. SVM performed better than other machine learning techniques used like ANN, KNN and REP Tree. CONCLUSION: VIRsiRNApred is the first algorithm for predicting inhibition efficacy of viral siRNAs which is developed using experimentally verified viral siRNAs. We hope this algorithm would be useful in predicting highly potent viral siRNA to aid siRNA based antiviral therapeutics development.

Here we describe how the pilot study of the Australian Epilepsy Project (AEP) has transitioned to tele-neuropsychology (teleNP), enabling continued safe operations during the pandemic. METHODS: The AEP includes adults (age 18-60) with a first unprovoked seizure, new diagnosis of epilepsy or drug resistant focal epilepsy. Shortly after launching the study, COVID-related restrictions necessitated adaptation to teleNP, including delivery of verbal tasks via videoconference; visual stimulus delivery via document camera; use of web-hosted, computerised assessment; substitution of oral versions for written tests; online delivery of questionnaires; and discontinuation of telehealth incompatible tasks. RESULTS: To date, we have completed 24 teleNP assessments: 18 remotely (participant in own home) and six on-site (participant using equipment at research facility). Five face-to-face assessments were conducted prior to the transition to teleNP. Eight of 408 tests administered via teleNP (1.9%) have been invalidated, for a variety of reasons (technical, procedural, environmental). Data confirm typical patterns of epilepsy-related deficits (p < .05) affecting processing speed, executive function, language and memory. Questionnaire responses indicate elevated rates of patients at high risk of mood (34%) and anxiety disorder (38%). CONCLUSION: Research teleNP assessments reveal a typical pattern of impairments in epilepsy. A range of issues must be considered when introducing teleNP, such as technical and administrative set up, test selection and delivery, and cohort suitability. TeleNP enables large-scale neuropsychological research during periods of social distancing (and beyond), and offers an opportunity to expand the reach and breadth of neuropsychological services.","Tailby, Chris; Collins, Alana J.; Vaughan, David N.; Abbott, David F.; O’Shea, Marie; Helmstaedter, Christoph; Jackson, Graeme D.",Seizure,39,1

RESULTS: The study showed active involvement of patients despite high clinical illness burden and disability, neurocognitive symptoms, childhood adverse experiences (ACE) and current life events. The study provided valuable knowledge regarding the feasibility of conducting a study in these patients that will inform future study phases. In the sample there were elevated levels of IL6, IL12, IL17A, IFNg, TNFa and VEGF-a, suggesting systemic low-grade inflammation. Also, microRNAs involved in inflammation and vascular inflammation were correlated with TNFa and VEGFa respectively, suggesting proof of concept for an epigenetic mechanism.

These policies often focus on specific activities or groups, rather than imposing the same limits across the board. In this Article, I consider the law and ethics of these policies, which I call tailored policies.In Part II, I identify two types of tailored policies: activity-based and group-based. Activity-based restrictions respond to differences in the risks and benefits of specific activities, such as walking outdoors and dining indoors. Group-based restrictions consider differences between groups with respect to risk and benefit. Examples are policies that treat children or senior citizens differently, policies that require travelers to quarantine when traveling to a new destination, and policies that treat individuals differently based on whether they have COVID-19 symptoms, have tested positive for COVID-19, have previous COVID-19 infection, or have been vaccinated against COVID-19. In Part III, I consider the public health law grounding of tailored policies in the principles of ""least restrictive means"" and ""well-targeting."" I also examine how courts have analyzed tailored policies that have been challenged on fundamental rights or equal protection grounds. I argue that fundamental rights analyses typically favor tailored policies and that equal protection does not preclude the use of tailored policies even when imperfectly crafted. In Part IV, I consider three critiques of tailored policies, centering on the claims that they produce inequity, cause harm, or unacceptably limit liberty. I argue that we must evaluate restrictions comparatively: the question is not whether tailored policies are perfectly equitable, wholly prevent harm, or completely protect liberty, but whether they are better than untailored ones at realizing these goals in a pandemic. I also argue that evaluation must consider indirect harms and benefits as well as direct and apparent ones.","Persad, Govind",Am J Law Med,39,1

A small proportion of children exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) or infected by Yersinia reproducibly develop principal symptoms of KD in various ethnic areas, but not in all studies. These microbes provoke a rapid cell‐damaging process, called ‘pyroptosis’, which is characterised by a subsequent release of proinflammatory cellular components from damaged endothelial and innate immune cells. In agreement with these molecular events, patients with KD show elevated levels of damage‐associated molecular patterns derived from cell death. In addition, an overwhelming amount of oxidative stress‐associated molecules, including oxidised phospholipids or low‐density lipoproteins, are generated as by‐products of inflammation during the acute phase of the disease. These molecules induce abnormalities in the acquired immune system and activate innate immune and vascular cells to produce a range of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, proteases and reactive oxygen species. These responses further recruit immune cells to the arterial wall, wherein inflammation and oxidative stress closely interact and mutually amplify each other. The inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system, plays an essential role in the development of vasculitis in KD. Thus, innate immune memory, or ‘trained immunity’, may promote vasculitis in KD. Hence, this review will be helpful in understanding the pathophysiologic pathways leading to the development of principal KD symptoms and coronary artery lesions in patients with KD, as well as in subsets of patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and Yersinia infections.","Hara, Toshiro; Yamamura, Kenichiro; Sakai, Yasunari",Clin Transl Immunology,39,16

However, only a small percentage of AYAs with OUD ever receive treatment. Further, among those that do receive treatment, a substantial proportion of patients continue to struggle with OUD, and many prematurely drop out of treatment. These challenges have only been heightened in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, but greater utilization of telehealth and mobile technologies by OUD patients may help counter these barriers, which ultimately may improve AYA OUD treatment in the postpandemic period. This viewpoint presents the perspective of a person in OUD recovery using online and mobile technology to support his own OUD recovery combined with thoughts from two clinicians supporting AYAs with OUD. Their perspectives may provide insights to help counter COVID-19–related consequences and offer clues to improving AYA OUD treatment in the long term.","Stull, Samuel W; McKnight, Erin R; Bonny, Andrea E",JMIR Pediatr Parent,39,24

En effet, ceux qui ont légalisé la drogue - le végétal - ont auparavant approuvé son emploi en thérapeutique, étape de « justification » qui semble incontournable. Il nous a donc paru opportun de rappeler les effets et les méfaits de la drogue dans le cadre de son usage récréatif. Les enquêtes en population générale réalisées en France depuis 25 ans par Santé publique France et l’Observatoire français des drogues et toxicomanies, permettent de suivre l’évolution de la consommation de substances psychoactives. Une attention toute particulière est portée aux usages de cannabis qui, dans un contexte de large diffusion depuis un quart de siècle n’ont cessé de progresser parmi les jeunes générations, mais également parmi les adultes plus âgés. La France est le pays européen dont la prévalence de consommation de cannabis est la plus élevée chez les jeunes et les adultes. En 25 ans, sa diffusion n’a cessé de s’étendre et le taux d’expérimentation a été pratiquement multiplié par 4. Estimé à 12,7 % en 1992, il atteint 44,8 % en 2017. De surcroît, en 2017, ce sont 25 % des usagers dans l’année de 18 à 64 ans qui présentent un risque élevé d’usage problématique ou de dépendance. Ce chiffre est inquiétant car il est en progression constante, il affecte 3 % des 18-64 ans, soit un peu plus d’un million de personnes. SUMMARY As the medical use of so called “therapeutic cannabis"" is in the process of being approved in France, the opening to its recreational use is the next logical step, as it has been always the chronology followed in all countries. Indeed, those who have legalized the drug have previously approved its therapeutic use. This 'justifying a project phase' stage seems unavoidable. Therefore, it is appropriate to recall the effects and misdeeds of the drug during its recreational use. The general population surveys carried out in France for 25 years by public health France and the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction, have followed the evolution of psychoactive substances consumption. Particular attention was focused on cannabis use, which, in a context of wide dissemination for a quarter of a century, rose steadily higher among younger generations, but also among older adults. France is the European country with the highest prevalence of cannabis use among young people and adults. Last 25 years, its diffusion has continued to expand, and the experimentation rate multiplied by near 4. Estimated at 12.7% in 1992, it reached 44.8% in 2017. Moreover, 25% of users in the year aged from 18 to 64 years old were at high risk of problematic use or dependence in 2017. This figure is worrying because it is constantly increasing; it affects 3% of 18-64-year-old, just over a million people.","Goullé, Jean-Pierre; Guerbet, Michel",Bull Acad Natl Med,39,24

METHODS: COVID-19-recovered patients, who had no previous underlying diseases and were discharged from Wuhan Union Hospital for 3 months, and matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this prospective cohort study. We examined the blood biochemical indicators, cytokines, lung computed tomography scans, including 39 HCs, 18 recovered asymptomatic (RAs), 34 recovered moderate (RMs), and 44 recovered severe/ critical patients (RCs). A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was employed to profile the global metabolites of fasting plasma of these participants. RESULTS: Clinical data and metabolomic profiles suggested that RAs recovered well, but some clinical indicators and plasma metabolites in RMs and RCs were still abnormal as compared with HCs, such as decreased taurine, succinic acid, hippuric acid, some indoles, and lipid species. The disturbed metabolic pathway mainly involved the tricarboxylic cycle, purine, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Moreover, metabolite alterations differ between RMs and RCs when compared with HCs. Correlation analysis revealed that many differential metabolites were closely associated with inflammation and the renal, pulmonary, heart, hepatic, and coagulation system functions. CONCLUSION: We uncovered metabolite clusters pathologically relevant to the recovery state in discharged COVID-19 patients which may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of potential organ damage in recovered patients.","Zhang, Shujing; Luo, Ping; Xu, Juanjuan; Yang, Lian; Ma, Pei; Tan, Xueyun; Chen, Qing; Zhou, Mei; Song, Siwei; Xia, Hui; Wang, Sufei; Ma, Yanling; Yang, Fan; Liu, Yu; Li, Yumei; Ma, Guanzhou; Wang, Zhihui; Duan, Yanran; Jin, Yang",J Inflamm Res,39,20

Most animal models that investigate this effect are based on prolonged isolation, which does not mimic the milder conditions experienced by people in the real world. We show that in adult male rats, acute social isolation causes social memory loss. This memory loss is accompanied by significant changes in the expression of specific mRNAs and proteins in the medial amygdala, a brain structure that is crucial for social memory. These changes particularly involve the neurotrophic signaling and axon guidance pathways that are associated with neuronal network remodeling. Upon regrouping, memory returns, and most molecular changes are reversed within hours. However, the expression of some genes, especially those associated with neurodegenerative diseases remain modified for at least a day longer. These results suggest that acute social isolation and rapid resocialization, as experienced by millions during the COVID-19 pandemic, are sufficient to induce significant changes to neuronal networks, some of which may be pathological.","Lavenda-Grosberg, Danit; Lalzar, Maya; Leser, Noam; Yaseen, Aseel; Malik, Assaf; Maroun, Mouna; Barki-Harrington, Liza; Wagner, Shlomo",Mol Psychiatry,39,16

This review approaches the sialylation of N-glycans from three perspectives. The first section focuses on the sialyltransferases that add sialic acid to N-glycans. Included in the discussion is a description of these enzymes’ glycan acceptors, conserved domain organization and sequences, molecular structure and catalytic mechanism. In addition, we discuss the protein interactions underlying the polysialylation of a select group of adhesion and signaling molecules. In the second section, the biosynthesis of sialic acid, CMP-sialic acid and sialylated N-glycans is discussed, with a special emphasis on the compartmentalization of these processes in the mammalian cell. The sequences and mechanisms maintaining the sialyltransferases and other glycosylation enzymes in the Golgi are also reviewed. In the final section, we have chosen to discuss processes in which sialylated glycans, both N- and O-linked, play a role. The first part of this section focuses on sialic acid-binding proteins including viral hemagglutinins, Siglecs and selectins. In the second half of this section, we comment on the role of sialylated N-glycans in cancer, including the roles of β1-integrin and Fas receptor N-glycan sialylation in cancer cell survival and drug resistance, and the role of these sialylated proteins and polysialic acid in cancer metastasis.","Bhide, Gaurang P.; Colley, Karen J.",Histochem Cell Biol,39,26

However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of 502 human-infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using the tRNA abundances across 23 human tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we build an in silico model of translational efficiency that validates the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. For instance, we detect that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is specifically adapted to the upper respiratory tract and alveoli. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins. The observed tissue-specific translational efficiency could be useful for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines.","Hernandez-Alias, Xavier; Benisty, Hannah; Schaefer, Martin H.; Serrano, Luis",Cell Rep,39,1

This study aims to provide preliminary information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases among students attending Italian schools. Methods Data are extracted and analysed from an open access, online dataset that monitor, on a daily basis, media news about SARS-CoV-2 infections of students attending Italian schools. Results As of 5 October 2020, a total of 1350 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been registered in the Italian territory schools (involving 1059 students, 145 teachers and 146 other school members), for a total of 1212 out of 65104 (1.8%) Italian schools involved. National schools reported only 1 case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in more than 90% of cases, and only in one high school a cluster of more than 10 cases have been described (P 0.015). The detection of one or more SARS-CoV-2 infections leaded to the closure of 192 (14.2%) entire schools, more frequently nursery/kindergartens (P <0.0005). Discussion Our preliminary data support low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within schools, at least among younger students. However, entire schools are frequently closed in the fear of larger outbreaks. Continuous monitoring of school settings, hopefully through daily updated open access datasets, are needed to better understand the impact of schools on the pandemic, and provide guidelines that better consider different risks within different age groups.","Buonsenso, D.; De Rose, C.; Moroni, R.; Valentini, P.",,39,28

Dental assistants (DAs) are at exceptionally high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to frequent and close patient contact and involvement in various high-risk dental procedures. This study aimed to investigate attitudes, stressors and work outcomes among DAs from all over Germany at the peak of cases in spring 2020. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression. SETTING: Dental, maxillofacial surgery and orthodontic practices across Germany, April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Participants aged 18 years and above and currently working as DAs in Germany. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A self-devised online questionnaire was employed comprising questions on SARS-CoV-2-related attitudes, stressors and work outcomes. Validated scales assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Among 1481 participating DAs (median age 35 years, 98.4% female, 91.8% working in dental practices), major stressors were uncertainty about the pandemic’s temporal scope (97.9% agreement, n=1450), uncertainty about one’s financial situation (87.8%, n=1301), uncertainty about how to act correctly (87.6%, n=1298) and thoughts about a possible infection during work (83.8%, n=1241). Forty-two per cent of DAs (n=622) felt sufficiently prepared for dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2. Only 17.5% (n=259) agreed that material for personal protection was sufficiently available. Multivariable logistic regression analyses suggested that working in a dental practice, compared with orthodontic and maxillofacial surgery practices, was significantly associated with uncertainty about one’s financial situation (OR 2.13 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.44)) and with the reported availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) (0.55 (0.36 to 0.84)). CONCLUSIONS: Training about correct behaviour of DAs during future infectious disease outbreaks is needed, especially for DAs working in dental practices. In the future, it will also be necessary to strengthen supply chains to ensure that PPE is sufficiently available in a timely manner.","Dreher, Annegret; Pietrowsky, Reinhard; Loerbroks, Adrian",BMJ Open,39,7

Although the majority of patients present with fever, dyspnea, cough, or myalgia, various signs and symptoms have been reported for this disease. Recently, neurological symptoms have been noticed in patients with COVID-19 with unknown etiology. However, the occurrence of strokes in young and middle aged patients with COVID-19 is not fully explained. METHODS: In this series, six patients younger than 55 years of age with diagnosis of stroke and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were evaluated for symptoms, lab data, imaging findings, and outcomes from March 2020 to the end of April 2020 from all stroke cases in a tertiary academic hospital. Patients older than 55 and all others who had evidence of cardiac abnormalities (arrhythmia/valvular) were excluded. RESULTS: Fever, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms noted in 66.66% (4/6), 66.66% (4/6), 50% (3/6), and 50% (3/6) of the patients, respectively. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for the patient was 10.16 ± 7.13 (ranged 5–24). The most involved area was middle cerebral artery (MCA) (five in MCA versus one in basal ganglia) and the majority of our patients had a low lung involvement score (mean ± SD: 13.16 ± 6.49 out of 24). Finally, one patient was deceased and rest discharged. CONCLUSION: Stroke may be unrelated to age and the extent of lung involvement. However, different factors may play roles in co-occurrence of stroke and COVID-19 and its outcome. Future studies with long-term follow-up and more cases are needed to assess prognostic factors.","Ashrafi, Farzad; Zali, Alireza; Ommi, Davood; Salari, Mehri; Fatemi, Alireza; Arab-Ahmadi, Mehran; Behnam, Behdad; Azhideh, Arash; Vahidi, Mohammad; Yousefi-Asl, Maryam; Jalili khoshnood, Reza; Advani, Soroor",Neurol Sci,39,3

Effective coping strategies likely reduce the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. This study aimed to (1) understand how COVID-19 stressors are related to different coping strategies and (2) identify whether coping strategies act as mechanisms accounting for the associations between COVID-19 stressful experiences and mental health problems in pregnancy. Participants were 304 pregnant women from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and perceived stress were assessed using validated measures. COVID-related stressors (i.e., financial difficulties, social isolation), subjective negative impact of COVID-19, and coping strategies used in response to COVID-19 were assessed by questionnaires. Results indicated that the subjective negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with more dysfunctional coping and less emotion-focused coping, whereas specific COVID-19 stressors, namely financial difficulties and social isolation, were associated with more dysfunctional coping and problem-focused coping. Dysfunctional coping was linked to elevated mental health problems and emotion-focused coping was linked to less mental health problems. Dysfunctional coping and emotion-focused coping partially mediated the effects of specific COVID-19 stressors on mental health outcomes. Findings indicate that coping is one pathway through which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts mental health in pregnancy. Supports and interventions for pregnant women during the pandemic should focus on bolstering coping skills, in order to minimize the mental health consequences of COVID-19.","Khoury, Jennifer E.; Atkinson, Leslie; Bennett, Teresa; Jack, Susan M.; Gonzalez, Andrea",Arch Womens Ment Health,39,33

However, some still contract SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination. This study identifies risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 14 days after first vaccination and describes characteristics of post-vaccination illness. Methods: Cases were UK adults reporting post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection between 8th December 2020 and 1st May 2021, reporting on the COVID Symptom Study app. We assessed the associations of age, frailty, comorbidity, area-level deprivation and lifestyle factors with infection (vaccinated cases vs. negative-vaccinated controls); and vaccination with illness profile (vaccinated cases vs positive-unvaccinated controls). Findings: Post-vaccination infection risk was substantially higher in older adults with frailty (OR= 2.78, 95% CI [1.98-3.89], p-value<0.0001) and in individuals living in most deprived areas (OR vs. intermediate group=1.22, 95%CI [1.04-1.43], p-value=0.01).

As many new strains emerge worldwide during the course of on-going pandemic, the chances of re-infection cannot be ignored as it may contribute to false negative RT-PCR test results. SARS-2-CoV though a novel virus, is phylogenetically similar to SARS-like CoV with around 79% similarity. Studies on immunological response to these infections suggest that antibodies formed after infection confers immunity only for a short period of time before it starts to wane. Also studies on SARS-CoV-2 suggest that antibody formation and longevity of immunity in an individual is dependent on the strain of coronavirus, its severity and age of the person infected.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these GI symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain elusive. Previous studies indicate that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal cells leads to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors resulting in impaired barrier function. While intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, the B0AT1/ACE2 complex within the intestinal epithelium acts as a regulator of gut microbiota composition and function. Alternations to the B0AT1/ACE2 complex lead to microbial dysbiosis through increased local and systemic immune responses. Previous studies have also suggested that altered serotonin metabolism may be the underlying cause of GI disorders involving diarrhea. The findings of elevated plasma serotonin levels and high fecal calprotectin in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea indicate that the viral infection evokes a systemic inflammatory response that specifically involves the GI. Interestingly, the elevated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with elevated serotonin and fecal calprotectin levels further supporting the evidence of GI inflammation, a hallmark of functional GI disorders. Moreover, the finding that rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after the nasopharynx clears the virus, suggests that viral replication and shedding from the GI tract may be more robust than that of the respiratory tract, further indicating fecal-oral transmission as another important route of viral spread. This review summarized the evidence for pathophysiological mechanisms (impaired barrier function, gut inflammation, altered serotonin metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis) underlying the GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19.","Jin, Byungchang; Singh, Rajan; Ha, Se Eun; Zogg, Hannah; Park, Paul J; Ro, Seungil",World J Gastroenterol,39,16

SOURCES OF DATA: We identified studies in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science and Google Scholar using keywords including ‘mindfulness’, ‘meditation’, and ‘review’, ‘meta-analysis’ or their variations. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MBIs are effective for improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, hypertension, weight control, cancer-related symptoms and prosocial behaviours. It is found to be beneficial in the healthcare settings, in schools and workplace but further research is warranted to look into its efficacy on different problems. MBIs are relatively safe, but ethical aspects should be considered. Mechanisms are suggested in both empirical and neurophysiological findings. Cost-effectiveness is found in treating some health conditions. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Inconclusive or only preliminary evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD, ADHD, ASD, eating disorders, loneliness and physical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. Furthermore, some beneficial effects are not confirmed in subgroup populations. Cost-effectiveness is yet to confirm for many health conditions and populations. GROWING POINTS: Many mindfulness systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate low quality of included studies, hence high-quality studies with adequate sample size and longer follow-up period are needed. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: More research is needed on online mindfulness trainings and interventions to improve biopsychosocial health during the COVID-19 pandemic; Deeper understanding of the mechanisms of MBIs integrating both empirical and neurophysiological findings; Long-term compliance and effects of MBIs; and development of mindfulness plus (mindfulness+) or personalized mindfulness programs to elevate the effectiveness for different purposes.","Zhang, Dexing; Lee, Eric K P; Mak, Eva C W; Ho, C Y; Wong, Samuel Y S",Br Med Bull,39,1

He was admitted to a hospital in Beijing for two months and then transferred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After multiple tests failed to identify the pathogen, single-cell sequencing (scS) was used to test the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Comparing the sequence obtained from single-cell sequencing with the reference database, it was found that the infection was caused by Cryptococcus gattii sensu stricto (AFLP4/VGI genotype). Cryptococcus is difficult to cultivate from complex body fluids. The etiological agent of this patient was identified and the patient was treated. This case is the first case in which scS was used to detect and identify fungal pathogen after conventional testing failed to identify the cause of the disease. This report demonstrates that the scS approach can be used to generate fungal genome sequences directly from the CSF of a CM patient. The scS technology could become a powerful tool to precise detect microscopically visible but uncultured pathogens in clinical samples.","Chen, Min; Hong, Nan; Hu, Shan; Wang, Peng; Guan, HongZhi; Xiao, Meng; Zhu, Xinlin; Al-Hatmi, Abdullah M.S.; Zhou, Zhe; Gao, Lei; Boekhout, Teun; Xu, Jianping; Xu, Yingchun; Liao, Wanqing; Yang, Ying",J Infect,39,15

METHODS: We searched Embase, Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv up to 22 June 2020. We included cohorts or cross-sectional studies which systematically tested populations regardless of symptoms for COVID-19, or case series of any size reporting contact investigations of asymptomatic index patients. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality using pre-specified criteria. Only moderate/high quality studies were included. The main outcomes were proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons at testing and through follow-up, and secondary attack rate among close contacts of asymptomatic index patients. A qualitative synthesis was performed. Where appropriate, data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis to estimate proportions and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of 6,137 identified studies, 71 underwent quality assessment after full text review, and 28 were high/moderate quality and were included. In two general population studies, the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection at time of testing was 20% and 75%, respectively; among three studies in contacts it was 8.2% to 50%. In meta-analysis, the proportion (95% CI) of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients was 95% (45% to 100%) of which 59% (49% to 68%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up; among nursing home residents, the proportion was 54% (42% to 65%) of which 28% (13% to 50%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up. Transmission studies were too heterogenous to meta-analyse. Among five transmission studies, 18 of 96 (18.8%) close contacts exposed to asymptomatic index patients were COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Despite study heterogeneity, the proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons appears high and transmission potential seems substantial. To further our understanding, high quality studies in representative general population samples are required.","Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Winters, Nicholas; Fregonese, Federica; Bastos, Mayara; Perlman-Arrow, Sara; Campbell, Jonathon R.; Menzies, Dick",PLoS One,39,30

Various ventilation systems have been employed in ORs to ensure an ultraclean environment. However, the effect ofdifferent ventilation systems on the control ofbacteria-carrying particles (BCPs) released from the surgical staff during surgery is unclear. In this study, the performance of four different ventilation systems (vertical laminar airflow ventilation (VLAF), horizontal laminar airflow ventilation (HLAF), differential vertical airflow ventilation (DVAF), and temperature-controlled airflow ventilation (TAF)) used in an OR was evaluated and compared based on the spatial BCP concentration. The airflow field in the OR was solved by the Renormalization Group (RNG) k-ε turbulence model, and the BCP phase was calculated by Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) and the discrete random walk (DRW) model. It was found that the TAF system was the most effective ventilation system among the four ventilation systems for ensuring air cleanliness in the operating area. This study also indicated that air cleanliness in the operating area depended not only on the airflow rate of the ventilation system but also on the airflow distribution, which was greatly affected by obstacles such as surgical lamps and surgical staff.","Liu, Zhijian; Liu, Haiyang; Yin, Hang; Rong, Rui; Cao, Guoqing; Deng, Qihong",Front Environ Sci Eng,39,21

Each viral RdRP contains a 500–600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven polymerase catalytic motifs are located in the RdRP palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRP and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Functional regions are often found fused to the RdRP catalytic module, resulting in a high level of diversity in RdRP global structure and regulatory mechanism. In this review, we surveyed all 46 RdRP-sequence available virus families of the positive-strand RNA viruses listed in the 2018b collection of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) and chose a total of 49 RdRPs as representatives. By locating hallmark residues in RdRP catalytic motifs and by referencing structural and functional information in the literature, we were able to estimate the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the catalytic module in these RdRPs, which in turn serve as reference points to predict additional functional regions beyond the catalytic module. Interestingly, a large number of virus families may have additional regions fused to the RdRP N-terminus, while only a few of them have such regions on the C-terminal side of the RdRP. The current knowledge on these additional regions, either in three-dimensional (3D) structure or in function, is quite limited. In the five RdRP-structure available virus families in the positive-strand RNA viruses, only the Flaviviridae family has the 3D structural information resolved for such regions. Hence, future efforts to solve full-length RdRP structures containing these regions and to dissect the functional contribution of them are necessary to improve the overall understanding of the RdRP proteins as an evolutionarily integrated group, and our analyses here may serve as a guideline for selecting representative RdRP systems in these studies.","Jia, Hengxia; Gong, Peng",Front Microbiol,39,22

Worldwide academic research on this topic has led to an explosion of scientific literature, never seen before. Bibliometrics provide methods to illustrate this exceptional phenomenon in academic publications. The objective of this paper is to analyze the Covid-19 research from a bibliometric perspective and to study the impact of the publication explosion on bibliometric indicators. The present study shows how an exceptional phenomenon has a disruptive impact on bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the Journal Impact Factor. The higher the specialization, the higher the possible impact of a disruptive phenomenon. In applied sciences, more important than the research or the discipline, the specific theme of the research is crucial for citations of articles and for their impact. The salience of the topic, the magnitude of the problem at study and the urgency to find solutions are drivers for citations. The study of the Covid-19 research illustrates the relativity of indicators and the need for context. The present study also confirms the plead for responsible metrics of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA).","Fassin, Yves",Scientometrics,39,26

More than 20 million people have already been infected by the virus. ACE2 is not only a functional receptor of COVID‐19 but also an important endogenous antagonist of the renin‐angiotensin system (RAS). A large number of studies have shown that ACE2 can reverse myocardial injury in various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as well as is exert anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, anti‐apoptotic and anticardiomyocyte fibrosis effects by regulating transforming growth factor beta, mitogen‐activated protein kinases, calcium ions in cells and other major pathways. The ACE2/angiotensin‐(1‐7)/Mas receptor axis plays a decisive role in the cardiovascular system to combat the negative effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II type 1 receptor axis. However, the underlying mechanism of ACE2 in cardiac protection remains unclear. Some approaches for enhancing ACE2 expression in CVDs have been suggested, which may provide targets for the development of novel clinical therapies. In this review, we aimed to identify and summarize the role of ACE2 in CVDs.","Zhu, Hanzhao; Zhang, Liyun; Ma, Yubo; Zhai, Mengen; Xia, Lin; Liu, Jincheng; Yu, Shiqiang; Duan, Weixun",J Cell Mol Med,39,3
