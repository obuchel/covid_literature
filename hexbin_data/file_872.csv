65488,[Metformin: one of the possible options to reduce the mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019?],2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Across Asia the brick-kiln industry is expanding. In Nepal, urban dwelling has increased in recent years, raising requirement for low-cost, mass produced bricks to meet the population needs. Working equids (WEs) play a key role in non-mechanised kilns. Assessing the welfare of these equids is the starting point to addressing concerns. In line with One Welfare principles, the health and welfare of animals, people and the kiln environment are interlinked. MATERIALS AND METHODS In December 2019, 119 WEs were assessed in seven brick kilns in three districts of Nepal, using the Equid Assessment Research and Scoping tool, developed by The Donkey Sanctuary. The objective was to measure welfare at the start of the brick kiln season. RESULTS Horses were the predominant species of WE. Hazardous housing and environments were seen in all kilns. Behaviour responses were mixed. Owner responses and animal examination indicated poor working conditions. Signs of harmful practice were evident in most animals. The majority were underweight, with poor general health, skin alterations and musculoskeletal issues. CONCLUSION The welfare of equids prior to starting brick kiln work is poor, posing significant concerns for the actual working period. Intervention to enhance health and welfare is required.","Rodrigues, Joao Brandao; Sullivan, Rebekah J E; Judge, Andrew; Norris, Stuart Lee; Burden, Faith A",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.106135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115919/,872
66191,COVID-19 and dermatological symptoms.,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND Approximately 35% of the North American population and an estimated 90% of the sub-Saharan African population have antibodies against adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) that are capable of neutralizing AdHu5-based vaccines. In mice, intranasal delivery of AdHu5 expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad) containing the genes for the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (ZGP) under the expressional control of a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (CMV)) can bypass systemic preexisting immunity, resulting in protection against mouse-adapted Zaire ebolavirus (Mayinga 1976). METHODS Guinea pigs administered an adenovirus-based Ebola virus vaccine either intramuscularly or intranasally in the presence of systemically or mucosally induced adenovirus immunity were challenged with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted Zaire ebolavirus (Mayinga 1976) (GA-ZEBOV). The humoral immune response was assayed to determine the effect of vaccine delivery route and preexisting immunity. RESULTS Intramuscular or intranasal vaccination fully protected guinea pigs against a lethal GA-ZEBOV challenge. However, intramuscular vaccination in animals with systemically induced preexisting immunity resulted in low survival following challenge. Interestingly, intranasal vaccination protected guinea pigs with systemic preexisting immunity to AdHu5. Mucosal adenoviral immunity induced by intranasal administration of AdHu5 decreased protection following intranasal vaccination with the first-generation but not with the second-generation vaccine. CONCLUSIONS Intranasal vaccination is an effective vaccine delivery route in the presence of systemic and, to a lower extent, mucosal preexisting immunity to the vaccine vector in guinea pigs.","Richardson, Jason S; Abou, Max C; Tran, Kaylie N; Kumar, Anand; Sahai, Beni M; Kobinger, Gary P",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jir332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21987739/,872

90833,[Effect of new simple breathing apparatus on oxygen therapy in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019].,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare the serious adverse risk of smoking versus diabetes co-morbid and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS We designed a cross-sectional, observational follow-up for 284 COVID-19 patients involved healthy patients, smoker, diabetic, and diabetic plus smoker recruited from the first of May 2020 to the twenty-fifth of June 2020. The clinical features, severity, duration and outcome of the disease were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 284 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 48 years (range 18-80), and 33.80% were female. Common symptoms included fever (85.56%), SOB (49.65%), cough (45.42%), and headache (40.86%). Patients with more than one co-morbidity (diabetes and smoking) presented as severe-critical cases comparing to healthy patients, diabetic, and smoker. Smokers presented in a lower rate of death in comparison to diabetic patients and diabetic + smoking, furthermore, smoking was less risky than diabetes. Although the mortality rate was high in patients with smoker comparing to healthy patients (4.22%, HR 1.358, 95% CI: 1.542-1.100, p= 0.014), it was less than diabetic (7.04%, HR 1.531, 95% CI: 1.668-1.337, p= 0.000), and diabetic plus smoker (10.00%, HR 1.659, 95% CI: 1.763-1.510, p= 0.000). CONCLUSION Multiple co-morbidity is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 disease progression and higher mortality rate. Smokers presented as mild cases comparing to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients, which presented as sever to critical cases. Although a higher death rate in smokers was seen compared to healthy patients, but are less probably comparing to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients. This article is protected by copyright.

93260,[Epidemiological characteristics of infection in COVID-19 close contacts in Ningbo city].,2020-05-10,"New York City (NYC) has emerged as the global epicenter for the COVID-19 pandemic. The NYC Public Health System (NYC Health +Hospitals, NYC H + H) was key to the city's response because its vulnerable patient population was disproportionately affected by the disease. As cases rose in the city, NYC H+H carried out plans to greatly expand critical care capacity. Primary ICU spaces were identified and upgraded as needed, while new ICU spaces were created in emergency departments (EDs), procedural areas, and other inpatient units. Patients were transferred between hospitals in order to reduce strain. Critical care staffing was supplemented by temporary recruits, volunteers, and military deployments. Supplies to deliver critical care were monitored closely and obtained as needed to prevent interruptions. An ED action team was formed to ensure that the experience of frontline providers was informing network level decisions. The steps taken by NYC H+H greatly expanded its capacity to provide critical care during an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in NYC. These steps, along with lessons learned, could inform preparations for other health systems during a primary or secondary surge of cases.

109704,[Logistic regression analysis of death risk factors of patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 and their predictive value].,2020-05-01,"Investor ownership of US health care has grown exponentially in the past 50 years through ever closer ties with Wall Street corporate interests. More recently, private equity firms have accelerated this process, invariably with harmful impacts on access to affordable care, its quality, and profiteering, with little accountability. These impacts are fueled by several concurrent trends: (1) increasing privatization, (2) consolidation and mergers, (3) increasing bureaucracy and waste, and (4) profiteering that may bleed into outright fraud. This article traces the uncontrolled growth of health care costs and prices in recent decades, together with documented examples across the health care delivery system whereby profit-driven, investor-owned interests have compromised patient care. These include hospitals, emergency care, nursing homes, mental health, and practices of such specialities as obstetrics-gynecology and ophthalmology. These practices have compromised patient care in the midst of a pandemic and economic downturn, as reflected by markers of a system needing reform. A larger role of government is called for, together with the advantages of Medicare for All in establishing health care as a human right, not a privilege based on ability to pay.","Geyman, John","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/00207314211015806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33988483/,872

After the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, this is the third outbreak of a highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) that the world has witnessed in the last 2 decades. Infection with highly pathogenic human CoVs often results in a severe respiratory disease characterized by a delayed and blunted interferon (IFN) response, accompanied by an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines. This indicates that CoVs developed effective mechanisms to overcome the host innate immune response and promote viral replication and pathogenesis. In this review, we describe the key innate immune signaling pathways that are activated during infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other well studied pathogenic CoVs. In addition, we summarize the main strategies that these viruses employ to modulate the host immune responses through the antagonism of IFN induction and effector pathways.","Kehrer, Thomas; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Miorin, Lisa",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.2021.0060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161170/,872

136188,[Clinical characteristics and risk factors of acute kidney injury in coronavirus disease 2019].,2020-04-01,"Background Community pharmacists play an important role in the wellness of patients, families and friends affected by prescription and illicit opioid drugs. They are key partners of the Community Based Naloxone (CBN) Program in Alberta and similar programs across other Canadian jurisdictions. This publicly funded program is an evidence-based response to the opioid overdose crisis, facilitating access to and distribution of naloxone kits through pharmacies. The study aimed to describe Alberta community pharmacists' practices, training, comfort levels and views in dispensing naloxone kits through the CBN program and detail potential perceived barriers to program participation. Methods The study was conducted as a cross-sectional online survey of Alberta pharmacists. Data collected from the survey were descriptive and evaluated using Microsoft Excel. Fisher exact tests were used to study the associations in responses among several demographic characteristics and related to dispensing practices, pharmacists' beliefs and perceived barriers. Results A total of 255 responses were included in the final analysis, with 89.8% of pharmacists replying ""yes"" to CBN program participation. Pharmacists on average were ""comfortable"" dispensing naloxone to patients for varying indications, with 85% reporting always providing education when dispensing naloxone to an individual for the first time. About 41% of pharmacists reported no barriers to the program, with the most common perceived barriers being lack of time (29%), demand (20%) and funding (19%). Conclusion Most community pharmacists who responded to the survey participate in the CBN program in Alberta. They held positive beliefs about their role in screening patients for the risk of opioid overdose and are confident in their abilities to recommend and educate on naloxone kits. Proactive screening appeared lower, however, and dispensing kits were potentially variable. Addressing factors such as time, funding for services and demand may help further pharmacist uptake and success of the program.

In this study we present evidence-based data on such effects, namely the increased number of drug findings in post-mortem investigations. All post-mortem toxicology cases positive for at least one of the following: buprenorphine, amphetamine, or cannabis, were investigated in the first 8 months of the year 2020 and the monthly numbers were compared to those in the previous 5 years from 2015-2019. These substances served as indicator analytes that could reveal changes in the drug using population. Right after the government restrictions came into force in March 2020, the numbers of buprenorphine, amphetamine and cannabis findings increased. The increase was most noticeable for amphetamine and was evident in all age groups. Our findings indicate that the assumptions on the increased risk of drug-related harm (including death) have become reality. Reduced access to harm-reduction services seems to have increased the mortality among individuals that use buprenorphine, amphetamine, or cannabis.

As a consequence nutritional requirements are not met, resulting in weight- and muscle loss, and malnutrition. The aim of the present study is to delineate nutritional complaints, the (course of the) nutritional status and risk of sarcopenia of COVID-19 patients, during hospitalisation and after discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational study in 407 hospital admitted COVID-19 patients in four university and peripheral hospitals, data were collected during dietetic consultations. Presence of nutrition related complaints (decreased appetite, loss of smell, changed taste, loss of taste, chewing and swallowing problems, nausea, vomiting, feeling of being full, stool frequency and consistency, gastric retention, need for help with food intake due to weakness and shortness of breath and nutritional status (weight loss, BMI, risk of sarcopenia with SARC-F &#8805;4 points) before, during hospital stay and after discharge were, where possible, collected. RESULTS: Included patients were most men (69%), median age of 64.8 ± 12.4 years, 60% were admitted to ICU at any time point during hospitalisation with a median LOS of 15 days and an in-hospital mortality rate of 21%. The most commonly reported complaints were: decreased appetite (58%), feeling of being full (49%) and shortness of breath (43%). One in three patients experienced changed taste, loss of taste and/or loss of smell. Prior to hospital admission, 67% of the patients was overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2), 35% of the patients was characterised as malnourished, mainly caused by considerable weight loss. Serious acute weight loss (>5 kg) was showed in 22% of the patents during the hospital stay; most of these patients (85%) were admitted to the ICU at any point in time. A high risk of sarcopenia (SARC-F &#8805; 4 points) was scored in 73% of the patients during hospital admission. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, one in five hospital admitted COVID-19 patients suffered from serious acute weight loss and 73% had a high risk of sarcopenia. Moreover, almost all patients had one or more nutritional complaints. Of these complaints, decreased appetite, feeling of being full, shortness of breath and changed taste and loss of taste were the most predominant nutrition related complaints. These symptoms have serious repercussions on nutritional status. Although nutritional complaints persisted a long time after discharge, only a small group of patients received dietetic treatment after hospital discharge in recovery phase. Clinicians should consider the risks of acute malnutrition and sarcopenia in COVID-19 patients and investigate multidisciplinary treatment including dietetics during hospital stay and after discharge.","Wierdsma, Nicolette J; Kruizenga, Hinke M; Konings, Lotte Aml; Krebbers, Daphne; Jorissen, Jolein Rmc; Joosten, Marie-Helene I; van Aken, Loes H; Tan, Flora M; van Bodegraven, Ad A; Soeters, Maarten R; Weijs, Peter Jm",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,872

329020,[Cardiac presentations in severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019],2021,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on children's mental health. Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context.

O artigo analisa o uso e a operacionalização do ciberespaço pela Administração Pública no combate ao SARS-CoV-2 e apresenta um diagnóstico das vulnerabilidades e desafios referentes a essa crescente operacionalização. A administração pública passou a operacionalizar o ciberespaço com mais afinco a partir da década de 1990, com o e-government. Estratégias de coordenação (inter)governamental impostas pela atual conjuntura seriam impossíveis sem a intensificação da operacionalização do ciberespaço pelo aparato administrativo público, que transpõe para o domínio digital práticas e ações pouco usuais ou mesmo inéditas. Dada sua artificialidade, o ciberespaço só pode ser operacionalizado por detentores de meios para tal. A ""democratização"" cibernética esbarra na exclusão digital. O atual isolamento social evidencia desafios técnicos e socioeconômicos decorrentes da transposição do aparato de administração pública para o ciberespaço.","Medeiros, Breno Pauli; Goldoni, Luiz Rogério Franco; Batista Junior, Eliezer; Rocha, Henrique Ribeiro da",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,872
414620,[Application of healthcare big data in active case finding of COVID-19 in Yinzhou district of Ningbo],2020,"Background and Purpose: “Target: Stroke Phase III” aims to improve stroke outcomes through the reduction of door-to-needle (DTN) times within 60 minutes in 85% of cases. After a recent data review, DTN times exceeded 60 minutes in the majority of alteplase (t-PA) cases at facilities monitored by our Telestroke (TS) program. With our TS nurses (RNs) being a unique resource to quickly assess Code Stroke patients and identify eligibility for t-PA we were able to implement an 'Alteplase Pre-Pull' protocol to instruct the bedside staff to pull t-PA and have it at bedside prior to the teleneurologist's assessment. Methods: Data was retrospectively collected from July-December 2019 (pre-mixed) and compared to data from January-June 2020 (pre-pulled). TS RNs were educated on pre-pull protocol titled “Less Than 3, Pull Me”. For patients presenting within three hours of symptom onset, TS RN would recommend bedside staff to pull t-PA and have at bedside: this would shave valuable minutes off DTN times if found to be t-PA eligible. TS RN would continue to assess for exclusions. Results: Significant improvements in DTN times due to pre-pulling t-PA. Average DTN time (total- 241 patients July-December 2019) improved from 57 minutes to 51 minutes (231 patients Jan-June 2020). Average DTN for pre-pulled patients decreased by 3 minutes from 51 to 48 minutes. Average door to activation decreased from 12 to 7 minutes. Conclusion: Pre-pulling t-PA using the “Less Than 3, Pull Me” protocol significantly reduced DTN times by 6 minutes from 57 to 51 minutes. Activation-to-needle decreased by 1 minute from 46 to 45 minutes indicating that early activation leads to faster DTN times. Early recognition of symptoms by bedside staff is essential to decreasing DTN times. The second half of this study took place amid the COVID-19 pandemic impacting bedside staff due to limited resources. In summary, pre-pulling t- PA has allowed us to shave 6 life-saving minutes off DTN times equating to 11.4 million neurons(Puig, 2018).","Snider, E.; Helms, A. M.",Stroke,,872

430734,Fatal pulmonary fibrosis: a post-COVID-19 autopsy case,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has caused a global outbreak which represents a major threat to global health. Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we reveal that pre-symptomatic transmission accelerates the onset of the exponential growth of cases. After that, we demonstrate that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces determines the number of cases reached during the peak of the epidemic. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.","Bouchnita, Anass; Jebrane, Aissam",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,872

520061,Use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy reduces progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe hypoxia,2020,"The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers saliva contact the lead transmission means of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Saliva droplets or aerosols expelled by heavy breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing may carry this virus. People in close distance may be exposed directly or indirectly to these droplets, especially those droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces and people may end up contracting COVID-19 after touching the mucosa tissue on their faces. It is of great interest to quickly and effectively detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an environment, but the existing methods only work in laboratory settings, to the best of our knowledge. However, it may be possible to detect the presence of saliva in the environment and proceed with prevention measures. However, detecting saliva itself has not been documented in the literature. On the other hand, many sensors that detect different organic components in saliva to monitor a person's health and diagnose different diseases that range from diabetes to dental health have been proposed and they may be used to detect the presence of saliva. This paper surveys sensors that detect organic and inorganic components of human saliva. Humidity sensors are also considered in the detection of saliva because a large portion of saliva is water. Moreover, sensors that detect infectious viruses are also included as they may also be embedded into saliva sensors for a confirmation of the virus' presence. A classification of sensors by their working principle and the substance they detect is presented. This comparison lists their specifications, sample size, and sensitivity. Indications of which sensors are portable and suitable for field application are presented. This paper also discusses future research and challenges that must be resolved to realize practical saliva sensors. Such sensors may help minimize the spread of not only COVID-19 but also other infectious diseases.","Dave, Priya Kishor; Rojas-Cessa, Roberto; Dong, Ziqian; Umpaichitra, Vatcharapan",Biosensors (Basel),,872
