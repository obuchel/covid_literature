91,91,91,Immune pathways and defence mechanisms in honey bees Apis mellifera,11.997442,6.9035053,2006-10-01,"Social insects are able to mount both group-level and individual defences against pathogens. Here we focus on individual defences, by presenting a genome-wide analysis of immunity in a social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera. We present honey bee models for each of four signalling pathways associated with immunity, identifying plausible orthologues for nearly all predicted pathway members. When compared to the sequenced Drosophila and Anopheles genomes, honey bees possess roughly one-third as many genes in 17 gene families implicated in insect immunity. We suggest that an implied reduction in immune flexibility in bees reflects either the strength of social barriers to disease, or a tendency for bees to be attacked by a limited set of highly coevolved pathogens.","Evans, J D; Aronstein, K; Chen, Y P; Hetru, C; Imler, J-L; Jiang, H; Kanost, M; Thompson, G J; Zou, Z; Hultmark, D",Insect Mol Biol,65,1
173,173,173,Patterns of Positive Selection in Six Mammalian Genomes,11.604918,7.147432,2008-08-01,"Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ∼16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.","Kosiol, Carolin; Vinař, Tomáš; da Fonseca, Rute R.; Hubisz, Melissa J.; Bustamante, Carlos D.; Nielsen, Rasmus; Siepel, Adam",PLoS Genet,65,1
257,257,257,A Microarray Based Approach for the Identification of Common Foodborne Viruses,11.91734,6.945932,2009-03-19,"An oligonucleotide array (microarray) incorporating 13,000 elements representing selected strains of hepatitis A virus (HAV), human coxsackieviruses A and B (CVA and CVB), genogroups I and II of Norovirus (NV), and human rotavirus (RV) gene segments 3,4,10, and 11 was designed based on the principle of tiling. Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy3-labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target. The results obtained with HAV and CV indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains. This represents a significant improvement over current methods for virus identification using PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing.","Ayodeji, Mobolanle; Kulka, Michael; Jackson, Scott A; Patel, Isha; Mammel, Mark; Cebula, Thomas A; Goswami, Biswendu B",Open Virol J,65,1
397,397,397,Immune Response to Lactobacillus plantarum Expressing Borrelia burgdorferi OspA Is Modulated by the Lipid Modification of the Antigen,11.995798,7.1336303,2010-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Over the past decade there has been increasing interest in the use of lactic acid bacteria as mucosal delivery vehicles for vaccine antigens, microbicides and therapeutics. We investigated the mechanism by which a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant lactic acid bacteria breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut in order to elicit a protective immune response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed how the lipid modification of OspA affects the localization of the antigen in our delivery vehicle using a number of biochemistry techniques. Furthermore, we examined how OspA-expressing L. plantarum breaks the oral tolerance of the gut by stimulating human intestinal epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte derived dendritic cells and measuring cytokine production. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. Mutation of the lipidation site in OspA redirects protein localization within the cell envelope. Further, we show that lipidated-OspA-expressing L. plantarum does not induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, as shown by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by human dendritic cells, and by the production of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Lipid modification of OspA expressed in L. plantarum modulates the immune response to this antigen through a Th1/Th2 immune response.","del Rio, Beatriz; Seegers, Jos F. M.

526,526,526,Differential Induction of Functional IgG Using the Plasmodium falciparum Placental Malaria Vaccine Candidate VAR2CSA,11.890981,6.675268,2011-03-25,"BACKGROUND: In Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemic areas placental malaria (PM) is an important complication of malaria. The recurrence of malaria in primigravidae women irrespective of acquired protection during childhood is caused by the interaction between the parasite-expressed VAR2CSA antigen and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space and lack of protective antibodies. PM impairs fetal development mainly by excessive inflammation processes. After infections during pregnancy women acquire immunity to PM conferred by antibodies against VAR2CSA. Ideally, a vaccine against PM will induce antibody-mediated immune responses that block the adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IE) in the placenta. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have previously shown that antibodies raised in rat against individual domains of VAR2CSA can block IE binding to CSA. In this study we have immunized mice, rats and rabbits with each individual domain and the full-length protein corresponding to the FCR3 VAR2CSA variant. We found there is an inherently higher immunogenicity of C-terminal domains compared to N-terminally located domains. This was irrespective of whether antibodies were induced against single domains or the full-length protein. Species-specific antibody responses were also found, these were mainly directed against single domains and not the full-length VAR2CSA protein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Binding inhibitory antibodies appeared to be against conformational B-cell epitopes. Non-binding inhibitory antibodies reacted highly against the C-terminal end of the VAR2CSA molecule especially the highly polymorphic DBL6ε domain. Differential species-specific induction of antibody responses may allow for more direct analysis of functional versus non-functional B-cell epitopes.","Pinto, Vera V.; Ditlev, Sisse B.; Jensen, Kamilla E.; Resende, Mafalda; Dahlbäck, Madeleine; Andersen, Gorm; Andersen, Pernille; Theander, Thor G.; Salanti, Ali; Nielsen, Morten A.",PLoS One,65,1
597,597,597,Milk Lacking α-Casein Leads to Permanent Reduction in Body Size in Mice,12.00348,6.9845195,2011-07-18,"The major physiological function of milk is the transport of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and minerals to mammalian offspring. Caseins, the major milk proteins, are secreted in the form of a micelle consisting of protein and calcium-phosphate. We have analysed the role of the milk protein α-casein by inactivating the corresponding gene in mice. Absence of α-casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium-phosphate, suggesting a role for α-casein in the establishment of casein micelles. In contrast, secretion of albumin, which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium, into milk is not reduced. The absence of α-casein also significantly inhibits transcription of the other casein genes. α-Casein deficiency severely delays pup growth during lactation and results in a life-long body size reduction compared to control animals, but has only transient effects on physical and behavioural development of the pups. The data support a critical role for α-casein in casein micelle assembly. The results also confirm lactation as a critical window of metabolic programming and suggest milk protein concentration as a decisive factor in determining adult body weight.","Kolb, Andreas F.; Huber, Reinhard C.; Lillico, Simon G.; Carlisle, Ailsa; Robinson, Claire J.; Neil, Claire; Petrie, Linda; Sorensen, Dorte B.; Olsson, I.

656,656,656,Use of Recombinant Adenovirus Vectored Consensus IFN-α to Avert Severe Arenavirus Infection,11.766871,6.8357625,2011-10-24,"Several arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease with case-fatality rates in hospitalized individuals ranging from 15-30%. Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens. Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-α) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal. However, while cIFN-α has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production. To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replication-deficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-α, for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters. Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichindé virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease. A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure. The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-α, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections. The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.","Gowen, Brian B.; Ennis, Jane; Russell, Andrew; Sefing, Eric J.; Wong, Min-Hui; Turner, Jeffrey",PLoS One,65,31

763,763,763,First Dating of a Recombination Event in Mammalian Tick-Borne Flaviviruses,11.965147,6.962679,2012-02-22,"The mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group (MTBFG) contains viruses associated with important human and animal diseases such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. In contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses where recombination events are frequent, the evolutionary dynamic within the MTBFG was believed to be essentially clonal. This assumption was challenged with the recent report of several homologous recombinations within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). We performed a thorough analysis of publicly available genomes in this group and found no compelling evidence for the previously identified recombinations. However, our results show for the first time that demonstrable recombination (i.e., with large statistical support and strong phylogenetic evidences) has occurred in the MTBFG, more specifically within the Louping ill virus lineage. Putative parents, recombinant strains and breakpoints were further tested for statistical significance using phylogenetic methods. We investigated the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a Bayesian framework. The recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of 282 to 76 years before the present. By unravelling the temporal setting of the event, we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account for the observed recombination.","Bertrand, Yann; Töpel, Mats; Elväng, Annelie; Melik, Wessam; Johansson, Magnus",PLoS One,65,1
852,852,852,Autophagy: More Than a Nonselective Pathway,11.746421,7.2472005,2012-05-15,"Autophagy is a catabolic pathway conserved among eukaryotes that allows cells to rapidly eliminate large unwanted structures such as aberrant protein aggregates, superfluous or damaged organelles, and invading pathogens. The hallmark of this transport pathway is the sequestration of the cargoes that have to be degraded in the lysosomes by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. The key actors mediating the biogenesis of these carriers are the autophagy-related genes (ATGs). For a long time, it was assumed that autophagy is a bulk process. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the capacity of this pathway to exclusively eliminate specific structures and thus better fulfil the catabolic necessities of the cell. We are just starting to unveil the regulation and mechanism of these selective types of autophagy, but what it is already clearly emerging is that structures targeted to destruction are accurately enwrapped by autophagosomes through the action of specific receptors and adaptors. In this paper, we will briefly discuss the impact that the selective types of autophagy have had on our understanding of autophagy.","Reggiori, Fulvio; Komatsu, Masaaki; Finley, Kim; Simonsen, Anne",Int J Cell Biol,65,8

The low lipophilicity of LYC made it hard to be dispersed into lipid nano-emulsions (LNEs). In order to increase its lipophilicity, lycorine-oleic acid ionic complex (LYC-OA) was made. M-LYC-OA-LNEs and uncoated lycorine-oleic acid loaded lipid nano-emulsions (LYC-OA-LNEs) were prepared by solvent injection method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size, polydispersity index, zeta-potential and entrapment efficiency analysis. The in vitro cellular uptake and growth inhibition activity studies were performed on A549 cell lines. The entrapment efficiency of M-LYC-OA-LNEs was 82.7 ± 1.6 %. The cellular uptake study showed that coated LNEs were preferably taken up by A549 cells than uncoated LNEs. The effective test by MTT assay showed better growth inhibition activity of M-LYC-OA-LNEs on A549 cell lines when compared with LYC-OA-LNEs and blank LNEs. These results demonstrated that M-LYC-OA-LNEs could be a promising formulation for tumor targeting delivery of LYC with the potential of being applied in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.","Guo, Yangming; Liu, Xing; Sun, Xun; Zhang, Qiang; Gong, Tao; Zhang, Zhirong",Theranostics,65,8

A total of 240 explants were used. The tissues were examined using the Hematoxylin & Eosin technique. Then, semithin sections (0.5 μm) were stained with toluidine blue and examined with indirect immunoperoxidase (IPI) and lectin histochemistry. The most frequent and statistically significant findings were as follows: (1) cell death and increased goblet cell activity when exposed to bacteria and (2) cell death, cytoplasmic vacuolation and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes when exposed to LPS. The lesions induced by the bacterium were more severe than with LPS alone, except for the cytoplasmic vacuolation in epithelial cells. IPI stained the ciliated border of the epithelium with the bacterium more intensely, while LPS lectin histochemistry preferentially labeled the cytoplasm of goblet cell. These data indicate that B. bronchiseptica and its LPS may have an affinity for specific glycoproteins that would act as adhesion receptors in both locations.","Gallego, Carolina; Middleton, Andrew M.; Martínez, Nhora; Romero, Stefany; Iregui, Carlos",Vet Med Int,65,22
1128,1128,1128,Systems Analysis of a RIG-I Agonist Inducing Broad Spectrum Inhibition of Virus Infectivity,11.9493065,6.985544,2013-04-25,"The RIG-I like receptor pathway is stimulated during RNA virus infection by interaction between cytosolic RIG-I and viral RNA structures that contain short hairpin dsRNA and 5′ triphosphate (5′ppp) terminal structure. In the present study, an RNA agonist of RIG-I was synthesized in vitro and shown to stimulate RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses at concentrations in the picomolar range. In human lung epithelial A549 cells, 5′pppRNA specifically stimulated multiple parameters of the innate antiviral response, including IRF3, IRF7 and STAT1 activation, and induction of inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes - hallmarks of a fully functional antiviral response. Evaluation of the magnitude and duration of gene expression by transcriptional profiling identified a robust, sustained and diversified antiviral and inflammatory response characterized by enhanced pathogen recognition and interferon (IFN) signaling. Bioinformatics analysis further identified a transcriptional signature uniquely induced by 5′pppRNA, and not by IFNα-2b, that included a constellation of IRF7 and NF-kB target genes capable of mobilizing multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response. Treatment of primary PBMCs or lung epithelial A549 cells with 5′pppRNA provided significant protection against a spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses. In C57Bl/6 mice, intravenous administration of 5′pppRNA protected animals from a lethal challenge with H1N1 Influenza, reduced virus titers in mouse lungs and protected animals from virus-induced pneumonia. Strikingly, the RIG-I-specific transcriptional response afforded partial protection from influenza challenge, even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. This systems approach provides transcriptional, biochemical, and in vivo analysis of the antiviral efficacy of 5′pppRNA and highlights the therapeutic potential associated with the use of RIG-I agonists as broad spectrum antiviral agents.","Goulet, Marie-Line; Olagnier, David; Xu, Zhengyun; Paz, Suzanne; Belgnaoui, S.

In this study, we conducted a systematic study of the immune response against influenza virus infection following immunization with recombinant HA proteins expressed in insect (Sf9) cells, insect cells that contain exogenous genes for elaborating N-linked glycans (Mimic) and mammalian cells (CHO). While the antibody titers are higher with the insect cell derived HA proteins, the neutralization and HA inhibition titers are much higher with the mammalian cell produced HA proteins.

Here, we reported a new designed nanoparticle system through incorporating anionic liposomes (AL) into chitosan/DNA (CS/DNA) complexes. With enhanced cellular uptake, the constructed AL/CS/DNA nanoparticles can deliver the anti-caries DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX into nasal mucosa. TEM results showed the AL/CS/DNA had a spherical structure. High DNA loading ability and effective DNA protection against nuclease were proved by gel electrophoresis. The surface charge of the AL/CS/DNA depended strongly on pH environment, enabling the intracellular release of loaded DNA via a pH-mediated manner. In comparison to the traditional CS/DNA system, our new design rendered a higher transfection efficiency and longer residence time of the AL/CS/DNA at nasal mucosal surface. These outstanding features enable the AL/CS/DNA to induce a significantly (p<0.01) higher level of secretory IgA (SIgA) than the CS/DNA in animal study, and a longer-term mucosal immunity. On the other hand, the AL/CS/DNA exhibited minimal cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the developed nanoparticles offer a potential platform for DNA vaccine packaging and delivery for more efficient elicitation of mucosal immunity.","Chen, Liulin; Zhu, Junming; Li, Yuhong; Lu, Jie; Gao, Li; Xu, Huibi; Fan, Mingwen; Yang, Xiangliang",PLoS One,65,1
1261,1261,1261,Vesicular Transport of Progeny Parvovirus Particles through ER and Golgi Regulates Maturation and Cytolysis,11.879597,7.230134,2013-09-19,"Progeny particles of non-enveloped lytic parvoviruses were previously shown to be actively transported to the cell periphery through vesicles in a gelsolin-dependent manner. This process involves rearrangement and destruction of actin filaments, while microtubules become protected throughout the infection. Here the focus is on the intracellular egress pathway, as well as its impact on the properties and release of progeny virions. By colocalization with cellular marker proteins and specific modulation of the pathways through over-expression of variant effector genes transduced by recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, we show that progeny PV particles become engulfed into COPII-vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Besides known factors like sar1, sec24, rab1, the ERM family proteins, radixin and moesin play (an) essential role(s) in the formation/loading and targeting of virus-containing COPII-vesicles. These proteins also contribute to the transport through ER and Golgi of the well described analogue of cellular proteins, the secreted Gaussia luciferase in absence of virus infection. It is therefore likely that radixin and moesin also serve for a more general function in cellular exocytosis. Finally, parvovirus egress via ER and Golgi appears to be necessary for virions to gain full infectivity through post-assembly modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). While not being absolutely required for cytolysis and progeny virus release, vesicular transport of parvoviruses through ER and Golgi significantly accelerates these processes pointing to a regulatory role of this transport pathway.","Bär, Séverine; Rommelaere, Jean; Nüesch, Jürg P.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sample from the BV patient underwent total RNA extraction, followed by physical subtraction of human rRNA and whole transcriptome amplification. The metatranscriptome was sequenced using Roche 454 titanium chemistry. The bioinformatics pipeline MG-RAST and desktop DNA analysis platforms were utilised to analyse results. Bacteria of the genus Prevotella (predominately P. amnii) constituted 36% of the 16S rRNA reads, followed by Megasphaera (19%), Leptotrichia/Sneathia (8%) and Fusobacterium (8%). Comparison of the abundances of several bacteria to quantitative PCR (qPCR) screening of extracted DNA revealed comparable relative abundances. This suggests a correlation between what was present and transcriptionally active in this sample: however distinct differences were seen when compared to the microbiome determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. To assess the presence of P. amnii in a larger pool of samples, 90 sexually active women were screened using qPCR. This bacterium was found to be strongly associated with BV (P<0.001, OR 23.3 (95%CI:2.9–190.7)) among the 90 women.

We applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics combined with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture to identify proteins rapidly phosphorylated in response to GH in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. We identified 132 phosphosites in 95 proteins that exhibited rapid (5 or 15 min) GH-dependent statistically significant increases in phosphorylation by more than or equal to 50% and 96 phosphosites in 46 proteins that were down-regulated by GH by more than or equal to 30%. Several of the GH-stimulated phosphorylation sites were known (e.g. regulatory Thr/Tyr in Erks 1 and 2, Tyr in signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and 5b, Ser939 in tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) 2 or tuberin). The remaining 126 GH-stimulated sites were not previously associated with GH. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of GH-stimulated sites indicated enrichment in proteins associated with the insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesions. Akt/protein kinase A consensus sites (RXRXXS/T) were the most commonly phosphorylated consensus sites. Immunoblotting confirmed GH-stimulated phosphorylation of all seven novel GH-dependent sites tested [regulatory sites in proline-rich Akt substrate, 40 kDA (PRAS40), regulatory associated protein of mTOR, ATP-citrate lyase, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-1, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1, and Shc]). The immunoblot results suggest that many, if not most, of the GH-stimulated phosphosites identified in this large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis, including sites in multiple proteins in the Akt/ mTOR complex 1 pathway, are phosphorylated in response to GH.

Compared with the MPP(+)-treated cells, GA markedly improved cell viability, restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed the overexpression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and suppressed the overproduction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular Ca(2+) overload. The protective effects of GA on cell survival were further confirmed in primary cortical neurons. GA markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), as well as its migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, blocked GA-enhanced ERK activation and reduced cell viability. However, pre-treatment with GA had no effects on the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (t-AKT). These results indicate that the GA-mediated neuroprotective effects are associated with its modulation of multiple anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, particularly the ERK signaling pathway. This study provides evidence supporting the use of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal injury.","TENG, LESHENG; KOU, CHUNJIA; LU, CHENGYU; XU, JIAMING; XIE, JING; LU, JIAHUI; LIU, YAN; WANG, ZHENZUO; WANG, DI",Int J Mol Med,65,22

We used a microarray-based system that warrants high throughput and easy handling. Seven immunogenic candidates were selected after screening. Comparative analyses by ELISA and microarrays manifested their immunodominant character. The large repetitive protein (SEN4030) that plays a role as a putative adhesin in initial cell surface interaction and is highly specific to Salmonella is considered to be the most suitable protein for a diagnostic approach. The results further demonstrate that the strategy applied herein is convenient for specifically identifying immunogenic proteins of pathogenic microorganisms. Consequently, it enables a sound assessment of promising candidates for diagnostic applications and vaccine development. Moreover, the elucidation of immunogenic proteins may assist in unveiling unknown virulence-associated factors, thus furthering the understanding of the underlying pathogenicity of Salmonella in general, and of S. Enteritidis, one of the most frequently detected serovars of this pathogen, in particular.

Using Xenopus laevis egg extract, we found that increases in cytosolic calcium lead to the activation of an endogenous ribonuclease, XendoU. A fraction of XendoU localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is required for nuclear envelope assembly and ER network formation in a catalysis-dependent manner. Using a purified vesicle fusion assay, we show that XendoU functions on the surface of ER membranes to promote RNA cleavage and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) removal. Additionally, RNA removal from the surface of vesicles by RNase treatment leads to increased ER network formation. Using human tissue culture cells, we found that hEndoU localizes to the ER, where it promotes the formation of ER tubules in a catalysis-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that calcium-activated removal of RNA from membranes by XendoU promotes and refines ER remodeling and the formation of tubular ER.","Schwarz, Dianne S.; Blower, Michael D.",J Cell Biol,65,8

PROCEDURES: Proteins expressed in the islets of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) with extensive insulitis were identified by laser-capture microdissection mass spectrometry using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues. RESULTS: Thirty-eight proteins were identified solely in FT1DM islets, most of which have not been previously linked to type 1 diabetes. Five protein-protein interacting clusters were identified, and the cellular localization of selected proteins was validated immunohistochemically. Migratory activity-related proteins, including plastin-2 (LCP1), moesin (MSN), lamin-B1 (LMNB1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1) and others, were identified in CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages infiltrated to inflamed FT1DM islets. Proteins involved in successive signaling in innate/adaptive immunity were identified, including SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1), proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1), HLA class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA-C), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1). Angiogenic (thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP)) and anti-angiogenic (tryptophan-tRNA ligase (WARS)) factors were identified in migrating CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages. Proteins related to virus replication and cell proliferation, including probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 5 (DDX5) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH1), were identified. The anti-apoptotic protein T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5), the anti-oxidative enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PDG), and the anti-viral and anti-apoptotic proteins serpin B6 (SERPINB6) and heat shock 70 kDa protein1-like (HSPA1L), were identified in FT1DM-affected islet cells. CONCLUSION: The identified FT1DM-characterizing proteins include those involved in aggressive beta cell destruction through massive immune cell migration and proteins involved in angiogenesis and islet vasculature bleeding, cell repair, and anti-inflammatory processes. Several target proteins for future type 1 diabetes interventions were identified.","Nishida, Yoriko; Aida, Kaoru; Kihara, Makoto; Kobayashi, Tetsuro",PLoS One,65,1

Data showed that the cell lines stably expressed TMPRSS2 and MSPL after 20 serial passages. Both MDCK-TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MSPL could proteolytically cleave the HA of Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 and supported high-titer growth of the vaccine without exogenous trypsin. Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 efficiently infected and replicated within MDCK-TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MSPL cells and viral titer were comparable to the virus grown in MDCK cells with TPCK-trypsin. Thus, our results indicate a potential application for these cell lines in cell-based influenza vaccine production and may serve as a useful tool for HA proteolytic cleavage-related studies.","Wen, Zhiyuan; Wu, Chao; Chen, Weiye; Zeng, Xianying; Shi, Jianzhong; Ge, Jinying; Chen, Hualan; Bu, Zhigao",Biotechnol Res Int,65,8

The importance of keeping rDNA transcription under tight control is reflected by the fact that deranged Pol I transcription is a feature of cancer and other human disorders. In this review, we discuss multiple aspects of rDNA function including the relationship between Pol I transcription and proliferative capacity, the role of Pol I transcription in mediating nucleolar structure and integrity, and rDNA/nucleolar interactions with the genome and their influence on heterochromatin and global genome stability. Furthermore, we discuss how perturbations in the structure of the rDNA loci might contribute to human disease, in some cases independent of effects on ribosome biogenesis.","Diesch, Jeannine; Hannan, Ross D; Sanij, Elaine",Cell Biosci,65,8
1852,1852,1852,Alternative Antigen Processing for MHC Class I: Multiple Roads Lead to Rome,11.712163,6.8396096,2015-06-05,"The well described conventional antigen-processing pathway is accountable for most peptides that end up in MHC class I molecules at the cell surface. These peptides experienced liberation by the proteasome and transport by the peptide transporter TAP. However, there are multiple roads that lead to Rome, illustrated by the increasing number of alternative processing pathways that have been reported during last years. Interestingly, TAP-deficient individuals do not succumb to viral infections, suggesting that CD8 T cell immunity is sufficiently supported by alternative TAP-independent processing pathways. To date, a diversity of viral and endogenous TAP-independent peptides have been identified in the grooves of different MHC class I alleles. Some of these peptides are not displayed by normal TAP-positive cells and we therefore called them TEIPP, for “T-cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing.” TEIPPs are hidden self-antigens, are derived from normal housekeeping proteins, and are processed via unconventional processing pathways. Per definition, TEIPPs are presented via TAP-independent pathways, but recent data suggest that part of this repertoire still depend on proteasome and metalloprotease activity. An exception is the C-terminal peptide of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane-spanning ceramide synthase Trh4 that is surprisingly liberated by the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), the proteolytic enzyme involved in cleaving leader sequences. The intramembrane cleaving SPP is thereby an important contributor of TAP-independent peptides. Its family members, like the Alzheimer’s related presenilins, might contribute as well, according to our preliminary data. Finally, alternative peptide routing is an emerging field and includes processes like the unfolded protein response, the ER-associated degradation, and autophagy-associated vesicular pathways. These data convince us that there is a world to be discovered in the field of unconventional antigen processing.","Oliveira, Cláudia C.; van Hall, Thorbald",Front Immunol,65,1

Active ionizer prevented 100% (4/4) of guinea pigs from infection. Moreover, the device effectively captured airborne transmitted calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus, with recovery rates up to 21% after 40 min in a 19 m(3) room. The ionizer generates negative ions, rendering airborne particles/aerosol droplets negatively charged and electrostatically attracts them to a positively charged collector plate. Trapped viruses are then identified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. The device enables unique possibilities for rapid and simple removal of virus from air and offers possibilities to simultaneously identify and prevent airborne transmission of viruses.","Hagbom, Marie; Nordgren, Johan; Nybom, Rolf; Hedlund, Kjell-Olof; Wigzell, Hans; Svensson, Lennart",Sci Rep,65,28

Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies.

IFNs inhibit rhabdovirus replication at different stages via the induction of a variety of ISGs. This review will discuss how individual ISG products confer resistance to rhabdoviruses by blocking viral entry, degrading single stranded viral RNA, inhibiting viral translation or preventing release of virions from the cell.

DNA and enzymes are used as simple artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system which responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of reactions can function in a manner which is superficially similar to the most basic responses of the vertebrate acquired immune system, including reaction sequences that mimic both humoral and cellular responses. As such, AIRS provides guidelines for the design and engineering of artificial reaction networks and molecular devices.","Han, Da; Wu, Cuichen; You, Mingxu; Zhang, Tao; Wan, Shuo; Chen, Tao; Qiu, Liping; Zheng, Zheng; Liang, Hao; Tan, Weihong",Nat Chem,65,1

The rs368234815-ΔG allele is strongly associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we further explored the biological function of IFN-λ4 expressed in human hepatic cells—a hepatoma cell line HepG2 and fresh primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). We performed live confocal imaging, cell death and proliferation assays, mRNA expression profiling, protein detection, and antibody blocking assays using transient and inducible stable in vitro systems. Not only did we observe significant intracellular retention of IFN-λ4 but also detected secreted IFN-λ4 in the culture media of expressing cells. Secreted IFN-λ4 induced strong activation of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in IFN-λ4-expressing and surrounding cells in transwell assays. Specifically, in PHHs, secreted IFN-λ4 induced expression of the CXCL10 transcript and a corresponding pro-inflammatory chemokine, IP-10. In IFN-λ4-expressing HepG2 cells, we also observed decreased proliferation and increased cell death. All IFN-λ4-induced phenotypes—activation of ISGs, decreased proliferation, and increased cell death—could be inhibited by an anti-IFN-λ4-specific antibody.

In this study, we assessed Actinidia deliciosa leaves inoculated with two doses of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae during a period of 13 days for the expression profile of nine candidate RGs. Their expression stability was calculated using four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the deltaCt method. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were the most stable genes, while β-tubulin and 7s-globulin were the less stable. Expression analysis of three target genes, chosen for RGs validation, encoding the reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) indicated that a combination of stable RGs, such as GAPDH and PP2A, can lead to an accurate quantification of the expression levels of such target genes. The APX level varied during the experiment time course and according to the inoculum doses, whereas both SOD and CAT resulted down-regulated during the first four days, and up-regulated afterwards, irrespective of inoculum dose. These results can be useful for better elucidating the molecular interaction in the A. deliciosa/P. s. pv. actinidiae pathosystem and for RGs selection in bacteria-plant pathosystems.","Petriccione, Milena; Mastrobuoni, Francesco; Zampella, Luigi; Scortichini, Marco",Sci Rep,65,1

Up-regulation of TGF-β in serum/peritoneal fluid and increased levels of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 in endometriotic tissues are frequently observed in patients with endometriosis. However, the mechanisms underlying how TGF-β/TGF-β receptor and OCT4 affect endometriotic cell migration still remain largely unknown. Therefore, endometriotic tissue with high cell migratory capacity were collected from patients with adenomyotic myometrium (n = 23) and chocolate cyst (n = 24); and endometrial tissue with low cell migratory capacity in normal endometrium or hyperplastic endometrium (n = 8) were collected as the controls. We found the mRNA levels of TGF-β receptor I (TGF-β RI) and OCT4 were significantly higher in the high-migratory ectopic endometriotic tissues than those of the low-migratory normal or hyperplastic endometrium. Positive correlations between TGF-β RI and OCT4, and either TGF-β RI or OCT4 with migration-related genes (SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST) regarding the mRNA levels were observed in human endometriotic tissues. TGF-βI dose-dependently increased the gene and protein levels of OCT4, SNAIL and N-Cadherin (N-CAD) and silencing of endogenous OCT4 significantly suppressed the TGF-βI-induced expressions of N-CAD and SNAIL in primary human endometriotic stromal cells and human endometrial carcinoma cell lines RL95-2 and HEC1A. Furthermore, TGF-βI significantly increased the migration ability of endometriotic cells and silencing of OCT4 dramatically suppressed the TGF-βI-induced cell migration activity evidenced by wound-closure assay, transwell assay, and confocal image of F-actin cellular distribution. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that the niche TGF-β plays a critical role in initiating expressions of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 which may contribute to the ectopic endometrial growth by stimulating endometrial cell migration. These findings would be useful for developing therapeutic strategies targeting TGF-β-OCT4 signaling to prevent endometriosis in the future.","Au, Heng-Kien; Chang, Jui-Hung; Wu, Yu-Chih; Kuo, Yung-Che; Chen, Yu-Hsi; Lee, Wei-Chin; Chang, Te-Sheng; Lan, Pei-Chi; Kuo, Hung-Chih; Lee, Kha-Liang; Lee, Mei-Tsu; Tzeng, Chii-Ruey; Huang, Yen-Hua",PLoS One,65,8

These prophylactics have been used for centuries but still to this day only three main design strategies exist: (1) live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccines, (2) killed or inactivated virus vaccines, (3) and subunit vaccines of the three, the most efficacious vaccines remain LAVs. LAVs replicate in relevant tissues, elicit strong cellular and humoral responses, and often confer lifelong immunity. While this vaccine strategy has produced the majority of successful vaccines in use today, there are also important safety concerns to consider with this approach. In the past, the development of LAVs has been empirical. Blind passage of viruses in various cell types results in the accumulation of multiple attenuating mutations leaving the molecular mechanisms of attenuation unknown. Also, due to the high error rate of RNA viruses and selective pressures of the host environment, these LAVs, derived from such viruses, can potentially revert back to wild-type virulence. This not only puts the vaccinee at risk, but if shed can put those that are unvaccinated at risk as well. While these vaccines have been successful there still remains a need for a rational design strategy by which to create additional LAVs. One approach for rational vaccine design involves increasing the fidelity of the viral RdRp. Increased fidelity decreases the viral mutational frequency thereby reducing the genetic variation the virus needs in order to evade the host imposed bottlenecks to infection. While polymerase mutants exist which decrease viral mutation frequency the mutations are not in conserved regions of the polymerase, which doesn’t lend itself toward using a common mutant approach toward developing a universal vaccine strategy for all RNA viruses. We have identified a conserved lysine residue in the active site of the PV RdRp that acts as a general acid during nucleotide incorporation. Mutation from a lysine to an arginine results in a high fidelity polymerase that replicates slowly thus creating an attenuated virus that is genetically stable and less likely to revert to a wild-type phenotype. This chapter provides detailed methods in which to identify the conserved lysine residue and evaluating fidelity and attenuation in cell culture (in vitro) and in the PV transgenic murine model (in vivo).","Lee, Cheri A.; August, Avery; Arnold, Jamie J.; Cameron, Craig E.",Vaccine Technologies for Veterinary Viral Diseases,65,1

Many DEGs associated with protein metabolism, cytoskeleton, and apoptosis may be involved in the host response to BmNPV infection. Moreover, some immunity related genes were also altered following BmNPV infection. Specifically, after removing genetic background and individual immune stress response genes, 22 genes were found to be potentially involved in repressing BmNPV infection. These genes were related to transport, virus replication, intracellular innate immune, and apoptosis.

Various single and double mutations were constructed on its phosphorylation sites to mimic different degrees of phosphorylation. Size exclusion chromatography of wild-type Vpu and mutants indicated that the smallest assembly unit of Vpu was a dimer and over time Vpu formed higher oligomers. The rate of oligomerization increased when (i) the degree of phosphorylation at serines 52 and 56 was decreased and (ii) when the ionic strength was increased indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu affects oligomerization. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations with models of wild-type and mutant Vpu in a hydrated lipid bilayer supported the experimental data in demonstrating that, in addition to a previously known role in downregulation of host factors, the phosphorylation sites of Vpu also modulate oligomerization.","Chen, Chin-Pei; Lin, Meng-Han; Chan, Ya-Ting; Chen, Li-Chyong; Ma, Che; Fischer, Wolfgang B.",Sci Rep,65,1

Our group has previously demonstrated the protective capacity of a vaccine against this parasite based on a native activation-associated secreted protein ASP1 (nASP) in combination with the saponin adjuvant QuilA. The aim of the current study was to analyse the effect of both antigen and adjuvant on the cellular and humoral vaccine-induced immune responses by comparing the native ASP to a recombinant version expressed in Pichia pastoris (pASP) and replacing QuilA by Al(OH)(3). Immunization of cattle with the protective nASP+QuilA vaccine was associated with antigen-induced proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells combined with IFN-γ secretion and the induction of a mixed IgG1/IgG2 antibody response. ASP-specific activation and proliferation of NK cells was also observed in mice following the same vaccination regime. Replacing QuilA by Al(OH)(3) or nASP by pASP significantly decreased the capacity of the vaccines to trigger both NK cell activation and antibody responses and failed to induce protection against a challenge infection. Reduction of the structurally anchoring disulphide bonds of the nASP completely abolished its ability to induce NK cell activation and antibody responses, highlighting the importance of protein conformation for the immunostimulatory activity.","González-Hernández, Ana; Van Coppernolle, Stefanie; Borloo, Jimmy; Van Meulder, Frederik; Paerewijck, Oonagh; Peelaers, Iris; Leclercq, Georges; Claerebout, Edwin; Geldhof, Peter",Sci Rep,65,8

Nano-carriers-based technology has made significant progress for a long time and is introducing a new paradigm in drug delivery. However, it still has some challenges like lack of specificity toward targeting the infectious site. Nano-carriers utilized targeting ligands on their surface called ‘active target’ provide the promising way to solve the problems like accelerating drug delivery to infectious areas and preventing toxicity or side-effects. In this mini review, we demonstrate the recent studies using the active targeted strategy to kill or inhibit microbes.

Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus (IAV) to induce host shutoff. We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

Antibody detection (serology) can reveal both past and recent infections. There is a great need for development of rational ways of detecting and quantifying antibodies, both for humans and animals. Traditionally, serology using synthetic antigens covers linear epitopes using up to 30 amino acid peptides. Methods: We here report that peptides of 100 amino acids or longer (“megapeptides”), designed and synthesized for optimal serological performance, can successfully be used as detection antigens in a suspension multiplex immunoassay (SMIA). Megapeptides can quickly be created just from pathogen sequences. A combination of rational sequencing and bioinformatic routines for definition of diagnostically-relevant antigens can, thus, rapidly yield efficient serological diagnostic tools for an emerging infectious pathogen. Results: We designed megapeptides using bioinformatics and viral genome sequences. These long peptides were tested as antigens for the presence of antibodies in human serum to the filo-, herpes-, and polyoma virus families in a multiplex microarray system. All of these virus families contain recently discovered or emerging infectious viruses. Conclusion: Long synthetic peptides can be useful as serological diagnostic antigens, serving as biomarkers, in suspension microarrays.","Rizwan, Muhammad; Rönnberg, Bengt; Cistjakovs, Maksims; Lundkvist, Åke; Pipkorn, Rudiger; Blomberg, Jonas",Microarrays (Basel),65,1
2415,2415,2415,Human IFIT1 Inhibits mRNA Translation of Rubulaviruses but Not Other Members of the Paramyxoviridae Family,11.958119,6.9513497,2016-09-29,"We have previously shown that IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the antiviral action of interferon (IFN) alpha/beta against parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5), selectively inhibiting the translation of PIV5 mRNAs. Here we report that while PIV2, PIV5, and mumps virus (MuV) are sensitive to IFIT1, nonrubulavirus members of the paramyxoviridae such as PIV3, Sendai virus (SeV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are resistant. The IFIT1 sensitivity of PIV5 was not rescued by coinfection with an IFIT1-resistant virus (PIV3), demonstrating that PIV3 does not specifically inhibit the antiviral activity of IFIT1 and that the inhibition of PIV5 mRNAs is regulated by cis-acting elements. We developed an in vitro translation system using purified human IFIT1 to further investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1. While the translations of PIV2, PIV5, and MuV mRNAs were directly inhibited by IFIT1, the translations of PIV3, SeV, and CDV mRNAs were not. Using purified human mRNA-capping enzymes, we show biochemically that efficient inhibition by IFIT1 is dependent upon a 5′ guanosine nucleoside cap (which need not be N7 methylated) and that this sensitivity is partly abrogated by 2′O methylation of the cap 1 ribose. Intriguingly, PIV5 M mRNA, in contrast to NP mRNA, remained sensitive to inhibition by IFIT1 following in vitro 2′O methylation, suggesting that other structural features of mRNAs may influence their sensitivity to IFIT1. Thus, surprisingly, the viral polymerases (which have 2′-O-methyltransferase activity) of rubulaviruses do not protect these viruses from inhibition by IFIT1. Possible biological consequences of this are discussed. IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses cause a wide variety of diseases, and yet most of their genes encode structural proteins and proteins involved in their replication cycle. Thus, the amount of genetic information that determines the type of disease that paramyxoviruses cause is relatively small. One factor that will influence disease outcomes is how they interact with innate host cell defenses, including the interferon (IFN) system. Here we show that different paramyxoviruses interact in distinct ways with cells in a preexisting IFN-induced antiviral state. Strikingly, all the rubulaviruses tested were sensitive to the antiviral action of ISG56/IFIT1, while all the other paramyxoviruses tested were resistant. We developed novel in vitro biochemical assays to investigate the mechanism of action of IFIT1, demonstrating that the mRNAs of rubulaviruses can be directly inhibited by IFIT1 and that this is at least partially because their mRNAs are not correctly methylated.","Young, D.

OBJECTIVE: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. RESULTS: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. LIMITATIONS: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.","Koh, Wee Ming; Bogich, Tiffany; Siegel, Karen; Jin, Jing; Chong, Elizabeth Y.; Tan, Chong Yew; Chen, Mark IC; Horby, Peter; Cook, Alex R.",Pediatr Infect Dis J,65,27
2544,2544,2544,The autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) positively regulates HCV replication and is required for wild-type membranous web formation,11.723068,6.8689017,2017-01-09,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces intracellular membrane rearrangements, thus forming a membranous web (MW) in which HCV replication and assembly occur. The HCV-induced MW is primarily composed of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) transfused by multi-membrane vesicles. The autophagy machinery has been proposed to participate in the formation of such vesicles. However, no clear evidence has been found linking autophagy to the formation of these DMVs. In this study, we evaluated the role of the autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) in HCV replication and MW formation. Using a dominant negative form of ATG12 and an siRNA approach, we demonstrated that the ATG5-12 conjugate, but not LC3-II formation, is crucial for efficient viral replication. Furthermore, purification of HCV MW revealed the presence of ATG5-12 and ATG16L1 along with HCV nonstructural proteins. Interestingly, LC3 was not recruited along with the elongation complex to the site of viral replication. Finally, inhibition of the elongation complex, but not LC3, greatly impaired the formation of the wild-type MW phenotype. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of the involvement of autophagy proteins in the formation of wild-type MWs.","Fahmy, Ahmed M.; Labonté, Patrick",Sci Rep,65,1

For many 2H enzymes, the physiological function is unknown. Here, we studied the structure of the 2H family member LigT from Escherichia coli both in the apo form and complexed with different active-site ligands, including ATP, 2′-AMP, 3′-AMP, phosphate, and NADP(+). Comparisons to the well-characterized vertebrate myelin enzyme 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) highlight specific features of the catalytic cycle and substrate recognition in both enzymes. The role played by the helix α7, unique to CNPases within the 2H family, is apparently taken over by Arg130 in the bacterial enzyme. Other residues and loops lining the active site groove are likely to be important for RNA substrate binding. We visualized conformational changes related to ligand binding, as well as the position of the nucleophilic water molecule. We also present a low-resolution model of E. coli LigT bound to tRNA in solution, and provide a model for RNA binding by LigT, involving flexible loops lining the active site cavity. Taken together, our results both aid in understanding the common features of 2H family enzymes and help highlight the distinct features in the 2H family members, which must result in different reaction mechanisms. Unique aspects in different 2H family members can be observed in ligand recognition and binding, and in the coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule and the reactive phosphate moiety.","Myllykoski, Matti; Kursula, Petri",PLoS One,65,1

However, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of ZIKV in different regions of the world. METHODS: We use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, and Suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number R(0). RESULTS: Six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of French Polynesia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Suriname and Saint Martin. However, only Colombia and Guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. Temporal patterns of the second wave in Colombia and the single wave in Suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. Moreover, the mean estimates of R(0) for Colombia, Guatemala and Suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for R(0) of island populations in French Polynesia, Puerto Rico and Saint Martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70–6.89. We also fit the Richards model to Zika case data from six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean R(0) range of 3.09–5.05. DISCUSSION: Using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R(0)) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring. Our result has potential implications for planning respective intervention and control policies targeted for island and land-based populations.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen",PeerJ,65,28

However, variability in the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic approach has been reported in human patients. Consequently, lentiviral-vector-based gene therapy is limited to incurable human diseases, with little understanding of the underlying causes of adverse effects and poor efficacy. To assess the role that host genetic variation has on efficacy of gene therapy, we characterized lentiviral-vector gene therapy within a set of 12 collaborative cross mouse strains. Lentiviral vectors carrying the firefly luciferase cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter were administered to female mice, with total-body and hepatic luciferase expression periodically monitored through 41 weeks post-vector administration. Vector copy number per diploid genome in mouse liver and spleen was determined at the end of this study. We identified major strain-specific contributions to overall success of transduction, vector biodistribution, maximum luciferase expression, and the kinetics of luciferase expression throughout the study. Our results highlight the importance of genetic variation on gene-therapeutic efficacy; provide new models with which to more rigorously assess gene therapy approaches; and suggest that redesigning preclinical studies of gene-therapy methodologies might be appropriate.","Suwanmanee, Thipparat; Ferris, Martin T.; Hu, Peirong; Gui, Tong; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Kafri, Tal",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,65,1

These CD8(+) T cell epitopes were separated by N/KAAA spacers and optimized for proteasomal cleavage. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle adjuvanted with TLR4 ligand-emulsion GLA-SE were evaluated for their efficacy in inducing IFN-γ responses and protection of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against T. gondii. Immunization, using self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE, activated CD8(+) T cells to produce IFN-γ. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE also protected HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against subsequent challenge with Type II parasites. Hence, combining CD8(+) T cell-eliciting peptides and PADRE into a multi-epitope protein that forms a nanoparticle, administered with GLA-SE, leads to efficient presentation by major histocompatibility complex Class I and II molecules.

They may occur transiently in gene creation and are of biotechnological interest. We have examined the possibility to encode an arbitrary pair of protein domains as a dual gene, with the shorter coding sequence completely embedded in the longer one. For 500 × 500 domain pairs (X, Y), we computationally designed homologous pairs (X′, Y′) coded this way, using an algorithm that provably maximizes the sequence similarity between (X′, Y′) and (X, Y). Three schemes were considered, with X′ and Y′ coded on the same or complementary strands. For 16% of the pairs, an overlapping coding exists where the level of homology of X′, Y′ to the natural proteins represents an E-value of 10(−10) or better. Thus, for an arbitrary domain pair, it is surprisingly easy to design homologous sequences that can be encoded as a fully-overlapping gene pair. The algorithm is general and was used to design 200 triple genes, with three proteins encoded by the same DNA segment. The ease of design suggests overlapping genes may have occurred frequently in evolution and could be readily used to compress or constrain artificial genomes.","Opuu, Vaitea; Silvert, Martin; Simonson, Thomas",Sci Rep,65,1

These processes require the virus to cross the plasma membrane of the cell twice: once via fusion mediated by the envelope glycoprotein to deliver the viral core into the cytosol; and secondly by ESCRT-mediated scission of budding virions during release. This physical barrier thus presents a perfect location for host antiviral restrictions that target enveloped viruses in general. In this review we will examine the current understanding of innate host antiviral defences that inhibit these essential replicative steps of primate lentiviruses associated with the plasma membrane, the mechanism by which these viruses have adapted to evade such defences, and the role that this virus/host battleground plays in the transmission and pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS.","Foster, Toshana L.; Pickering, Suzanne; Neil, Stuart J.

The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.","Grossegesse, Marica; Doellinger, Joerg; Fritsch, Annemarie; Laue, Michael; Piesker, Janett; Schaade, Lars; Nitsche, Andreas",Sci Rep,65,28

Next, we observed that male C57BL/6 mice treated with C23 (8 mg/kg BW) at 2 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) had lower serum levels of LDH, ALT, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β (reduced by ≥39%) at 20 h after CLP compared with mice treated with vehicle.

These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.","Jang, Hyesun; Elaish, Mohamed; KC, Mahesh; Abundo, Michael C.; Ghorbani, Amir; Ngunjiri, John M.; Lee, Chang-Won",PLoS One,65,1

Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of the innate defense to infection, and in this study we evaluated the contribution of a specific gene coding for IFIT2 induced by type I IFNs in a murine model of disseminated Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a frequent challenge during immunosuppression or surgical medical interventions, and C. albicans is a common culprit that leads to high rates of mortality. When IFIT2 knockout mice were infected systemically with C. albicans, they were found to have improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to wild-type mice. One of the mechanisms by which IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans appears to be suppression of NADPH oxidase activation. Loss of IFIT2 increases production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, and we demonstrate that IFIT2 is a binding partner of a critical regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase, p67(phox). Since the administration of IFN has been used therapeutically to combat viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, we evaluated administration of IFN-β to mice prior to C. albicans infection. IFN-β treatment promoted pathology and death from C. albicans infection. We provide evidence that IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans and that administration of IFN-β has deleterious effects during infection.","Stawowczyk, Marcin; Naseem, Shamoon; Montoya, Valeria; Baker, Darren P.; Konopka, James; Reich, Nancy C.",mBio,65,1

In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis, western blot analysis, RT-qPCR analysis and flow cytometry assays were mainly used in vivo and/or in vitro. The results indicated that in mice, UVB exposure increased susceptibility to carcinogens, and accelerated disease pathogenesis. Conversely, juglanin was able to ameliorate this condition via inhibition of inflammation, suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis via p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) blockage, nuclear factor (NF)-κB inactivation and caspase stimulation in vivo. In addition, in vitro, the present study demonstrated that treatment of UVB-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells with juglanin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, as well as increased apoptosis via the upregulation of caspase expression and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, juglanin markedly attenuated p38/JNK signaling, inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway and suppressed UVB-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together, these results indicated the possibility of applying juglanin in combination with UVB as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing skin cancer.","Hou, Gui-Rong; Zeng, Kang; Lan, Hai-Mei; Wang, Qi",Int J Mol Med,65,1

Despite this, current vaccination strategies need to be refined to successfully generate robust protective antigen-specific memory immune responses. To address this issue, one possibility is to exploit the high efficiency of dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-presenting cells for T cell priming. DCs functional plasticity allows shaping the outcome of immune responses to achieve the required type of immunity. Therefore, the choice of adjuvants to guide and sustain DCs maturation, the design of multifaceted vehicles, and the choice of surface molecules to specifically target DCs represent the key issues currently explored in both preclinical and clinical settings. Here, we review advances in DCs-based vaccination approaches, which exploit direct in vivo DCs targeting and activation options. We also discuss the recent findings for efficient antitumor DCs-based vaccinations and combination strategies to reduce the immune tolerance promoted by the tumor microenvironment.","Gornati, Laura; Zanoni, Ivan; Granucci, Francesca",Front Immunol,65,1

This is a severe, often fatal illness with mortality rates varying from 50 to 90% in humans. Although the virus and associated disease has been recognized since 1976, it was only when the recent outbreak of EBOV in 2014–2016 highlighted the danger and global impact of this virus, necessitating the need for coming up with the effective vaccines and drugs to counter its pandemic threat. Albeit no commercial vaccine is available so far against EBOV, a few vaccine candidates are under evaluation and clinical trials to assess their prophylactic efficacy. These include recombinant viral vector (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector, chimpanzee adenovirus type 3-vector, and modified vaccinia Ankara virus), Ebola virus-like particles, virus-like replicon particles, DNA, and plant-based vaccines. Due to improvement in the field of genomics and proteomics, epitope-targeted vaccines have gained top priority. Correspondingly, several therapies have also been developed, including immunoglobulins against specific viral structures small cell-penetrating antibody fragments that target intracellular EBOV proteins. Small interfering RNAs and oligomer-mediated inhibition have also been verified for EVD treatment. Other treatment options include viral entry inhibitors, transfusion of convalescent blood/serum, neutralizing antibodies, and gene expression inhibitors. Repurposed drugs, which have proven safety profiles, can be adapted after high-throughput screening for efficacy and potency for EVD treatment. Herbal and other natural products are also being explored for EVD treatment.

The ITS rDNA region of seven Exophiala species (E. equina, E. salmonis, E. opportunistica, E. pisciphila, E. aquamarina, E. angulospora and E. castellanii) along with the close relative Veronaea botryosa was sequenced and aligned for the design of specific padlock probes for the detection of characteristic single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The assay demonstrated to successfully amplify DNA of target fungi, allowing detection at the species level. Amplification products were visualized on 1% agarose gels to confirm specificity of probe–template binding. Amounts of reagents were reduced to prevent the generation of false positive results.

By deep sequencing and de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls.

However, the development of LAIV has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as the adaptation of viruses to replicate at low temperatures. These approaches require an extensive investment of time and resources before identifying potential vaccine candidates that can be safely implemented as LAIV to protect humans. In addition, the mechanism of attenuation of these vaccines is poorly understood in some cases. Importantly, LAIV are more efficacious than inactivated vaccines because their ability to mount efficient innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Therefore, the design of potential LAIV based on known properties of viral proteins appears to be a highly appropriate option for the treatment of influenza viral infections. For that, the viral RNA synthesis machinery has been a research focus to identify key amino acid substitutions that can lead to viral attenuation and their use in safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV. In this review, we discuss the potential to manipulate the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex to generate attenuated forms of the virus that can be used as LAIV for the treatment of influenza viral infections, one of the current and most effective prophylactic options for the control of influenza in humans.","Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Peersen, Olve; Nogales, Aitor",Viruses,65,1

While vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza, its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections. In addition, antigenic variation of IAV complicates the production of efficacious vaccines. Similarly, effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs. Like many viruses, IAV is reliant on host factors and signaling-pathways for its replication, which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections. While host-factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses, only recently they have been targeted for development as IAV antivirals. Future strategies to combat IAV infections will most likely include approaches that alter host-virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other, with the use of biological response modifiers (BRMs). In principle, BRMs are biologically active agents including antibodies, small peptides, and/or other (small) molecules that can influence the immune response. BRMs are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal IAV infections. In this review, we will address the potential therapeutic use of different BRM classes to modulate the immune response induced after IAV infections.","Elbahesh, Husni; Gerlach, Thomas; Saletti, Giulietta; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F.",Front Immunol,65,28

Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution, but their assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Such features also challenge assembly across genomic islands containing niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation. These populations and features may be successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, at least in abundant taxa, but at considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative sequencing and informatics workflow to improve viral metagenomic assemblies using short-read and long-read technology. The ‘VirION’ (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing) approach was first validated using mock communities where it was found to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods and provided significant improvements in recovery of viral genomes. We then then applied VirION to the first metagenome from a natural viral community from the Western English Channel. In comparison to a short-read only approach, VirION: (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes; (ii) captured abundant, highly microdiverse virus populations, and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands. Together, these findings suggest that VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.","Warwick-Dugdale, Joanna; Solonenko, Natalie; Moore, Karen; Chittick, Lauren; Gregory, Ann C.; Allen, Michael J.; Sullivan, Matthew B.; Temperton, Ben",PeerJ,65,1

The Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis mouse model has been well documented. This model allows the analysis of host responses to enteric bacteria and facilitates improved understanding of the potential mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. The current study evaluated the effects of dietary 30 mg/kg quercetin supplementation on C. rodentium-induced experimental colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Following dietary quercetin supplementation, the mice were infected with 5 × 10(8) CFU C. rodentium, and the pathological effects of C. rodentium were measured. The results showed that quercetin alleviated the effects of C. rodentium-induced colitis, suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6 (p < 0.05), and promoted the production of IL-10 in the colon tissues (p < 0.05). Quercetin supplementation also enhanced the populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia and significantly reduced those of Fusobacterium and Enterococcus (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that dietary quercetin exerts therapeutic effects on C. rodentium-induced colitis, probably due to quercetin’s ability to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or modify gut microbiota. Thus, these results suggest that quercetin supplementation is effective in controlling C. rodentium-induced inflammation.","Lin, Rui; Piao, Meiyu; Song, Yan",Front Microbiol,65,1

Recently, it has come to light that when these people infect others, the new infection is typically established by only one or a small number of virions from within this complex viral swarm. An important goal is to characterize the biological properties of HIV-1 virions that seed and exist early in new human infections because these are potentially the only viruses against which a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine would need to elicit protection. This includes understanding how the Envelope (Env) protein of these virions interacts with the T-cell receptor CD4, which supports attachment and entry of HIV-1 into target cells. We examined early HIV-1 isolates for their ability to infect cells via the CD4 receptor of 15 different primate species. Primates were the original source of HIV-1 and now serve as valuable animal models for studying HIV-1. We find that most primary isolates of HIV-1 from the blood, including early isolates, are highly selective and enter cells through some primate CD4 receptor orthologs but not others. This phenotype is remarkably consistent, regardless of route of transmission, viral subtype, or time of isolation post infection. We show that the weak CD4 binding affinity of blood-derived HIV-1 isolates is what makes them sensitive to the small sequence differences in CD4 from one primate species to the next. To substantiate this, we engineered an early HIV-1 Env to have high, medium, or low binding affinity to CD4, and we show that it loses the ability to enter cells via the CD4 receptor of many primate species as the binding affinity gets weaker. Based on the phenotype of selective use of primate CD4, we find that weak CD4 binding appears to be a nearly universal property of HIV-1 circulating in the bloodstream. Therefore, weak binding to CD4 must be a selected and important property in the biology of HIV-1 in the body. We identify six primate species that encode CD4 receptors that fully support the entry of early HIV-1 isolates despite their low binding affinity for CD4. These findings will help inform long-standing efforts to model HIV-1 transmission and early disease in primates.","Warren, Cody J.; Meyerson, Nicholas R.; Dirasantha, Obaiah; Feldman, Emily R.; Wilkerson, Gregory K.; Sawyer, Sara L.",PLoS Biol,65,1

Porcine IFN-complex thus represents an optimal model for studying IFN evolution that resulted from increasing viral pressure during domestication and industrialization. We hypothesize and justify that porcine IFN-complex may extend its functionality in antiviral and immunomodulatory activity due to its superior molecular diversity. Furthermore, these unconventional IFNs could even confer some functional and signaling novelty beyond that of the well-studied IFN-α/β subtypes. Investigations into porcine IFN-complex will further our understanding of IFN biology and promote IFN-based therapeutic designs to confront swine viral diseases.","Jennings, Jordan; Sang, Yongming",Viruses,65,1

We did not find broad support across studies for a one-way effect of nutrient availability on pathogen virulence. We thus discuss a hypothesis that there is a balance between the effect of host nutrition on the immune system and on pathogen resources, with the pivot point of the balance differing for vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Our results suggest that variation in nutrition, caused by natural or anthropogenic factors, can have diverse effects on infectious disease outcomes across species.","Pike, Victoria L.; Lythgoe, Katrina A.; King, Kayla C.",Proc Biol Sci,65,1

Here, we analyse the effect of the P. aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB on human keratinocytes and demonstrate that it triggers events in the host, upon binding to fucosylated residues on cell membrane receptors, which extend beyond its role as an adhesion molecule. We found that LecB associates with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and dampens its signalling, leading to the arrest of cell cycle. In addition, we describe a novel LecB-triggered mechanism to down-regulate host cell receptors by showing that LecB leads to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor internalisation and subsequent missorting towards intracellular endosomal compartments, without receptor activation. Overall, these data highlight that LecB is a multitask virulence factor that, through subversion of several host pathways, has a profound impact on keratinocyte proliferation and survival.","Landi, Alessia; Mari, Muriel; Kleiser, Svenja; Wolf, Tobias; Gretzmeier, Christine; Wilhelm, Isabel; Kiritsi, Dimitra; Thünauer, Roland; Geiger, Roger; Nyström, Alexander; Reggiori, Fulvio; Claudinon, Julie; Römer, Winfried",Life Sci Alliance,65,1

Important research questions concern the involvement of the host innate immune response in pathogenesis, key to which is the role played by microglia, resident macrophages of the brain parenchyma. Do microglia have a protective function, by coordinating the innate immune response to viral infection, or do they drive pathogenic neuroinflammation? Here we synthesize recent data from mouse models of acute viral encephalitis, which reveal an unambiguously protective role for microglia. Depletion of microglia, via blockade of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling, led to increased viral replication accompanied by more severe neurological disease and heightened mortality. Whilst the underlying mechanism(s) remain to be defined, microglial interactions with T cells and phagocytosis of infected neurones appear to play a role. Paradoxically, the production of inflammatory cytokines was increased in several instances following viral infection in microglia-depleted brains, suggesting that: (i) cells other than microglia mediate inflammatory responses and/or (ii) microglia may exert a regulatory function. Under certain circumstances the microglial antiviral response might contribute negatively to longer-term neurological sequelae, although fewer studies have focused on this aspect in encephalitis models. Understanding regulation of the microglial response, and how it contributes to disease is therefore a priority for future studies. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the central role of microglia in pathogenesis, suggesting the exciting possibility that defects of microglial function might contribute to encephalitis susceptibility and/or outcome in humans.","Hatton, Catherine F.; Duncan, Christopher J.

New vaccine candidates are therefore urgently needed. Highly conserved Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue-5 (PfRH5) has been identified as a potential candidate for anti-disease vaccine development. PfRH5 is essential for erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and crucial for parasite survival. However, there is paucity of data on the extent of genetic variations on PfRH5 in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. This study described genetic polymorphisms at the high affinity binding polypeptides (HABPs) 36718, 36727, 36728 of PfRH5 in Nigerian isolates of P. falciparum. This study tested the hypothesis that only specific conserved B and T cell epitopes on PfRH5 HABPs are crucial for vaccine development. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five microscopically confirmed P. falciparum samples collected in a prospective cross-sectional study of three different populations in Lagos, Nigeria. Genetic diversity and haplotype construct of Pfrh5 gene were determined using bi-directional sequencing approach. Tajima’s D and the ratio of nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations were utilized to estimate the extent of balancing and directional selection in the pfrh5 gene. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three haplotypes of PfRH5 with negative Tajima’s D and dN/dS value of − 1.717 and 0.011 ± 0.020, respectively. A single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP (G → A) at position 608 was observed, which resulted in a change of the amino acid cysteine at position 203 to tyrosine. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.318 ± 0.016 and 0.0046 ± 0.0001 while inter-population genetic differentiation ranged from 0.007 to 0.037.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed clustering and evidence of evolutionary relationship with 3D7, PAS-2 and FCB-2 RH5 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed low level of genetic polymorphisms in PfRH5 antigen with B- and T-cell epitopes in intrinsically unstructured regions along the PfRH5 gene in Lagos, Nigeria. A broader investigation is however required in other parts of the country to support the possible inclusion of PfRH5 in a cross-protective multi-component vaccine.","Ajibaye, Olusola; Osuntoki, Akinniyi A.; Balogun, Emmanuel O.; Olukosi, Yetunde A.; Iwalokun, Bamidele A.; Oyebola, Kolapo M.; Hikosaka, Kenji; Watanabe, Yoh-ichi; Ebiloma, Godwin U.; Kita, Kiyoshi; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",Malar J,65,1
4278,4278,4278,Identification of Plasmodium falciparum proteoforms from liver stage models,11.978784,7.191178,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Immunization with attenuated malaria sporozoites protects humans from experimental malaria challenge by mosquito bite. Protection in humans is strongly correlated with the production of T cells targeting a heterogeneous population of pre-erythrocyte antigen proteoforms, including liver stage antigens. Currently, few T cell epitopes derived from Plasmodium falciparum, the major aetiologic agent of malaria in humans are known. METHODS: In this study both in vitro and in vivo malaria liver stage models were used to sequence host and pathogen proteoforms. Proteoforms from these diverse models were subjected to mild acid elution (of soluble forms), multi-dimensional fractionation, tandem mass spectrometry, and top-down bioinformatics analysis to identify proteoforms in their intact state. RESULTS: These results identify a group of host and malaria liver stage proteoforms that meet a 5% false discovery rate threshold. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides proof-of-concept for the validity of this mass spectrometry/bioinformatic approach for future studies seeking to reveal malaria liver stage antigens towards vaccine development.","Winer, Benjamin; Edgel, Kimberly A.; Zou, Xiaoyan; Sellau, Julie; Hadiwidjojo, Sri; Garver, Lindsey S.; McDonough, Christin E.; Kelleher, Neil L.; Thomas, Paul M.; Villasante, Eileen; Ploss, Alexander; Gerbasi, Vincent R.",Malar J,65,1
4284,4284,4284,Leishmania braziliensis prostaglandin F(2α) synthase impacts host infection,12.027731,7.072989,2020-01-08,"BACKGROUND: Prostaglandins (PG) are lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid metabolism. They are involved in cellular processes such as inflammation and tissue homeostasis. PG production is not restricted to multicellular organisms. Trypanosomatids also synthesize several metabolites of arachidonic acid. Nevertheless, their biological role in these early-branching parasites and their role in host-parasite interaction are not well elucidated. Prostaglandin F(2α) synthase (PGF2S) has been observed in the Leishmania braziliensis secreted proteome and in L. donovani extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we previously reported a positive correlation between L. braziliensis PGF2S (LbrPGF2S) expression and pathogenicity in mice. METHODS: LbrPGF2S gene expression and PGF2α synthesis in promastigotes were detected and quantified by western blotting and EIA assay kit, respectively. To investigate LbrPGF2S localization in amastigotes during bone marrow-derived macrophage infection, parasites expressing mCherry-LbrPGF2S were generated and followed by time-lapse imaging for 48 h post-infection. PGF2S homolog sequences from Leishmania and humans were analyzed in silico using ClustalW on Geneious v6 and EMBOSS Needle. RESULTS: Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes synthesize prostaglandin F(2α) in the presence of arachidonic acid, with peak production in the stationary growth phase under heat stress. LbrPGF2S is a cytoplasmic protein enriched in the secretory site of the parasite cell body, the flagellar pocket. It is an enzyme constitutively expressed throughout promastigote development, but overexpression of LbrPGF2S leads to an increase of infectivity in vitro. The data suggest that LbrPGF2S may be released from intracellular amastigotes into the cytoplasm of bone marrow-derived macrophages over a 48-hour infection period, using time-lapse microscopy and mCherry-PGF2S (mChPGF2S)-expressing parasites. CONCLUSIONS: LbrPGF2S, a parasite-derived protein, is targeted to the host cell cytoplasm. The putative transfer of this enzyme, involved in pro-inflammatory lipid mediator synthesis, to the host cell suggests a potential role in host-parasite interaction and may partially explain the increased pathogenicity associated with overexpression of LbrPGF2S in L. braziliensis. Our data provide valuable insights to help understand the importance of parasite-derived lipid mediators in pathogenesis.

First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-γ expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.","Pan, Xiaocheng; Zhang, Nianzhi; Wei, Xiaohui; Jiang, Yinan; Chen, Rong; Li, Qirun; Liang, Ruiying; Zhang, Lijie; Ma, Lizhen; Xia, Chun",Front Immunol,65,1

However, due to its size and complexity, expression of the full-length protein has been difficult, leading to focus on the C-terminal six cysteine domain (6C) with the use of fusion proteins to facilitate expression and folding. In this study, we utilized the baculovirus system to evaluate the expression of three Pfs48/45 proteins including the full-length protein, the 6C domain fragment and the 6C domain mutant to prevent glycosylation. Expression of the recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins was conducted in super Sf9 cells combined with the use of tunicamycin to prevent N-glycosylation. The proteins were then evaluated as immunogens in mice to demonstrate the induction of functionally active polyclonal antibody responses as measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Only the 6C protein was found to exhibit significant transmission-reducing activity. Further characterization of the biologically active 6C protein demonstrated it was homogeneous in terms of size, charge, conformation, absence of glycosylation, and containing proper disulfide bond pairings. This study presents an alternative expression system, without the need of a fusion protein partner, for the Pfs48/45 6C protein fragment including further evaluation as a potential transmission-blocking vaccine candidate.","Lee, Shwu-Maan; Hickey, John M.; Miura, Kazutoyo; Joshi, Sangeeta B.; Volkin, David B.; King, C.

4349,4349,4349,Human antibodies neutralizing diphtheria toxin in vitro and in vivo,11.902929,7.1219907,2020-01-17,"Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacterium primarily infects the throat and upper airways and the produced diphtheria toxin (DT), which binds to the elongation factor 2 and blocks protein synthesis, can spread through the bloodstream and affect organs, such as the heart and kidneys. For more than 125 years, the therapy against diphtheria has been based on polyclonal horse sera directed against DT (diphtheria antitoxin; DAT). Animal sera have many disadvantages including serum sickness, batch-to-batch variation in quality and the use of animals for production. In this work, 400 human recombinant antibodies were generated against DT from two different phage display panning strategies using a human immune library. A panning in microtiter plates resulted in 22 unique in vitro neutralizing antibodies and a panning in solution combined with a functional neutralization screening resulted in 268 in vitro neutralizing antibodies. 61 unique antibodies were further characterized as scFv-Fc with 35 produced as fully human IgG1. The best in vitro neutralizing antibody showed an estimated relative potency of 454 IU/mg and minimal effective dose 50% (MED50%) of 3.0 pM at a constant amount of DT (4x minimal cytopathic dose) in the IgG format. The targeted domains of the 35 antibodies were analyzed by immunoblot and by epitope mapping using phage display. All three DT domains (enzymatic domain, translocation domain and receptor binding domain) are targets for neutralizing antibodies. When toxin neutralization assays were performed at higher toxin dose levels, the neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies was markedly reduced but this was largely compensated for by using two or more antibodies in combination, resulting in a potency of 79.4 IU/mg in the in vivo intradermal challenge assay. These recombinant antibody combinations are candidates for further clinical and regulatory development to replace equine DAT.","Wenzel, Esther Veronika; Bosnak, Margarita; Tierney, Robert; Schubert, Maren; Brown, Jeffrey; Dübel, Stefan; Efstratiou, Androulla; Sesardic, Dorothea; Stickings, Paul; Hust, Michael",Sci Rep,65,11
4384,4384,4384,In silico Design of a Multivalent Vaccine Against Candida albicans,12.118534,7.0577903,2020-01-23,"Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common nosocomial infection and a leading cause of mycoses-related deaths. High-systemic toxicity and emergence of antifungal-resistant species warrant the development of newer preventive approaches against IC. Here, we have adopted an immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine-based approach, to enhance the body’s immune response against invasive candida infections. Using computational tools, we screened the entire candida proteome (6030 proteins) and identified the most immunodominant HLA class I, HLA class II and B- cell epitopes. By further immunoinformatic analyses for enhanced vaccine efficacy, we selected the 18- most promising epitopes, which were joined together using molecular linkers to create a multivalent recombinant protein against Candida albicans (mvPC). To increase mvPC’s immunogenicity, we added a synthetic adjuvant (RS09) to the mvPC design. The selected mvPC epitopes are homologous against all currently available annotated reference sequences of 22 C. albicans strains, thus offering a higher coverage and greater protective response. A major advantage of the current vaccine approach is mvPC’s multivalent nature (recognizing multiple-epitopes), which is likely to provide enhanced protection against complex candida antigens. Here, we describe the computational analyses leading to mvPC design.","Tarang, Shikha; Kesherwani, Varun; LaTendresse, Blake; Lindgren, Laramie; Rocha-Sanchez, Sonia M.; Weston, Michael D.",Sci Rep,65,1

Assessment of the baseline antibody repertoires of unimmunized model animals will be useful as a benchmark for future immunization experiments. We characterized the heavy chain and kappa light chain antibody repertoires of a model animal, the OmniRat, by high throughput antibody sequencing and made use of two novel datasets for comparison to human repertoires. Intra-animal and inter-animal repertoire comparisons reveal a high level of conservation in antibody diversity between the lymph node and spleen and between members of the species. Multiple differences were found in both the heavy and kappa chain repertoires between OmniRats and humans including gene segment usage, CDR3 length distributions, class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation levels and in features of V(D)J recombination. The Inference and Generation of Repertoires (IGoR) software tool was used to model recombination in VH regions which allowed for the quantification of some of these differences. Diversity estimates of the OmniRat heavy chain repertoires almost reached that of humans, around two orders of magnitude less. Despite variation between the species repertoires, a high frequency of OmniRat clonotypes were also found in the human repertoire. These data give insights into the development and selection of humanized animal antibodies and provide actionable information for use in vaccine studies.","Joyce, Collin; Burton, Dennis R.; Briney, Bryan",Sci Rep,65,1
4434,4434,4434,Sexual forms obtained in a continuous in vitro cultured Colombian strain of Plasmodium falciparum (FCB2),12.019344,7.044259,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiological control of malaria has been hampered by the appearance of parasite resistance to anti-malarial drugs and by the resistance of mosquito vectors to control measures. This has also been associated with weak transmission control, mostly due to poor control of asymptomatic patients associated with host-vector transmission. This highlights the importance of studying the parasite’s sexual forms (gametocytes) which are involved in this phase of the parasite’s life-cycle. Some African and Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum have been fully characterized regarding sexual forms’ production; however, few Latin-American strains have been so characterized. This study was aimed at characterizing the Colombian FCB2 strain as a gametocyte producer able to infect mosquitoes. METHODS: Gametocyte production was induced in in vitro cultured P. falciparum FCB2 and 3D7 strains. Pfap2g and Pfs25 gene expression was detected in FCB2 strain gametocyte culture by RT-PCR. Comparative analysis of gametocytes obtained from both strains was made (counts and morphological changes). In vitro zygote formation from FCB2 gametocytes was induced by incubating a gametocyte culture sample at 27 °C for 20 min. A controlled Anopheles albimanus infection was made using an artificial feed system with cultured FCB2 gametocytes (14–15 days old). Mosquito midgut dissection was then carried out for analyzing oocysts. RESULTS: The FCB2 strain expressed Pfap2g, Pfs16, Pfg27/25 and Pfs25 sexual differentiation-related genes after in vitro sexual differentiation induction, producing gametocytes that conserved the expected morphological features. The amount of FCB2 gametocytes produced was similar to that from the 3D7 strain. FCB2 gametocytes were differentiated into zygotes and ookinetes after an in vitro low-temperature stimulus and infected An. albimanus mosquitoes, developing to oocyst stage. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the history of long-term FCB2 strain in vitro culture maintenance, it has retained its sexual differentiation ability. The gametocytes produced here preserved these parasite forms’ usual characteristics and An. albimanus infection capability, thus enabling its use as a tool for studying sexual form biology, An. albimanus infection comparative analysis and anti-malarial drug and vaccine development.","Ararat-Sarria, Monica; Prado, Cesar Camilo; Camargo, Milena; Ospina, Laura Tatiana; Camargo, Paola Andrea; Curtidor, Hernando; Patarroyo, Manuel Alfonso",Malar J,65,1

Given the magnitude of the school-aged child population, a sizeable proportion of influenza virus transmission events are expected to occur within school settings. However, influenza virus activity in schools is not well-understood, likely due to our limited ability to accurately monitor for respiratory viruses without disrupting the school environment. In this study, we evaluated the use of a bioaerosol sampling method to noninvasively detect and quantify airborne influenza A virus (IAV) densities in a public elementary school. Air samples were collected from multiple locations in the school, two days per week, throughout an eight-week sampling period during influenza season. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the IAV M gene revealed detectable IAV on five occasions in densities ranging from 2.0 × 10(−1) to 1.9 × 10(4). No significant differences in IAV densities were related to student presence/absence. The majority of IAV-associated particles were ≤4 μm in diameter, and theoretical calculations indicate infectious thresholds after minutes of exposure. Our study represents the first identification and quantification of airborne influenza virus in an elementary school, and the results suggest that airborne IAV has the potential to circulate in schools during influenza season, in large enough doses known to cause infection.","Coleman, Kristen K.; Sigler, William V.",Sci Rep,65,28

The incidence of NEC is reduced when infants are fed human milk. However, in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), it is standard practice to freeze and/or pasteurize human milk, which deactivates bioactive components that may offer additional protective benefits. Indeed, our pilot study showed that one feed of fresh mother’s own milk per day was safe, feasible, and can reduce morbidity in preterm infants. To further evaluate the benefits of fresh human milk in the NICU, a randomized controlled trial is needed. METHODS: Our prospective multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial will include infants born at < 30 weeks’ gestation and admitted to one of 29 tertiary NICUs in China. Infants in the intervention (fresh human milk) group (n = 1549) will receive at least two feeds of fresh human milk (i.e., within 4 h of expression) per day from the time of enrollment until 32 weeks’ corrected age or discharge to home. Infants in the control group (n = 1549) will receive previously frozen human milk following the current standard protocols. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will be randomly allocated to the control or fresh human milk groups. The primary outcome is the composite outcome mortality or NEC ≥ stage 2 at 32 weeks’ corrected age, and the secondary outcomes are mortality, NEC ≥ stage 2, NEC needing surgery, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference, time to full enteral feeds, and finally, the number and type of critical incident reports, including feeding errors. DISCUSSION: Our double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial aims to examine whether fresh human milk can improve infant outcomes. The results of this study will impact both Chinese and international medical practice and feeding policy for preterm infants. In addition, data from our study will inform changes in health policy in NICUs across China, such that mothers are encouraged to enter the NICU and express fresh milk for their infants.

However, these studies do not directly estimate the causal effects of fluid-restrictive strategies, nor do their analyses properly adjust for time-varying confounding by indication. In this study, we used causal inference techniques to estimate mortality outcomes that would result from imposing a range of arbitrary limits (“caps”) on fluid volume administration during the first 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: ICUs at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 2008–2012 PATIENTS: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine septic patients (defined by Sepsis-3 criteria) 18 years and older, admitted to the ICU from the emergency department (ED), who received less than 4 L fluids administered prior to ICU admission MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). We employed a dynamic Marginal Structural Model fit by inverse probability of treatment weighting to obtain confounding adjusted estimates of mortality rates that would have been observed had fluid resuscitation volume caps between 4 L–12 L been imposed on the population. The 30-day mortality in our cohort was 17%. We estimated that caps between 6 and 10 L on 24 h fluid volume would have reduced 30-day mortality by − 0.6 to − 1.0%, with the greatest reduction at 8 L (− 1.0% mortality, 95% CI [− 1.6%, − 0.3%]). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 30-day mortality would have likely decreased relative to observed mortality under current practice if these patients had been subject to “caps” on the total volume of fluid administered between 6 and 10 L, with the greatest reduction in mortality rate at 8 L.","Shahn, Zach; Shapiro, Nathan I.; Tyler, Patrick D.; Talmor, Daniel; Lehman, Li-wei H.",Crit Care,65,1

To test the effect of differentiation and activation on their susceptibility, AMφ and BMo were aged, cultivated in either adhesion or suspension and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). It was found that freshly isolated PMφ and BMo were non-permissive to PRRSV. PMφ remained refractory but a few BMo became susceptible after 1 day cultivation. AMφ were permissive with a significant increase of their susceptibility after one day cultivation. In a binding assay, it was demonstrated that the attachment of biotinylated PRRSV to AMf is much more efficient than to PMφ and BMo. Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) 41D3 and 41D5 which block PRRSV infection of AMφ and are directed against a candidate receptor for PRRSV only reacted with the cell membrane of AMφ. PMA treatment of AMφ blocked PRRSV replication in the cells in a dose-dependent manner. The blocking effect of PMA decreased after 9 h continuous pre-treatment and diminished after 24 h continuous pre-treatment. PMA treatment did not affect the binding of PRRSV and MAb 41D3 and 41D5 to AMφ. Direct or indirect treatment of AMφ and BMo with LPS or cultivation in suspension did not significantly affect their susceptibility. These results provide clear evidence that PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for only some sub-populations of porcine monocytes/macrophages and that some specific states of differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages considerably affect their susceptibility.","Duan, X.; Nauwynck, H.

A broad repertoire of memory T-cells must be developed and maintained to effectively protect against viral invasions; yet, the total number of memory T-cells is constrained between infections. Thus, creating memory to new infections can require attrition of some existing memory cells. Furthermore, some viruses induce memory T-cell death early in an infection, after which surviving cells proliferate to refill the memory compartment. We develop mathematical models of cellular attrition and proliferation in order to examine how new viral infections impact existing immunity. With these probabilistic models, we qualitatively and quantitatively predict how the composition and diversity of the memory repertoire changes as a result of viral infections. In addition, we calculate how often immunity to prior diseases is lost due to new infections. Comparing our results across multiple general infection types allows us to draw conclusions about, which types of viral effects most drastically alter existing immunity. We find that early memory attrition does not permanently alter the repertoire composition, while infections that spark substantial new memory generation drastically shift the repertoire and hasten the decline of existing immunity.","Davis, Courtney L.; Adler, Frederick R.",Bull Math Biol,65,11

In one example of this approach, electrospun nylon filters were used to collect MLFs from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The filters were washed to obtain liquid probes, which were then tested for human immunoglobulin A (h-IgA) and fractions of h-IgA specific to ESAT-6 and Psts-1, two antigens secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Probes collected for 10 min contained 100–1500 fg of h-IgA and, in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, a portion of these h-IgA molecules showed specificity to the secreted antigens. Separate MLFs and their dry residues were successfully collected using an electrostatic collector and impactor developed especially for this purpose. Visualization of MLF dry residues by atomic force microscopy made it possible to estimate the lipid content in each MLF and revealed mucin molecules in some MLFs. This exciting new approach will likely make it possible to detect biomarkers in individual MLFs. MLFs emerging from an infection site (‘hot’ microdroplets) are expected to be enriched with infection biomarkers. This paper discusses possible experimental approaches to detecting biomarkers in single MLFs, as well as certain technological problems that need to be resolved in order to develop new non-invasive diagnostics based on analysing biomarkers in separate MLFs.","Morozov, Victor N; Mikheev, Andrey Y; Shlyapnikov, Yuri M; Nikolaev, Alexander A; Lyadova, Irina V",J Breath Res,65,1

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 618 inpatients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection admitted to 36 Spanish hospitals between July 2009 and February 2010. Risk factors evaluated included host-related factors and clinical data at admission. We developed a composite index of severe in-hospital complications (SIHC), which included: mortality, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and requirement for resuscitation maneuvers. Six factors were independently associated with SIHC: age >45 years, male sex, number of comorbidities, pneumonia, dyspnea, and confusion. From the β parameter obtained in the multivariate model, a weight was assigned to each factor to compute the individual influenza risk score. The score shows an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77. The SIHC rate was 1.9 % in the low-risk group, 10.3 % in the intermediate-risk group, and 29.6 % in the high-risk group. The odds ratio for complications was 21.8 for the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group. This easy-to-score influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection risk index accurately stratifies patients hospitalized for H1N1 virus infection into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for SIHC.","Capelastegui, A.; Quintana, J.

Infectious bronchitis virus has many serotypes that do not confer cross protection against each other. The current study was designed to know which IBV types were circulating in Jordanian broiler chickens. Tracheal swabs from 175 broiler flocks at the acute phase of respiratory disease were collected. The swabs were subjected to RNA extraction and tested by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific-nested PCR were performed on RT-PCR products to detect and differentiate strains of Massachusetts, 4/91, and D274 types. The nucleic acid of IBV was detected in 105 out 174 (60%) broiler flocks by RT-PCR. Specific-nested PCR revealed that 35.2, 31.4, and 8.6% of these flocks had Massachusetts, 4/91, and D274, respectively, alone. In 24.8% of tested flocks, 2 types of IBV were detected. However, because the primers used in this study were designed specifically for 3 types of IBV, other types might have been present but not detected.

To test the hypothesis that CLA ameliorate immunosuppression, we developed the immunosuppressive model of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in broiler chickens induced by cyclosporin A. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes of broiler chickens were cultured with media containing various concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 200 μmol/L) of c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA to investigate the effects of CLA isomers on peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2, the activity of phospholipase C, and protein kinase C production. Results suggested that CLA alleviated the immunosuppression of T lymphocytes in broiler chickens exposed to cyclosporin A through increasing of peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2. The 2 CLA isomers enhanced T lymphocyte proliferation at low concentration and inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation at high concentration. In addition, the effect of c9, t11-CLA was better than that of t10, c12-CLA. At the cellular level, the effects of CLA on the alleviation of immunosuppression in T lymphocytes are mainly attributable to increasing the signaling molecules, such as phospholipase C and protein kinase C.","Long, F.

In particular, we show that, for any initial conditions, the epidemic eventually dies out regardless of what other factors are whenever some type of immunization awareness is considered, and vaccination has a perfect success. Moreover, the threshold is independent of the global type of awareness. Second, we compare the effect of contact and local types of awareness on the epidemic thresholds between heterogeneous networks and homogeneous networks. Specifically, we find that the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network can be lower than that of the heterogeneous network in an intermediate regime for intensity of contact infection awareness while it is higher otherwise. In summary, our results highlight the important and crucial roles of both vaccine success and contact infection awareness on epidemic dynamics.","Juang, Jonq; Liang, Yu-Hao",Chaos,65,8

MBP-selected CD4(4+) T cell lines both from measles-infected animals as well as from rats challenged with guinea pig MBP (Gp-MBP) had a similar pattern of response in the presence of synthetic peptides to Gp-MBP and specifically responded in vitro only to the encephalitogenic and not the non-encephalitogenic or other control peptides. In primary splenic lymphocyte cultures from SAME animals, however, a low but significant T-cell response was obtained against the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 (residues 69–81) of the Gp-MBP. Moreover, immunization of MV-infected rats with this peptide induced clinical and histological experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in 38% of the animals. The results of the study show that the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 can be rendered encephalitogenic in rats when an additional stimulus is given in the form of MV infection.

Several aspects of DUB biology have been studied through genetic knock-out or knock-down, genomic, or proteomic studies. However, investigation of enzyme activation and regulation requires additional tools to monitor cellular and physiological dynamics. A comparison between genetic ablation and dominant-negative target validation with pharmacological inhibition often leads to striking discrepancies. Activity probes have been used to profile classes of enzymes, including DUBs, and allow functional and dynamic properties to be assigned to individual proteins. The ability to directly monitor DUB activity within a native biological system is essential for understanding the physiological and pathological role of individual DUBs.

Organs that operate this pathway are numerous and the disease states regulated are diverse, with ceramide generation governing injury in tumor, gut, ovary, brain, lung, heart, liver, and during infection. This chapter emphasizes evolutionary conservation of sphingolipid stress signaling and mammalian adaptations that permit transduction of organotypic responses.

Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 10(6) pfu or less. The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance. However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV. The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats. Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile. The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent. From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system.

RESULTS: Seven fungi (Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides types 1 and 2, Cladosporium herbarum, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium crustosum, and Penicillium chrysogenum type 2) were discovered at very high concentrations in some CRS patients. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of these seven fungi demonstrated species specific sensitivities. Four CRS patients with marked elevations of fungal populations in their sinus samples underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. After surgical treatment, the fungal populations were reduced by several orders of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Seven fungi were found in very high concentrations in the sinuses of some CRS patients. Not one of the five common antifungal agents could control all seven of these fungi based on in vitro tests.","Murr, Andrew H.; Goldberg, Andrew N.; Pletcher, Steven D.; Dillehay, Kelsey; Wymer, Larry J.; Vesper, Stephen J.",Laryngoscope,65,11

Nucleic acid sequence homology or identity and similar RNA secondary structure of CVs and non-CVs may provide a locus for recombination within CVs or with non-CVs should co-infections of the same cell occur. Natural recombinants have been demonstrated among other enteric viruses, including Picornaviridae (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; Furione et al., 1993), Astroviridae (Walter et al., 2001), and possibly rotaviruses (e.g., Desselberger, 1996; Suzuki et al., 1998), augmenting the natural diversity of these pathogens and complicating viral gastroenteritis prevention strategies based upon traditional vaccines. Such is the case for CVs and Astroviridae, whose recombinant strains may be a common portion of naturally circulating strains. The taxonomic — and perhaps biologic — limits of recombination are defined by the suggested recombination of Nanovirus and CV, viruses from hosts of different biologic orders; the relationship of picornaviruses and CVs, viruses in different families, as recombination partners; and the intra-generic recombination between different clades of NLVs.","Matson, David O.",Perspect Med Virol,65,1

Mouse erythrocytes were used as a reagent to explore the question of whether erythrocyte sialic acid functions as a nonspecific negative charge or whether the sialic acid is a necessary structural part of the receptor for merozoites. Human erythrocytes contain N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), whereas mouse erythrocytes, which are also invaded by P. falciparum merozoites, contain 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac(2)) and N-glycoloylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), in addition to Neu5Ac. We compared the effects of sialidase and influenza C virus esterase treatments of mouse erythrocytes on invasion and the binding of a 175-kDa P. falciparum protein (EBA-175), a sialic acid-dependent malaria ligand implicated in the invasion process. Sialidase-treated mouse erythrocytes were refractory to invasion by P. falciparum merozoites and failed to bind EBA-175. Influenza C virus esterase, which converts Neu5,9Ac(2) to Neu5Ac, increased both invasion efficiency and EBA-175 binding to mouse erythrocytes. Thus, the parasite and EBA-175 discriminate between Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac(2), that is, the C-9 acetyl group interferes with EBA-175 binding and invasion by P.falciparum merozoites. This indicates that sialic acid is part of a receptor for invasion.","Klotz, Francis W.; Orlandi, Palmer A.; Reuter, Gerd; Cohen, Stuart J.; Haynes, J.David; Schauer, Roland; Howard, Russell J.; Palese, Peter; Miller, Louis H.",Mol Biochem Parasitol,65,1

METHODS: In this multi-centre prospective study 795/2222 (36%) babies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (gestational age (GA) < 35 weeks or birth weight (BW) < 1800 g or unstable clinical course), 424 (53%) of whom were screened for ROP. 270 died before the first screening. ROP and treatment-warranted ROP were classified using the revised International Classification of ROP (2005). Data on maternal and perinatal risk factors were collected from daily neonatal notes. RESULTS: 31 babies (7.3%, CI 5.0–10.2) developed any ROP, 13 of whom (41.9%, CI 24.5–60.9) required treatment. ROP was seen in six neonates with GA > 30 weeks and BW > 1500 g, one of whom required treatment. In univariate analysis the following were associated with any ROP: increasing number of days on supplemental oxygen (OR 2.1, CI 1.5–3.0, P < 0.001), low GA (OR 3.4, CI 1.8–6.4, P < 0.001), low BW (OR 2.3, CI 1.5–3.4, P < 0.001), at least one episode of hyperglycaemia ≥ 150 mg/dl (OR 6.6, CI 2.0–21.5, P < 0.001), blood transfusion (OR 3.5, CI 1.6–7.4, P < 0.001) or sepsis (OR 3.2, CI 1.2–8.6, P = 0.01).

The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent gravity's rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the nature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our investigation we have considered two different models of [Formula: see text] gravity, namely the inflationary Starobinsky's model and the power law model. Our study reveals the fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end state of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result derived from the study is that gravity's rainbow increases the tendency of formation of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under which the singularity will be a strong or weak curvature singularity. Finally in our quest to know more about the model we have performed a thermodynamical study. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation from the classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution and can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations that our model suffers from. It is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about quantization of gravity and subsequently about the illusive theory of quantum gravity.","Rudra, Prabir",Nucl Phys B,65,1

Thanks to these improvements, the most abundant marks, including N(6)-methyladenosine, are emerging as important determinants of the fate of marked RNAs. However, we still lack approaches to directly study how the set of marks for a given RNA molecule shape its fate. In this perspective, we first review current leading approaches in the field.

In the phase III REPROVE trial (NCT01808092), ceftazidime–avibactam demonstrated non-inferiority to meropenem for the treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including VAP. As ceftazidime–avibactam was not studied in patients with NP prior to REPROVE, selecting an appropriate dosage regimen in the “perfect storm” of NP required careful consideration of potential determinants and confounders of response specific to the NP patient population. METHODS: This review describes the series of preclinical studies and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses that supported ceftazidime–avibactam dosage selection for patients with NP/VAP (2000/500 mg by 2-h intravenous infusion every 8 h, adjusted for renal function). In parallel, important considerations for antibiotic dosage selection in patients with NP are highlighted, including adequate drug penetration into the lungs, the suitability of murine-derived plasma PK/PD targets, evaluation of MIC distributions against clinical bacterial isolates from patients with NP, and consideration of PK in patients with NP, who are often critically ill. These analyses also supported the European approval of ceftazidime–avibactam for adults with HAP, including VAP, before the completion of REPROVE. CONCLUSIONS: This work serves as a successful practical example of dosage design for a new antibacterial drug therapy in the indication of NP, including VAP, where previous drug therapies have failed, possibly as a result of evaluation of too few variables, thereby limiting the accuracy of pharmacodynamic predictions.

Forecasting bed demand helps achieve appropriate safety standards and cost management by proactively adjusting staffing levels and patient flow protocols. This paper defines the theoretical bounds on optimal bed demand prediction accuracy and develops a flexible statistical model to approximate the probability mass function of future bed demand. A case study validates the model using blinded data from a mid-sized Massachusetts community hospital. This approach expands upon similar work by forecasting multiple days in advance instead of a single day, providing a probability mass function of demand instead of a point estimate, using the exact surgery schedule instead of assuming a cyclic schedule, and using patient-level duration-varying length-of-stay distributions instead of assuming patient homogeneity and exponential length of stay distributions. The primary results of this work are an accurate and lengthy forecast, which provides managers better information and more time to optimize short-term staffing adaptations to stochastic bed demand, and a derivation of the minimum mean absolute error of an ideal forecast.","Davis, Samuel; Fard, Nasser",Health Care Manag Sci,65,8

Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying its protective action remains to be fully elucidated. Recently, increased attention has been focused on Notch1 signalling for ameliorating cardiac ischaemic injury. Here, we hypothesised that oestrogen receptor β activation attenuates myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac damage by modulating the Notch1 signalling pathway. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish an MI model through the ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Two chemical drugs, 2,3-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a specific inhibitor of Notch1 signalling) were administered via intraperitoneal injection to change oestrogen receptor β and Notch1 activities. Immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) assessment and echocardiography were used in this study to analyse cardiac oxidative stress, apoptosis, infraction volume, fibrosis and cardiac function. RESULTS: DPN-mediated oestrogen receptor β activation effectively protected cardiomyocytes from MI-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, oestrogen receptor β activation reduced the infarct size and lowered the levels of myocardial enzymes in the serum, thereby leading to greater overall cardiac function improvement. Ischaemic injury–induced myocardial fibrosis was attenuated by oestrogen receptor β activation. Nevertheless, all of these cardioprotective effects of oestrogen receptor β activation were almost abrogated by DAPT administration, i.e. DAPT attenuated the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects and the decrease in infarct and fibrotic areas and reversed cardiac functional recovery. The levels of phospho-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and phospho-protein kinase B (Akt) were increased after DPN administration, and this change was reversed after DAPT was administered. CONCLUSIONS: All of these new findings indicate that oestrogen receptor β activation is effective in ameliorating MI-induced cardiac dysfunction by enhancing Notch1 signalling and that PI3K/Akt signalling is the downstream mediator.

Emerging of its antibiotic-resistant strains persuade researchers to find alternative treatment options such as immunization against the notorious nosocomial pathogen. Oma87 has been introduced as an immunogenic outer membrane protein via reverse vaccinology. However, protectivity of A. baumannii Oma87 is not well known. The current research undertakes a study on the immunogenicity of recombinant Oma87 in a murine model. Some physico-chemical properties were assessed via in silico analyses. The corresponding gene was amplified and cloned into pET28a plasmid. The recombinant protein was purified and then was administered to immunize mice. Sera obtained from the immunized mice were assessed with respect to the triggered antibodies. Challenges were performed on actively or passively immunized mice. In silico analyses revealed that this protein is the same as BamA. A high titer of specific antibody was raised against rOma87 even after the first injection. The specific antibody recognized the whole cell of A. baumannii. Both active and passive immunizations confer 100 and 50% protection, respectively against ~ 2 × lethal dose (LD) of A. baumannii in the murine sepsis model. Although none of mice received ~ 5 × LD of A. baumannii survived in passive immunization, 25% of mice challenged with ~ 7 × LD of the bacteria survived and the dead mice exhibited a delayed death. Based on these results, Oma87 is the same as BamA which could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate against A. baumannii in the sepsis model.

As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between “black box” deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs).

While the benefits of these new technologies are overwhelmingly positive, negative consequences are experienced by a minority of individuals. One possible negative aspect of new technologies is their problematic use due to impulsive use which may lead to lower life satisfaction. The present study investigated the mediating role of problematic video gaming (PVG) and problematic Facebook use (PFU) in the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction as well as the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and problematic behaviors. Additionally, the potential impact of gender differences was also examined. The study comprised 673 gamers (391 females) aged 17–38 years (M = 21.25 years, SD = 2.67) selected from 1365 individuals who completed an offline survey. PFU was assessed using the Facebook Intrusion Scale, and PVG was assessed using the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form (IGDS9-SF). Impulsivity dimensions such as attention, cognitive instability, motor, perseverance, self-control, and cognitive complexity were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and life satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Depending on the specific impulsivity dimension, findings showed both positive and negative relationships between impulsivity and life satisfaction. Attention and perseverance subtypes of impulsivity were primarily associated with problematic behaviors. Additionally, cognitive complexity was associated with PFU among female gamers, whereas cognitive instability was associated with PVG among male gamers. Additionally, PVG was primarily associated with lower life satisfaction. However, there was no mediation effects between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction via PFU or PVG. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between problematic behaviors, life satisfaction, and impulsivity among gamers and the differences between male and female gamers.","Cudo, Andrzej; Wojtasiński, Marcin; Tużnik, Przemysław; Griffiths, Mark D.; Zabielska-Mendyk, Emilia",PLoS One,65,8

OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association of testosterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with depressive symptoms in women after spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Community SCI clinic. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants were enrolled in this study. Total testosterone (Total T) and TSH levels as well as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) survey and monthly sexual activity were obtained from only 20 participants. Pearson’s correlations were used to assess the relationship between age, time from injury, Total T level, TSH level, and CES-D total score. Follow-up analyses investigating the role of monthly sexual activity was also explored. RESULTS: Participants’ average age and time from injury was 44.4 ± 12.7 years old and 11.7 ± 8.89 years, respectively. Low Total T was observed in four participants and one of those participant’s presented with low TSH as well. Nine women were classified as “at risk for clinical depression” on the CES-D (total score >15). Pearson’s correlations revealed a significant association between time from injury and TSH (r = .536, p = .015), as well as CES-D total score (r = −.547, p = .013).

Females had higher presentation rates than males, particularly among younger age groups. The highest rates of presentations were by persons aged 15–24. Overseas-born persons had around half the rates of suicidal presentations than Australian-born persons, and Indigenous persons had 2.9-times higher rates than non-Indigenous persons. Of all presenters, 70.6% presented once, but 5.7% had five or more presentations. Seasonal distribution of presentations showed a peak at the end of spring and a decline in winter months. These findings can inform the allocation of health resources and guide the development of suicide prevention strategies for people presenting to hospitals in suicidal crisis.","Stapelberg, Nicolas J.C.; Sveticic, Jerneja; Hughes, Ian; Turner, Kathryn",Int J Environ Res Public Health,65,1

HEV comprises eight genotypes and several subtypes. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 (HEV3 and HEV4) are zoonotic. In Italy, the most part of HEV infections (80%) is due to autochthonous HEV3 circulation of the virus, and the key role played by wild animals is generally accepted. Abruzzo is an Italian region officially considered an HEV “hot spot”, with subtype HEV3-c being up to now the only one reported among wild boars. During the year 2018–2019, a group of wild boars in Abruzzo were screened for HEV; positive RNA liver samples were subjected to HEV characterization by using the whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach methodology. This represents the first report about the detection of HEV-3 subtypes e and f in the wild boar population in this area. Since in Italy human infections from HEV 3-e and f have been associated with pork meat consumption, our findings deserve more in-depth analysis with the aim of evaluating any potential correlation between wild animals, the pork chain production and HEV human infections.","Aprea, Giuseppe; Scattolini, Silvia; D’Angelantonio, Daniela; Chiaverini, Alexandra; Di Lollo, Valeria; Olivieri, Sabrina; Marcacci, Maurilia; Mangone, Iolanda; Salucci, Stefania; Antoci, Salvatore; Cammà, Cesare; Di Pasquale, Adriano; Migliorati, Giacomo; Pomilio, Francesco",Microorganisms,65,1

For the high-precision inversion of the column length, we propose a set of methods on the basis of the actual conditions, including autocorrelation detection, adaptive filtering, Gaussian decomposition, and optimized Levenberg–Marquardt fitting based on the generalized Gaussian distribution. Then, based on the information of a pair of laser pulses, we use the direct adjustment method of unequal precision to eliminate the error in the distance measurement. Further, the effect of atmospheric delay on distance measurements is considered, leading to further correction of the inversion results. At last, an airborne experiment was carried out in a sea area near Qinhuangdao, China on 14 March 2019. The results showed that the ranging accuracy can reach 0.9066 m, which achieved an excellent ranging accuracy on 1.57-μm IPDA Lidar and met the requirement for high-precision CO(2) column length inversion.","Ma, Xin; Zhang, Haowei; Han, Ge; Xu, Hao; Shi, Tianqi; Gong, Wei; Ma, Yue; Li, Song",Sensors (Basel),65,1

The growing interest in plant-derived substances has led to increased consumption of them also in pregnancy. The pleiotropic and multi-targeting actions of curcumin have made it very attractive as a health-promoting compound. In spite of the beneficial effects observed in various chronic diseases in humans, limited and fragmentary information is currently available about curcumin’s effects on pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications. It is known that immune-metabolic alterations occurring during pregnancy have consequences on both maternal and fetal tissues, leading to short- and long-term complications. The reported anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitoxicant, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antiapoptotic, antiangiogenic, anti-hypertensive, and antidiabetic properties of curcumin appear to be encouraging, not only for the management of pregnancy-related disorders, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia (PE), depression, preterm birth, and fetal growth disorders but also to contrast damage induced by natural and chemical toxic agents. The current review summarizes the latest data, mostly obtained from animal models and in vitro studies, on the impact of curcumin on the molecular mechanisms involved in pregnancy pathophysiology, with the aim to shed light on the possible beneficial and/or adverse effects of curcumin on pregnancy outcomes.","Filardi, Tiziana; Varì, Rosaria; Ferretti, Elisabetta; Zicari, Alessandra; Morano, Susanna; Santangelo, Carmela",Nutrients,65,1

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 390 eyes from 256 (89.8%) intraocular RB and 29 (10.2%) extraocular RB cases diagnosed and treated between October 1998 and May 2018 at one of the largest tertiary care centers in Turkey. RESULTS: Of 351 intraocular RB eyes, 53.3% had group D/E disease at presentation. 75 (21.4%) of 351 eyes underwent primary enucleation. Of the remaining 276 eyes undergoing eye-conserving treatments, 201 (72.8%) were salvaged. Most of these eyes were treated using intravenous chemotherapy and/or focal treatments [transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) and cryotherapy] initially. EBRT was eventually required in 48 (17.4%) eyes and secondary enucleation in 75 (27.2%) eyes. At mean follow-ups of 76.7 and 39.7 months for intraocular and extraocular RB cohorts, respectively, 180 (46.2%) eyes underwent primary/secondary enucleation and exenteration. Overall, 13 cases developed metastasis and 9 died. Two patients with trilateral RB also expired. Multivariable risk factors for enucleation were the presence of vitreous seeds (p < 0.001), absence of EBRT administration (p = 0.033), 5–9 TTT applications compared with no TTT (p = 0.031), and each 1 mm increase in tumour base diameter (p < 0.001). Univariate factors predictive of metastasis were the presence of extraocular RB detected by imaging methods (p < 0.001) and extrascleral/optic nerve cut end involvement at histopathological examination (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, 72.8% of the intraocular RB eyes undergoing eye-conserving treatments were saved.

METHODS: A total of 80 patients with acute CN4 palsy who underwent at least 3 months of follow-up were included in this study. We retrospectively investigated the aetiology, rate of recovery, and factors associated with recovery between March 2016 and January 2019. RESULTS: The average age of patients with CN4 palsy was about 60 years, and the duration of recovery was 1.5 months: 48 (60.0%) patients had a vascular aetiology and 17 (21.3%) patients had a trauma history. Brain lesions were found in four (5.0%) patients and decompensated cause accounted for four (5.0%) cases. Among the total of 80 patients, 13 (16.3%) failed to completely recover. Non-isolated CN4 palsy with other cranial nerve palsies were recorded in seven cases. The comparison between recovery and non-recovery groups showed that initial deviation angle, aetiology, fundus extorsion, and head tilt status were significantly different factors. CONCLUSION: The recovery rate of acute CN4 palsy was about 80% and duration of recovery was 1.5 months. However, the varying rates and duration of recovery was presented according to aetiology thus we should consider the prognosis by aetiology.","Oh, Shin Yeop; Oh, Sei Yeul",Eye (Lond),65,1

Here, we studied morphological differences in the Harderian gland (HG), a vital photosensitive organ, in male striped dwarf hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) under different photoperiods (short photoperiod, SP; moderate photoperiod, MP; long photoperiod, LP), and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms related to these morphological differences. Results showed that carcass weight and HG weight were lower under SP and LP conditions. There was an inverse correlation between blood melatonin levels and photoperiod in the order SP > MP > LP. Protein expression of hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), a MT synthesis-related enzyme, was highest in the SP group. Protein expression of bax/bcl2 showed no significant differences, indicating that the level of apoptosis remained stable. Protein expression of LC3II/LC3I was higher in the SP group than that in the MP group. Furthermore, comparison of changes in the HG ultrastructure demonstrated autolysosome formation in the LP, suggesting the lowest autophagy level in under MP. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of ATP synthase and mitochondrial fission factor were highest in the MP group, whereas citrate synthase, dynamin-related protein1, and fission1 remained unchanged in the three groups. The change trends of ATP synthase and citrate synthase activity were similar to that of protein expression among the three groups. In summary, the up-regulation of autophagy under SP and LP may be a primary factor leading to loss of HG weight and reduced mitochondrial energy supply capacity.","Xu, Jin-Hui; Wang, Zhe; Mou, Jun-Jie; Zhao, Xiang-Yu; Geng, Xiao-Cui; Wu, Ming; Xue, Hui-Liang; Chen, Lei; Xu, Lai-Xiang",PLoS One,65,11

Here we examine the effects of unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS), a mouse model of complex ELS, using high resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. We show that UPS induces several neuroanatomical alterations that were seen in both sexes and resemble those reported in humans. In contrast, exposure to UPS induced fronto-limbic hyper-connectivity in males, but either no change or hypoconnectivity in females. Moderated-mediation analysis found that these sex-specific changes are likely to alter contextual freezing behavior in males but not in females.","White, Jordon D; Arefin, Tanzil M; Pugliese, Alexa; Lee, Choong H; Gassen, Jeff; Zhang, Jiangyang; Kaffman, Arie",,65,1

The aim of the study was to explore the interest of Mexican outpatients with RA in SRH and to examine patient view on SRH. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed 303 consecutive outpatients with RA on their perceptions of SRH importance, SRH satisfaction, access to SRH information, preferences regarding SRH communication with healthcare professionals, and understanding of SRH (qualitative open-ended descriptions). Descriptive statistics and inferential analysis were used. Patient knowledge of each dimension of SRH was rated based on pre-specified criteria. Two assessors assigned ten major themes to each patient´s description of both dimensions of SRH. RESULTS: Patients perceived their SRH as an important component of their general health and wished to address the topic, although few had access to such communication. Female patients assigned lesser importance to SRH, showed lesser degree of satisfaction with SRH, and expressed preference for a truthful physician. Age showed a linear association with individual survey responses, except for satisfaction with reproductive health dimension. There was a linear association between increased age and decreased years of formal education with a lower level of SRH knowledge. Ten major themes emerged for each of the two dimensions of the SRH construct, although most individual descriptions were assigned to one or two major themes. CONCLUSIONS: Further education and assessment of SRH in Mexican patients with RA is warranted.","Ledón-LLanes, Loraine; Contreras-Yáñez, Irazú; Guaracha-Basáñez, Guillermo; Valverde-Hernández, Salvador Saúl; González-Marín, Anayanci; Ballinas-Sánchez, Ángel de Jesús; Durand, Marta; Pascual-Ramos, Virginia",PLoS One,65,1

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 13 population-based national surveys in nine countries (n=8361). We used k-means to develop a clustering model; predictors were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and T2DM family history. The training data set included all surveys, and the clusters were then predicted in each country-year data set. We used Euclidean distance, elbow and silhouette plots to select the optimal number of clusters and described each cluster according to the underlying predictors (mean and proportions). RESULTS: The optimal number of clusters was 4. Cluster 0 grouped more men and those with the highest mean SBP/DBP. Cluster 1 had the highest mean BMI and WC, as well as the largest proportion of T2DM family history. We observed the smallest values of all predictors in cluster 2. Cluster 3 had the highest mean age. When we reflected the four clusters in each country-year data set, a different distribution was observed. For example, cluster 3 was the most frequent in the training data set, and so it was in 7 out of 13 other country-year data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, it was possible to cluster people with T2DM from the general population in LAC; clusters showed unique profiles that could be used to identify the underlying characteristics of the T2DM population in LAC.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Castillo-Cara, Manuel; Anza-Ramirez, Cecilia; Bernabé-Ortiz, Antonio",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,65,1

Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials of care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention at least 3 months. RESULTS: Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome. Initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people improved retention following release. Contingency management may improve retention using antagonist but not agonist MOUD. Retention with interventions integrating medical, psychiatric, social services, or IT did not differ from in-person treatment-as-usual approaches. Retention was comparable with XR- compared to daily buprenorphine formulations and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention. DISCUSSION: Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation, and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, social services, delivering through IT, or administering via XR-MOUD formulations did not worsen retention. Fewer than half of the studies we identified focused on retention as a primary outcome. Studies used different measures of retention, making it difficult to compare effectiveness.

Because the course of the disease is often erratic and varies between patients, it is imperative for patients with ALS to be closely monitored. E-health innovations that can monitor disease progression remotely have great potential to tailor the care to the needs of individual patients with ALS. Therefore, the e-health innovation “ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching” was developed employing a user-centered design process and implemented at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands in 2017. Because ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching was shown to be feasible and well received by patients and healthcare professionals at University Medical Centre Utrecht, we aim to implement this e-health innovation nationwide, starting with 10 ALS care teams in different rehabilitation settings spread across the Netherlands. METHODS: This research focuses on the implementation process and the user experiences with ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching of both patients and healthcare professionals. We will use a participatory action research approach, with the stakeholders involved in all stages of the implementation process. The implementation process model of Grol and Wensing was used to structure and support planning, execution and evaluation of the implementation strategy. The expected barriers and facilitators will be explored and identified in focus group settings using the Theoretical Domains Framework. After that, each team will develop their own action plan with strategies for how to resolve each barrier. The teams will include 5-10 ALS patients with whom they will test their implementation plan and provide care with ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching for approximately 3 months. Afterwards, the implementation and the user experiences will be evaluated with digital surveys based on the evaluation framework of Proctor (e.g., acceptability, adoption, appropriateness). DISCUSSION: Using implementation theories, this study will provide inside in factors influencing implementation outcomes and strategies that can be used to overcome barriers. This will enhance our understanding of how to successfully implement e-health innovations in multidisciplinary care in rehabilitation settings.

To reveal a potential family predisposition to these alterations, we investigated the regulation of gene expression profiles in circulating CD14(+) and CD14(-) PBMC in fasting conditions and in response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in glucose tolerant first-degree relatives (FDR) of T2DM patients and in control subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is based on the clinical study LIMEX (NCT03155412). Non-obese 12 non-diabetic (FDR), and 12 control men without family history of diabetes matched for age and BMI underwent OGTT. Blood samples taken before and at the end of OGTT were used for isolation of circulating CD14(+) and CD14(-) PBMC. In these cells, mRNA levels of 94 genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, immunity, and inflammation were assessed by qPCR. RESULTS: Irrespectively of the group, the majority of analyzed genes had different mRNA expression in CD14(+) PBMC compared to CD14(-) PBMC in the basal (fasting) condition. Seven genes (IRS1, TLR2, TNFα in CD14(+) PBMC; ABCA1, ACOX1, ATGL, IL6 in CD14(-) PBMC) had different expression in control vs. FDR groups. OGTT regulated mRNA levels of nine genes selectively in CD14(+) PBMC and of two genes (ABCA1, PFKL) selectively in CD14(-)PBMC. Differences in OGTT-induced response between FDR and controls were observed for EGR2, CCL2 in CD14(+) PBMC and for ABCA1, ACOX1, DGAT2, MLCYD, and PTGS2 in CD14(-) PBMC. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a different impact of glucose challenge on gene expression in CD14(+) when compared with CD14(-) PBMC fractions and suggested possible impact of family predisposition to T2DM on basal and OGTT-induced gene expression in these PBMC fractions. Future studies on these putative alterations of inflammation and lipid metabolism in fractionated PBMC in larger groups of subjects are warranted.","Koc, Michal; Šiklová, Michaela; Šrámková, Veronika; Štěpán, Marek; Krauzová, Eva; Štich, Vladimír; Rossmeislová, Lenka",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),65,1

As of the key role of vitamin D in bone and mineral metabolism, and because the vitamin D status appears to be closely linked with the PCOS manifestations including insulin resistance, obesity, ovulatory and menstrual irregularities, oxidative stress and PTH elevation, hypovitaminosis D may directly and indirectly via the different facets of PCOS impair bone health in these women. Although limited data are available on life-long fracture risk in women with PCOS, the importance of preserving bone health in youth and adults to prevent osteoporosis and related fractures is also recognized in PCOS women. Evidence of the association between vitamin D and the clinical hallmarks of PCOS are summarized and discussed. Vitamin D arises as a cornerstone in women with PCOS and contributes to the pathophysiological link between PCOS and bone metabolism.","Di Bari, Flavia; Catalano, Antonino; Bellone, Federica; Martino, Gabriella; Benvenga, Salvatore",Metabolites,65,0

The GC receptor (GR) is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor family that regulates anti-inflammatory processes and releases pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6. RESULTS: Five putative GR binding sites and other transcriptional factor binding sites were identified on theIL-6 promoter, and dexamethasone (DEX) was noted to reduce the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 production. Among mutant transcriptional factor binding sites, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), activator protein (AP)-1, and specificity protein (Sp)1–2 sites reduced basal and LPS-induced IL-6 promoter activities through various responses. The second GR binding site (GR2) was noted to play a crucial role in both basal and inducible promoter activities in LPS-induced inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that selective GR2 modulator might exert agonistic and antagonistic effects and could activate crucial signaling pathways during the LPS-stimulated inflammatory process.

Our aim was to investigate factors contributing to psychological distress in the working population, with a special reference to gender differences. METHODS: We used questionnaire data from the nationally representative Finnish Regional Health and Well-being Study (ATH) collected in the years 2012–2016 (target population participants aged 20 +, n = 96,668, response rate 53%), restricting the current analysis to those persons who were working full-time and under 65 of age (n = 34,468). Psychological distress was assessed using the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5) (cut-off value <=52). We studied the following factors potentially associated with psychological distress: sociodemographic factors, living alone, having children under18 years of age, lifestyle-related factors, social support, helping others outside of the home and work-related factors. We used logistic regression analysis to examine association between having work-family conflict with the likelihood for psychological distress. We first performed the models separately for men and women. Then interaction by gender was tested in the combined data for those independent variables where gender differences appeared probable in the analyses conducted separately for men and women. RESULTS: Women reported more psychological distress than men (11.0% vs. 8.8%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Loneliness, job dissatisfaction and family-work conflict were associated with the largest risk of psychological distress. Having children, active participation, being able to successfully combine work and family roles, and social support were found to be protective factors. A significant interaction with gender was found in only two variables: ignoring family due to being absorbed in one’s work was associated with distress in women (OR 1.30 (95% CI 1.00–1.70), and mental strain of work in men (OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.66–4.41). CONCLUSIONS: Satisfying work, family life and being able to successfully combine the two are important sources of psychological well-being for both genders in the working population.

Similarly, two allogeneic clonal transmissible cancers have killed thousands of wild Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and also modulate MHC-I expression to evade anti-cancer and allograft responses. IFNG treatment restores MHC-I expression on devil facial tumor (DFT) cells but is insufficient to control tumor growth. Transcriptional co-activator NLRC5 is a master regulator of MHC-I in humans and mice but its role in transmissible cancers remains unknown. In this study, we explored the regulation and role of MHC-I in these unique genetically mis-matched tumors. METHODS: We used transcriptome and flow cytometric analyses to determine how MHC-I shapes allogeneic and anti-tumor responses. Cell lines that overexpress NLRC5 to drive antigen presentation, and B2M-knockout cell lines incapable of presenting antigen on MHC-I were used to probe the role of MHC-I in rare cases of tumor regressions. RESULTS: Transcriptomic results suggest that NLRC5 plays a major role in MHC-I regulation in devils. NLRC5 was shown to drive the expression of many components of the antigen presentation pathway but did not upregulate PDL1. Serum from devils with tumor regressions showed strong binding to IFNG-treated and NLRC5 cell lines; antibody binding to IFNG-treated and NRLC5 transgenic tumor cells was diminished or absent following B2M knockout. CONCLUSION: MHC-I could be identified as a target for anti-tumor and allogeneic immunity. Consequently, NLRC5 could be a promising target for immunotherapy and vaccines to protect devils from transmissible cancers and inform development of transplant and cancer therapies for humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB-approved pilot study included 24 consecutive patients referred for ultrasound-guided injection (Jan 1, 2017–Mar 31, 2018) with anterior hip pain and/or limited hip flexion following arthroscopic treatment for femoroacetabular impingement. They underwent ultrasound-guided pressure injection, releasing post-operative extra-articular adhesions between the joint capsule and flexor tendons along the arthroscopic portal followed by steroid instillation. A visual analogue pain score of 0–10 and standard Hip Outcome Score was used to record treatment response pre-injection, at 6 weeks and at 6 months following injection. RESULTS: Nine out of 11 patients (complete data group) who answered all questionnaires showed response to injection with improvement in Hip Outcome Scores at 6 weeks and 6 months. Three out of 10 patients (incomplete data group) showed significant response to injection from clinical follow-up records. No records were available in 3 patients. In total, 12 (57.14%) out of 21 patients showed response to injection. No post-procedure complications. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided pressure injection is a novel, safe, and effective procedure providing pain relief and improved hip movement as evaluated in our small sample study. The limitations of this pilot project include small sample size, lack of control group, short 6-month follow-up, and single institution study. This minimally invasive technique could be a cost-effective alternative to surgical adhesiolysis and can potentially be extended for extra-articular adhesions at other peripheral joints, amenable to ultrasound.","M V Reddy, Santhosh; Ayeni, Olufemi; Vatturi, Sri Sannihita; Yu, Hang; Choudur, Hema N",Skeletal Radiol,65,8

The main reason is that social behavior is complex and time-consuming. We are currently using the nests built by animals living together, a species-typical behavior naturally occurring in standard housing conditions, to monitor them. Here, we provide an example of its use to evaluate social deficits and the long-term effects of a neonatal tactile-proprioceptive sensorial treatment from postnatal day 1 to 21, in male and female adult mice modeling Alzheimer’s disease compared to mice with normal aging. Social nesting was worse in the mutants, mostly in males, since the number of days needed to build a perfect nest was longer or unsuccessful in a three-day test. Early life intervention was successful. Social nesting, easily included in housing routines, can be a useful tool to assess animal welfare, monitor disease progress, and evaluate potential risk factors and effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies. Other advantages, such as being a noninvasive, painless, simple, short, and low-cost, rend social nesting feasible to be implemented in most animal department settings. ABSTRACT: The assessment of welfare and disease progression in animal models is critical. Most tools rely on evaluating individual subjects, whereas social behaviors, also sensitive to acute illness, chronic diseases, or mental health, are scarcely monitored because they are complex and time-consuming. We propose the evaluation of social nesting, a species-typical behavior naturally occurring in standard housing conditions, for such behavioral monitoring. We provide an example of its use to evaluate social deficits and the long-term effects of neonatal tactile-proprioceptive sensorial stimulation from postnatal day 1 to 21, in male and female adult 3xTg-AD mice for Alzheimer’s disease compared to sex- and age-matched non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging. Social nesting was sensitive to genotype (worse in 3xTg-AD mice), sex (worse in males), profile, and treatment (distinct time to observe the maximum score and incidence of the perfect nest). Since social nesting can be easily included in housing routines, this neuroethological approach can be useful for animal welfare, monitoring the disease’s progress, and evaluating potential risk factors and effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies. Finally, the noninvasive, painless, simple, short time, and low-cost features of this home-cage monitoring are advantages that make social nesting feasible to be successfully implemented in most animal department settings.","Giménez-Llort, Lydia; Torres-Lista, Virginia",Animals (Basel),65,1

Biochemical markers of cardiac dysfunction are associated with high mortality in many respiratory conditions. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the link between elevated biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction in ARDS and mortality. METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases was performed. We included studies of adult intensive care patients with ARDS that reported the risk of death in relation to a measured biomarker of cardiac dysfunction. The primary outcome of interest was mortality up to 60 days. A random-effects model was used for pooled estimates. Funnel-plot inspection was done to evaluate publication bias; Cochrane chi-square tests and I(2) tests were used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review and 18 in the meta-analysis. Biomarkers of cardiac stretch included NT-ProBNP (nine studies) and BNP (six studies). Biomarkers of cardiac injury included Troponin-T (two studies), Troponin-I (one study) and High-Sensitivity-Troponin-I (three studies). Three studies assessed multiple cardiac biomarkers. High levels of NT-proBNP and BNP were associated with a higher risk of death up to 60 days (unadjusted OR 8.98; CI 4.15-19.43; p<0.00001). This association persisted after adjustment for age and illness severity. Biomarkers of cardiac injury were also associated with higher mortality, but this association was not statistically significant (unadjusted OR 2.21; CI 0.94-5.16; p= 0.07). CONCLUSION: Biomarkers of cardiac stretch are associated with increased mortality in ARDS.

Despite this major dietary shift, we know relatively little about food and nutrient intake in infants worldwide and virtually nothing about the impact of baby food “pouches” and “baby-led weaning” (BLW), which are infant feeding approaches that are becoming increasingly popular. Pouches are squeezable containers with a plastic spout that have great appeal for parents, as evidenced by their extraordinary market share worldwide. BLW is an alternative approach to introducing solids that promotes infant self-feeding of whole foods rather than being fed purées, and is popular and widely advocated on social media. The nutritional and health impacts of these novel methods of infant feeding have not yet been determined. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the First Foods New Zealand study is to determine the iron status, growth, food and nutrient intakes, breast milk intake, eating and feeding behaviors, dental health, oral motor skills, and choking risk of New Zealand infants in general and those who are using pouches or BLW compared with those who are not. METHODS: Dietary intake (two 24-hour recalls supplemented with food photographs), iron status (hemoglobin, plasma ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor), weight status (BMI), food pouch use and extent of BLW (questionnaire), breast milk intake (deuterium oxide “dose-to-mother” technique), eating and feeding behaviors (questionnaires and video recording of an evening meal), dental health (photographs of upper and lower teeth for counting of caries and developmental defects of enamel), oral motor skills (questionnaires), and choking risk (questionnaire) will be assessed in 625 infants aged 7.0 to 9.9 months. Propensity score matching will be used to address bias caused by differences in demographics between groups so that the results more closely represent a potential causal effect. RESULTS: This observational study has full ethical approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committees New Zealand (19/STH/151) and was funded in May 2019 by the Health Research Council (HRC) of New Zealand (grant 19/172). Data collection commenced in July 2020, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2022.

Dissociation kinetics depended on sequence, increased exponentially with temperature, and transition-state parameters inversely correlated to thermodynamic parameters (r = −0.99). Association had no consistent enthalpic component, varied little with temperature or sequence, and poorly correlated to thermodynamic parameters (r = 0.28). Average association rates decreased 78% in MgCl(2) compared to NaCl while dissociation was relatively insensitive to ionic conditions.

Twenty-one patients with serologically or ultrasonographically verified HT and 16 controls with non-toxic goiter or postsurgical hypothyroidism were recruited for this study. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine, as well as thyroid autoantibodies (thyroglobulin antibodies and thyroid peroxidase antibodies), were assayed. Alexithymia, depression, anxiety, and HRQoL were assessed with Toronto Alexithymia Scale; Beck Depression Inventory, second edition; Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; and Health Survey Short-Form 36, respectively. A negative relationship between the difficulty to describe feelings and the cognitive component of depression was found (r = -0.46, p = 0.04). Besides, patients with seronegative HT had lower somatic anxiety than patients with HT who tested positive (r = -0.68, p = 0.01 and r = -0.59, p = 0.04, respectively). Besides, no statistically significant difference was found between patients with HT and controls with regard to somatic anxiety. The present study suggests the relevance of alexithymia in patients suffering from HT, which may be intertwined with a possible state of underreported depression that is mainly expressed through physical complaints. Promoting the capability to describe and communicate feelings could contribute to psychological elaboration and coping with the disease and, consequently, to the improvement of self-management and perceived HRQoL.","Martino, Gabriella; Caputo, Andrea; Vicario, Carmelo M.; Feldt-Rasmussen, Ulla; Watt, Torquil; Quattropani, Maria C.; Benvenga, Salvatore; Vita, Roberto",Front Psychol,65,1

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP’s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.","Sebastiani, Federica; Yanez Arteta, Marianna; Lerche, Michael; Porcar, Lionel; Lang, Christian; Bragg, Ryan A.; Elmore, Charles S.; Krishnamurthy, Venkata R.; Russell, Robert A.; Darwish, Tamim; Pichler, Harald; Waldie, Sarah; Moulin, Martine; Haertlein, Michael; Forsyth, V.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent apoptosis play pivotal role in virus infection. However, the protective mechanisms of intestinal damage caused by RV are poorly defined, especially the molecular pathways related to enterocytes apoptosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of sodium butyrate (SB) on RV-induced apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. RESULTS: The RV infection led to significant cell apoptosis, increased the expression levels of ER stress (ERS) markers, phosphorylated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), caspase9, and caspase3. Blocking PERK pathway using specific inhibitor GSK subsequently reversed RV-induced cell apoptosis. The SB treatment significantly inhibited RV-induced ERS by decreasing the expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), PERK, and eIF2α. In addition, SB treatment restrained the ERS-mediated apoptotic pathway, as indicated by downregulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA level, as well as decreased cleaved caspase9 and caspase3 protein levels. Furthermore, siRNA-induced GPR109a knockdown significantly suppressed the protective effect of SB on RV-induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that SB exerts protective effects against RV-induced cell apoptosis through inhibiting ERS mediated apoptosis by regulating PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway via GPR109a, which provide new ideas for the prevention and control of RV.","Zhao, Ye; Hu, Ningming; Jiang, Qin; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Ming; Jiang, Jun; Xiong, Manyi; Yang, Mingxian; Yang, Jiandong; Shen, Linyuan; Zhang, Shunhua; Niu, Lili; Chen, Lei; Chen, Daiwen",J Anim Sci Biotechnol,65,1

METHODS: Data on trends of antimicrobial susceptibility among bacteria causing HAIs events in children and adults at three tertiary private hospitals located in Riyadh and Qassim, Saudi Arabia, were collected retrospectively between 2015 and 2019 using the surveillance data datasets. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, 38,624 pathogens caused 17,539 HAI events in 17,566 patients. About 9450 (53.8%) of patients who suffered HAIs were females and the average age was 41.7 ± 14.3 years (78.1% were adults and 21.9% were children).

Gram-negative isolates were mostly sensitive to tigecycline (95%) whereas they were resistant to cefotaxime (49.5%) and cefixime (59.6%). During the 5 years, there were relatively stable susceptibility patterns to all tested antimicrobials, except for cefotaxime which shown a susceptibility reduction by 41.4%, among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. An increase in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter and Enterobacter and Citrobacter species to all studied antimicrobials was observed except for colistin that had a slight sensitivity reduction in 2019 by 4.3% against Acinetobacter species. However, we noted reduced sensitivity of MRSA, CoNS and Enterococcus species to gentamicin; and increased resistance of MRSA to linezolid and vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in susceptibility of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to studied antimicrobials is important; however, reduced sensitivity of MRSA, CoNS and Enterococcus species to gentamicin; and increased resistance of MRSA to linezolid and vancomycin is a serious threat and calls for effective antimicrobial stewardship programs.","Alhumaid, Saad; Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Alawi, Zainab; Alzahrani, Ahmad J.; Tobaiqy, Mansour; Alresasi, Ahmed M.; Bu-Shehab, Ibrahim; Al-Hadary, Issa; Alhmeed, Naif; Alismail, Mossa; Aldera, Ahmed H.; AlHbabi, Fadhil; Al-Shammari, Haifa; Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Omari, Awad",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,65,1

Recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology have offered many new opportunities for BT. Methods: In this work, we developed a biomimetic nanotheranostic platform for enhanced BT. Core-shell Au@AuPd nanospheres (CANS) were synthesized and then encapsulated in platelet (PLT)-derived plasma membranes. Results: The resulting PLT/CANS nanoparticles efficiently evaded immune clearance and specifically accumulated in tumor tissues due to the targeting capabilities of the PLT membrane coating. Under endoscopic guidance, a BT needle was manipulated to deliver appropriate radiation doses to orthotopic colon tumors while sparing surrounding organs. Accumulated PLT/CANS enhanced the irradiation dose deposition in tumor tissue while alleviating tumor hypoxia by catalyzing endogenous H(2)O(2) to produce O(2). After treatment with PLT/CANS and BT, 100% of mice survived for 30 days. Conclusions: Our work presents a safe, robust, and efficient strategy for enhancing BT outcomes when adapted to treatment of intracavitary and unresectable tumors.","Lyu, Meng; Chen, Mingzhu; Liu, Lujie; Zhu, Daoming; Wu, Xianjia; Li, Yang; Rao, Lang; Bao, Zhirong",Theranostics,65,1

OBJECTIVES: We investigated private household wells in the region, determining the extent, sources, and risk factors of nitrate and microbial contamination. METHODS: Total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and nitrate were evaluated by synoptic sampling during groundwater recharge and no-recharge periods. Additional seasonal sampling measured genetic markers of human and bovine fecal-associated microbes and enteric zoonotic pathogens. We constructed multivariable regression models of detection probability (log-binomial) and concentration (gamma) for each contaminant to identify risk factors related to land use, precipitation, hydrogeology, and well construction. RESULTS: Total coliforms and nitrate were strongly associated with depth-to-bedrock at well sites and nearby agricultural land use, but not septic systems. Both human wastewater and cattle manure contributed to well contamination. Rotavirus group A, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella were the most frequently detected pathogens. Wells positive for human fecal markers were associated with depth-to-groundwater and number of septic system drainfield within [Formula: see text]. Manure-contaminated wells were associated with groundwater recharge and the area size of nearby agricultural land. Wells positive for any fecal-associated microbe, regardless of source, were associated with septic system density and manure storage proximity modified by bedrock depth. Well construction was generally not related to contamination, indicating land use, groundwater recharge, and bedrock depth were the most important risk factors. DISCUSSION: These findings may inform policies to minimize contamination of the Silurian dolomite aquifer, a major water supply for the U.S. and Canadian Great Lakes region. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7813","Borchardt, Mark A.; Stokdyk, Joel P.; Kieke, Burney A.; Muldoon, Maureen A.; Spencer, Susan K.; Firnstahl, Aaron D.; Bonness, Davina E.; Hunt, Randall J.; Burch, Tucker R.",Environ Health Perspect,65,1

In this paper, the first aim is to describe our efforts to test a simple, low-cost intervention to large numbers of women following a major natural disaster. The second aim is to outline the challenges faced and lessons learned during the execution of this natural disaster study. Methods: The setting was the May 2016 Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo wildfire in northern Alberta, Canada. Women who were pregnant or preconception at the time of the disaster were invited to participate via social media. This prospective cohort study included a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention on the levels of prenatal maternal stress and maternal, birth, and early childhood outcomes. At recruitment and at multiple timepoints postpartum, a battery of questionnaires was administered to evaluate objective and subjective stress exposure to the fire as well as maternal mental health, resilience and its contributing factors as well as infant developmental milestones. Qualitative content analysis of the expressive writing was conducted. Discussion: There is an increasing need to develop effective, wide-spread, rapid, and low-cost interventions to reduce prenatal maternal stress, increase resilience, and improve pregnancy outcomes following a natural disaster. Though analysis of data is ongoing, we highlight the strengths of this study which include strong community participation, rapid recruitment of eligible participants, low-cost intervention and data acquisition, and successful testing of the intervention. We acknowledge the challenges we encountered including the high rate of participant disqualifications or losses due to incomplete collection of online data; evacuation, dispersal, and inconsistent return to homes; and the high levels of stress accumulated post-disaster which led to inability to complete the study. Despite potential challenges, there remains a need for such research amid natural disasters.","Hyde, Ashley; Verstraeten, Barbara S.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) protocols are widely used in adult emergency situations to diagnose and guide treatment, but none has been specifically developed for the neonate. We propose a targeted diagnostic ultrasound protocol for the suddenly decompensating infant in the NICU for rapid screening for the most common life-threatening complications needing immediate attention. We integrated current knowledge on the use of POCUS for diagnosis of the most critical neonatal complications into the “SAFE-R protocol” (Sonographic Assessment of liFe-threatening Emergencies — Revised). The ultrasound algorithm was evaluated at the bedside for suitability and ease of use. Main features of SAFE-R are the use of standardized ultrasound points and a simple one-probe rule-in/rule-out approach. The flowchart is designed by order of urgency and priority is given to treatable causes. Hence, ruling out cardiac tamponade is the first step in the decision tree, followed by pneumothorax, pleural effusion, then acute critical aortic occlusion, acute abdominal complications, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage. Conclusion: SAFE-R is the first ultrasound algorithm specifically conceived for use in the NICU to screen for the most common urgent neonatal complications leading to sudden deterioration, thereby providing critical information within minutes. The simplified and rapid approach is designed for the neonatologist and is easy to learn and quick to perform.","Yousef, Nadya; Singh, Yogen; De Luca, Daniele",Eur J Pediatr,65,1

Computed tomography (CT) revealed an anterior mediastinal 32-mm solid mass that was suspected of being thymoma. The clinical features and neurological examination findings confirmed the diagnosis of thymoma-associated MG coexisting with DM. Intensive treatment for MG, including surgery, resulted in an improvement in some of her neurological symptoms.

The experimental prevention group received a long-term daily dose of 50 µg/kg (total dose of 1300 µg/kg), whereas the rescue group underwent a short-term daily dose of 100 µg/kg (total dose of 400 µg/kg). The following oxidative stress parameters were analyzed in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue homogenate (LTH): total oxidative status, total antioxidant response, oxidative stress index, malondialdehyde and total thiols. Results showed that VD significantly reduced oxidative forces and increased the antioxidant capacity in the serum and LTH of treated mice. There was no statistically significant difference between the two types of VD supplementation. VD also exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect in all treated mice, reducing nitric oxide formation in serum and the expression of nuclear factor kappa B p65 in the lung.

Hemiplegia, cerebral hemorrhage, and even death can occur, mainly in the elderly. In this paper, we meta-analyzed the effect of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle function. In this article, we used a topic search method to search for relevant literature on respiratory muscle training and obtained 58 and 32 literature studies from CNKI and Wanfang Data, respectively. As a result of the screening, 36 and 28 documents were obtained. In this paper, 64 selected articles were studied. The authors make statistics on the literature of designing serum content index and multislice spiral CT (Member of the Society of Cardiological Technicians) image of patients, so as to analyze the influence of CT image and inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle function. The study showed that FVC, FEV1, MIP, and diaphragm mobility of the experimental group were significantly improved after treatment in more than 85% of the studies (P < 0.05), while those of the control group were not significantly improved (P > 0.05). The comparison between the two groups after treatment showed that FVC, FEV1, MIP, and diaphragm mobility of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The application of multislice spiral CT image analysis technology can effectively evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory dysfunction in stroke patients, the mechanism of which regulates the expression of related pathways, suppresses the inflammatory response, and can reduce oxidative stress damage. Therefore, respiratory muscle training can improve the function of respiratory muscle and reduce the death rate of cerebellar hemorrhage in patients with stroke and other vascular diseases.","An, Lijuan; Li, Baiyan; Ming, Dan; Wang, Weizhan",J Healthc Eng,65,1

Serum sodium transiently increases postprandially but can also accumulate at sites of inflammation affecting differentiation and function of innate and adaptive immune cells. Here, we focus on how changes in extracellular sodium, mimicking alterations in the circulation and tissues, affect the early metabolic, transcriptional, and functional adaption of human and murine mononuclear phagocytes. METHODS: Using Seahorse technology, pulsed stable isotope-resolved metabolomics, and enzyme activity assays, we characterize the central carbon metabolism and mitochondrial function of human and murine mononuclear phagocytes under HS in vitro. HS as well as pharmacological uncoupling of the electron transport chain under normal salt is used to analyze mitochondrial function on immune cell activation and function (as determined by Escherichia coli killing and CD4(+) T cell migration capacity). In 2 independent clinical studies, we analyze the effect of a HS diet during 2 weeks (URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02509962) and short-term salt challenge by a single meal (URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT04175249) on mitochondrial function of human monocytes in vivo. RESULTS: Extracellular sodium was taken up into the intracellular compartment, followed by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in murine and human macrophages. Mechanistically, HS reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, electron transport chain complex II activity, oxygen consumption, and ATP production independently of the polarization status of macrophages. Subsequently, cell activation is altered with improved bactericidal function in HS-treated M1-like macrophages and diminished CD4(+) T cell migration in HS-treated M2-like macrophages. Pharmacological uncoupling of the electron transport chain under normal salt phenocopies HS-induced transcriptional changes and bactericidal function of human and murine mononuclear phagocytes. Clinically, also in vivo, rise in plasma sodium concentration within the physiological range reversibly reduces mitochondrial function in human monocytes. In both a 14-day and single meal HS challenge, healthy volunteers displayed a plasma sodium increase of [Image: see text] and [Image: see text] respectively, that correlated with decreased monocytic mitochondrial oxygen consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify the disturbance of mitochondrial respiration as the initial step by which HS mechanistically influences immune cell function. Although these functional changes might help to resolve bacterial infections, a shift toward proinflammation could accelerate inflammatory cardiovascular disease.","Geisberger, Sabrina; Bartolomaeus, Hendrik; Neubert, Patrick; Willebrand, Ralf; Zasada, Christin; Bartolomaeus, Thomas; McParland, Victoria; Swinnen, Dries; Geuzens, Anneleen; Maifeld, András; Krampert, Luka; Vogl, Marion; Mähler, Anja; Wilck, Nicola; Markó, Lajos; Tilic, Ekin; Forslund, Sofia K.; Binger, Katrina J.; Stegbauer, Johannes; Dechend, Ralf; Kleinewietfeld, Markus; Jantsch, Jonathan; Kempa, Stefan; Müller, Dominik N.",Circulation,65,8

Given that the disruption of this interaction prevents P. vivax blood-stage infection, a PvDBP-based vaccine development has been well recognized. However, the polymorphic nature of PvDBPII prevents a strain transcending immune response and complicates attempts to design a vaccine. METHODS: Twenty-three P. vivax clinical isolates collected from three areas of Ethiopia were sequenced at the pvdbpII locus. A total of 392 global pvdbpII sequences from seven P. vivax endemic countries were also retrieved from the NCBI archive for comparative analysis of genetic diversity, departure from neutrality, linkage disequilibrium, genetic differentiation, PvDBP polymorphisms, recombination and population structure of the parasite population. To establish a haplotype relationship a network was constructed using the median joining algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 110 variable sites were found, of which 44 were parsimony informative. For Ethiopian isolates there were 12 variable sites of which 10 were parsimony informative. These parsimony informative variants resulted in 10 nonsynonymous mutations. The overall haplotype diversity for global isolates was 0.9596; however, the haplotype diversity was 0.874 for Ethiopia. Fst values for genetic revealed Ethiopian isolates were closest to Indian isolates as well as to Sri Lankan and Sudanese isolates but further away from Mexican, Papua New Guinean and South Korean isolates. There was a total of 136 haplotypes from the 415 global isolates included for this study. Haplotype prevalence ranged from 36.76% to 0.7%, from this 74.2% were represented by single parasite isolates. None of the Ethiopian isolates grouped with the Sal I reference haplotype. From the total observed nonsynonymous mutations 13 mapped to experimentally verified epitope sequences. Including 10 non-synonymous mutations from Ethiopia. However, all the polymorphic regions in Ethiopian isolates were located away from DARC, responsible for junction formation. CONCLUSION: The results of this study are concurrent with the multivalent vaccine approach to design an effective treatment. However, the presence of novel haplotypes in Ethiopian isolates that were not shared by other global sequences warrant further investigation.

We report here the results of a single-center retrospective observational study of the remission rate in pediatric patients with SNRS receiving tacrolimus. Serial renal biopsies from children on tacrolimus therapy were evaluated for tubulointerstitial fibrosis and transforming growth factor-β immunostaining. Of the 16 children with SRNS, 15 went into complete remission after a median of 120 days of therapy. Nine children were able to stop steroids, while the others were on tapering doses. Forty-seven percent had relapses, most of which were steroid-responsive. Serial renal biopsies were obtained from seven children after a median treatment duration of 24 months; two of these children had increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis and four showed increased transforming growth factor-β tissue staining. Children with worsening histological findings were younger. There was no significant association between tacrolimus exposure and biopsy changes, although the average trough level was higher in those children with worsening histological findings. In conclusion, tacrolimus may be a safe and effective alternative agent for inducing remission in children with SRNS. However, caution needs to be taken when prescribing this agent due to its narrow therapeutic index. Serial renal biopsies are necessary to check for subclinical nephrotoxicity, especially in younger children and those with higher trough levels.","Butani, Lavjay; Ramsamooj, Rajendra",Pediatr Nephrol,65,8

Despite this, chronic conditions are often managed in isolation, potentially leading to burden-capacity imbalance and reduced treatment adherence. We aimed to explore, in a low-income population with common comorbidities, how the specific demands of multimorbidity affect burden and capacity as defined by the Cumulative Complexity Model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Qualitative interviews with thirteen rural community health centre patients in Victoria, Australia. Participants were aged between 47–72 years and reported 3–10 chronic conditions. We asked about perceived capacity and burden in managing health. The Theory of Patient Capacity was used to analyse capacity and Normalisation Process Theory to analyse burden. All data specifically associated with the experience of multimorbidity was extracted from each burden and capacity domain. RESULTS: The capacity domains of biography, resource mobilisation and work realisation were important in relation to multimorbidity. Conditions causing functional impairment (e.g. chronic pain, depression) interacted with physical, psychological and financial capacity, leading to biographical disruption and an inability to realise treatment and life work. Despite this, few people had a treatment plan for these conditions. Participants reported that multimorbidity affected all burden domains. Coherence and appraisal were especially challenging due to condition interactions, with clinicians providing little guidance. DISCUSSION: The capacity and burden deficits highlighted by participants were not associated with any specific diagnosis, but were due to condition interactions, coupled with the lack of health provider support to navigate interactions. Physical, psychological and financial capacities were inseparable, but rarely addressed or understood holistically. Understanding and managing condition and treatment interactions was a key burden task for patients but was often difficult, isolating and overwhelming. This suggests that clinicians should become more aware of linkages between conditions, and include generic, synergistic or cross-disciplinary approaches, to build capacity, reduce burden and encourage integrated chronic condition management.","Hardman, Ruth; Begg, Stephen; Spelten, Evelien",PLoS One,65,8

Individuals with the ancestral IFNL4-dG allele are not able to clear HCV in the acute phase and have more than a 90% probability to develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Paradoxically, the IFNL4-dG allele encodes a fully functional IFNλ4 protein with antiviral activity against HCV. Here we describe an effect of IFNλ4 on HCV antigen presentation. Only minor amounts of IFNλ4 are secreted, because the protein is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it induces ER stress. Stressed cells are significantly weaker activators of HCV specific CD8(+) T cells than unstressed cells. This is not due to reduced MHC I surface presentation or extracellular IFNλ4 effects, since T cell responses are restored by exogenous loading of MHC with HCV antigens. Rather, IFNλ4 induced ER stress impairs HCV antigen processing and/or loading onto the MHC I complex. Our results provide a potential explanation for the IFNλ4–HCV paradox.","Chen, Qian; Coto-Llerena, Mairene; Suslov, Aleksei; Teixeira, Raphael Dias; Fofana, Isabel; Nuciforo, Sandro; Hofmann, Maike; Thimme, Robert; Hensel, Nina; Lohmann, Volker; Ng, Charlotte K.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in diverse cellular processes during inflammation. In the present study, we found that miR-302a is an effective suppressor of vascular inflammation in endothelial cells. It was revealed that miR-302a exhibited a lower level in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model and in patients with vascular inflammatory disease. Genetic haploinsufficiency of miR-302 aggravated the LPS-induced vascular inflammatory response in mice, and overexpression of miR-302a attenuated vascular inflammation in mice. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-302a inhibited the synthesis and secretion of adhesion factors in endothelial cells, and suppressed the adhesion of monocytes to endothelium. In the study of molecular mechanism, we found that miR-302a relieved vascular inflammation mainly by regulating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway in endothelial cells. The results showed that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase4 (IRAK4) and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFP91) were the binding targets of miR-302a. MiR-302a prevented the nuclear translocation of NF-κB by inhibiting phosphorylation of IκB kinase complex β (IKKβ) and inhibitors of κBα (IκBα) via targeting IRAK4. In addition, miR-302a downregulated the expression of NF-κB by directly binding with ZFP91. These findings indicate that miR-302a negatively regulates inflammatory responses in the endothelium via the NF-κB pathway and it may be a novel target for relieving vascular inflammation.","Yuan, Jia-Ni; Hong, Yu; Ma, Zhuo-Lin; Pang, Rui-Ping; Lei, Qing-Qing; Lv, Xiao-Fei; Zhou, Jia-Guo; Huang, Hui; Zhang, Ting-Ting",Front Cell Dev Biol,65,28

We, therefore, did this study to assess health extension package utilization and associated factors in the East Gojjam zone, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based mixed cross-sectional study was conducted on households of East Gojjam Zone, from January 1 to April 30, 2020. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 806 study participants in this study. We used EPI info version 7 for data entry and SPSS version 24 software for cleaning and analysis. Variables having a P-value of less than 0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression analysis were fitted into the multivariable logistic regression model. The 95% confidence interval of odds ratio was computed and a variable having P-value less than 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The study showed that 119 (14.8%) respondents have utilized health extension packages. Knowledge health extension package (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.79), residence (AOR = 3.55, 95% CI: 1.99,6.33),visited health post(AOR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.054,2.50), home visited by health extension worker (AOR = 1,68, 95% CI: 1.025,2.74) and involving in model family training(AOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.38,3.215) were significant factors for health extension service utilization. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of health extension service utilization was low since the Ethiopian government recommends 100% health extension service utilization coverage. Knowledge of health extension package, residence, health post-visit, home visit, and model family training were significant factors for health extension service utilization. So expanding the model family training and strict home-to-home visit especially in rural areas may increase the health extension package utilization.","Aynalem, Bewket Yeserah; Melesse, Misganaw Fikrie",PLoS One,65,28

They express various activating and inhibitory receptors on their surface, and the balance of interactions between them and specific ligands displayed on the surface of target cells is critical for NK cell cytolytic function and target cell protection. The CD94/NKG2A heterodimer is one of the inhibitory receptors that interacts with its trimeric ligand consisting of HLA-E, β2m, and a nonameric peptide. Here, multi-microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of eight immune complexes elucidate the subtleties of receptor (NKG2A/CD94)–ligand (HLA-E/β2m/peptide) molecular recognition that mediate the NK cell protection from a geometric and energetic perspective. We identify key differences in the interactions between the receptor and ligand complexes, which are via an entangled network of hydrogen bonds fine-tuned by the ligand-specific nonameric peptide. We further reveal that the receptor protein NKG2A regulates the NK cell activity, while its CD94 partner forms the majority of the energetically important interactions with the ligand. This knowledge rationalizes the atomistic details of the fundamental NK cell protection mechanism and may enable a variety of opportunities in rational-based drug discovery for diverse pathologies including viral infections and cancer and elimination of senescent cells associated with potential treatment of many age-related diseases.","Prašnikar, Eva; Perdih, Andrej; Borišek, Jure",J Chem Inf Model,65,1

In this study, our primary objective was to validate the performance of CASE through a multicenter study in China. METHODS: Between July 2014 and December 2019, 143 consecutive patients with definite neuronal surface antibody-associated AE from three tertiary hospitals were enrolled in the study. We validated the reliability, internal consistency, and validity of CASE. We further compared CASE with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) among different subtypes of AE in terms of its sensitivity to disease dynamics. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and R software. RESULTS: Our analyses showed that CASE had good inter- and intraobserver reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.96/0.98) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.847) at disease onset. The scores of CASE and mRS remained well correlated in patients at admission and at discharge (both r = 0.80, p < 0.001). From admission to discharge, the scores of CASE changed in 81 (56.6%) patients, in comparison to changes in mRS in 48 (33.6%) patients (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001, respectively). The largest changes in scores occurred for non-motor symptoms, including psychiatric, memory, and language dysfunctions (40.6, 26.6, and 23.1% of patients, respectively); in contrast, scores for motor symptoms, such as dyskinesia, weakness and ataxia, changed the least (7.0, 15.4, and 16.1% of patients, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, CASE performed well in assessing the severity of neuronal surface antibody-associated AE. In comparison to mRS, it performed better for non-motor symptoms and was more sensitive to changes in severity.

In laying hens, studies have primarily focused on early development of immune competence and only few have investigated systemic and lymphatic distribution of leukocyte subsets during adolescence and the egg-laying period. The present study determined the number of various leukocyte types in blood, spleen, and cecal tonsils of 10 Lohmann Brown-Classic and 10 Lohmann LSL-Classic hens per wk of life 9/10, 15/16, 23/24, 29/30, and 59/60, encompassing important production as well as developmental stages, by flow cytometry. Although immune traits differed between the 2 hen strains, identical patterns of age-related immunological changes were found. The numbers of all investigated lymphocyte types in the spleen as well as the numbers of blood γδ T cells increased from wk 9/10 to 15/16. This suggests an ongoing release of lymphocytes from primary lymphoid tissues and an influx of blood lymphocytes into the spleen due to novel pathogen encounters during adolescence. A strong decrease in the number of CTL and γδ T cells and an increase in innate immune cells within blood and spleen were found between wk of life 15/16 and 23/24, covering the transition phase to egg-laying activity. Numbers of peripheral and splenic lymphocytes remained low during the egg-laying period or even further decreased, for example blood CD4(+) T cells and splenic γδ T cells. Functional assessments showed that in vitro IFN-γ production of mitogen-stimulated splenocytes was lower in wk 60. Taken together, egg-laying activity seems to alter the immune system toward a more pronounced humoral and innate immune response, with probable consequences for the immunocompetence and thus for productivity, health and welfare of the hens.","Schmucker, Sonja; Hofmann, Tanja; Sommerfeld, Vera; Huber, Korinna; Rodehutscord, Markus; Stefanski, Volker",Poult Sci,65,8

The combination of antifungal drugs may be an interesting and feasible approach to be investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the in vitro activity of amphotericin B in combination with anidulafungin or caspofungin against C. auris. In vitro static time–kill curve experiments were conducted for 48 h with different combinations of amphotericin B with anidulafungin or caspofungin against six blood isolates of C. auris. The antifungal activity of 0.5 mg/L of amphotericin B was limited against the six isolates of C. auris. Similarly, echinocandins alone had a negligible effect, even at the highest tested concentrations. By contrast, 1 mg/L of amphotericin B showed fungistatic activity. Synergy was rapidly achieved (8 h) with 0.5 mg/L of amphotericin B plus 2 mg/L of anidulafungin or caspofungin. These combinations lead to a sustained fungistatic effect, and the fungicidal endpoint was reached against some C. auris isolates. Additionally, ≥0.5 mg/L of either of the two echinocandins with 1 mg/L of amphotericin B resulted in fungicidal effect against all C. auris isolates. In conclusion, combinations of amphotericin B with anidulafungin or caspofungin provided greater killing with a lower dose requirement for amphotericin B compared to monotherapy, with synergistic and/or fungicidal outcomes.","Caballero, Unai; Eraso, Elena; Quindós, Guillermo; Jauregizar, Nerea",Pharmaceutics,65,1

Syringol (6.03%), glutamine (1.71%), methyl laurate (1.79%), methyl palmitate (1.53%), palmitic acid (5.20%), palmitoleic acid (2.80%), and methyl oleate (2.97%) were detected in the unfermented nuts of the T. catappa. Additionally, two of these natural compounds (palmitic acid (4.19%) and palmitoleic acid (1.48%)) survived the fermentation process to emerge in the fermented seeds. The other natural compounds were biotransformed into 2,3-butanediol (1.81%), butyric acid (16.20%), propane-1,3-diol (19.66%), neoheptanol (2.89%), 2-piperidinone (6.63%), palmitoleic acid (1.18%), formamide, n-(p-hydroxyphenethyl)- (2.80%), and cis-vaccenic acid (1.69%) that newly emerged in the fermented seeds. The phytochemical compounds are likely carbon sources for the organisms facilitating the biotransformed molecules and product production.

Enterococcus faecum, and Enterococcus faecalis were the organisms identified as driving the fermentation of the seeds. All strains were gram-positive, catalase-negative, and non-hemolytic, which suggests their harmless nature. N-(p-hydroxyphenethyl)-) was associated with fermentation for the first time, and neoheptanol was discovered as the main alcoholic molecule formed during the fermentation of the seeds.

Abisko virus has a genome organization similar to that of the insect-infecting negeviruses, but phylogenetic and compositional bias analyses also reveal strong affiliations with plant-infecting viruses, such that both the primary host origin and taxonomic identity of the virus remain in doubt. In an extensive set of larval, pupal, and adult autumnal moth and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) outbreak samples, the virus was only detected in a few adult E. autumnata moths as well as the single larval transcriptome.

Little is known, however, about differences in frequencies of viral infection between CC children and those cared for exclusively at home. METHODS: Using surveillance data from the HIVE household cohort in southeast Michigan from 2014–2018 (4 seasons), we analyzed 1022 illness cases from 354 children aged 0–6 years. Age groups were dichotomized as infants (aged <2 years) and toddlers/preschoolers (aged 2–6 years). Households were prospectively enrolled and nasal respiratory swabs were collected from children upon report of acute illness symptoms. We used real-time RT–PCR to test for 18 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: We detected at least one virus in 855 illness cases (83% of all illnesses reported). Age at first illness onset in all four seasons was significantly younger among CC children than homecare children (P < 0.001) across all 4 years (average difference = 1.25 years). CC children <2 years had slightly lower odds of viral detection during illness (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.49, 1.61]) but higher odds at ages 2–6y (1.07 [0.65, 1.76]); neither was statistically significant. Neither CC nor homecare children were significantly more or less at risk for any particular pathogen—expect for rhinovirus in the <2-year group, where odds of rhinovirus infection were 58% lower (OR = 0.42) in CC children compared with homecare counterparts (95% CI, 0.21–0.83). Conversely, CC attendees under 3 more frequently had influenza, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza, and coronavirus; however, none of these associations were significant. Odds of coinfection (> 1 virus detected) were higher among CC children, but not significant (OR = 1.4 [0.63, 2.96] and 1.2 [0.77, 1.88] in <2 year and 2–6 year age groups, respectively). Among all children <7 year, the mean number of pathogens detected was not different between CC and homecare individuals (1.20 vs. 1.23, P = 0.16). CONCLUSION: As expected, results indicated that CC attendees aged 0–6y experienced illness episodes earlier in life compared with homecare children. Our analysis also indicated that, compared with children cared for at home, CC children were less at risk for rhinovirus infection when young but could potentially be at higher risk for viruses of greater clinical concern.

This integrative field builds on and complements comparative immunology by evaluating immunity across levels of biological organization using an evolutionary and ecological framework. One major accomplishment of ecoimmunology has been to demonstrate that immune defenses have costs, and these costs can be context-dependent. As a result, researchers assess immunity not only in terms of specific immune pathways but also as functional, emergent traits, such as resistance against and tolerance of parasites. Ecoimmunology also highlights the importance of integration across physiological systems, including the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems, in the production of immune defenses. The field has demonstrated the importance of genetics, developmental environment, and current conditions to individual variation in immune function and emphasized the traits of species, such as body size, that could be integral to immune phenotypes. Furthermore, ecoimmunological studies have shown that heterogeneity in immunity at the individual and species levels can have important consequences for disease dynamics within populations and communities as well as population cycling. Herein we discuss these key research areas in ecoimmunology as they relate to three central themes: (1) immunity in the context of the whole organism, (2) heterogeneity in immunity, and (3) the broad consequences of individual variation in immunity.

There are, however, many controversies regarding indications for initiating ECMO in this setting and the appropriate management strategies thereafter. Broad indications for ECMO include hypoxia, hypercarbia, and severe air leak syndrome, with hypoxia being the most common. There are many disease-specific considerations when evaluating children for ECMO, but there are currently very few, if any, absolute contraindications. Venovenous rather than veno-arterial ECMO cannulation is the preferred configuration for ECMO support of acute respiratory failure due to its superior side-effect profile. The approach to lung management on ECMO is variable and should be individualized to the patient, with the main goal of reducing the risk of VILI. ECMO is a relatively rare intervention, and there are likely a minimum number of cases per year at a given center to maintain competency. Patients who have prolonged ECMO runs (i.e., greater than 21 days) are less likely to survive, though no absolute duration of ECMO that would mandate withdrawal of ECMO support can be currently recommended.","Friedman, Matthew; Hobson, Michael",Pediatric Critical Care,65,1

Cell surface glycans also serve as cellular receptors involved in the transmission of endocytosis-inducing signals or in the induction of fusion between viral envelope and cellular membrane for some other viruses. In contrast, viruses can use host cell functions to glycosylate viral proteins, which affects viral glycoprotein stability and function during host cell entry.

Our pyramidal model of adversaries, and spherical system of prevention help us to solve this problem.

Primordial level of prevention should be focused to stop entering perpetrator/source of infection/reservoir of pathogen and biological agent/pathogen on defended territory. This is the first line of biodefense, deeply and multiply linked with the strategies of intelligence and deterrence. The primary prevention of biological attack is focused on monitoring and surveillance of potential internal sources of biological agents and bioterrorists.

Resilience is needed as systems and organizations become more complex and interrelated and the consequences of accidents and incidents increase. This paper analyzes the notion of resilience based on a literature survey and an exploration of incidents. In particular, resilience involves the ability of systems to undergo graceful and controlled degradation, the ability to rebound from degradation, the presence of redundancy, the ability to manage margins close to the performance boundaries, the establishment and exploration of common mental models, the presence of flexibility in systems and organizations, and the reduction of complexity and coupling. The paper describes how resilience can be included in system development and operations by considering organizations, technology and human factors. Also, it shows how past strengths and weaknesses can be considered in risk analysis to enhance safety, security and resilience.","Johnsen, Stig",Critical Infrastructure Protection IV,65,17

Given the peculiar characteristics of the lung circulation, with a broad capillary bed, platelets are especially involved with the physiology of the lungs and play a key role in a number of inflammatory lung disorders. The platelet precursors, megakaryocytes, are detected in the lung microcirculation; moreover platelets with their endothelium-protective and vascular reparative activities contribute to the lung capillary blood barrier integrity. Given the function of the lungs as first wall against pathogen invasion, platelets participate in immune defence of the normal lung. On the other hand, platelets may turn into effectors of the inflammatory reaction of the lungs to allergens, to infectious agents, to chemical agents and may contribute strongly to the perpetuation of chronic inflammatory reactions, largely by their ability to interact with other inflammatory cells and the endothelium. In this chapter we provide an overview of the role of platelets in several inflammatory lung disorders discussing the pathophysiologic bases of platelet involvement in these conditions and the experimental and clinical evidence for a role of platelets in lung diseases.","Momi, Stefania; Pitchford, Simon; Gresele, Paolo; Page, Clive P.",Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-Thrombotic Disorders,65,1

Although the common cold is a self-limited infection, there are no effective treatments presently available and complications, missed time from work and school, and overall discomfort are not insignificant. Understanding how infections are transmitted may lead to interventions to reduce rates of infection. In order to establish a route of transmission, certain conditions must be met. The virus must be produced and shed at the site of infection. The virus must be deposited in the environment and be able to survive there. The virus must then be able to reach the portal of entry. Finally, interruption of the proposed route of transmission must reduce the incidence of infection under natural conditions. Applying this framework, there is clear evidence in both experimental and home settings that colds can be transmitted via self-inoculation. A small amount of evidence is available relating to large and small particle aerosol transmission. Because rhinovirus is responsible for half of all colds, it has been used as the model to understand how virus is transmitted from one person to another in experimental settings. Rhinovirus has been shown to infect via self-inoculation following hand-to-hand contact with contaminated hands or hand-to-surface contact with contaminated objects in the environment. Similarly, there is convincing evidence that the self-inoculation method of cold virus transmission occurs in the home environment, where colds arre most often transmitted. Aerosol transmission has been studied in the experimental setting and may provide another, albeit less common method for transmission of rhinovirus infection. As more is understood about the transmission of cold viruses, effective methods to interrupt transmission may be devised.","Pappas, Diane E.; Hendley, J. Owen",Common Cold,65,1

Our study showed that codon usage bias of DEV UL21 had strong bias towards the A-ended or T-ended codons, and GC3s contents of the codon usage bias in DEV UL21 gene were significantly varied compared with those of other 27 reference herpesviruses. The CAI, ENC value of DEV CHv strain UL21 gene is 0.615 and 55.167, respectively, indicating that the codon usage bias of this gene is weak and lowly expressed. The plot of ENC versus GC3S content revealed that DEV UL21 gene is subject to GC compositional constraints.

Infections of the mucosal surfaces of the larynx, trachea, and bronchial tree account for the majority of all infections in this age group and can be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality in certain populations. Many viral upper respiratory tract pathogens can also involve the middle and lower respiratory tract, particularly for children experiencing their first infection with the pathogen. Laryngitis may cause sore throat and hoarse voice but can also be associated with tracheitis and even bronchiolitis as the pathogen, infection, and host responses move further down the respiratory tree. Bronchiolitis may also occur as a separate infection in the lower airways presenting as respiratory distress in a young infant with prominent wheezing. Many respiratory viral diseases occur with seasonal patterns, with most cases occurring in the fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates. In the tropics, some viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), may cause disease sporadically, year round, but epidemics still occur during “rainy” seasons. Bacterial infections can also involve the middle airway. Epiglottitis is a feared condition due to the potential for sudden airway obstruction. Fortunately, the diagnosis of epiglottitis has become quite rare since the introduction of routine childhood immunization against Haemophilus influenzae, serotype B, was once the most common cause of epiglottitis. Bacterial tracheitis can be a secondary bacterial infection following an acute viral infection of the trachea or a consequence of prolonged endotracheal intubation. While the mechanism of injury to the trachea is different, both processes lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, predisposing the patient to a tracheal infection caused by bacteria that normally only colonize the airway.","Tristram, Debra",Introduction to Clinical Infectious Diseases,65,1

Stem nodules formed only on submerged stems of flooded plants (mean of 25 per plant), and did not form on aerial parts, although they were capable of growing and fixing N(2) after drainage of the stems. Root nodules formed on both non‐flooded and flooded plants but were usually decreased in number by flooding (from means of 124 to 51 per plant, respectively). Flooding (and stem‐nodulation) resulted in an increase in shoot (and a decrease in root) dry weight, regardless of rhizobial isolate. Stem nodules were attached by a wide collar of aerenchymatous tissue at the base of the nodule. There were large air spaces in the stem where nodules were subtended and these were continuous with nodule aerenchyma/outer cortex. In addition, aerenchyma and spongy tissue at the base of the nodule connected both flooded and non‐flooded root nodules to large intercellular spaces in the root cortex. The stem and root nodules were ovoid in shape, and essentially aeschynomenoid in type, i.e. the central infected tissue was without uninfected, interstitial cells. Root nodules had a similar structure to stem nodules (although stem nodules were generally larger), and flooded root nodules were approximately twice the size of non‐flooded nodules. The infected tissue of root and stem nodules consisted of spherical, bacteroid‐containing cells containing one or two rod‐shaped bacteroids per peribacteroid unit and prominent organelles. Infection threads were observed in root but not in stem nodules. The cortex of stem and root nodules had an apparent oxygen diffusion barrier, consisting of concentric layers of small cells with interlocking cell walls and few intercellular spaces. Cell layers external to these consisted of larger cells and intercellular spaces, with some spaces being occluded with an electron‐dense material that contained a glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibodies MAC236 and MAC265. The amount of glycoprotein occlusions did not appear to differ between nodule types or treatments, although stem nodules contained intracellular glycoprotein vesicles adjacent to cell walls. The exterior of the nodules consisted of an epidermis of thin flattened cells with occasional lenticels. Amyloplasts were common in lower stem and hypocotyl nodules, but fewer in flooded or non‐flooded root nodules. Upper stem nodules (i.e. those within 6 cm of the water surface) differed from more profoundly submerged stem nodules by having chloroplasts throughout the cortex. Root nodules did not contain chloroplasts, and undifferentiated plastids were found mainly in lower stem nodules.","LOUREIRO, M. F.; JAMES, E. K.; SPRENT, J. I.; FRANCO, A. A.",New Phytol,65,8

SUMMARY: Attempts to establish an immunoprophylaxis for transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection of pigs I. Pathogenicity of the Bl strain after serial passages The Bl strain of TGE virus was propagated for 350 passages in swine thyroid cell cultures. Pathogenicity for newborn piglets was tested after 2, 120, 250, 300 and 350 passages. Pathological lesions observed with passage number 300 were similar to those detected with the virulent field strain. however, in a shorter portion of the small intestine. It did not, however, produce clinical symptoms when administered to newborn piglets. After 350 passages only 1/4 of the middle part of the jejunum is infected without any clinical signs. The results are discussed with respect to the possibility of using the described strain for the development of an immune prophylaxis. RÉSUMÉ: Recherches sur le développement d'une immunoprophylaxie contre la gastroentérite transmissible (TGE) du porc I. Pathogénicité de la souche Bl durant des passages en séries La souche du virus TGE Bl a été atténuée lors de 350 passages en séries dans des cultures cellulaires de glande thyroide du porc. La pathogénicité de la souche a été testée sur des porcelets nouveaux‐nés après 2, 125, 250, 300 et 350 passages. Après le troiscentième passage en culture cellulaire, la souche Bl n'a plus provoqué de signe clinique dans une portée infectée, mais a donné par contre les mêmes lésions pathologiques chez des porcelets maintenus isolés; ces lésions furent toutefois localisées à un secteur raccourci de l'intestin grêle. Après 350 passages, seul un quart de la localisation moyenne du jejunum fut infecté, sans apparition de symptômes cliniques. Les résultats sont discutés en fonction de l'emploi de la souche pour une immunoprophylaxie. RESUMEN: Ensayos para implantar una inmunoprofilaxis frente a la infección por el virus de la gastroenteritis transmisible (GET) de los cerdos I. Patogeneidad de la estirpe Bl en el curso de pases seriados La estirpe Bl del virus de la GET se atenuó en 350 pases seriados por cultivos celulares de tiroides porcinos. Tras 2, 125, 250, 300 y 350 pases, se contrastó la patogeneidad de la cepa para lechones recién nacidos. Aunque tras el pase célulocultural 300° no ocasionaba la estirpe Bl ninguna enfermedad clínica en una ventrigada infectada, sí que aparecían en lechones mantenidos aislados las mismas modificaciones patológicas que con la cepa campal virulenta, aunque solo en un tramo abreviado del intestino delgado. Después de 350 pases solo se infectaba la cuarta parte del tramo mediano del yeyuno, sin llegar a evocar síntomas clínicos. Los resultados se discuten en atención al empleo de la estirpe para una profilaxis inmunológica.","Hess, R. G.; Bachmann, P. A.; Hänichen, T.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,65,8

DATA: We collected two decades of homicide victimisation counts in England and Wales, as broken out for each racial group identified by the Office of National Statistics. We also collected the estimated population size of those groups from the 2001 and 2011 Census. METHODS: We divided the number of homicides in each racial category by the estimated population size of that category, by year, for 20 years, and plotted their relationships. FINDINGS: While White homicide victimisation rates remained low and stable from 2000 through 2019, Black homicide victimisation ranged from 200 to 800% higher than that for the White population during that time period, at an average of 5.6 times higher for Blacks. While Black victimisation dropped by 69% from 2001 to 2012, it almost doubled (79% increase) from 2013 to 2019, rising seven times faster than the White victimisation rate. Asian rates remained stable at about twice as high as White rates. For persons aged 16 to 24, the most recent homicide rate was 24 times higher for Blacks than for Whites. CONCLUSION: None of these rates per 100,000 or ratios has been reported by the Office of National Statistics. If future ONS reporting of homicide rates would include relevant denominators with raw numerators, public understanding of racial disparities in “over-policing” could be informed by potential “under-policing” relative to racial inequalities in homicide risk.","Kumar, Sumit; Sherman, Lawrence W.; Strang, Heather",Camb J Evid Based Polic,65,1

While measures of physical distancing and reduction of in-person contacts were necessary to prevent contraction, they hit residents of care settings particularly hard since visits from family and friends were banned and the risk for loneliness and social isolation increased. In the present study, we therefore gave the voice to nursing home residents and focused on their perceived loneliness and subjective well-being during the crisis. We were both interested in difficulties but also in personal resources and resilience factors that might protect older adults from negative mental health outcomes and help to maintain subjective well-being. A sample of N = 76 residents in care homes in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were interviewed by use of a standardized questionnaire during July and August 2020. Participants reported on their loneliness and life satisfaction during the crisis, on their self-regulatory strategies as well as on personal and social resources (e.g. self-efficacy, generativity, social support). Data will be analyzed by use of regression analysis to predict loneliness and well-being by risk and protective factors. Results will be discussed applying a life-span developmental and systemic perspective to understand the mutual interplay of individual, social and institutional resources to mitigate negative side effects of protective measures on care home residents.","Albert, Isabelle; Hoffmann, Martine; Kornadt, Anna; Murdock, Elke; Nell, Josepha",Innov Aging,65,21

These are messianic—rather than prophetic—utopias that exist not as proclamations or programmes for a distant future but as potentialities immanent in the irreducible excess of the present. While their roots most clearly emanate from the Freirean-inspired ecopedagogy movement, we conceptualize ecopedagogies instead as educational forms that emerge from, negotiate, debate, produce, resist, and/or overcome the shifting and expansive postdigital ecosystems from and to which we write and think. These are expansive ecosystems of humans, postdigital machines, nonhuman animals, minerals, objects, and more; ecosystems that are overdetermined by new forms of ontological hierarchies and capitalism, imperialism, and settler-colonialism. By charting some of the potential lineages, directions, contradictions, and challenges—and by proposing potential lines of educational praxis—we lay a basis for reinvigorated fields of inquiry that moves beyond the existing postdigital literature on the current pandemic.","Jandrić, Petar; Ford, Derek R.",Postdigit Sci Educ,65,1

However, the availability of RT-PCR kits can be known as a problem and false negative results may be encountered. Although CT scan is not a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, given the widespread acquisition of it in the pandemic state, familiarity with different CT findings and possible differential diagnosis is essential in this regard. MAIN TEXT: In this review, we introduced the typical and atypical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia, and discussed the main differential diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging findings in this viral pneumonia showed a broad spectrum, and there are no pathognomonic imaging findings for COVID-19 pneumonia. Although CT scan is not a diagnostic and screening tool, familiarity with different imaging findings and their differential diagnosis can be helpful in a rapid and accurate decision-making.","Shirani, Fattane; Shayganfar, Azin; Hajiahmadi, Somayeh",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,65,1

State-level public health practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to chronic disease, but the extent to which mis-implementation occurring with these programs is largely unknown. Mis-implementation refers to ending effective programs and policies prematurely or continuing ineffective ones. METHODS: A 2018 comprehensive survey assessing the extent of mis-implementation and multi-level influences on mis-implementation was reported by state health departments (SHDs). Questions were developed from previous literature. Surveys were emailed to randomly selected SHD employees across the Unites States. Spearman’s correlation and multinomial logistic regression were used to assess factors in mis-implementation. RESULTS: Half (50.7%) of respondents were chronic disease program managers or unit directors. Forty nine percent reported that programs their SHD oversees sometimes, often or always continued ineffective programs. Over 50% also reported that their SHD sometimes or often ended effective programs. The data suggest the strongest correlates and predictors of mis-implementation were at the organizational level. For example, the number of organizational layers impeded decision-making was significant for both continuing ineffective programs (OR=4.70; 95% CI=2.20, 10.04) and ending effective programs (OR=3.23; 95% CI=1.61, 7.40). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that changing certain agency practices may help in minimizing the occurrence of mis-implementation. Further research should focus on adding context to these issues and helping agencies engage in appropriate decision-making. Greater attention to mis-implementation should lead to greater use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of resources, ultimately to improve health outcomes.

IDEO.org’s teams of professionals (e.g., industrial designers or business strategists) develop innovative products and services for implementation by partners serving low-income communities. IDDS teaches people from diverse backgrounds (e.g., farmers, mechanics, students, teachers, doctors, and artisans) to create technologies and launch enterprises for poverty alleviation. The objective is not to determine which approach is better, but to determine what can be learned from IDEO.org about designing with established organizations, and from IDDS about teaching budding innovators to be grassroots change agents.","Vechakul, Jessica; Agogino, Alice",The Future of Transdisciplinary Design,65,1

The increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), further amplify the inflammation. We evaluated the dose response relationship of IL-1β and TNF-α levels and severity of airflow limitation, and differential responses in IL-1β and TNF-α between biomass COPD (BMS-COPD) and tobacco smoke COPD (TS-COPD) using a case control design in 160 subjects. Patients with COPD had higher serum levels of both IL-1β and TNF-α compared to healthy controls. A large difference in TNF-α was observed between TS-COPD and BMS-COPD, where TS-COPD patients had much higher levels. Serum IL-1β levels were higher in BMS-COPD. Levels of IL-1β correlated better with severity of airflow limitation than TNF-α levels. Both TNF-α and IL-1β levels had a negative linear relationship with Forced Expiratory Volume in 1st second (FEV1) and six-minute walk distance. The correlations were stronger with FEV1 than six-minute walk distance. The correlations of TNF-α and IL-1β with St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores and body mass index (BMI) were not significant. In conclusion, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β are differently elevated in TS-COPD and BMS-COPD, respectively.","Shyam Prasad Shetty, Bellipady; Chaya, Sindaghatta Krishnarao; Kumar V, Sravan; Mahendra, Maheswarappa; Jayaraj, Biligere Siddaiah; Lokesh, Komarla Sundararaja; Ganguly, Koustav; Mahesh, Padukudru Anand",Toxics,65,24

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology workflow, working pattern, training and continuing professional development (CPD) activities, as well as personal well-being of the radiologists during the pandemic. Material and Methods: Questionnaire designed to gather the opinions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed to radiologists throughout the world in electronic format. Anonymized responses were obtained and analyzed. Two hundred radiologists, working in 17 different countries, responded to our questionnaire. Majority of the respondents were from India (72.8%) and 70% of the them were in the age group of 25–45 years. About 80% of respondents felt that they were well protected or moderately well protected in terms of the personal protective equipment (PPE), however, most of them felt that the use of PPE had affected their ability to work. Similar number of radiologists felt that there was significant reduction in the radiology workload. More than half of the respondents felt that their working patterns were altered by the pandemic with drastic impact on teaching, CPD activities, and personal well-being.

Green spaces are obligatory landscapes in an urban structure that provide a natural environment and accelerate other life events. In contrast, unplanned urbanization, and conversion from green to grey structures have damaged natural environmental resources. Studies through different angles have highlighted the importance of urban green spaces for human well-being but now need to identify their role according to the potential. The demands of urban green spaces may differ with the change of population size, types of grey structure, urban expansion, the altitude of the place, and geographical location. Therefore, this systematic review aims to analyse the significance of urban green spaces for human well-being. The study opted for a systematic process during the selection and organization of studies for this review. After analysing, 46 studies were finalized with the consensus of three review authors. Accordingly, literature was analysed under the central theme of “Urban Green Spaces for Human Well-being.” Human Well-being was assessed under six sub-themes; physical, psychological, mental, social, subjective, and environmental well-being. The review concluded that urban green spaces are the primary pillar for a sustainable urban place and human well-being due to highly positive and positive correlations. Moreover, the study did not find any demarcation line between green spaces and grey structures according to any specific need. Therefore, the study suggested that the role of urban green spaces for human well-being should be analysed according to their potential and required optimal ratio under different communities’ urban specific environments and social behaviour.","Jabbar, Muhammad; Yusoff, Mariney Mohd; Shafie, Aziz",GeoJournal,65,8

We assess feasibility and outcomes for ACTIVE. METHODS: Mixed methods comprised a randomised feasibility trial with qualitative process evaluation and a nested fatigue risk substudy. Participants at a higher risk of fatigue were allocated 2:1 to behavioural intervention or information alone. Participants at a lower risk of fatigue entered the fatigue risk substudy. Feasibility was assessed by rates of eligibility, recruitment, retention and adherence. Qualitative interviews explored acceptability of the intervention and trial processes. Measures of fatigue, anxiety, depression, quality of life and self-efficacy were self-reported before, during and 10 days, 3 weeks and 6 months after radiotherapy. Pre-treatment fatigue risk score and post-treatment fatigue were correlated. RESULTS: Fifty percent (n = 75) of eligible patients were recruited with 33 higher risk participants randomised to the trial and 42 entering the fatigue risk score substudy. Trial design and methods were feasible and acceptable with 91% of participants completing all measures according to protocol. Fatigue was clinically-significantly lower in the intervention group during, and in the weeks after, treatment compared to the control: all secondary measures favoured the intervention group. Positive group differences were not maintained at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Our targeted approach to fatigue self-management is feasible and acceptable within the early breast cancer pathway.

Most CS patients have mutations in SUR2, the major component of skeletal muscle KATP, but the consequences of SUR2 GOF in skeletal muscle are unknown. (2) Methods: We performed in vivo and ex vivo characterization of skeletal muscle in heterozygous SUR2[A478V] (SUR2(wt/AV)) and homozygous SUR2[A478V] (SUR2(AV/AV)) CS mice. (3) Results: In SUR2(wt/AV) and SUR2(AV/AV) mice, forelimb strength and diaphragm amplitude movement were reduced; muscle echodensity was enhanced. KATP channel currents recorded in Flexor digitorum brevis fibers showed reduced MgATP-sensitivity in SUR2(wt/AV), dramatically so in SUR2(AV/AV) mice; IC(50) for MgATP inhibition of KATP currents were 1.9 ± 0.5 × 10(−5) M in SUR2(wt/AV) and 8.6 ± 0.4 × 10(−6) M in WT mice and was not measurable in SUR2(AV/AV). A slight rightward shift of sensitivity to inhibition by glibenclamide was detected in SUR2(AV/AV) mice. Histopathological and qPCR analysis revealed atrophy of soleus and tibialis anterior muscles and up-regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA in CS mice. (4) Conclusions: SUR2[A478V] “knock-in” mutation in mice impairs KATP channel modulation by MgATP, markedly so in SUR2(AV/AV), with atrophy and non-inflammatory edema in different skeletal muscle phenotypes.","Scala, Rosa; Maqoud, Fatima; Zizzo, Nicola; Passantino, Giuseppe; Mele, Antonietta; Camerino, Giulia Maria; McClenaghan, Conor; Harter, Theresa M.; Nichols, Colin G.; Tricarico, Domenico",Cells,65,1

AIM To reveal the symptoms of musculoskeletal system in COVID-19 patients, to evaluate myalgia, arthralgia and physical/mental fatigue, to assess handgrip muscle strength, and to examine the relations of these parameters with the severity and laboratory values of the disease. DESIGN This study was designed as a cross-sectional, single-center case series. SETTING This study took place from May 15,2020, to June 30, 2020 at the Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Pandemia Services. POPULATION Hospitalized 150 adults with laboratory and radiological confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to WHO interim guidance were included in the study. METHODS The disease severity 2007 idsa/ats guidelines for community acquired pneumonia was used. Myalgia severity was assessed by numerical rating scale (NRS). Visual analog scale and Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) were used for fatigue severity determination. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured by Jamar hand dynamometer. RESULTS 103 patients (68.7%) were non-severe and 47 patients (31.3%) were severe. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue (133 [85.3%]), followed by myalgia (102 [68.0%]), arthralgia (65 [43.3%]) and back pain (33 [22.0%]). Arthralgia, which was mostly notable at wrist (25 [16.7%]), ankle (24 [16.0%]) and knee (23 [15.3%]) joints, was significantly higher among the severe group. Severe myalgia was prevalent among myalgia sufferers regardless of COVID-19 severity. The physical fatigue severity score was significantly higher in severe cases, whereas this difference was not significant in mental fatigue score. Female patients with severe infection had ""lower"" grip strength, whereas grip strength among males did not differ significantly between non-severe and severe COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless the mean values in both genders and in age decades were below the specified normative values. CRP, ferritin, and LDH levels were significantly higher in women with ""lower"" grip strength compared to the ""normal"" group. CONCLUSIONS Aside from other multi-systemic symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms are quite common in patients with COVID-19. Patients have severe ischemic myalgia regardless of disease activity. Although there is a muscle weakness in all patients, the loss of muscle function is more of a problem among women in connection with disease severity. Muscular involvement in coronavirus disease is a triangle of myalgia, physical fatigue, and muscle weakness. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Muscle involvement in COVID-19 patients does not mean only myalgia but also a combination of physical fatigue and muscle weakness, and this should be considered in planning the rehabilitation strategies of COVID-19 patients.","Tuzun, Sansin; Keles, Aslinur; Okutan, Dilara; Yildiran, Tugbay; Palamar, Deniz",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,65,17

Animals lose their natural habitats due to extensive landscape changes, consequently crowding them together and increasing their interaction with humans. Additionally, it is also important to emphasise the increasing concern on climate change because climate can modify the distribution and intensity of other diseases such as vector-borne disease. Unfortunately, the global resources for biodiversity conservation were diluted by government support for activities harmful to the environment. A tragic example is from the Amazon rainforest, that experienced fast environmental depletion and high social inequalities. Extractive systems and extensive land use on a large scale have induced deforestation, great loss of biodiversity, carbon emission, and water contamination, leading to indigenous land dispossession, violence, and rural-urban migration. The deforested areas in the Amazon region increase considerably at an alarming speed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic is an evidence to show how viruses and pathogens move further and faster than before, which means we must also show a quick response. It requires financing and, mostly, changes in human behaviour. The message is simple: we need to rethink our current relationship with nature and with ourselves, which should lead to a social transformation towards the sustainable use of the available resources.","Lorenz, Camila; de Oliveira Lage, Mariana; Chiaravalloti-Neto, Francisco",The Science of the total environment,65,1

The modules were implemented as part of a multicomponent quality improvement initiative across a six-hospital health system. This article describes the development and evaluation of this educational intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinician education modules targeting surgical prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists were developed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team. Clinicians were invited to participate in an evaluation survey after completing the modules. Survey items assessed clinicians' rating of the module and intention to change clinical practice because of the module. Quantitative and qualitative survey responses were analyzed by the study team. RESULTS A total of 2119 clinicians completed the module and 1831 of these clinicians (86.4%) completed the survey. Of clinicians completing the survey, 65.6% reported that they intend to change clinical practice after completing the module. Intended changes were related to increased knowledge and awareness, provider empowerment, opioid prescribing practices, nonopioid prescribing practices, and patient education. Many clinicians who indicated they do not intend to change practice reported that their clinical practices were already in line with module recommendations. Some clinicians did not perceive the module to be relevant to their role. CONCLUSIONS Module completion was associated with the intention to improve clinical practice in areas related to provider empowerment, opioid prescribing, nonopioid prescribing, and patient education. Evaluation data will inform future module improvements. There is an opportunity to ensure that all clinicians, including those who are not prescribers, recognize their role in opioid stewardship.","Shallcross, Meagan L; Stulberg, Jonah J; Schäfer, Willemijn L A; Buckley, Barbara A; Huang, Reiping; Bilimoria, Karl Y; Johnson, Julie K",The Journal of surgical research,65,1

METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly allocated to 6% HES solutions or alternative i.v. fluids in patients undergoing surgery. Ovid Medline, Embase, Cinhal, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for trials comparing 6% HES with clinically relevant non-starch comparator. The primary end-point was hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and author-defined AKI. Pre-defined subgroups were cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. RESULTS Four hundred and fifty-six papers were identified; of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 1567 patients were included in the analysis. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as a difference of proportions [risk difference (RD)]. There was no difference in hospital mortality [RD 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02, 0.02], requirement for RRT (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04, 0.02), or AKI (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06) between compared arms overall or in predefined subgroups. CONCLUSIONS We did not identify any differences in the incidence of death or AKI in surgical patients receiving 6% HES. Included studies were small with low event rates and low risk of heterogeneity. Narrow CIs suggest that these findings are valid. Given the absence of demonstrable benefit, we are unable to recommend the use of 6% HES solution in surgical patients.","Gillies, M A; Habicher, M; Jhanji, S; Sander, M; Mythen, M; Hamilton, M; Pearse, R M",British journal of anaesthesia,65,1

This study investigated the mechanism by which these cytokines act to impede RV. Although IL-18 and IL-22 induce each other's expression, we found that IL-18 and IL-22 both impeded RV independently of one another and did so by distinct mechanisms that involved activation of their cognate receptors in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). IL-22 drove IEC proliferation and migration toward villus tips, which resulted in increased extrusion of highly differentiated IEC that serve as the site of RV replication. In contrast, IL-18 induced cell death of RV-infected IEC thus directly interrupting the RV replication cycle, resulting in spewing of incompetent virus into the intestinal lumen and causing a rapid drop in the number of RV-infected IEC. Together, these actions resulted in rapid and complete expulsion of RV, even in hosts with severely compromised immune systems. These results suggest that a cocktail of IL-18 and IL-22 might be a means of treating viral infections that preferentially target short-lived epithelial cells.","Zhang, Zhan; Zou, Jun; Shi, Zhenda; Zhang, Benyue; Etienne-Mesmin, Lucie; Wang, Yanling; Shi, Xuyan; Shao, Feng; Chassaing, Benoit; Gewirtz, Andrew T",Science immunology,65,29

However, little is known about the impact of the pandemic on the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD), especially in high-risk samples such as U.S. military veterans. METHODS Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with incident and chronic probable AUD were examined. RESULTS A total of 6.9 % (n = 183) of veterans were classified as chronic probable AUD, 3.2 % (n = 85) as remitted from AUD, and 2.7 % (n = 71) as incident probable AUD during the pandemic; the prevalence of probable AUD in the full sample remained stable -10.1 % pre-pandemic and 9.6 % peri-pandemic. Younger age, greater pre-pandemic alcohol use severity, and COVID-related stressors were associated with incident AUD during the pandemic, whereas higher pre-pandemic household income was associated with lower risk of this outcome. Younger age, combat experience, lifetime substance use disorder, greater drug use severity, lower dispositional optimism, and more COVID-related worries and social restriction stress were associated with higher risk of chronic AUD. CONCLUSIONS Nearly 1-in-10 US veterans screened positive for AUD 1-year into the pandemic; however, the pre- and 1-year peri-pandemic prevalence of probable AUD remained stable. Veterans who are younger, have served in combat roles, endorse more COVID-related stressors, and have fewer socioeconomic resources may be at higher risk for AUD during the pandemic.","Na, Peter J; Norman, Sonya B; Nichter, Brandon; Hill, Melanie L; Rosen, Marc I; Petrakis, Ismene L; Pietrzak, Robert H",Drug and alcohol dependence,65,31

Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging is an emerging molecular MRI technique that can detect various metabolites and proteins in vivo. However, the role of CEST imaging for TSC-associated epilepsy has not been assessed. Here, we aim to investigate the feasibility of applying CEST imaging to TSC-associated epilepsy, optimize the CEST acquisition parameters, and provide an analysis method for exploring the dominant molecular contributors to the CEST signal measured. Nine TSC epilepsy patients were scanned on a 3-T MRI system. The CEST saturation frequencies were swept from -6 to 6 ppm with 12 different combinations of saturation power (4, 3, 2 and 1 μT) and duration (1000, 700 and 400 ms). Furthermore, a two-stage simulation method based on the seven-pool Bloch-McConnell model was proposed to assess the contribution of each exchangeable pool to the CEST signal in normal-appearing white matter and cortical tubers, which avoided the complexity and uncertainty of full Bloch-McConnell fitting. The results showed that under the optimal saturation duration of 1000 ms, the greatest contrast between tubers and normal tissues occurred around 3, 2.5, 1.75 and 3.5 ppm for B1 of 4, 3, 2 and 1 μT, respectively. At the optimal frequency offsets, the CEST values of tubers were significantly higher than those in the normal brain tissues (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the two-stage analysis suggested that the amine pool played a dominant role in yielding the contrast between cortical tubers and normal tissues. These results indicate that CEST MRI may serve as a potentially useful tool for identifying tubers in TSC, and the two-stage analysis method may provide a route for investigating the molecular contributions to the CEST contrast in biological tissues.","Wen, Qingqing; Wang, Kang; Hsu, Yi-Cheng; Xu, Yan; Sun, Yi; Wu, Dan; Zhang, Yi",NMR in biomedicine,65,16

However, feeding via jejunostomy can cause complications including mechanical obstruction, which could be life threatening. From 2009, we began enteral feeding via duodenostomy to reduce the likelihood of complications. In this study, we compared duodenostomy with the conventional jejunostomy feeding, mainly looking at the catheter-related complications. METHODS The database records of 378 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent radical esophagectomy with retrosternal or posterior mediastinal gastric tube reconstruction in our department from January 1998 to December 2012 were examined. Of the 378 patients, 111 underwent feeding via duodenostomy (FD) and 267 underwent feeding via jejunostomy (FJ), and their records were reviewed for the following catheter-related complications: site infection, dislodgement, peritonitis, and mechanical obstruction. RESULTS Mechanical obstruction occurred in 12 patients in the FJ group but none in the FD group (4.5 % vs. 0 %, P = 0.023). Of the 12 cases, 7 (58.3 %) required surgery of which 2 had bowel resection due to strangulated mechanical obstruction. Catheter site infection was seen in 14 cases in the FJ group, of which 2 (14.2 %) had peritonitis following catheter dislocation, while only one case of site infection was seen in the FD group (5.2 % vs. 0.9 %, P = 0.078). CONCLUSIONS Feeding via duodenectomy could be the procedure of choice since neither mechanical obstruction nor relaparotomy was seen during enteral feeding through this technique.","Oya, Hisaharu; Koike, Masahiko; Iwata, Naoki; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Torii, Koji; Niwa, Yukiko; Kanda, Mitsuro; Tanaka, Chie; Yamada, Suguru; Fujii, Tsutomu; Nakayama, Goro; Sugimoto, Hiroyuki; Nomoto, Shuji; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kodera, Yasuhiro",World journal of surgery,65,17

This study sought to determine whether quantitative hemodynamic assessment using MR angiography can stratify CHS risk. METHODS In this prospective trial, patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were randomly selected for pre- and postoperative quantitative phase-contrast MR angiography (QMRA). Assessment was standardized according to a protocol and included Doppler/duplex sonography, MRI, and/or CT angiography and QMRA of the intra- and extracranial supplying arteries of the brain. Clinical and radiological data were analyzed to identify CHS risk factors. RESULTS Twenty-five of 153 patients who underwent CEA for ICA stenosis were randomly selected for pre- and postoperative QMRA. QMRA data showed a 2.2-fold postoperative increase in blood flow in the operated ICA (p < 0.001) and a 1.3-fold increase in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) (p = 0.01). Four patients had clinically manifested CHS. The mean flow increases in the patients with CHS were significantly higher than in the patients without CHS, both in the ICA and MCA (p < 0.001). Female sex and a low preoperative diastolic blood pressure were the clearest clinical risk factors for CHS, whereas the flow differences and absolute postoperative flow values in the ipsilateral ICA and MCA were identified as potential radiological predictors for CHS. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral ICA and MCA as assessed by QMRA significantly increased after CEA. Higher mean flow differences in ICA and MCA were associated with the development of CHS. QMRA might have the potential to become a noninvasive, operator-independent screening tool for identifying patients at risk for CHS.","Andereggen, Lukas; Amin-Hanjani, Sepideh; El-Koussy, Marwan; Verma, Rajeev K; Yuki, Kenya; Schoeni, Daniel; Hsieh, Kety; Gralla, Jan; Schroth, Gerhard; Beck, Juergen; Raabe, Andreas; Arnold, Marcel; Reinert, Michael; Andres, Robert H",Journal of neurosurgery,65,1

METHODS A systematic literature review of Medline®, EMBASE® and Cochrane library was performed to identify studies reporting efficacy and safety of NSCT in SCI. Articles were included if they reported efficacy and safety data of SCI patients who received NSCT. RESULTS Overall, four studies of the 277 records met all the study eligibility criteria. Over the 1-year follow-up period, motor scores were significantly higher among patients who received NSCT compared with those who did not (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] motor scores (mean±standard deviation [SD]): 7.9±1.2 versus 3.9±0.6; upper extremity motor score: 7.8±2.1 versus 3.9±0.6, both P<0.05).

Typical symptoms of UC are bloody diarrhoea and faecal urgency, which disturb the quality of life (QOL) of patients, and intractable UC leads to hospitalisation and colectomy. To improve relevant outcomes such as symptoms, QOL and colectomy, many clinical questions need to be resolved regarding what the ideal lifestyle, psychosocial burden and optimal practice patterns are. In this YOu and Ulcerative colitis: Registry and Social network (YOURS) study, we will investigate the effect of lifestyle, psychosocial factors and practice patterns on patient-reported outcomes (PRO), hospitalisation rate and colectomy rate in Japanese patients with UC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS For this prospective cohort study, we recruited 2006 patients from five hospitals (Tokyo and Chiba; May 2018-January 2019). Patients will be able to access their own data and compare them with summarised data from all patients on the website beyond the YOURS study. At baseline, patients will answer a questionnaire regarding lifestyle (diet, exercise, sleep and work), psychosocial factors (stress, depression and social support) and PRO (symptoms and QOL). Information on practice patterns (eg, medications, endoscopy frequency) will be collected from electronic medical records. Gaps between patients' needs and healthcare professionals' practice will be identified. Follow-up surveys will be conducted periodically for approximately 3 years. Research questions suggested by patients and healthcare professionals may be used in subsequent surveys. Results from the YOURS study will demonstrate optimal UC management strategies to improve relevant outcomes.The study was approved by the ethics committees of five investigational sites before starting the study.

During the course of infection, viremia was initially significantly lower than normal littermates, but by 21 days was significantly elevated. Deep sequencing of the viral structural genes at days 11 and 21 identified seven amino acid substitutions in both normal and SCID pigs. The most significant change was a W99R substitution in GP2, which was present in the inoculum at a frequency of 35%, but eventually disappeared from all pigs regardless of immune status. Therefore, amino acid substitutions that appear during acute infection are likely the result of the adaptation of the virus to replication in pigs and not immune selection.","Chen, Nanhua; Dekkers, Jack C M; Ewen, Catherine L; Rowland, Raymond R R",Virus research,65,0

Principal esophagectomy after neoadjuvant treatment is the standard of care for all patients, although surveillance and surgery as needed in case of local recurrence may be a treatment alternative for patients with complete response (CR). METHODS We performed a scoping review to describe key characteristics of relevant clinical studies including adults with non-metastatic esophageal cancer receiving multimodal treatment. Until September 2020, relevant studies were identified through systematic searches in the bibliographic databases Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, ClinicalTrials, the German study register, and the WHO registry platform. RESULTS In total, three completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs, with 468 participants), three planned/ongoing RCTs (with a planned sample size of 752 participants), one non-randomized controlled study (NRS, with 53 participants), ten retrospective cohort studies (with 2228 participants), and one survey on patients' preferences (with 100 participants) were identified. All studies applied neoadjuvant chemoradiation protocols. None of the studies examined neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic protocols. Studies investigated patient populations with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and mixed cohorts. Important outcomes reported were overall, disease-free and local recurrence-free survival. Limitations of the currently available study pool include heterogeneous chemoradiation protocols, a lack of modern neoadjuvant treatment protocols in RCTs, short follow-up times, the use of heterogeneous diagnostic methods, and different definitions of clinical CR. CONCLUSION Although post-neoadjuvant surveillance and surgery as needed compared with post-neoadjuvant surgery on principle has been investigated within different study designs, the currently available results are based on a wide variation of diagnostic tools to identify patients with pCR, short follow-up times, small sample sizes, and variations in therapeutic procedures. A thoroughly planned RCT considering the limitations in the currently available literature will be of great importance to provide patients with CR with the best and less harmful treatment.","Hipp, Julian; Nagavci, Blin; Schmoor, Claudia; Meerpohl, Joerg; Hoeppner, Jens; Schmucker, Christine",Cancers,65,5

Mean HSUs for different time points and HSU changes over time (where feasible) were meta-analysed using random-effects models. Of the 950 potentially relevant identified studies, n = 28 (2004-2018) qualified for data extraction, with n = 85 unique HSUs elicited mainly from the EQ-5D (88%). Most (75%) studies were published after 2013. The follow-up duration varied between studies and was often limited to 12 months. The pooled mean HSU was 0.72 (0.67-0.76) at baseline/presurgery (n = 18) and 0.84 (0.79-0.89) one-year postsurgery (n = 11), indicating a 0.11 (0.09-0.14) utility unit increment. EQ-5D showed the similar results. This positive difference can be partially explained by BMI and/or co-morbidities status improvement. This study provides a valuable summary of HSUs to future bariatric surgery-related cost-utility models. However, more well-designed higher-quality bariatric-related HSU studies are expected for future reviews to improve the available evidence. We suggest that researchers select an MAUI that is preferentially sensitive to the study population.","Xia, Qing; Campbell, Julie A; Ahmad, Hasnat; Si, Lei; de Graaff, Barbara; Otahal, Petr; Palmer, Andrew J",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,65,1

However, data on the specificities of CD4(+) T cells that recognize epitopes in the viral structural proteins and thus can provide direct help to the B cells producing E-specific antibodies are lacking. We therefore conducted a study on the CD4(+) T cell response against the virion proteins in vaccinated people in comparison to TBE patients. The data obtained with overlapping peptides in interleukin-2 (IL-2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays were analyzed in relation to the three-dimensional structures of the capsid (C) and E proteins as well as to epitope predictions based on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II peptide affinities. In the C protein, peptides corresponding to two out of four alpha helices dominated the response in both vaccinees and patients, whereas in the E protein concordance of immunodominance was restricted to peptides of a single domain (domain III). Epitope predictions were much better for C than for E and were especially erroneous for the transmembrane regions. Our data provide evidence for a strong impact of protein structural features that influence peptide processing, contributing to the discrepancies observed between experimentally determined and computer-predicted CD4(+) T cell epitopes. Importance: Tick-borne encephalitis virus is endemic in large parts of Europe and Asia and causes more than 10,000 annual cases of neurological disease in humans. It is closely related to yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, and vaccination with an inactivated vaccine can effectively prevent disease. Both vaccination and natural infection induce the formation of antibodies to a viral surface protein that neutralize the infectivity of the virus and mediate protection. B lymphocytes synthesizing these antibodies require help from other lymphocytes (helper T cells) which recognize small peptides derived from proteins contained in the viral particle. Which of these peptides dominate immune responses to vaccination and infection, however, was unknown. In our study we demonstrate which parts of the proteins contribute most strongly to the helper T cell response, highlight specific weaknesses of currently available approaches for their prediction, and demonstrate similarities and differences between vaccination and infection.","Schwaiger, Julia; Aberle, Judith H; Stiasny, Karin; Knapp, Bernhard; Schreiner, Wolfgang; Fae, Ingrid; Fischer, Gottfried; Scheinost, Ondrej; Chmelik, Vaclav; Heinz, Franz X",Journal of virology,65,1

INTRODUCTION The recent health emergency which in the first half of 2020 has seen Italy involved in the management of patients with COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19), has led to further stress for hospitals both in terms of beds and in terms of workload for healthcare workers. METHOD A multicenter study was conducted. A convenience sample of 208 nurses participated in the study. Between March 20 and July 20, 2020, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) questionnaire was made available online by using the Google Forms platform in order to detect and measure the severity of Burnout Syndrome (BOS). RESULTS BOS-related symptoms (medium or high score) for individual MBI-GS domains were identified in at least 68% of nurses. One hundred and sixty-one nurses (77.4%) had a risk of emotional exhaustion, 143 (68.7%) of depersonalization, and 162 (77.9%) of reduced professional accomplishment. High risk was observed among nurses who managed COVID patients at their own operating unit (RR = 1.27, p = 0.016). Severe BOS risk was observed in 146 nurses analyzed (70.2%) with an increased risk among Intensive Care nurses. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the nurses during the coronavirus pandemic, had high levels of work-related suffering and were at risk of physical and emotional exhaustion. Further research should be undertaken to establish causal relationships between BOS and personal and environmental risk factors among healthcare professionals in relation to the COVID-19.","Damico, Vincenzo; Murano, Liana; Demoro, Giuseppe; Russello, Giuseppe; Cataldi, Giusy; D'Alessandro, Antonella",Professioni infermieristiche,65,5

Our aim was to evaluate the clinical significance of the clot meniscus sign in patients with acute BAO. METHODS 89 patients with acute BAO who underwent MT were retrospectively analyzed. The clot meniscus sign was defined as meniscoid/tram-track like antegrade side-wall contrast opacification of the thrombus. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the presence of the clot meniscus sign. The treatment and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS The clot meniscus sign was diagnosed in 62.9% (53/89) of the patients. The meniscus sign (+) group showed a shorter procedure time (55 vs 85 min; p=0.045), higher rate of successful recanalization (89.3% vs 63.6%, p=0.004), higher incidence of first pass effect (32.1% vs 6.1%, p=0.004), and lower number of passes (2 vs 3; p=0.042) when compared with the meniscus sign (-) group. The procedure time (OR 0.972, 95% CI 0.962 to 0.992; p=0.003) and clot meniscus sign (OR 7.920, 95% CI 1.769 to 35.452; p=0.007) were independent predictors of successful recanalization. CONCLUSION The clot meniscus sign is related to high first pass effect and short procedure time and is a reliable predictor of successful recanalization in patients with acute BAO.","Baik, Sung Hyun; Kim, Joon Whi; Kim, Byung Moon; Kim, Dong Joon",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,65,31

To ensure an easy and consistent movement of the plunger, the inner glass container surface is typically siliconized. For bake-on siliconization emulsions are sprayed on and heat treated. Due to the European Union regulation REACh (Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) the use of certain emulsion components, partially constituting the gold standard Liveo™ 365 35% Dimethicone NF Emulsion (Liveo™ 365), becomes restricted and Liveo™ 366 35% Dimethicone NF Emulsion (Liveo™ 366) has been introduced as an alternative. This change may affect the handling properties as well as the silicone layer formed. The purpose of these studies was to identify any differences that may influence the stability and safety of the final drug/device combination product to enable the use of the new emulsion. We compared silicone emulsions Liveo™ 365 and Liveo™ 366 and dilutions focusing on I) their general physical stability, II) the thermal degradation process of the emulsions and their components, and III) the resulting silicone layer concerning chemistry, morphology, and functionality. The results were linked to the assessment of the final product regarding particle formation and long-term stability. A comparison of the emulsions Liveo™ 365 and Liveo™ 366 for bake-on siliconization is presented to support the transition of the latter as it becomes mandatory with REACh. Our studies show that the two emulsions do not significantly differ with respect to handling and stability, the resultant silicone layer characteristics as well as its functionality. We conclude that the transition to the new emulsion will not significantly impact the final product or the layer performance upon storage and with respect to particle formation.","Moll, Fabian; Bechtold-Peters, Karoline; Mellman, James; Sigg, Jurgen; Friess, Wolfgang",PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,65,20

We sought to compare outcomes between high dose radiotherapy (HDRT) [>48.85 Gy biologically effective dose (BED)] group and low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) (≤48.85 Gy BED) for patients with EC receiving cnCRT. Methods Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched independently by two members of our team on August 07, 2017. Articles were screened using Covidence. Study quality was assessed via CONSORT. Eligible studies had to be randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing cnCRT vs. surgery alone in full-text English. Those with induction or sequential chemoradiotherapy were excluded. We captured data points including radiation dose, hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), and treatment-related mortality (TRM). We analyzed HRs for OS and risk ratio (RR) for TRM and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) as the summary statistic. We used both fixed- and random-effects models in the presence of heterogeneity. The primary outcome was OS; secondary endpoint was treatment related mortality (TRM). We compared outcomes by HDRT vs. LDRT. To minimize chemotherapy heterogeneity, we performed a pre-planned analysis excluding the CROSS trial. Results The eleven included studies contained a total of 1,697 patients. Eight hundred forty-eight were randomized into the cnCRT. Of these 848 patients, 287 received HDRT and 561 received LDRT. HR for OS was not statistically different between LDRT (HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.8) and HDRT (HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45-0.91). Excluding the CROSS trial, there was still no difference in outcomes between LDRT and HDRT. TRM was similar between LDRT and HDRT. Conclusions With no difference in OS or TRM between LDRT and HDRT, 48.85 Gy BED cnCRT may be a sufficient radiation dose for cnCRT for patients with EC fit for surgery.","Engel, Steven; Awerbuch, Adam; Kwon, Deukwoo; Picado, Omar; Yechieli, Raphael; Yakoub, Danny; Portelance, Lorraine",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,65,20

Infections of immunocompetent animals are generally transient, yet serum antibody responses to infection often can be detected within days to weeks and persist throughout the life of the host. Serology is the primary diagnostic methodology by which laboratory animals are monitored. Historically the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been the main screening method for serosurveillance. The ELISA is performed as a singleplex, in which one microbial antigen-antibody reaction is measured per well. In comparison the MFIA is performed as a multiplexed assay. Since the microspheres come in 100 distinct color sets, as many as 100 different assays can be performed simultaneously in a single microplate well. This innovation decreases the amount of serum, reagents and disposables required for routine testing while increasing the amount of information obtained from a single test well. In addition, we are able to incorporate multiple internal control beads to verify sample and system suitability and thereby assure the accuracy of results. These include tissue control and IgG anti-test serum species immunoglobulin (αIg) coated bead sets to evaluate sample suitability. As in the ELISA and IFA, the tissue control detects non-specific binding of serum immunoglobulin. The αIg control (Serum control) confirms that serum has been added and contains a sufficient immunoglobulin concentration while the IgG control bead (System Suitability control), coated with serum species immunoglobulin, demonstrates that the labeled reagents and Luminex reader are functioning properly.","Wunderlich, Michelle L; Dodge, Megan E; Dhawan, Rajeev K; Shek, William R",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,65,11

How phleboviruses assemble, bud, and exit cells remains largely elusive. Here, we performed high-resolution, label-free mass spectrometry analysis of UUKV immuno-precipitated from cell lysates and identified 39 cellular partners interacting with the viral envelope glycoproteins. The importance of these host factors for UUKV infection was validated by silencing each host factor by RNA interference. This revealed Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor resident in the Golgi, as a critical host factor required for the UUKV life cycle. An inhibitor of GBF1, Golgicide A, confirmed the role of the cellular factor in UUKV infection. We could pinpoint the GBF1 requirement to UUKV replication and particle assembly. When the investigation was extended to viruses from various positive and negative RNA viral families, we found that not only phleboviruses rely on GBF1 for infection, but also Flavi-, Corona-, Rhabdo-, and Togaviridae In contrast, silencing or blocking GBF1 did not abrogate infection by the human adenovirus serotype 5 and immunodeficiency retrovirus type 1, the replication of both occurs in the nucleus. Together our results indicate that UUKV relies on GBF1 for viral replication, assembly and egress.

They are elevated in several neurological conditions, but their importance in cerebrovascular diseases remains unclear. In a proof of concept study, we compared sNfL levels with clinical characteristics and outcome in patients with cervical artery dissection (CeAD). METHODS A total of 49 non-traumatic CeAD patients were included. sNfL levels were measured by high-sensitivity electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Levels were compared with regard to (i) type of presenting symptoms (local symptoms only (n = 8), transient ischemic attack (TIA; n = 10) or ischemic stroke (n = 31)), (ii) stroke severity quantified by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), (iii) time interval between onset of symptoms and blood sampling and (iv) 3-month outcome as measured by the modified Rankin Scale score. Analyses were performed using univariate and multivariate linear and ordinal regression models. RESULTS CeAD patients presenting with stroke had significantly higher sNfL levels (median 108.9 pg/ml, interquartile range (37.8-427.7)) than patients with TIA (16.4 pg/ml (8.7-36.3), p = 0.002) or local symptoms (23.4 pg/ml (17.8-30.8), p = 0.0007). Among stroke patients, sNfL levels were positively associated with both NIHSS (p = 0.0002) and time between stroke onset and serum sampling (p = 1.9 × 10-6). Higher sNfL levels were associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 months (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.69-12.95, p = 0.003). However, this association lost significance after adjustment for NIHSS. The highest sNfL level was observed in a TIA patient who had ischemic stroke 1 day after serum sampling for sNfL measurement. CONCLUSION sNfL levels were increased in CeAD patients presenting with stroke, correlated with clinical severity and were influenced by the time point of blood sampling. The prognostic meaning of sNfL in CeAD deserves further testing.","Traenka, Christopher; Disanto, Giulio; Seiffge, David J; Gensicke, Henrik; Hert, Lisa; Grond-Ginsbach, Caspar; Peters, Nils; Regeniter, Axel; Kloss, Manja; De Marchis, Gian Marco; Bonati, Leo H; Lyrer, Philippe A; Kuhle, Jens; Engelter, Stefan T",Cerebrovascular diseases,65,1

This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of stapler repair with anastomosis for stoma prolapse. METHODS Twenty-four patients (15 men, median age 64 years, range 33-88 years) undergoing 25 stapler repairs with anastomosis were prospectively registered, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The median length of prolapse was 10 cm (range 5-22). Stoma prolapse repair was performed by means of 16 loop colostomies, four end colostomies, three loop ileostomies, and one end ileostomy. A stapler was used 4.6 times on average (range 4-8). The average operative time and bleeding were 40.8 (range 15-75) min and 40 (range 0-214) mL, respectively. No mortality and morbidity were observed after surgery. A recurrence of stoma prolapse was reported in only one of 25 repairs (4%) at the proximal limb of loop ileostomy during a median follow-up period of 1 year (range 1-120 months). However, a new stoma prolapsed in one untreated limb of loop stoma. CONCLUSIONS Stapler repair with anastomosis is a safe and minimally invasive treatment option for stoma prolapse with a low recurrence.

Here, a strategy for effectively dispersing graphene using graphene oxide (GO) to produce homogeneous, tunable, and ultrahigh concentration graphene dispersions (>150 mg mL-1 ) is proposed. The structure of GO with abundant edge-bound hydrophilic carboxyl groups and in-plane hydrophobic π-conjugated domains allows it to function as a special ""surfactant"" that enables graphene dispersion. In acidic solutions, GO sheets tend to form edge-to-edge hydrogen bonds and expose the π-conjugated regions which interact with graphene, thereby promoting graphene dispersion. While in alkaline solutions, GO sheets tend to stack in a surface-to-surface manner, thereby blocking the π-conjugated regions and impeding graphene dispersion. As the concentration of GO-dispersed graphene dispersion (GO/G) increases, a continuous transition between four states is obtained, including a dilute dispersion, a thick paste, a free-standing gel, and a kneadable, playdough-like material. Furthermore, GO/G can be applied to create desirable structures including highly conductive graphene films with excellent flexibility, thereby demonstrating an immense potential in flexible composite materials.","Luo, Jiajun; Yang, Liangwei; Sun, Danping; Gao, Zhenfei; Jiao, Kun; Zhang, Jin",Small,65,12

This low diagnostic yield may be improved by use of sensitive detection methods and biomarkers. METHODS The prevalence, clinical predictors and inflammatory mediator profile of respiratory viral infection in serious acute respiratory illness were investigated. Sequential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from all patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness over 12 months (n=283) were tested for the presence of 17 respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR assay and for newly discovered respiratory viruses (bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses) by single-target PCR. BAL samples also underwent conventional testing (direct immunoflorescence and viral culture) for respiratory virus at the clinician's discretion. 27 inflammatory mediators were measured in a subset of the patients (n=64) using a multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS 39 respiratory viruses were detected in 37 (13.1% of total) patients by molecular testing, including rhinovirus (n=13), influenza virus (n=8), respiratory syncytial virus (n=6), human metapneumovirus (n=3), coronavirus NL63 (n=2), parainfluenza virus (n=2), adenovirus (n=1) and newly discovered viruses (n=4). Molecular methods were 3.8-fold more sensitive than conventional methods. Clinical characteristics alone were insufficient to separate patients with and without respiratory virus. The presence of respiratory virus was associated with increased levels of interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) (p<0.001) and eotaxin-1 (p=0.017) in BAL. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses can be found in patients with serious acute respiratory illness by use of PCR assays more frequently than previously appreciated. IP-10 may be a useful biomarker for respiratory viral infection.","Sumino, Kaharu C; Walter, Michael J; Mikols, Cassandra L; Thompson, Samantha A; Gaudreault-Keener, Monique; Arens, Max Q; Agapov, Eugene; Hormozdi, David; Gaynor, Anne M; Holtzman, Michael J; Storch, Gregory A",Thorax,65,31

Infection may play a role in the induction of autoimmunity as well as in the effector phase of the disease. Here, the current hypotheses aiming to explain the link between infections and Wegener's granulomatosis immunopathogenesis are reviewed and discussed. RECENT FINDINGS In recent years, studies suggested that molecular mimicry could play a role in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), either via direct mimicry between human lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 and bacterial FimH or indirectly via the development of antibodies against a peptide complementary to proteinase 3 (cPr3). More recent work has focused on Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of receptors specialized in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In animal models, it has been shown that TLR ligands can aggravate anti-MPO antibody-mediated disease. Furthermore, it was shown that a TLR9 ligand can trigger the production of ANCA in vitro by peripheral blood-derived B lymphocytes from AAV patients. The newly described process of ANCA-mediated neutrophil extracellular trap formation may provide an endogenous TLR9 ligand. Finally, TLR2 signaling is involved in the development of a Th17-driven immune response, consistent with skewing towards a Th17 T cell phenotype that has been observed in Wegener's granulomatosis. SUMMARY Although Wegener's granulomatosis pathophysiology is becoming better understood, the specific events leading to autoimmunity are not clear. Recent studies show that several mechanisms may be involved in linking infection to autoimmunity. Molecular mimicry may be involved, and a role for TLR signaling is suggested.","Tadema, Henko; Heeringa, Peter; Kallenberg, Cees G M",Current opinion in rheumatology,65,1

Asphyxiated neonates commonly have multi-organ failure including hypotension, perfusion deficit, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension, vasculopathic enterocolitis, renal failure and thrombo-embolic complications. Animal models are developed to help us understand the patho-physiology and pharmacology of neonatal asphyxia. In comparison to rodents and newborn lambs, the newborn piglet has been proven to be a valuable model. The newborn piglet has several advantages including similar development as that of 36-38 weeks human fetus with comparable body systems, large body size (~1.5-2 kg at birth) that allows the instrumentation and monitoring of the animal and controls the confounding variables of hypoxia and hemodynamic derangements. We here describe an experimental protocol to simulate neonatal asphyxia and allow us to examine the systemic and regional hemodynamic changes during the asphyxiating and reoxygenation process as well as the respective effects of interventions. Further, the model has the advantage of studying multi-organ failure or dysfunction simultaneously and the interaction with various body systems. The experimental model is a non-survival procedure that involves the surgical instrumentation of newborn piglets (1-3 day-old and 1.5-2.5 kg weight, mixed breed) to allow the establishment of mechanical ventilation, vascular (arterial and central venous) access and the placement of catheters and flow probes (Transonic Inc.) for the continuously monitoring of intra-vascular pressure and blood flow across different arteries including main pulmonary, common carotid, superior mesenteric and left renal arteries. Using these surgically instrumented piglets, after stabilization for 30-60 minutes as defined by Z<10% variation in hemodynamic parameters and normal blood gases, we commence an experimental protocol of severe hypoxemia which is induced via normocapnic alveolar hypoxia. The piglet is ventilated with 10-15% oxygen by increasing the inhaled concentration of nitrogen gas for 2h, aiming for arterial oxygen saturations of 30-40%. This degree of hypoxemia will produce clinical asphyxia with severe metabolic acidosis, systemic hypotension and cardiogenic shock with hypoperfusion to vital organs. The hypoxia is followed by reoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 0.5 h and then 21% oxygen for 3.5 h. Pharmacologic interventions can be introduced in due course and their effects investigated in a blinded, block-randomized fashion.","Cheung, Po-Yin; Gill, Richdeep S; Bigam, David L",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,65,1

These assays need to target conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 global variants and avoid cross-reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses. To contribute to this effort, we employed an in-silico immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to identify immunogenic peptides resulting from conserved and highly networked regions with topological importance from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. A total of 57 highly networked T-cell epitopes that are conserved across geographic viral variants were identified from these viral proteins, with a binding potential to diverse HLA alleles and 80-100% global population coverage. Importantly, 18 of these T-cell epitope derived peptides had limited homology to seasonal human coronaviruses making them promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell immunity assays. Moreover, two of the NC-derived peptides elicited effector/polyfunctional responses of CD8+ T-cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients.ImportanceThe development of specific and validated immunologic tools is critical for understanding the level and duration of the cellular response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccines against this novel coronavirus disease.

Our immunoinformatics analysis revealed that 18 of these peptides had limited homology to circulating seasonal human coronaviruses, and therefore are promising candidates for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses from pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Importantly, CD8+ T-cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited polyfunctional effector responses to two novel NC-derived peptides identified as HLA-binders. These studies provide a proof of concept that our immunoinformatics analysis pipeline identifies novel immunogens which can elicit polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses.","Lee, Eunok; Sandgren, Kerrie; Duette, Gabriel; Stylianou, Vicki V; Khanna, Rajiv; Eden, John-Sebastian; Blyth, Emily; Gottlieb, David; Cunningham, Anthony L; Palmer, Sarah",Journal of virology,65,1

The aim of this study is to examine: (i) how two different dimensions of trust (general/institutional) are associated with alcohol use among adolescents; (ii) how these dimensions interact with alcohol use; and (iii) whether the associations are moderated by sex, parenting, health, school satisfaction or economic disadvantage. METHODS A nationwide sample of 5549 adolescents (aged 15-16 years) in Sweden answered a questionnaire in school. General and institutional trust were measured with five items each. Logistic regressions were used to examine associations between drinking and the trust dimensions, and the cross-combinations of these. Moderation by sex, parenting, health, school satisfaction and economic disadvantage was tested. RESULTS General and institutional trust were both significantly associated with drinking. High scores on both dimensions simultaneously were associated with the lowest probability of drinking, and low scores on both with the highest. Low institutional trust had a stronger association than low general trust. The combination of high institutional/low general trust was more protective than low institutional/high general trust. The association between general trust and drinking was moderated by school satisfaction, and the relationship between institutional trust and drinking was moderated by parental support and control. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS High trust is associated with a lower probability of past-year drinking among 15-16-year-olds. Parents and schools can be useful in endeavours to prevent low-trusting individuals in this age group from drinking.","Sjödin, Lars; Livingston, Michael; Karlsson, Patrik; Larm, Peter; Raninen, Jonas",Drug and alcohol review,65,1

The purpose of this study was to review clinical evidence following the use of fibrin sealant in standard LSG. METHODS Morbidly obese patients who underwent standard technique of LSG with using fibrin sealant were included in the study. Demographics variables [age, gender, body mass index (kg/m2), and comorbid conditions], the re-admission rate, and postoperative early complications, such as bleeding, staple-line leak, twist and stricture, were evaluated at the follow-up during the postoperative first month. RESULTS In total, 1000 patients [586 female (58.6 %)] with a mean age of 42.6 ± 13.6 years underwent LSG. Fibrin sealant was used in all operations. In total, 186 patients (18.6 %) had previous abdominal surgery. The mean operative time was 72 ± 19 min, and the mean hospital stay was 3.2 ± 1.1 days. Only 3 patients (.3 %) experienced bleeding. Staple-line leakage, twist and stricture were not observed. The re-admission rate was .5 %, and no mortalities were noted. CONCLUSION This retrospective study indicates that bariatric surgeons should consider implementing standardized surgical operative technique for reduced postoperative complications in LSG.

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the preventive effect of a simple technique by closing the direct hernia defect with barbed suture in laparoscopic direct inguinal hernia. METHODS In total, 60 patients aged 18 years or older who presented to the hernia center department in our hospital between October 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018 with primary direct inguinal hernia were randomized into the defect-closing group (by closing the transversalis) and the control groups. The primary outcomes were to compare the ultrasonic seroma number and volume at the inguinal region at 7 days, 1, and 3 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included total operative time, acute pain, chronic pain (pain lasting over 3 mo), hospital stay, recurrence, and any other complications. RESULTS There were no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics between the 2 groups including age, sex, hernia type, size of hernia defect, surgical approach, and follow-up time. Compared with control group, there were significantly fewer patients with seroma formation at 7 days, 1, and 3 months after the operations in the defect-closing group (P<0.001, <0.001, 0.002, respectively). In addition, ultrasonic seroma volume was less in the defect-closing group on postoperative day 7 (13.33 vs. 30.45 mL; P=0.02). The acute pain and hospital stay were comparable (P=0.61, 0.85, respectively), and no chronic pain, early recurrence or other postoperative complications observed in both groups during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS The simple technique of direct hernia defect closure with barbed suture in laparoscopic direct inguinal hernia repair is a secure and effective method, which is easy to perform and could significantly reduce both incidence and volume of seroma formation without increasing the risk of recurrence, acute, and chronic pain.","Zhu, Yilin; Liu, Min; Li, Junsheng; Wang, Minggang","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",65,1

METHODS A prospective study was conducted in 24 male urology patients with stable renal function. The mean age was 66.5 ± 7.9 (SD) years; the mean serum creatinine was 1.38 ± 0.57 (SD) mg/dL, and the MAG3 renal scans were performed a mean of 11 ± 8 days apart. Each MAG3 scan included a measurement of relative function as well as the time to maximum counts and 20 minutes to maximum count ratios for both cortical and whole kidney regions of interest. RESULTS The Pearson and intraclass correlations for the baseline and repeat measurements of relative renal function were both 0.98. Bland-Altman plots showed no bias between the baseline and repeat relative uptake measurements. The mean difference between 2 repeated measurements of the relative MAG3 uptake was 0.04 ± 2.88% (SD) for the left kidney and 0.08 ± 3.07% (SD) for the right kidney. Comparable results were obtained for the other renogram parameters. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of relative renal uptake of MAG3 and common renogram parameters are highly reproducible; a decrease in relative uptake ≥7% (ie, 50%-43%) implies a loss in renal function.","Taylor, Andrew; Manatunga, Amita; Halkar, Raghuveer; Issa, Muta M; Shenvi, Neeta V",Urology,65,26

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on glucose homeostasis in two obese populations of rats. METHODS Two strains of rats [Zucker fatty (ZF) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)] were each divided into two groups: sham and SG. Food intake was measured daily, and weight was measured bi-weekly. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was performed before and 45 days after surgery. RESULTS In both strains of rats, there was no statistical difference in food intake and weight gain between the sham and SG rodents before and after surgery. In ZF rats, there was no change in fasting glucose or OGTT area under the curve (AUC) before or 45 days after surgery. In the ZDF rodents, the mean preoperative fasting glucose and OGTT AUC was 204 ± 25 and 25,441 ± 2,648, respectively. At 45 days after surgery, mean fasting glucose significantly increased in the sham (sham = 529 ± 26, p = 0.0003) but not in the SG rodents (SG = 289 ± 46, p = 0.1113).

The result shows that the complexes in which Na+ or H2O is bonded simultaneously to the -NH and -OH groups connected to the C3 atom of DMGA are the most stable. The cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects occur in DMGA···H2O···DMGA and DMGA···Na+···H2O, while only the cooperativities are confirmed in DMGA···Na+···DMGA. The cooperativity occurs in the DMGA···Na+···H2O complexes without the hydration, while the anti-cooperativity occurs in those with the hydration. Furthermore, the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity in DMGA···Na+···H2O are far stronger than those in DMGA···Na+···DMGA or DMGA···H2O···DMGA. Therefore, a deduction is given that the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects play an important role in the hydration of chitin or chitosan in the presence of Na+. When only Na+ is linked with -OH and -NH groups of chitosan or chitin, due to the cooperativity effect, the hydration does not occur. When both Na+ and H2O are linked with -OH and -NH groups, the anti-cooperativities are dominant in controlling of the aggregation process of Na+, H2O, chitosan, and chitin, leading to the possible hydration. Atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis confirms the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects. Graphical abstract.","Zhao, Jin-An; Ren, Fu-de",Journal of molecular modeling,65,8

[11C]mG4P012 was shown to be a promising PET radioligand for mGluR4 in the monkey brain and for further development in human subjects. However, the previously reported multi-step synthesis of the thiophenol precursor suffered from low yields and difficult workup procedures. To support the translational research of [11C]mG4P012 and the other potential applications, we have developed a new route for synthesis of the thiophenol precursor and optimized the reaction conditions.

Several reports have demonstrated that many viruses belonging to Flaviviridae may cause diseases in poultry species; however, the susceptibility of other avian species is variable and still unclear. In human and mice, the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins are associated with resistance to the flavivirus infection as well as other virus infections. However, the avian OAS proteins are rarely studied. In our previous studies, we confirmed that the chicken OAS-like protein (chOASL) expressed OAS-enzymatic activity (the classical OAS/RNase L-dependent pathway) as well as the anti-flavivirus activity (the putative OAS/RNase L-independent pathway). Therefore, the current study aimed at functional analysis of avian OAS proteins from duck, goose, and ostrich. The duOASL, goOASL, and osOAS1 proteins expressed enzymatic activity as well as chOASL, whereas osOASL expressed little enzymatic activity. On the other hand, duOASL, goOASL, and osOASL possessed significant antiviral activity against West Nile virus (WNV)-replicon replication as well as chOASL, whereas osOAS1 did not. In addition, similar to chOASL, their antiviral activity was independent of RNase L activation. These results suggest that OASL is the only OAS protein in the duck and goose as well as chicken and possesses both OAS-enzymatic and anti-flavivirus activities, whereas the ostrich possesses both OAS1 and OASL proteins with sharing the functional activities, OAS-enzymatic and anti-flavivirus activities, respectively. It is of interest that the ostrich undergoes differential process in OAS gene evolution from other poultries and thus possesses different molecular mechanism in antiviral activity.","Tag-El-Din-Hassan, Hassan T; Morimatsu, Masami; Agui, Takashi","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",65,1

With rising cases in many countries, and likely further peaks in the coming colder seasons, ventilator triage guidance remains a central part of the COVID-19 policy response. The dominant model in ventilator triage guidelines prioritises the ethical principles of saving the most lives and saving the most life-years. We sought to ascertain to what extent this focus aligns, or conflicts, with the preferences of disadvantaged minority populations. We conducted a bibliographical search of PubMed and Google Scholar and reviewed all ventilator rationing guidelines included in major recent systematic reviews, yielding 589 studies before screening. Post screening, we found six studies comprising a total of 10 591 participants, with 1247 from disadvantaged populations. Three studies reported findings stratified by race and age, two of which stratified by income. Studies included two to seven principles; all included 'save the most lives'. Involvement of disadvantaged minority populations in eliciting preferences is very limited; few studies capture race and income. This is concerning, as despite relatively small numbers and framing effects there is an observable and plausible trend suggesting that disadvantaged groups worry that dominant principles reduce their chances of receiving a ventilator. To avoid compounding prior historical and structural disadvantage, policy makers need to engage more fully with these populations in designing and justifying ventilator rationing guidance and review their adequacy. Likewise, clinicians need to be aware that their implementation of dominant triage guidelines is viewed with higher levels of concern by minority populations.","Kerr, Whitney; Schmidt, Harald",Journal of medical ethics,65,27

A negative-binomial regression model was used to estimate influenza-associated EMRs in two age groups (<65 years and ≥65 years).Results: It was estimated that an annual average of 10025 influenza-associated deaths occurred in Chongqing, corresponding to 5.2% of all deaths. The average EMR for all-cause death associated with influenza was 33.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.5-35.6) per 100 000 persons, and in separate cause-specific models we attributed 24.7 (95% CI: 23.3-26.0), 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8), 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) and 5.0 (95% CI: 4.7-5.3) per 100 000 persons EMRs to CRD, P&I, COPD and IDH, respectively. The estimated EMR for influenza B virus was 20.6 (95% CI: 20.3-21.0), which was significantly higher than the rates of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5-6.1) and 7.5 (95% CI: 6.7-8.3) for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, respectively. The estimated EMR was 152.3 (95% CI: 136.1-168.4) for people aged ≥65 years, which was significantly higher than the rate for those aged <65 years (6.8, 95% CI: 6.3-7.2).Conclusions: Influenza was associated with substantial EMRs in Chongqing, especially among elderly people. Influenza B virus caused a relatively higher excess mortality impact compared with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is emerging as a potential candidate biomarker for perioperative risk stratification. We therefore performed this systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic value of elevated preoperative NLR in vascular surgery. METHODS We searched Embase (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and the Cochrane Library database from inception to June 2019. Screening was performed, and included all peer-reviewed original research studies reporting preoperative NLR in adult emergent and elective vascular surgical patients. Studies were assessed for bias and quality of evidence using a standardized tool. Meta-analysis was performed by general linear (mixed-effects) modelling where possible, and otherwise a narrative review was conducted. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using the Chi-squared statistic and explored qualitatively. RESULTS Fourteen studies involving 5,652 patients were included. The overall methodological quality was good. Elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality (HR 1.40 [95%CI: 1.13-1.74], Chi-squared 60.3%, 7 studies, 3,637 people) and short-term mortality (OR: 3.08; 95%CI: 1.91-4.95), Chi-squared 66.59%, 4 studies, 945 people). Outcome measures used by fewer studies such as graft patency and amputation free survival were assessed via narrative review. CONCLUSIONS NLR is a promising, readily obtainable, prognostic biomarker for mortality outcomes following vascular surgery. Heterogeneity in patient factors, severity of vascular disease, and type of vascular surgery performed renders direct comparison of outcomes from the current literature challenging. This systematic review supports further investigation for NLR measurement in pre-vascular surgical risk stratification. In particular, the establishment of a universally accepted NLR cut-off value is of importance in real-world implementation of this biomarker.","Jackson, Sarah M; Perry, Luke A; Borg, Carla; Ramson, Dhruvesh M; Campbell, Ryan; Liu, Zhengyang; Nguyen, Jacqueline; Douglas, Ned; Kok, Juliana; Penny-Dimri, Jahan",Vascular and endovascular surgery,65,1

Doravirine was added to a maternal perfusate (theoretical doravirine concentration of 250 ng/mL) containing 2 g/L human albumin and 20 g/L antipyrine, a marker to validate the cotyledon's viability, and cotyledons were dually perfused for up to 90 min. RESULTS In five experiments, the median (IQR) doravirine concentrations in the maternal and fetal compartments were, respectively, 303 (178-420) and 40 (30-54) ng/mL, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 16% (12%-18%) and the clearance index (in comparison with antipyrine transfer) was 48% (35%-64%).

This study aimed to investigate the effect of educational intervention based on the empowerment model on deaf and hard hearing females' self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitude toward PMSGC. A Quasi-experimental research design was conducted on 64 deaf and hard hearing female students. The data collection instrument comprised four parts: basic data and personal/family history, PMSGC quiz, Likert attitude scale, and general self-efficacy scale. Data were collected from September to December 2020. The empowerment educational intervention was conducted in four sequential phases; needs assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The intervention addressed the students' knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy. The results showed that 76.6% of the study participants had consanguineous marriage between their parents, 64.1% had a history of hereditary deafness in first-degree relatives. There were statistically significant differences between the total knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy before and after intervention (p <0.001).

Our aim was to estimate the positivity rate of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing among people admitted to hospital without symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Alberta, Canada. METHODS Between Apr. 9 and May 24, 2020, we screened for COVID-19 symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all consecutive adult patients (≥ 18 yr) admitted via emergency department to 3 Alberta hospitals. We summarized the parameters of the epidemic curve and assessed the performance of symptom screening versus RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS The study period encompassed Alberta's initial epidemic curve, with peak active cases per 100 000 of 71.4 (0.07%) on Apr. 30, 2020, and 14.7 and 14.6 at the beginning (Apr. 9, 2020) and end (May 24, 2020), respectively. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (64.9% throat and 35.1% nasopharyngeal swabs) was done on 3375 adults (mean age 51, standard deviation 21, yr; 51.5% men). None of the asymptomatic patients (n = 1814) tested positive, and 71 of those with symptoms tested positive (n = 1561; 4.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%-5.7%). Sensitivity of symptom screening (v. RT-PCR) was 100% (95% CI 95%-100%), and specificity was 55% (95% CI 53%-57%). Posttest probabilities for prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from 1.5 to 14 times the peak prevalence of active cases during the study did not change when we assumed lower sensitivity (92%). INTERPRETATION In a region with low disease prevalence where protocolized symptom assessment was in place during the admission process, we did not identify people admitted to hospital without COVID-19 symptoms who were RT-PCR positive. There may not be additive benefit to universal testing of asymptomatic patients on hospital admission in a setting of low pretest probability and strong public health containment.","Ravani, Pietro; Saxinger, Lynora; Chandran, Uma; Fonseca, Kevin; Murphy, Stephanie; Lang, Eddy; McDougall, Laura; Manns, Braden",CMAJ open,65,27

METHODS From January 2014 to October 2016 53 patients were included retrospectively, using a cross-sectional design. All patients underwent both CTA and CEA. Sixteen patients had their CEA specimen NCCT scanned. The semi-automated CTA software analyzed carotid stenosis using different HU values defining plaque components. The predictive values of CTA based detection of vulnerable plaques were calculated. Quantification of calcifications on CTA using region of interest (ROI)-function and mathematical equations was done manually, and validated by NCCT of the CEA specimen. RESULTS The semi-automated CTA software had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89.1% (95% CI, 73.6% - 96.4%), 31.3% (95% CI, 12.1% - 58.5%), 75% (95% CI, 59.3% - 86.2%) and 55.6% (95% CI, 22.6% - 84.6%).

The correlation between in vivo CTA and ex vivo NCCT was strong, proposing it to be used in both scientifically and clinical settings, but studies with larger sample sizes are needed.","Diab, Hadi Mahmoud Haider; Rasmussen, Lars Melholt; Duvnjak, Stevo; Diederichsen, Axel; Jensen, Pia Søndergaard; Lindholt, Jes Sanddal",BMC medical imaging,65,1

Clinical presentation and imaging findings of metastatic broad ligament LMS are often nonspecific. Complete excision plays an important role in treatment of patients with localized LMS. CASE PRESENTATION Here, we report a case of a 33-year-old woman with recurrent broad ligament LMS metastasizing to pancreas and thigh. Previously, she was diagnosed with broad ligament LMS and underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The disease-free interval was 2.5 years until metastases were found. Computerized tomography (CT) of abdomen and thighs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thighs and whole-body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) performed, revealed pancreatic and thigh metastasis. Ultrasonography-guided biopsy and histological examinations confirmed LMS at both the sites. Pancreatic metastasis was completely resected first. Then the patient underwent surgical resection of thigh metastasis when both chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed. She recovered well and remained free of disease recurrence in the 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Though imaging lacks specificity, it is a valuable asset in assessing the burden of disease and characterizing lesions while histological examination with immunohistochemistry is helpful for the diagnosis of LMS. Complete surgical resection of all metastatic sites where-ever feasible should be strongly considered in a treated case of broad ligament LMS with a durable disease-free interval.","Tian, Xuan; Yan, Xin; Wu, Jun; Song, Hongli; Shen, Zhongyang",BMC surgery,65,26

The emergence of drug-resistance to specific anti-influenza drugs such as oseltamivir and baloxavir marboxil highlights the urgency of novel anti-influenza chemical entity discovery. In this study, we report a series of novel thiazolides derived from an FDA-approved drug nitazoxanide with antiviral activity against influenza and a broad range of viruses. The preferred candidates 4a and 4d showed significantly enhanced anti-influenza potentials with 10-fold improvement, compared with nitazoxanide, and were effective against a variety of influenza subtypes including oseltamivir-resistant strains. Notably, the combination using of compounds 4a/4d and oseltamivir carboxylate or zanamivir displayed synergistic antiviral effect against oseltamivir-resistant strain. Mode of action analysis demonstrated that compounds 4a/4d acted at the late phase of viral infection cycle through inhibiting viral RNA transcription and replication. Further experiments showed that treatment with compounds 4a/4d significantly inhibited influenza virus infection in human lung organoids, suggesting the druggability of the novel thiazolides. In-depth transcriptome analysis revealed a series of up-regulated cellular genes that may contribute to the antiviral activities of 4a/4d Together, our study pointed the optimization direction of nitazoxanide as anti-influenza drug, and discovered two novel-structured candidates 4a/4d with relatively broad-spectrum antiviral potential.","Zhao, Lei; Yan, Yunzheng; Dai, Qingsong; Li, Xingzhou; Xu, Ke; Zou, Gang; Yang, Keyu; Li, Wei; Guo, Xiaojia; Yang, Jingjing; Li, Yuexiang; Xia, Qing; Cao, Ruiyuan; Zhong, Wu",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,65,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of preoperative Onyx embolization procedures for treatment of head, neck, and spine tumors from 2009 to 2011. Patient demographics and information relating to the embolization procedure and operation were recorded. Measures of Onyx efficacy included intraoperative blood loss and length of surgery. Angiographic and histologic penetration, in addition to percentage of tumor devascularization, were assessed as predictors of efficacy. RESULTS A total of 22 patients with 17 head or neck and 5 spinal lesions underwent trans-arterial preoperative Onyx embolization. Good angiographic penetration was reported in 41% of tumors and central histologic penetration in 59%, with mean tumor devascularization of 85.3% (standard deviation [SD]: 12.6%). There was no relationship between angiographic and histologic Onyx penetrance. Mean surgical blood loss was 1342 mL (SD: 1327 mL), and length of surgery was 289 minutes (SD: 162 minutes). Neither angiographic, nor histologic Onyx penetration predicted intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.38 and p = 0.32, respectively) or surgical length (p = 0.62 and 0.90, respectively). Devascularization was not associated with blood loss (p = 0.62), but it was a negative predictor of surgical length (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative Onyx embolization of head, neck, and spine tumors is capable of deep histologic tumor penetration, even when not visualized on angiography. The lack of association between measures of procedural adequacy suggests that using angiographic devascularization as a measure of procedural efficacy may be of limited utility.","Grandhi, Ramesh; Hunnicutt, Christopher T; Harrison, Gillian; Zwagerman, Nathan T; Snyderman, Carl H; Gardner, Paul A; Hartman, Douglas J; Horowitz, Michael","Journal of neurological surgery.

DESIGN A multicentric retrospective case-control study (Canadian Task Force II-2). SETTING Catholic University of the Sacred Heart and National Cancer Institute ""Regina Elena"" (Rome, Italy), Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MD), and Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD). PATIENTS From July 2009 to April 2013, 120 women underwent LESS hysterectomy. Five women (8%) were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 115 women were divided into 2 groups: obese (n = 43, body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m(2)) and nonobese (n = 72, BMI <30 kg/m(2)). INTERVENTIONS Total LESS hysterectomies for malignant and premalignant uterine disease or at least for prophylactic intent were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS No statistical differences regarding perioperative outcomes were observed between the 2 groups. Conversion to standard laparoscopy occurred in 2 obese (5%) and 2 (5%) nonobese women (p = .62). Conversion to laparotomy occurred in 1 obese (2.3%) and 3 (4.2%) nonobese women (p = .212). The median operative time was 115 minutes (range, 48-300 minutes) in obese and 114 minutes (range, 55-342 minutes) in nonobese women (p = .787). The intraoperative complication rate was 11.6% and 9.6% in obese and nonobese women, respectively (p = .712). The early postoperative complication rate was 6.9% in obese and 4.1% in nonobese women (p = .516). CONCLUSION Despite the fact that the present analysis was performed in a relatively small group of patients, this study suggests that obesity (BMI ≥30) does not preclude successful completion of total LESS hysterectomy. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these preliminary data and to clarify potential advantages and disadvantages of LESS in obese women.","Fanfani, Francesco; Boruta, David M; Fader, Amanda N; Vizza, Enrico; Growdon, Withfiel B; Kushnir, Cristina L; Corrado, Giacomo; Scambia, Giovanni; Turco, Luigi C; Fagotti, Anna",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,65,8

This broad, and sometimes blind, application of SDOH interventions can be costly and wasteful. We argue for rejecting the ""more is better"" mindset and specifically targeting patients who truly need and would substantially benefit from SDOH interventions.

The V-loc (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) suture is a unidirectional barbed suture that provides even distribution of tension. We determined the rate of urinary leak at the urethro-intestinal anastomosis following orthotopic neobladder construction performed with V-loc suture. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed charts on all patients that underwent RARC with orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion performed with a V-loc suture from February 2010 to February 2012. The urethro-intestinal anastomosis was evaluated for urinary leak by cystogram at 3 to 4 weeks, postoperatively. RESULTS In total, 11 patients were available for analysis. The mean patient age was 57.2 years (range: 47-71). The average clinical follow-up was 8 months (range: 4-15). On surgical pathology, 8 (73%) patients had pT2 or less disease, 3 (27%) had pT3/T4 disease, and 1 (9%) had N+ disease. The mean intraoperative blood loss was 315 mL (range: 150-600) and the average operative time was 496 minutes (range: 485-519). No patient (0%) demonstrated a urinary leak at the urethro-intestinal anastomosis on postoperative cystogram. Eight patients (73%) were continent by 4 months, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Orthotopic neobladder urethro-intestinal anastomosis can be performed effectively and safely with V-loc suture with an acceptably low urinary leak rate.","Pham, Khanh N; Sack, Bryan S; O'Connor, R Corey; Guralnick, Michael L; Langenstroer, Peter; See, William A; Jacobsohn, Kenneth",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,65,27

Although treatment with pulsed dye laser and fractional CO2 laser may improve symptoms, incidence of secondary wound complications is not well known. We examined the adverse event profile of laser therapies for the treatment of hypertrophic burn scars. METHODS We performed a descriptive, retrospective, 6-month study of all patients who underwent laser therapies, at an accredited regional burn center, to improve the vascularity, texture, thickness, and stiffness of symptomatic burn scars. Data regarding skin type, mechanism, area treated, and laser parameters were collected. Main outcome measures included pigmentation changes, blistering, rash, infection. χ analysis and Student t test were used to evaluate associations between variables. RESULTS A total of 95 patients underwent 163 treatment sessions (mean, 2.7 sessions/patient) with pulsed dye laser (71%), CO2 laser (22%), and other lasers (7%). Forty-one adverse events were recorded: hyperpigmentation (2%), hypopigmentation (12%), mild blistering (27%), pain (37%), rash (7%), fever (10%), and infection (2%). Patients with scald burns were more likely to develop blistering, rash, and fever after treatment (all P < 0.05). Higher Fitzpatrick skin type was associated with hypopigmentation and blistering, whereas CO2 laser was associated with increased postoperative pain (all P < 0.05) CONCLUSIONS Despite the frequent occurrence of pain and mild blistering after laser treatment of hypertrophic burn scars, major adverse effects were exceedingly rare, with improvement noted in all patients.

Given COVID-19 limitations, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, pain is likely largely going untreated, leading to greater pain and associated consequences. Mental health symptoms, which have been found to be elevated due to COVID-19, may contribute to elevated pain experience, but little work has examined how COVID-19-specific mental health factors may be associated with pain. Therefore, the current study examined (1) how COVID-19-specific psychological factors and general mental health symptoms differ between those with pain and without, and (2) among those with pain, which psychological factors were most strongly associated with pain experience. Results from a national (U.S. based) online sample of 174 adults (42.5% female, M age = 37.80 years, SD = 11.30, 88 with pain) collected between April and May 2020 indicated that, compared to those individuals reporting no pain, those with pain reported significantly higher values on all variables.

OBJECTIVES This work aimed to investigate the factors that affected both teaching/learning effectiveness and general human comfort and wellbeing after the sudden transition from classrooms to eLearning platforms due to COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS A workshop, involving students and experts of Human Factors and Ergonomics, has been performed to identify aspects/factors that could influence online learning. Then, from workshop output and literature studies, a survey composed of two questionnaires (one for students and one for teachers) has been developed and spread out among Italian universities students and professors. RESULTS 700 people answered the questionnaires. Data have been analysed and discussed to define the most important changes due to the new eLearning approach. Absence of interactions with colleagues and the necessity to use several devices were some of the aspects coming out from questionnaires.

This study examined online pricing published by facilities that have an active registration to store spermatozoa with the Food and Drug Administration. Less than one-fifth of registered facilities display any pricing information online. Price transparency also varies among census regions and facility types. Nationally, the median initial bank fee and annual price of storage are $350 and $385 respectively. Although there were no differences in the initial fee by facility type and census region, the annual price of storing spermatozoa is highest in the Northeast, which could be attributed to laboratory techniques, demographic patterns or insurance coverage.

The high virulence and mortality rate prompted us to analyze aspects of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, especially its interaction with innate immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Particularly, we analyzed secretion of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) by APCs, i.e., B cells, macrophages, monocyte-derived/myeloid dendritic cells (MDDCs/mDCs), and by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) of human and murine origin after inoculation with MERS-CoV. Production of large amounts of type I and III IFNs was induced exclusively in human pDCs, which were significantly higher than IFN induction by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Of note, IFNs were secreted in the absence of productive replication. However, receptor binding, endosomal uptake, and probably signaling via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) were critical for sensing of MERS-CoV by pDCs. Furthermore, active transcription of MERS-CoV N RNA and subsequent N protein expression were evident in infected pDCs, indicating abortive infection. Taken together, our results point toward dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)-dependent endosomal uptake and subsequent infection of human pDCs by MERS-CoV. However, the replication cycle is stopped after early gene expression. In parallel, human pDCs are potent IFN-producing cells upon MERS-CoV infection. Knowledge of such IFN responses supports our understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and is critical for the choice of treatment options. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes a severe respiratory disease with high fatality rates in human patients. Recently, confirmed human cases have increased dramatically in both number and geographic distribution. Understanding the pathogenesis of this highly pathogenic CoV is crucial for developing successful treatment strategies. This study elucidates the interaction of MERS-CoV with APCs and pDCs, particularly the induction of type I and III IFN secretion. Human pDCs are the immune cell population sensing MERS-CoV but secrete significantly larger amounts of IFNs, especially IFN-α, than in response to SARS-CoV. A model for molecular virus-host interactions is presented outlining IFN induction in pDCs. The massive IFN secretion upon contact suggests a critical role of this mechanism for the high degree of immune activation observed during MERS-CoV infection.","Scheuplein, Vivian A; Seifried, Janna; Malczyk, Anna H; Miller, Lilija; Höcker, Lena; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Dolnik, Olga; Zielecki, Florian; Becker, Björn; Spreitzer, Ingo; König, Renate; Becker, Stephan; Waibler, Zoe; Mühlebach, Michael D",Journal of virology,65,11

Although the trial was stopped early for lack of overall efficacy, later correlates of risk and sieve analyses generated the hypothesis that the DNA/rAd5 vaccine regimen protected some vaccinees from HIV infection, yet enhanced HIV infection risk for others. Here we assessed whether and how host Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) genetic variations influenced the DNA/rAd5 vaccine regimen's effect on HIV infection risk. We found that vaccine receipt significantly increased HIV acquisition compared with placebo receipt among participants carrying the FCGR2C-TATA haplotype (comprising minor alleles of four FCGR2C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites) (HR=9.79, p=0.035) but not among participants without the haplotype (HR=0.86, p=0.67); the interaction of vaccine and haplotype effect was significant (p=0.034). Similarly, vaccine receipt increased HIV acquisition compared with placebo receipt among participants carrying the FCGR3B-AGA haplotype (comprising minor alleles of the 3 FCGR3B SNPs) (HR=2.78, p=0.058) but not among participants without the haplotype (HR=0.73, p=0.44); again, the interaction of vaccine and haplotype was significant (p-value=0.047). The FCGR3B-AGA haplotype also influenced whether a combined Env-specific CD8+ T-cell polyfunctionality score and IgG response correlated significantly with HIV risk; an FCGR2A SNP and two FCGR2B SNPs influenced whether anti-gp140 antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis correlated significantly with HIV risk. These results provide further evidence that Fc gamma receptor genetic variations may modulate HIV vaccine effects and immune function after HIV vaccination.IMPORTANCE By analyzing data from the HVTN 505 efficacy trial of a DNA/recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) vaccine regimen, we found that host genetics, specifically Fc gamma receptor genetic variations, influenced whether receiving the DNA/rAd5 regimen was beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to an individual with respect to HIV-1 acquisition risk. Moreover, Fc gamma receptor genetic variations influenced immune responses to the DNA/rAd5 vaccine regimen. Thus, Fc gamma receptor genetic variations should be considered in the analysis of future HIV vaccine trials and the development of HIV vaccines.","Li, Shuying S; Gilbert, Peter B; Carpp, Lindsay N; Pyo, Chul-Woo; Janes, Holly; Fong, Youyi; Shen, Xiaoying; Neidich, Scott D; Goodman, Derrick; deCamp, Allan; Cohen, Kristen W; Ferrari, Guido; Hammer, Scott M; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Mulligan, Mark J; Buchbinder, Susan P; Keefer, Michael C; DeJesus, Edwin; Novak, Richard M; Frank, Ian; McElrath, M Juliana; Tomaras, Georgia D; Geraghty, Daniel E; Peng, Xinxia",Journal of virology,65,1

Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost. With the increasing dependency on multimedia and technology support for teaching and learning, one important focus of educational research is on the development and evaluation of strategies that reduce extraneous processing and manage essential and generative processing in virtual learning environments. Collaboration to identify and implement best practices has the potential to improve education for all learners.","Martinelli, Susan M; Chen, Fei; Isaak, Robert S; Huffmyer, Julie L; Neves, Sara E; Mitchell, John D",Anesthesia and analgesia,65,1

However, the empirically measured pIs of many viruses have thus far defied simple explanation, let alone prediction, based on the ionizable amino acid composition of the virus capsid. Here, we suggest an approach for predicting the pI of nonenveloped viruses by excluding capsid regions that stabilize the virus polynucleotide via electrostatic interactions. This method was applied first to viruses with known polynucleotide-binding regions (PBRs) and/or 3D structures. Then, PBRs were predicted in a group of 32 unique viral capsid proteome sequences via conserved structures and sequence motifs. Removing predicted PBRs resulted in a significantly better fit to empirical pI values. After modification, mean differences between theoretical and empirical pI values were reduced from 2.1 ± 2.4 to 0.1 ± 1.7 pH units.Importance. This model fits predicted pIs to empirical values for a diverse set of viruses. The results suggest that many previously-reported discrepancies between theoretical and empirical virus pIs can be explained by coulombic neutralization of PBRs of the inner capsid. Given the diversity of virus capsid structures, this nonarbitrary, heuristic approach to predicting virus pI offers an effective alternative to a simplistic, one-size-fits-all charge model of the virion. The accurate, structure-based prediction of PBRs of the virus capsid employed here may also be of general interest to structural virologists.","Heffron, Joe; Mayer, Brooke K",Applied and environmental microbiology,65,1

The senior author (D.T.W.C.) has developed a technique of adipose tissue-preserved full-thickness skin grafts for larger areas with success similar to that achieved with conventional full-thickness skin grafts. METHODS All cases of the senior author involving a full-thickness skin graft were identified and reviewed to identify cases in which adipose tissue-preserved full-thickness skin grafts were used. Indication for skin grafting, anatomical location of recipient and donor sites, size of graft, total number of grafts received by each patient, and percentage take were extracted from patient charts. Graft take was measured between days 5 and 14. RESULTS A total of 72 adipose tissue-preserved skin grafts on 47 patients were identified from 1994 to 2009, with a median follow-up of 8 years. The size of defect ranged from 0.7 to 210 cm, with a median area of 6 cm (interquartile range, 2.5 to 15 cm). Only six of 72 grafts were found to have less than 100 percent take. The lowest take percentage was 85 percent in a graft with an area of 2.6 cm. There were no graft failures. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the proof-of-concept that both larger and distant donor- site adipose tissue-preserved skin grafts are a viable alternative to conventional defatted full-thickness skin grafting. It appears that there is a low complication rate with respect to graft failure or incomplete graft take.

Biosynthetic studies in the past have elucidated early and late steps of rishirilide biosynthesis. This work is aiming to solve the remaining steps in the rishirilide biosynthesis. Inactivation of the cyclase gene rslC3 in Streptomyces bottropensis resulted in an interruption of rishirilide production. Instead, accumulation of the tricyclic aromatic galvaquinones was observed. Similar results were observed after deletion of rslO4. Closer inspection into RslO4 crystal structure in addition to site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that RslO4 might be responsible for quinone formation on the third ring. The RslO1 three-dimensional structure shows a high similarity to FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenases such as the epoxy-forming MsnO8 which acts with the flavin reductase MsnO3 in mensacarcin biosynthesis in the same strain.

Controlled-release (CR) mesalazine has 2 formulations: tablets and granules. The relative acceptabilities of these formulations may influence patient adherence; however, they have not been compared to date. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptabilities of the 2 formulations of CR mesalazine in relation to patient adherence using a crossover questionnaire survey. METHODS UC patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in each group took either 4 g of CR mesalazine tablets or granules for 6 to 9 weeks, and then switched to 4 g of the other formulation for a further 6 to 9 weeks. The acceptability and efficacy were evaluated by questionnaires, and adherence was assessed using a visual analog scale. The difference in acceptabilities between the 2 formulations and its impact on adherence were assessed. RESULTS A total of 49 patients were prospectively enrolled and 33 patients were included in the analysis. Significantly more patients found the tablets to be less acceptable than the granules (76% vs. 33%, P=0.0005). The granules were preferable to the tablets when the 2 formulations were compared directly (73% vs. 21%, P=0.004), for their portability, size, and numbers of pills. The adherence rate was slightly better among patients taking the granules (94% vs. 91%) during the observation period, but the difference was not significant (P=0.139).

In this proof-of-principle study, we address this issue by presenting a computational approach (DEmARC) to classify viruses of a family into groups at hierarchical levels using a sole criterion-intervirus genetic divergence. To quantify genetic divergence, we used pairwise evolutionary distances (PEDs) estimated by maximum likelihood inference on a multiple alignment of family-wide conserved proteins. PEDs were calculated for all virus pairs, and the resulting distribution was modeled via a mixture of probability density functions. The model enables the quantitative inference of regions of distance discontinuity in the family-wide PED distribution, which define the levels of hierarchy. For each level, a limit on genetic divergence, below which two viruses join the same group, was objectively selected among a set of candidates by minimizing violations of intragroup PEDs to the limit. In a case study, we applied the procedure to hundreds of genome sequences of picornaviruses and extensively evaluated it by modulating four key parameters. It was found that the genetics-based classification largely tolerates variations in virus sampling and multiple alignment construction but is affected by the choice of protein and the measure of genetic divergence. In an accompanying paper (C. Lauber and A. E. Gorbalenya, J. Virol. 86:3905-3915, 2012), we analyze the substantial insight gained with the genetics-based classification approach by comparing it with the expert-based picornavirus taxonomy.","Lauber, Chris; Gorbalenya, Alexander E",Journal of virology,65,12

Sympathetic overactivity, which might play an important role in hyperhidrosis, can contribute to metabolic diseases and the decreased quality of life (QoL). We compared the metabolic components and health-related QoL between patients with hyperhidrosis and the general population. METHODS We conducted a case-control study and compared the characteristics of the patients (N = 196) with hyperhidrosis and propensity score-matched controls (N = 196) selected from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Metabolic components and EQ-5D-3L (EQ-5D) index were compared using a two-way mixed analysis of covariance after adjusting for confounders. RESULTS Patients with hyperhidrosis had significantly higher waist circumference (estimated mean values ± SD for patients and the control group, 85.5 ± 10.8 cm vs 81.3 ± 10.3 cm, p < 0.001), blood pressure (SBP, 121.1 ± 16.9 vs 111.7 ± 10.3, p < 0.001 AND DBP, 77.5 ± 12.8 vs 73.6 ± 8.6, p < 0.001, respectively), fasting glucose (97.1 ± 11.3 vs 91.5 ± 9.2, p < 0.001), and the number of components of metabolic syndrome (1.4 ± 1.3 vs 1.0 ± 1.2, p = 0.002), and significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (144.3 ± 53.2 vs 158.3 ± 55.7, p = 0.002) and EQ-5D values (estimated mean values (standard error) for patients and the control group, 0.92 (0.01) vs 0.97 (0.01), p < 0.001) compared to the control group after adjustment.

The aim of this study is to find the changes of protein that can be helpful in understanding blast-induced lung injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS A quantitative analysis of their global proteome was conducted in lung from mice with blast injury using LC-MS/MS. Protein annotation, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, functional classification, functional enrichment and cluster, and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed. Furthermore, western blotting was used to validate the changed protein levels. RESULTS A total of 6498 proteins were identified, of which 5520 proteins were quantified. The fold-change cutoff was set at 1.2; 132 proteins were upregulated, and 104 proteins were downregulated. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in the cholesterol metabolism, asthma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Remarkably, the processes related to the change of oxidative phosphorylation including the NADH dehydrogenase, Cytochrome C reductase, Cytochrome C oxidase and F-type ATPase were significantly upregulated, which were further verified by western blotting. CONCLUSION These results confirmed that the oxidative phosphorylation is critical to blast-induced lung injury.

The Copenhagen EMS operates two telephone line the 1-1-2 emergency number and the 1813 medical helpline. A separate coronavirus support track was implemented on the 1813 medical helpline and a web-based self-triage (web triage) system was created to reduce non-emergency call volume. The aim of this paper is to present call volume and the two measures implemented to handle the increased call volume to the Copenhagen EMS.MethodsThis is a cross sectional observational study. Call volume and queue time is presented in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic (27th of February 2020 to 27th of march) and compared to the equivalent month from the year before (2019). Descriptive statistics are conducted on call volumes and queue times and spearman's rank correlation test are performed to test correlation between web triage and call volume.ResultsTotal EMS call volume increase by 23.3% between 2019 and 2020 (92.670 vs. 114,250). The 1-1-2 emergency line total call volume increase by 4.4% (8,4942 vs. 8,870) and the 1813 medical helpline increased by 25.1% (84.176 vs. 105.380). The coronavirus support track handled 21,063 calls. The 1813 medical helpline queue time was a mean of 02 minutes and 23 seconds (CI: 2.22-2.25) in 2019 and 12 minutes and 2 seconds (CI 11:55-12:09) in 2020 (P < 0.001). The web triage was used 10,894 times. No correlation between call volume and web triage usage was seen.ConclusionsIn the first month of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic a significant increase in call volume was observed in the 1813 medical helpline compared to 2019. A large number of calls were handled by the additional coronavirus track and diverted away from the regular tracks of the 1813 medical helpline. This likely contributed to mitigating increased call volumes and queue times. The web triage was widely used but no significant correlation was seen with 1813 medical helpline call volume. Other EMS organizations can learn from this to enhance capacity in a future epidemics.","Jensen, Theo; Holgersen, Mathias Geldermann; Jespersen, Mads Seit; Blomberg, Stig Nikolaj; Folke, Fredrik; Lippert, Freddy; Christensen, Helle Collatz",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,65,1

METHODS Seventy patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic surgery were enrolled in the study. They were divided into two groups: 35 patients who received DNG for 4 months preoperatively (group D) and 35 patients who received low-dose sustained-release goserelin acetate for 4 months preoperatively (group G). Preoperative outcomes, including pain score associated with endometriosis, using the numerical rating scale (NRS), adverse events of hormonal therapy and Kupperman index (KI) before and after treatment, surgical outcomes including total surgical duration and blood loss, and postoperative recurrence of endometrioma were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Regarding preoperative symptoms, NRS and KI at 4 months after preoperative hormonal therapy were significantly lower in group D than in group G (NRS, 5.3 ± 5.5 vs. 2.7 ± 3.9; P = 0.01; KI, 16.0 ± 11.0 vs. 9.2 ± 7.6; P = 0.006). Regarding adverse events, the incidence of hot flashes was significantly lower in group D than in group G (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the incidence of breast pain and metrorrhagia was significantly higher in group D than in group G (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). The total surgical duration and blood loss were not significantly different between the groups. At 12 months after surgery, ovarian endometrioma did not recur in either group. CONCLUSION Preoperative administration of DNG is more valuable for patients with endometriosis and scheduled for laparoscopic surgery to improve symptoms with good efficacy and tolerability than the administration of GnRH agonist.","Ozaki, Rie; Kumakiri, Jun; Jinushi, Makoto; Ikuma, Shinichiro; Murakami, Keisuke; Kawasaki, Yu; Kitade, Mari",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,65,16

There is a need for a psychotherapeutic response for people with complex or serious mental health problems within the stepped care model and in response to increased need for psychotherapeutic responses to COVID-19 and natural disasters. This project sought to identify the educational preparation and self-reported competency of MHNs to clinically undertake psychotherapy across the continuum of care.MethodsSituated within a larger mixed-methods study exploring how MHNs practice psychotherapy, adapt it to routine care and envisage the future, this paper reports the findings from a survey of MHNs regarding their educational preparation, experience and competence in modalities of psychotherapy and the application of psychotherapy with specific clinical groups.ResultsIn all, 153 MHNs responded to a request to participate in the study. In this cohort, 86% of nurses had postgraduate qualifications specific to psychotherapy and 95% had worked for over 10 years in the mental health field and had hundreds of hours of training in psychotherapy. There was a high level of self-reported competence in working with people with serious mental health problems and at-risk or vulnerable groups.ConclusionsCurrently, MHNs are not recognised in federal funding arrangements to procure psychotherapeutic intervention for members of the Australian population who require it. MHNs ought to be recognised as independent providers based on both the psychotherapeutic skills they possess and their specialist clinical skills of working with people across the spectrum of mental health problems. Appropriately qualified MHNs need to be funded to use their skills in psychotherapy via access to appropriate funding arrangements, such as Better Access and the National Disability Insurance Scheme.What is known about the topic?MHNs do not appear to be recognised as having postgraduate knowledge and skills in psychotherapy and other psychotherapeutic interventions. This lack of recognition has resulted in the Australian public being unable to access subsidised specialist psychotherapeutic services by this highly experienced group. Most published commentary has been around the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program, but, to date, scholarly work related to this program has not influenced public views and policy formation despite multiple favourable evaluations.What does this paper add?This study highlights that MHNs possess a largely unrecognised and valuable skill set in psychotherapy practice that they can adapt to work with people with complex needs.What are the implications to practitioners?MHNs possess skills and experience that, if recognised and funded, could be rapidly mobilised to improve consumer outcomes across the continuum of stepped care and in response to increased need during COVID-19.","Lakeman, Richard; Cashin, Andrew; Hurley, John; Ryan, Tom",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,65,23

Recent studies have demonstrated that Rho is immediately activated in left ventricles after pressure overload, and that Rho signalling plays crucial regulatory roles in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement during cardiac hypertrophic responses. However, the mechanisms by which Rho and its downstream proteins control actin dynamics during hypertrophic responses remain not fully understood. In this study, we identified the pivotal roles of mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia) 1, a Rho-effector molecule, in pressure overload-induced ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS Male wild-type (WT) and mDia1-knockout (mDia1KO) mice (10-12 weeks old) were subjected to a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham operation. The heart weight/tibia length ratio, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, left ventricular wall thickness, and expression of hypertrophy-specific genes were significantly decreased in mDia1KO mice 3 weeks after TAC, and the mortality rate was higher at 12 weeks. Echocardiography indicated that mDia1 deletion increased the severity of heart failure 8 weeks after TAC. Importantly, we could not observe apparent defects in cardiac hypertrophic responses in mDia3-knockout mice. Microarray analysis revealed that mDia1 was involved in the induction of hypertrophy related genes, including immediate early genes, in pressure overloaded hearts. Loss of mDia1 attenuated activation of the mechanotransduction pathway in TAC-operated mice hearts. We also found that mDia1 was involved in stretch-induced activation of the mechanotransduction pathway and gene expression of c-fos in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). mDia1 regulated the filamentous/globular (F/G)-actin ratio in response to pressure overload in mice. Additionally, increases in nuclear myocardin-related transcription factors and serum response factor were perturbed in response to pressure overload in mDia1KO mice and to mechanical stretch in mDia1 depleted NRVMs. CONCLUSIONS mDia1, through actin dynamics, is involved in compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE Heart disease is associated with increased cardiac mass resulting from hypertrophic growth and remodelling in response to excessive mechanical stress. Although numerous signalling pathways have been shown to influence cardiac hypertrophy, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy have remained incompletely understood. Here, we present evidence that the cardioprotective functions of actin polymerization by mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous 1, a Rho-effector molecule, in response to mechanical stress. Understanding this mechanotransduction pathway may provide new prospects for identifying a novel strategy for pressure overload-induced cardiovascular disease.","Abe, Ichitaro; Terabayashi, Takeshi; Hanada, Katsuhiro; Kondo, Hidekazu; Teshima, Yasushi; Ishii, Yumi; Miyoshi, Miho; Kira, Shintaro; Saito, Shotaro; Tsuchimochi, Hirotsugu; Shirai, Mikiyasu; Yufu, Kunio; Arakane, Motoki; Daa, Tsutomu; Thumkeo, Dean; Narumiya, Shuh; Takahashi, Naohiko; Ishizaki, Toshimasa",Cardiovascular research,65,28

METHODS Consecutive patients with either acute symptomatic LS or dICH were prospectively enrolled as part of a multicenter Italian study. We compared the risk factor profile of the 2 subgroups using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS During a time course of 9.5 years, 1931 subjects (1434 LS and 497 dICH; mean age, 71.3±13.3 years; males, 55.5%) qualified for the analysis. Current smoking was associated with LS (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; P<0.001). Conversely, dICH cases were more likely to be hypertensive (OR, 1.87; P<0.001), excessive alcohol consumers (OR, 1.70; P=0.001), and more frequently under treatment with warfarin (OR, 2.05; P=0.010) and statins (OR, 3.10; P<0.001). Hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and antiplatelet treatment were not associated with a specific small vessel disease manifestation. CONCLUSIONS The risk factor profile of dICH differs from that associated with LS. This might be used for disease risk stratification at individual level.","Morotti, Andrea; Paciaroni, Maurizio; Zini, Andrea; Silvestrelli, Giorgio; Del Zotto, Elisabetta; Caso, Valeria; Dell'Acqua, Maria Luisa; Simone, Anna Maria; Lanari, Alessia; Costa, Paolo; Poli, Loris; De Giuli, Valeria; Gamba, Massimo; Ciccone, Alfonso; Ritelli, Marco; Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; Iacoviello, Licia; Colombi, Marina; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Grassi, Mario; de Gaetano, Giovanni; Padovani, Alessandro; Pezzini, Alessandro",Stroke,65,30

This study was aimed to report the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on visits and treatments for patients with ureteral stones in a general hospital ED. METHODS The patients with ureteral stones were collected from 24 January to 24 March 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing. Two periods were divided for study: 24 January to 24 February (Period 1) and 25 February to 24 March (Period 2). Data on patients' characteristics, attendance, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, stone features, and final treatment choices were retrieved from the computer and compared with the data in the same periods in 2019. RESULTS The study included 376 patients with ureteral stones during the COVID-19 outbreak periods in 2020 and 343 patients during the same periods in 2019. Compared with the same periods in 2019, the number of patients with ureteral stones was less in Period 1 (137 vs 163) but had a rebound phenomenon in Period 2 (239 vs 180). The visit frequency was significantly reduced (2.6 ± 0.4 vs 3.6 ± 0.8, p < 0.01) and the VAS scores and the onset time increased (7.7 ± 1.3 vs 5.5 ± 1.6, p < 0.01; 7.4 ± 1.8 vs 8.2 ± 1.5, p < 0.01, respectively) in Period 1. More patients chose oral analgesics medication to release from renal colic in the COVID-19 outbreak period instead of ESWL and intravenous analgesics medication (Period 1, 54.0% vs 20.2%, p < 0.01; Period 2, 20.9% vs 13.3%, p = 0.044; respectively). However, the percentage of patients underwent endoscopy surgery in outbreak period showed no significant difference compared with that in 2019. CONCLUSION These results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak can directly affect the visits and final treatment choices for patients with ureteral stones.","Liu, Zhenhua; Man, Libo",Urologia,65,26

In this study, we aimed to determine if fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) is associated with the need for MV in patients with COVID-19 and if there is an association to determine the optimal FIB-4 cutoff. This was a retrospective, national, multiethnic cohort study of adults seen in an ambulatory or emergency department setting who were diagnosed with COVID-19. We used the TriNetX platform for analysis. Measures included demographics, comorbid diseases, and routine laboratory tests. A total of 4,901 patients with COVID-19 were included. Patients had a mean age of 56, 48% were women, 42% were obese, 38% were white, 40% were black, 15% had cardiac disease, 39% had diabetes mellitus, 20% had liver disease, and 50% had respiratory disease. The need for MV was 6%. The optimal FIB-4 cutoff for the need for MV was 3.04 (area under the curve, 0.735), which had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 42%, 77%, 11%, and 95%, respectively, with 93% accuracy. When stratified by race, increased FIB-4 remained associated with the need for MV in both white and black patients. Conclusion: FIB-4 can be used by frontline providers to identify patients that may require MV.","Sterling, Richard K; Shin, Dongho; Shin, Yongyun; French, Evan; Stevens, Michael P; Bajaj, Jasmohan S; DeWit, Marjolein; Sanyal, Arun J",Hepatology communications,65,11

Here, in contrast, we describe real-time, seconds-resolved measurements of plasma phenylalanine collected in situ in the body via electrochemical aptamer-based (EAB) sensors, a platform technology that is independent of the reactivity of its targets and thus is generalizable to many. Specifically, using indwelling EAB sensors, we have monitored plasma phenylalanine in live rats with a few micromolar precision and a 12 s temporal resolution, identifying a large-amplitude, few-seconds phase in the animals' metabolic response that had not previously been reported. Using the hundreds of individual measurements that the approach provides from each animal, we also identify inter-subject variability, including statistically significant differences associated with the feeding status. These results highlight the power of in vivo EAB measurements, an advancement that could dramatically impact our understanding of physiology and provide a valuable new tool for the monitoring and treatment of metabolic disorders.","Idili, Andrea; Gerson, Julian; Kippin, Tod; Plaxco, Kevin W",Analytical chemistry,65,1

METHODS Serum samples from 251 dogs of varying age, breed and clinical histories were tested for the presence of antibodies to CRCoV and CIV, using indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) analysis. The population sampled represented a wide geographic area but principally encompassed the central and lower North Island of New Zealand. RESULTS Seventy-three of the 251 samples (29%) were seropositive for CRCoV. Dogs <2 years old were less likely to be seropositive for CRCoV than older dogs. None was seropositive for CIV. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed the presence of antibodies to CRCoV in dogs in New Zealand. Young dogs are less likely to be seropositive than older dogs, probably due to increased opportunity for exposure to CRCoV over time. Serum antibodies to CIV were not detected in any of the dogs sampled, suggesting that this virus is unlikely to be present in dogs in New Zealand. CLINICAL RELEVENCE: Canine respiratory coronavirus is present in New Zealand. Although the role of this virus in canine infectious tracheobronchitis has not been fully elucidated, evidence suggests that it may have a causal role in this disease. Veterinarians should consider CRCoV as a differential diagnosis in cases of respiratory disease in dogs in New Zealand.

Studies of postmortem COVID-19 lungs largely report diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and capillary fibrin thrombi, but we have also observed other patterns. OBJECTIVE To report demographic and radiographic features along with macroscopic, microscopic, and microbiologic postmortem lung findings in patients with COVID-19 infections. DESIGN Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and postmortem examination (3/2020-5/2020) were included. Clinical findings were abstracted from medical records. Lungs were microscopically reviewed independently by 4 thoracic pathologists. Imaging studies were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist. RESULTS Eight patients (7 men, 87.5%; median age of 79 years, range, 69-96) died within a median of 17 days (range, 6-100) from onset of symptoms. The median lung weight was 1,220 g (range, 960-1,760); consolidations were found in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients; gross thromboemboli were noted in one of 8 (12.5%) patient. Histologically, all patients had acute bronchopneumonia, 6 of 8 (75%) patients had also DAD. Two of 8 (25%) patients had aspiration pneumonia in addition. Thromboemboli, usually scattered and rare, were identified in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients in small vessels and in two of these patients also in pulmonary arteries. Four of (50%) patients had perivascular chronic inflammation. Postmortem bacterial lung cultures were positive in 4 of 8 (50%) patients. Imaging studies (available in 4 patients) were typical (N=2, 50%), indeterminate (N=1, 25%), or negative (N=1, 25%) for COVID-19 infection.

METHODS The clinicopathologic and perioperative characteristics of consecutive resected PDAC patients (July 2011 to October 2018) were analyzed from a prospectively maintained database. Intraoperative administration of dexamethasone (4-10 mg) was retrospectively abstracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS The majority of 373 patients (59.8%) received intraoperative dexamethasone. Most of these patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy (75.3%), were potentially resectable at presentation (69.7%), and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (79.9%). Women were more likely to receive dexamethasone than men (69.9 vs 30.1%; p < 0.001). The cohorts were otherwise clinically similar. Intraoperative dexamethasone was not associated with differences in postoperative major complications (PMCs) (21.1 vs 19.3%; p = 0.68), postoperative pancreatic fistulas (6.3 vs 6.7%; p = 0.88), or composite infectious complications (28.7 vs 24.7%; p = 0.39). Dexamethasone was not associated with any improvement in median recurrence-free survival (RFS) (17 vs 17 months; p = 0.99) or overall survival (OS) (46 vs 43 months; p = 0.90). After adjustment for clinical factors including margin status, clinical classification, tumor size, and dexamethasone, the only factors independently associated with OS were pathologic node-positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.47), perineural invasion (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.23-3.31), multimodality therapy (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13-0.70), and PMCs (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.17-2.29) (all p < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS Dexamethasone failed to demonstrate any protective advantage in terms of mitigating short-term PMCs or infectious complications, or to confer any long-term survival benefit.

In an increasingly connected world, training in GH and STEGH can provide essential knowledge and practical skills to trainees, particularly at the graduate medical education level. The current core programmatic components and the essential competencies and curricula that support ethical and effective STEGH, however, still vary widely. The authors conducted a survey of the 228 EM residency programs in the United States to describe the current state of GH training and STEGH. Methods An online survey was developed in REDCap by a team of GH faculty. In July 2018, programs were invited to participate via individual invitation of program directors from a directory. The programs received two reminders to participate until January 2019. Results Of the 84 programs that responded, 75% offer STEGH and 39% have longitudinal GH curricula. Within these programs, only 55% have dedicated GH faculty and only 70% have dedicated sites. Both faculty and residents encounter funding and insurance barriers; most notably, only 20% of programs that offer STEGH provide evacuation insurance for their residents. Most residents (95%) engage in clinical work along with teaching and other activities, but 24% of programs do not allow these activities to fulfill any residency requirements. Finally, only 80 and 85% of programs offer preparatory and debriefing activities for residents, respectively. Conclusions While the results of this survey show progress relative to prior surveys, there are still barriers to implementing GH curricula and supporting safe, ethical, and effective STEGH, particularly in the form of continued financial and logistic support for faculty and for residents, in U.S. EM training programs.","Rybarczyk, Megan M; Muck, Andrew; Kolkowitz, Ilan; Tupesis, Janis P; Jacquet, Gabrielle A",AEM education and training,65,27

METHODS Twenty-four phantoms were randomly divided into a complete ablation group (n = 6) and an incomplete ablation group (n = 18). After radiofrequency ablation (RFA), the AM was evaluated using ultrasound (US)-CT image fusion, and the results were compared with the AM results that were directly measured in a gross specimen. CEUS-CT/MR image fusion and CT-CT / MR-MR image fusion were used to evaluate the AM in 37 tumors from 33 HCC patients who underwent RFA. RESULTS The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of US-CT image fusion for evaluating AM in the phantom model were 93.8, 85.7 and 91.3%, respectively. The maximal thicknesses of the residual AM were 3.5 ± 2.0 mm and 3.2 ± 2.0 mm in the US-CT image fusion and gross specimen, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the US-CT image fusion and direct measurements of the AM of HCC. In the clinical study, the success rate of the AM evaluation was 100% for both CEUS-CT/MR and CT-CT/MR-MR, and the duration was 8.5 ± 2.8 min (range: 4-12 min) and 13.5 ± 4.5 min (range: 8-16 min) for CEUS-CT/MR and CT-CT/MR-MR, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CEUS-CT/MR imaging for evaluating the AM were 100.0, 80.0, and 90.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A phantom model composed of carrageenan gel and additives was suitable for the evaluation of HCC AM. CEUS-CT/MR image fusion can be used to evaluate HCC AM with high accuracy.","Li, Kai; Su, Zhongzhen; Xu, Erjiao; Huang, Qiannan; Zeng, Qingjing; Zheng, Rongqin",BMC cancer,65,19

However, in a recent meta-analysis, the overall HCV reinfection rate was 5.9/100 person-years (PY) among PWID. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to investigate the reinfection rate in former and active PWID who achieved the end of treatment response after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment in Belgium. METHODS This observational cross-sectional study recruited individuals with a history of injecting drug use who had achieved the end of treatment response to any DAA treatment between 2015 and 2020. Participants were offered a post-treatment HCV RNA test. RESULTS Eighty-five potential participants were eligible to participate and contacted, of whom 60 participants were enrolled in the study with a median age of 51.0 (IQR 44.3-56.0) years; it was reported that 23.3% continued to inject drugs intravenously after DAA treatment. Liver cirrhosis was present in 12.9%. The majority had genotype 1a (51.7%) or genotype 3 (15.0%) infection. We detected no reinfections in this study population. The total time patients were followed up for reinfection in the study was 78.5 PY (median 1.0 years IQR 0.4-2.0). CONCLUSION Reinfection after successful treatment with DAA initially appears to be very low in Belgian PWID. Therefore, efforts should be made to screen individuals with persistent risk behaviors for reinfection systematically. In addition, a national HCV registry should be established to accurately define the burden of HCV infection and reinfection in Belgium and support the elimination of viral hepatitis C in Europe.

The risk of vascular pedicle thrombosis increases, if patients have arterial sclerosis or intimal dissection at the recipient artery. We performed selective and continuous transarterial heparin infusion for postoperative anticoagulant therapy. METHODS Fifteen patients (10 men and 5 women; mean age of 55.1 years; range of 16-86 years) received lower leg reconstruction using free flap. Postoperatively, a catheter was inserted into the femoral artery during surgery. Heparin infusion was performed through the catheter as a postoperative therapy for patients who had a risk factor of vascular pedicle thrombosis. Until two days post-operation, heparin was started between 5,000 and 10,000 IU per day. In postoperative days 3 and 4, half of the initial dose of heparin was administered. In postoperative days 5 and 6, 25% of the initial dose of heparin was administered. RESULTS Recipient arteries were the posterior tibial (n=11), anterior tibial (n=2), lateral circumflex femoral (n=1), and medial sural (n=1) arteries. Thirteen of the 15 cases showed arterial sclerosis or intimal dissection at the recipient artery. There was no case of vascular thrombosis. Hematoma formation at flap recipient was observed in four cases. Their initial heparin dose was than 8.5±1.7 U/kg/h. CONCLUSION Continuous transarterial heparin infusion was an effective anticoagulant therapy for the patients who had received free tissue transfer to a lower extremity. The initial dose of heparin should not exceed 6.5 U/kg/h.","Okochi, Masayuki; Komuro, Yuzo; Ueda, Kazuki",World journal of plastic surgery,65,1

METHODS The irradiance levels (mW/cm2) of 26 LED LCUs from general dental practices and 207 LED LCUs from two dental hospitals were measured using a digital radiometer (Blue Phase II, Ivoclar, Vivadent, Amherst, NY). Ten LED light guide tips (Satelec Mini, Acteon, Merignac, France) were selected to evaluate the effect of chipping, contamination (tip debris), and use of protective sleeves and tips to sensor distance on irradiance (mW/cm2) using a MARC Resin Calibrator (Blue Light Analytics, Halifax, Canada). Homogeneity of the light output was evaluated using a laser beam profiler (SP620; Ophir-Spiricon, North Longan, UT, USA). Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey test (α=0.05) and linear regression with stepwise correlation tests. RESULTS Thirty-three percent of the LCUs delivered irradiance output less than 500 mW/cm2. The condition of the light curing tips was poor, with 16% contaminated with resin debris, 26% damaged, and 10% both contaminated and damaged. The irradiance output was significantly reduced in contaminated (62%) and chipped (50%) light curing tips and when using protective sleeves (24%) (p<0.05). Irradiance was also reduced when increasing the distance with 25% and 34% reduction at 7 mm and 10 mm, respectively (p<0.05). CONCLUSION There remains a lack of awareness of the need for regular monitoring and maintenance of dental LCUs. Damaged and contaminated light curing tips, use of protective sleeves, and increasing the distance from the restoration significantly reduced the irradiance output and the performance of the LCUs.","Altaie, A; Hadis, M A; Wilson, V; German, M J; Nattress, B R; Wood, D; Palin, W M",Operative dentistry,65,33

Following parameters of pretreatment were used: HPP-400 MPa for 15 min, US-21 kHz, 180 W for 45 min, PEF-1 kV/cm, 3.5 kJ/kg. The quality of materials was evaluated by their rehydration properties, hygroscopicity, color and total phenolic content. To compare the effectiveness of the utilized methods, determined properties were expressed as relative comparison values against the reference sample obtained without any pretreatment in the same conditions. The performed research demonstrated that properties can be shaped by the application of proper pretreatment methods. For instance, PEF was shown to be the best method for improving water uptake during rehydration, whereas HPP was the most effective in decreasing hygroscopic properties in comparison with untreated dried apples. Among the investigated methods, HPP resulted in the deepest browning and thus total color difference, while the effects of US and PEF were comparable. For all pretreated dried apples, the total phenolic content was lower when compared with reference material, though the smallest drop was found in sonicated samples.","Wiktor, Artur; Landfeld, Aleš; Matys, Aleksandra; Novotná, Pavla; Dadan, Magdalena; Kováříková, Eliška; Nowacka, Malgorzata; Mulenko, Martin; Witrowa-Rajchert, Dorota; Strohalm, Jan; Houška, Milan",Foods,65,11

Early real-world data of a new percutaneous direct annuloplasty system for tricuspid repair were examined. METHODS The first 60 patients treated with the Cardioband tricuspid valve repair system at 4 centers were included in this retrospective study. The primary efficacy end point was technical success with reduction of TR ≥2 grades at discharge. Combined primary safety end point was major adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, cardiothoracic surgery, and stroke) at 30 days. RESULTS Median patient age was 76 years (73-82), median EuroScore II was 3.9% (2.2-8.1), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was present in 78%, and 81.7% were in the New York Heart Association class III/IV. Massive or torrential TR was found in 51.7%, and severe TR in 48.3%. The primary efficacy end point was achieved in 45%, while 60.3% of patients had less-than-severe TR at discharge. Vena contracta was reduced by 47% from 12.9±4.8 to 7.0±3.4 mm (P<0.001). Overall, the majority of patients (81.7%) improved at least by 1 New York Heart Association class. At follow-up 81.3% of patients presented in the New York Heart Association class I or II. The primary safety end point occurred in 4 patients with 2 in-hospital deaths, both not device related. Right coronary artery complications (vessel perforation or stent implantation) occurred in 9 patients (15%). Procedural time decreased from 298 to 185 minutes (P<0.001) with efficacy remaining stable (P=0.817) when comparing procedure numbers 11 or more to the earliest 5 procedures per center. CONCLUSIONS This first real-world experience suggests that transcatheter treatment of advanced secondary TR using direct annuloplasty is feasible and reasonably safe early in the learning curve, with significant symptomatic benefit. Further studies are warranted to provide data on long-term outcome and patient prognosis.","Körber, Maria I; Landendinger, Melanie; Gerçek, Muhammed; Beuthner, Bo E; Friedrichs, Kai P; Puls, Miriam; Baldus, Stephan; Rudolph, Volker; Jacobshagen, Claudius; Arnold, Martin; Pfister, Roman",Circulation.

The aim of this review was to enlighten and summarize the cumulative knowledge regarding the relationship between Coronavirus outbreaks and pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Literature search was commenced in order to analyze the maternofetal effects of Coronavirus outbreaks. RESULTS Fever and cough are the most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19 which mostly affects pregnant women in their 3rd trimester with a maternal mortality rate of 0-77% and fetal and neonatal mortality rates of 1.2%. Fetal demise is common in critically ill pregnant. Pregnancy seems as a worsening factor for SARS and MERS epidemics and both infections affect prominently 3rd trimester pregnancies, although abortion (57%) is a significant risk for cases of early pregnancy. Clinical course of COVID-19, SARS and MERS may be rapid and worse in pregnant women than non-pregnant individuals. Cesarean section is the choice of delivery in most reported women due to mostly obstetrical reasons, although vaginal delivery seems not a worsening factor for the disease. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19, SARS and MERS have significant detrimental effect on pregnancy. Rapid intervention, treatment, and intensive care support are essential for infected pregnant. Timely delivery is important in order to avoid intrauterine fetal death.","Simsek, Y; Ciplak, B; Songur, S; Kara, M; Karahocagil, M K",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,65,9

METHODS Three healthcare workers received 30 μg BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Pfizer Vaccine, followed by a second identical dose, 21 days afterwards. Venous blood was drawn at baseline and at serial intervals, up to 63 days afterwards, for assessing total immunoglobulins (Ig) anti-RBD (receptor binding domain), anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG, anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM, and anti-S1 IgA. RESULTS All subjects were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG levels increased between 91 and 368 folds until 21 days after the first vaccine dose, then reached a plateau. The levels raised further after the second dose (by ∼30-, ∼8- and ∼8-fold, respectively), peaking at day 35, but then slightly declining and stabilizing ∼50 days after the first vaccine dose. Anti-S1 IgA levels increased between 7 and 11 days after the first dose, slightly declined before the second dose, after which levels augmented by ∼24-fold from baseline. The anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM kinetics were similar to that of anti-S1 IgA, though displaying substantially weaker increases and modest peaks, only 4- to 7-fold higher than baseline. Highly significant inter-correlation was noted between total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG (all r=0.99), whilst other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies displayed lower, though still significant, correlations. Serum spike protein concentration was undetectable at all-time points. CONCLUSIONS BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination generates a robust humoral immune response, especially involving anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG and IgA, magnified by the second vaccine dose.","Danese, Elisa; Montagnana, Martina; Salvagno, Gian Luca; Peserico, Denise; Pighi, Laura; De Nitto, Simone; Henry, Brandon M; Porru, Stefano; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,65,1

This retrospective, two-centre study was conducted between 2000 and 2009. Data on patients with VO were retrieved from the diagnosis database and confirmed by checking medical records. A total of 300 patients with VO were identified; 31 received antibiotics without bacteriological diagnosis, and 269 patients with spondylodiscitis imaging were included. Eighty-three (30.9%) and 18 (6.7%) infections were documented by blood cultures and by bacteriological samples other than PNB, respectively; 168 patients with no bacteriological diagnosis had PNB. Of these, 92 (54.8%) were positive and identified the pathogen and 76 (45.2%) were negative. The most common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (34.3%), Streptococcus spp. (20.6%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (14.8%). After multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with negative PNB was previous antibiotic intake (OR: 2.31 [1.07-5.00]). When VO was suspected on imaging, bacteriological investigation identified the microorganism in 209/300 (70%) of the cases. The yield of PNB was 54.8%.

Current experimental and clinical studies focus on the implementation of new minimally invasive approaches as well as on the training in the use of these procedures. In recent years, flexible endoscopic-NOTES and endoluminal surgery have increasingly reported favorable results in preclinical and experimental settings using flexible endoscopic cholecystectomy, cholecystolithotomy, and appendectomy. Additionally, flexible endoscopic lymphadenectomy and thyroidectomy are among the new interventions that are opening new frontiers for endoscopists to explore. SUMMARY Flexible endoscopy has paved way to new frontiers for endoscopists and surgeons.

However, a lack of source-diagnostic observations of BC is hindering evaluation of uncertain bottom-up emission inventories (EIs), and thereby also models/policies. Here, we present dual-isotope-based (Δ14C/δ13C) fingerprinting of wintertime BC at two receptor sites of the continental outflow. Our results show a remarkable similarity in contributions of biomass and fossil combustion, both from the site capturing the highly-populated highly-polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain footprint (IGP; Δ14C-fbiomass=50±3%) and the second site in the N. Indian Ocean representing a wider South Asian footprint (52±6%). Yet, both sites reflect distinct δ13C-fingerprints, indicating a distinguishable contribution of C4-biomass burning from peninsular India (PI). Tailored-model-predicted season-averaged BC concentrations (700±440 ng m-3) match observations (740±250 ng m-3), however, unveiling a systematically increasing model-observation bias (+19% to -53%) through winter. Inclusion of BC from open burning alone does not reconcile predictions (fbiomass=44±8%) with observations. Direct source-segregated comparison reveals regional offsets in anthropogenic emission fluxes in EIs, overestimated fossil-BC in the IGP and underestimated biomass-BC in PI, which contributes to the model-observation bias. This ground-truthing pinpoints uncertainties in BC emission sources, which benefit both climate/air-quality modeling and mitigation policies in South Asia.","Dasari, Sanjeev; Andersson, August; Stohl, Andreas; Evangeliou, Nikolaos; Bikkina, Srinivas; Holmstrand, Henry; Budhavant, Krishnakant; Salam, Abdus; Gustafsson, Örjan",Environmental science & technology,65,16

The effect of extracranial internal carotid artery (EICA) lesion severity on the outcomes of EVT is unknown. In this study we investigated the effect of EICA lesion severity on the outcomes of tandem occlusion EVT. METHODS A multicenter retrospective TITAN (Thrombectomy In TANdem lesions) study that included 18 international endovascular capable centers was performed. Patients who received EVT for atherosclerotic TO with or without EICA lesion intervention were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the EICA lesion severity (high-grade stenosis (≥90% North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) vs complete occlusion). Outcome measures included the 90-day clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score (mRS)), angiographic reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) at the end of the procedure), procedural complications, and intracranial hemorrhage at 24 hours follow-up. RESULTS A total of 305 patients were included in the study, of whom 135 had complete EICA occlusion and 170 had severe EICA stenosis. The EICA occlusion group had shorter mean onset-to-groin time (259±120 min vs 305±202 min; p=0.037), more patients with diabetes, and fewer with hyperlipidemia. With respect to the outcome, mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion was lower in the EICA occlusion group (70% vs 81%; p=0.03). The favorable outcome (90-day mRS 0-2), intracerebral hemorrhage and procedural complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION Atherosclerotic occlusion of the EICA in acute tandem strokes was associated with a lower rate of mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion but similar functional and safety outcomes when compared with high-grade EICA stenosis.","Anadani, Mohammad; Spiotta, Alejandro; Alawieh, Ali; Turjman, Francis; Piotin, Michel; Steglich-Arnholm, Henrik; Holtmannspötter, Markus; Taschner, Christian; Eiden, Sebastian; Haussen, Diogo C; Nogueira, Raul; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Boutchakova, Maria; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Lapergue, Bertrand; Dorn, Franziska; Cognard, Christophe; Killer-Oberpfalzer, Monika; Mangiafico, Salvatore; Ribo, Marc; Psychogios, Marios-Nikos; Labeyrie, Marc-Antoine; Mazighi, Mikael; Biondi, Alessandra; Anxionnat, René; Bracard, Serge; Richard, Sébastien; Gory, Benjamin",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,65,1

Cachexia was positively associated with depression (unstandardised coefficient (B)=2.123, p<0.001) and anxiety (B=1.123, p=0.024), and had a negative relationship with PF, CF, EF, SF and overall QoL (all B<0, all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Cachexia was associated with greater depression and anxiety and poorer QoL in patients with cancer, which emphasised the importance of timely identification and management of cachexia to improve the psychological problems and QoL among patients with cancer.","Sun, Huihui; Sudip, Thapa; Fu, Xiaofen; Wen, Su; Liu, Huiquan; Yu, Shiying",BMJ supportive & palliative care,65,16

We examine downstream effects on mental health, how effects vary by race and ethnicity, and the role of existing state-level social policies in softening the pandemic's impact. METHODS We analyze an online, multi-wave Census Bureau survey fielded to nearly a million respondents between late April and July 2020. The survey includes questions measuring psychological distress as well as indirect measures of experience with the pandemic. We combine these data with state-level measures of COVID cases, lock-down orders, unemployment filings, and safety net policy. FINDINGS We find significant mental stress among all respondents and a sizeable gap between non-white and white respondents. Adjusting for pandemic experiences eliminates this gap. The effect of losing work due to the pandemic is slightly offset by state policies such as unemployment benefit size and Medicaid expansion. The magnitude of these offsetting effects is similar across racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS The racialized impacts of the pandemic are exacerbated by inequalities in state policy exemplifying structural racism. If the least generous states matched the policies of the most generous, inequalities caused by the pandemic would be diminished.","Sances, Michael W; Campbell, Andrea Louise","Journal of health politics, policy and law",65,16

OBJECTIVE We present our experience of the laparoscopic Politano-Leadbetter technique performed under pneumovesicum conditions, which allows an orthotopic ureteral location after vesicoureteral reflux correction. Our procedure recreates the new ureteric orifice in a normal anatomical position with potential less morbidity and better cosmesis. STUDY DESIGN Our series comprises ten cases. The three 5 mm ports were introduced through bladder wall under cystoscopic vision. A 5-0 monofilament traction suture was used and dissection was carried out. After the ureteral mobilization, the location of the new hiatus was selected in a straight line superior to the original orifice. Dissection of the submucosal tunnel was started from the new hiatus and advanced to the original hiatus and the ureter was gently drawn passed through the tunnel. The ureter was rolled up and muscle fibers were incised until ureter could freely move from the base of the new hiatus. Finally, after spatulation of the terminal part of the ureter, ureterovesical anastomosis was performed with intracorporeal suturing using 5-0 monofilament sutures. RESULTS The average operative time was 125 min, with an average of 93 min for unilateral and 133 min for bilateral reimplantation. Blood loss was minimal and drains were used selectively. Removal of urethral catheter was decided empirically after hematuria stopped. Mean catheterization time was 5.1 days. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.2 days. DISCUSSION This study had limitations: the small number of cases, follow-up period is relatively short and data on the pre-operative bladder capacity, catheter-related morbidity, pain control and cosmesis are lacking. But most cases showed positive clinical results including acceptable operating time and good resolution rate with minimal complication. Our Politano-Leadbetter transvesicoscopic ureteric reimplantation is safe and useful in the resolution of VUR, even though the laparoscopic ureteric reimplantation is technically demanding even for experienced pediatric surgeons. Considering the main advantages of endoscopic surgery, our new vesicoscopic technique could be an optional treatment to the open reimplantation and has merits because whole the procedure are performed within the bladder, so there is no risk of intraperitoneal organ injury. CONCLUSION Though the role of this new technique in the treatment of VUR remains to be determined, the technique could be an optional treatment to replace other surgical methods as a less invasive and effective therapeutic method.","Choi, H; Park, J Y; Bae, J H",Journal of pediatric urology,65,27

Previous observational and randomized trials report conflicting results regarding the clinical significance of this pharmacological interaction. We examined the interaction between concomitant administration of PPI and clopidogrel on platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes in the large-scale, prospective Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study. METHODS AND RESULTS On-treatment P2Y12 platelet reactivity testing was performed using the VerifyNow assay after clopidogrel loading and successful drug-eluting stent implantation at 11 sites in the United States and Germany. PPIs were prescribed at the discretion of treating physicians; patients were followed for 2 years. High platelet reactivity was defined as P2Y12 reactivity units >208. Of 8582 enrolled patients, 2697 (31.4%) were taking a PPI at the time of coronary intervention. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, PPI use was independently associated with high platelet reactivity (odds ratio, 1.38: 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.52, P=0.0001). A total of 2162 (25.2%) patients were prescribed a PPI at hospital discharge. In a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis, discharge PPI use was independently associated with increased risk for postdischarge major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients treated with clopidogrel after successful drug-eluting stents implantation, the concomitant administration of PPI was associated with high platelet reactivity and a greater rate of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine the risk-benefit ratio of PPIs in patients with drug-eluting stents treated with clopidogrel.

Our goal was to determine resistance and susceptibility of MHC B haplotype in congenic and inbred chicken lines in order to establish a resistant-susceptible model. Eight congenic lines (253/B18, 254/B15, 330/B21, 312/B24, 331/B2, 335/B19, 336/B21, and 342/BO), two inbred lines (003/B17 and 077/B19), and three commercial lines (white leghorn, brown layers, and broilers) were used in two experiments. We analyzed and compared immunologic responses and the effect of challenge by measuring viral load, IgG and IgA humoral responses, histopathology and histomorphometry, clinical signs, and immune cell populations in the different MHC B haplotype lines. We found that respiratory signs, tracheal deciliation and inflammation, airsacculitis, viral shedding in tears, and local humoral responses were good parameters to determine resistance or susceptibility. Based on these results, we identified 331/B2 as the most resistant and 335/B19 as the most susceptible congenic chicken lines. These two lines will be used as an animal model in subsequent experiments to understand the mechanisms by which the immune system in chickens generates resistance to infectious bronchitis virus.","da Silva, A P; Hauck, R; Zhou, H; Gallardo, R A",Avian diseases,65,1

They have been shown to be a safe and effective method of delivering trauma care for injuries which do not require immediate intervention or specialist management, whilst maintaining high levels of patient satisfaction. AIMS Our aim was to evaluate whether VFCs reduce the volume of X-rays performed for common fractures of the wrist and ankle. METHODS A retrospective cohort review was performed. The pre-VFC group consisted of 168 wrist and 108 ankle referrals from March to September 2019. The VFC group included 75 wrist and 68 ankle referrals, during the period March to September 2020. The total number of X-ray images, carried out within a 3-month period for each fracture was summated, with statistical analysis performed following fracture pattern classification. FINDINGS A statistically significant decrease in mean X-rays was observed for isolated stable fracture patterns, such as non-displaced distal radius, - 0.976 (p = 0.00025), and Weber A ankle fractures, - 0.907 (p = 0.000013). A reduction was also observed for more complex fracture patterns such as dorsally displaced distal radius, - 0.701 (p = 0.129) and Weber B ankle fractures, - 0.786 (p = 0.235), though not achieving statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Virtual fracture clinics can reduce X-ray frequency for common stable wrist and ankle fractures, with resultant benefits for both patients and healthcare systems. These benefits may be sustained in patient care beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic.","O'Driscoll, Conor S; Hughes, Andrew J; McCabe, Fergus J; Hughes, Elaine; Quinlan, John F; O'Daly, Brendan J",Irish journal of medical science,65,1

Mitigation strategies in acute care settings are based on a combination of basic science, environmental, and epidemiologic evidence. Here, we review the literature on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, how it has shaped infection prevention interventions in acute care settings, and the results of such measures to reduce transmission. RECENT FINDINGS HCP adherence to transmission-based precautions in acute care settings, such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is essential to mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in nonrespiratory body sites, such exposure has not been shown to definitively cause transmission in humans. Epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated that implementation and adherence to infection prevention strategies reduces acute setting transmission. SUMMARY Given SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs primarily through respiratory transmission, preventing HCP acquisition requires fidelity to consistent PPE usage. Infection prevention strategies and implementation of transmission-based precautions have reduced spread and outbreaks. Epidemiologic studies of acute care outbreaks often include reports of PPE nonadherence and community exposure contributing to SARS-CoV-2 transmission within this setting.","Yen, Christina F; van den Berg, Polly; Pepe, Dana E",Current opinion in infectious diseases,65,16

The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease focuses only on 6 behaviors. Nonetheless, impulsivity could affect the entire range of human practices. Because of their heterogeneity and undefined boundaries, it is not clear what conditions should be considered as Impulse Control Disorders. This results in poorly standardized scientific literature and underdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE We aimed to create a comprehensive list of possible manifestations of drug-induced Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease and test it on pharmacosurveillance data. METHODS PubMed was used to identify reviews in English about Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease. Mentioned conditions were charted and translated to the lexicon of MedDRA, ICD-11, and DSM-5. The relevant MedDRA terms were used to test potential association with dopamine agonists on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. RESULTS 50 reviews published between 2001 and 2020 were identified. 66 conditions were collected as possible Impulse Control Disorders. Pathological gambling, shopping, eating and sexuality, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, hobbyism and punding were the most frequently mentioned, together with leisure activities, body-focused compulsivity, disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders, and substance abuse. All these conditions were disproportionately reported with dopamine agonists, except for substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS We defined a potential extended list of ICDs, which, along with its conversion to international taxonomies, can support the identification of drug-induced conditions in pharmacovigilance archives, as well as monitoring processes in clinical practice.","Fusaroli, Michele; Raschi, Emanuel; Contin, Manuela; Sambati, Luisa; Menchetti, Marco; Fioritti, Angelo; Poluzzi, Elisabetta",Parkinsonism & related disorders,65,20

IL-10(+)CD8 and IL-10(-)CD8 T cells interconvert during acute disease, possibly based on recent Ag exposure. Strikingly, IL-10(+)CD8 T cells were more highly activated and cytolytic than IL-10(-)CD8 T cells, expressing greater levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as cytotoxic proteins. Even though these cells are highly proinflammatory, IL-10 expressed by these cells was functional. Furthermore, IL-10 produced by CD8 T cells diminished disease severity in mice with coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that minimizes immunopathological changes.","Trandem, Kathryn; Zhao, Jingxian; Fleming, Erica; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,65,1

To study the possible immune evasion of the type III IFN response by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells was developed as a cell model for PEDV replication. IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ3 inhibited PEDV replication, indicating the anti-PEDV activity of type III IFNs. Of the 21 PEDV proteins, nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp8, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, open reading frame 3 (ORF3), E, M, and N were found to suppress type III IFN activities, and IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) signaling mediated the suppression. PEDV specifically inhibited IRF1 nuclear translocation. The peroxisome is the innate antiviral signaling platform for the activation of IRF1-mediated IFN-λ production, and the numbers of peroxisomes were found to be decreased in PEDV-infected cells. PEDV nsp1 blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF1 and reduced the number of peroxisomes to suppress IRF1-mediated type III IFNs. Mutational studies showed that the conserved residues of nsp1 were crucial for IRF1-mediated IFN-λ suppression. Our study for the first time provides evidence that the porcine enteric virus PEDV downregulates and evades IRF1-mediated type III IFN responses by reducing the number of peroxisomes.IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that emerged in swine in the United States and has caused severe economic losses. PEDV targets intestinal epithelial cells in the gut, and intestinal epithelial cells selectively induce and respond to the production of type III interferons (IFNs). However, little is known about the modulation of the type III IFN response by PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell model for PEDV replication. We found that PEDV inhibited IRF1-mediated type III IFN production by decreasing the number of peroxisomes in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. We also demonstrated that the conserved residues in the PEDV nsp1 protein were crucial for IFN suppression. This study for the first time shows PEDV evasion of the type III IFN response in intestinal epithelial cells, and it provides valuable information on host cell-virus interactions not only for PEDV but also for other enteric viral infections in swine.","Zhang, Qingzhan; Ke, Hanzhong; Blikslager, Anthony; Fujita, Takashi; Yoo, Dongwan",Journal of virology,65,16

We investigated students' perspectives on Q fever prevention using a One Health approach combining animal, human and environmental health. Animal science and veterinary students enrolled at the University of Adelaide in 2019 were invited to participate in an online survey to explore their perceptions about Q fever and prevention strategies. We undertook descriptive analysis and logistic regression. Overall, 46% of students reported little to no knowledge of Q fever. Over three-quarters of students reported transmission of Q fever via aerosol inhalation and animal culling, whilst other modes including sexual transmission between humans (7%) was poorly identified. The majority of students reported exposure to cattle, sheep and goats. Of those who reported vaccination status, 5% veterinary and 61% animal science students were unvaccinated for Q fever. Challenges concerning vaccination included cost, time and access to healthcare with strategies aimed at promoting awareness, improving healthcare access and subsidized and mass vaccination. Knowledge of Q fever among respondents, particularly about disease transmission was suboptimal. As a key principle to One Health approach, adherence to biosecurity guidelines during contact with animals could potentially reduce zoonoses including Q fever transmission. Improving access to Q fever vaccine for unvaccinated students is a priority.

With a lung simulator we tested 4 leak levels (baseline [BL] 2-3 L/min, L1 5-6 L/min, L2 9-10 L/min, and L3 19-20 L/min); 3 patient weights (10, 20, and 30 kg); and 3 lung mechanics scenarios (normal, obstructive, and restrictive). The ventilator settings were NIV mode, pressure support of 10 cm H2O, and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. The synchronization rate (synchronized cycles/total simulated respirations) was recorded for each ventilator and each leak scenario. Synchronization was defined as triggering without auto-triggering, miss-triggering, delayed cycling, or premature cycling. RESULTS The mean synchronization rate across all ventilators was 68 ± 27% (range 23-96%) and marked differences existed between the ventilators (P < .001). Significant differences in synchronization rate were observed between the 10-kg model (mean 57 ± 30%, range 17-93%), the 20-kg model (69 ± 30%, 25-98%), and the 30-kg models (77 ± 22%, 28-97%) (P < .001). The synchronization rate for the obstructive model (60 ± 30%, 9-94%) was significantly different from the normal model (71 ± 29%, 18-98%) and the restrictive model (72 ± 28%, 23-98%) (P < .001). The PB840 and the C3 had synchronization rates over 90% overall across all body weights, all lung mechanic profiles, and all leak levels. CONCLUSIONS Leak compensation in NIV for pediatric use can partially compensate for leaks, but varies widely among ventilators, patient weights, and lung mechanics.","Oto, Jun; Chenelle, Christopher T; Marchese, Andrew D; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,65,17

An emerging theme is that polymorphisms in the genes encoding these factors can influence the host response to infection and the course of disease. Genetic variation affecting interferon lambda (IFN-λ) expression is now known to influence the outcome of both hepatitis C virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in humans. IFN-λ is expressed at higher levels in organs with high epithelial cell content such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Interestingly, data from animal models show that IFN-λ contributes to host control of viruses infecting these sites, including influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and rotavirus. Furthermore, defective IFN-λ production by humans with asthma impairs the control of rhinovirus infection. We hypothesize that genetic variation of IFN-λ could potentially influence the course of disease during infection with many viruses that infect epithelial cells.","Russell, Clark D; Griffiths, Samantha J; Haas, Jürgen",DNA and cell biology,65,1

In this study, deep RNA sequencing was used to analyze the transcriptome at five time points following the infection of a bat AdV in a kidney cell line derived from a myotis bat species. Evidence of AdV replication was observed with the proportion of viral RNAs ranging from 0.01% at 6 h to 1.3% at 18 h. Further analysis of viral temporal gene expression revealed three replication stages, the early-stage genes encoding mainly host interaction proteins, the intermediate-stage genes for the DNA replication and assembly proteins, and the late-stage genes for most structural proteins. Several bat AdV genes were expressed at stages that differed from those of their counterpart genes previously reported for human AdV type 2. In addition, single-base resolution splice sites of several genes and promoter regions of all 30 viral genes were fully determined. Simultaneously, the temporal cellular gene expression profiles were identified. The most overrepresented functional categories of the differentially expressed genes were related to cellular immune response, transcription, translation, and DNA replication and repair. Taken together, the deep RNA sequencing provided a global, transcriptional profile of the novel bat AdV and the virus-host interactions which will be useful for the understanding and investigation of AdV replication, pathogenesis, and specific virus-bat interactions in future research.","Wu, Lijun; Zhou, Peng; Ge, Xingyi; Wang, Lin-Fa; Baker, Michelle L; Shi, Zhengli",Journal of virology,65,20

Many factors were not known about The Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic because it is a novel human pathogen. One key factor that was not known in the earliest days of the pandemic was that many patients are either asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild that they may not seek medical attention and hence these patients would not be identified as a ""case"" if that term is defined as being sufficiently symptomatic to be seeking medical attention. Cases in the earliest days of the pandemic were defined as based on having symptoms (eg, fever, cough, respiratory distress) after ruling out other possible causes. Cases now are defined by tests confirming that the person is shedding the SARS-CoV-2 (ie, a laboratory vs. a symptomatic diagnosis). The mortality rate of this virus dropped as a function of this change. On the basis of the results of an unintended, naturalistic experiment on an expeditionary cruise in March of 2020, there was more than a 5-fold drop in the calculated mortality rate due to this definitional change in what constituted a case. This column explains this issue and discusses its implications for effectively dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic.","Preskorn, Sheldon H",Journal of psychiatric practice,65,1

However, there are discrepancies in existing guidelines and a lack of consensus among ophthalmic communities. This review aims to identify general consensus and provides recommendation of PPE for most common ophthalmological scenarios. With a global shortage of PPE, extended use and reuse strategies are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS In this review, guidelines and resources were selected, based on a three-tier process. The first-tier resources were from international infection control organizations. The second-tier resources were from ophthalmological professional associations and colleges. The third-tier resources involved a PubMed search using the keywords 'COVID-19; coronavirus; personal protective equipment' performed on 1 May 2020. Non-English guidelines and literatures were excluded. SUMMARY On the basis of our methodology, we included a total of 30 documents, including 5 resources from tier 1, 14 resources from tier 2 and 15 from tier 3. Different levels of protection are necessary. Whenever performing an aerosol generating procedure, maximum protection should be ensured, this includes FFP3 respirator, fluid resistant gown, goggles or face-shield and disposable gloves. Similar protection should be used for handling COVID-19-positive/suspected case but the use of FFP2 respirator is acceptable. During routine outpatient clinic in cases of negative triage, it is recommended to use ASTM III surgical mask, plastic apron, disposable gloves and eye protection with goggles or face-shield. Lastly, patients should be encouraged to wear surgical masks whenever possible.","Tang, Samuela W K; Romano, Mario Rosario; Wong, Daniel H T; Montericcio, Alessio; Yip, Nelson K F; Montalbano, Clara; Raimondi, Raffaele; Li, Kenneth K W",Current opinion in ophthalmology,65,24

We found that cannulation of even a completely occluded inferior petrosal sinus is feasible, especially when using a standard hydrophilic-polymer-jacketed 0.035-inch guidewire as a frontier-wire for probing. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2002 to 2017, the frontier-wire technique was tried in 52 patients with occluded inferior petrosal sinuses for transvenous embolization of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas at our center. Technical success was defined as access into the affected cavernous sinus compartment with a microcatheter through the occluded inferior petrosal sinus and deployment of at least 1 coil. The complications and treatment outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The frontier-wire technique was applied in 52 patients with 57 occluded inferior petrosal sinuses (52 ipsilateral and 5 contralateral inferior petrosal sinuses). Technical success rates were 80.8% (42/52) of patients and 73.7% (42/57) of inferior petrosal sinuses. Alternative transvenous routes were used in 3 patients, and transarterial access was used in 7 patients. Complete embolization of fistulas was achieved in 82.2% (37/45) of patients in the transvenous embolization group and in 14.3% (1/7) of patients in the transarterial group. No procedure-related morbidity or mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS Transvenous embolization of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas, even through a completely occluded inferior petrosal sinus, is feasible. The difficulty of passing the microcatheter can be minimized by prior probing of the occluded inferior petrosal sinus using a standard 0.035-inch guidewire; the trace of the guidewire on the roadmap image serves as a guide for microcatheter navigation through the inferior petrosal sinus on fluoroscopy.","Jia, Z Y; Song, Y S; Sheen, J J; Kim, J G; Lee, D H; Suh, D C",AJNR.

From 2009 to 2018, 97 patients (84 men, 13 women; median age, 60 years; range, 1-71) were transplanted after bridging therapy of 195 HCCs by stereotactic RFA (SRFA). The median interval between the first SRFA and transplantation was 6.8 months (range, 0-71). The rate of residual vital tissue (RVT) could be assessed in 188 of 195 lesions in 96 of 97 patients by histological examination of the explanted livers using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Tdt-mediated UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stains. Histopathological results were compared with the findings of the last computed tomography (CT) imaging before liver transplantation (LT). Median number and size of treated tumors were 1 (range, 1-8) and 2.5 cm (range, 1-8). Complete radiological response was achieved in 186 of 188 nodules (98.9%) and 94 of 96 patients (97.9%) and complete pathological response in the explanted liver specimen in 183 of 188 nodules (97.3%) and 91 of 96 patients (94.8%), respectively. In lesions ≥3 cm, complete tumor cell death was achieved in 50 of 52 nodules (96.2%). Residual tumor did not correlate with tumor size (P = 0.5). Conclusion: Multiprobe SRFA with intraprocedural image fusion represents an efficient, minimally invasive therapy for HCC, even with tumor sizes larger than 3 cm, and without the need of a combination with additional treatments. The results seem to justify the additional efforts related to the stereotactic approach.","Bale, Reto; Schullian, Peter; Eberle, Gernot; Putzer, Daniel; Zoller, Heinz; Schneeberger, Stefan; Manzl, Claudia; Moser, Patrizia; Oberhuber, Georg",Hepatology,65,5

This study explores the potential of this sequence-independent approach in a public-health setting, by systematic analysis of samples cultured from patients with unexplained illness through a combination of PCR-based assays and viral metagenomics. In total, 1834 cell-culture isolates were collected between 1994 and 2007 through the Enterovirus Surveillance programme in the Netherlands. During the 13 year period, seven samples that exhibited reproducible cytopathogenic effects in cell culture tested negative in standard PCR assays for a range of viruses. In order to fill the diagnostic gap, viral metagenomics was applied to these culture supernatants, resulting in the rapid identification of viruses in all of the samples. The unexplained samples contained BK polyomavirus, herpes simplex virus, Newcastle disease virus and the recently discovered Saffold viruses (SAFV) (which dominated the unexplained samples; n=4). The full genomic sequences of four SAFV genotype 3 (SAFV-3) viruses, which share 88-93 % nucleotide identity with known SAFV-3 viruses, are reported. Further screening for SAFV in additional cultured, unidentified clinical isolates from 2008 and 2009 resulted in identification of another SAFV-positive sample. Although the pathogenicity of the identified viruses has not been established, this study demonstrates that viral metagenomics is a powerful tool that can be integrated into public-health monitoring efforts to investigate unidentified viruses in cell cultures from clinical isolates where standard PCR assays fail to detect viruses.","Svraka, Sanela; Rosario, Karyna; Duizer, Erwin; van der Avoort, Harrie; Breitbart, Mya; Koopmans, Marion",The Journal of general virology,65,1

HEV replication protein is encoded by ORF1 and contains the predicted domains of methyltransferase (MT), protease, macro domain, helicase (HEL) and polymerase (POL). In this study, the full-length protein pORF1 (1693 aa) and six truncated variants were expressed by in vitro translation and in human HeLa and hepatic Huh-7 cells by using several vector systems. The proteins were visualized by three specific antisera directed against the MT, HEL and POL domains. In vitro translation of full-length pORF1 yielded smaller quantities of two fragments. However, these fragments were not observed after pORF1 expression and pulse-chase studies in human cells, and their production was not dependent on the predicted protease domain in pORF1. The weight of evidence supports the proposition that pORF1 is not subjected to specific proteolytic processing, which is unusual among animal positive-strand RNA viruses but common for plant viruses. pORF1 was membrane associated in cells and localized to a perinuclear region, where it partially overlapped with localization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker BAP31 and was closely interspersed with staining of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment marker protein ERGIC-53. Co-localization with BAP31 was enhanced by treatment with brefeldin A. Therefore, HEV may utilize modified early secretory pathway membranes for replication.","Perttilä, Julia; Spuul, Pirjo; Ahola, Tero",The Journal of general virology,65,20

METHODS Pregnant women who lived in the 15 designated regional centers throughout Japan were recruited. We obtained information about maternal smoking or secondhand smoke status and wheeze/asthma development in the offspring from a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS We analyzed 90,210 singleton births.

Personal infection mitigation strategies coupled with lockdown have caused a change in healthcare-seeking behaviour, with individuals not attending to their ill health as they previously did. OBJECTIVES To determine whether admissions for urgent and emergency surgical pathologies have declined during the COVID-19 lockdown period, and the magnitude of the decline. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted, comparing pre-lockdown (3 February - 26 March 2020) and lockdown (27 March - 30 April 2020) admission incidences for surgical pathologies at a tertiary healthcare complex in North West Province, South Africa. Poisson regression models were created to determine admission incidence rate ratios (IRRs). RESULTS Of 769 surgical admissions included in the analysis, 49.7% were male and 67.2% were unemployed. There was a 44% reduction in the incidence of non-trauma admissions during lockdown (IRR 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 - 0.68; p<0.001) and a 53% reduction in the incidence of trauma-related admissions (IRR 0.47; 95% CI 0.34 - 0.66; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Even when the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was minimal, COVID-19 lockdown in North West was associated with a significant reduction in surgical admissions.

Data from the AGES-Reykjavik study, a cohort of 5764 elderly Icelanders, were used. Outcome data were ascertained from electronic medical records. Gray's tests, Cox proportional hazards models and proportional subdistribution hazards models were used to analyse associations of interstitial lung abnormalities with lung cancer diagnoses and lung cancer mortality as well as diagnoses and mortality from all cancers.Participants with interstitial lung abnormalities had greater cumulative incidence of lung cancer diagnoses (p<0.001) and lung cancer mortality (p<0.001) than others. Interstitial lung abnormalities were associated with an increased hazard of lung cancer diagnosis (HR=2.77) and lung cancer mortality (HR=2.89) in adjusted Cox models. Associations of interstitial lung abnormalities with all cancers were found in models including lung cancers but not in models excluding lung cancers.People with interstitial lung abnormalities are at increased risk of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality, but not of other cancers.

Health systems are being strengthened and programs are being developed to address this burden, often building on HIV care strategies and infrastructure or through integrated care models. HIV remains a stigmatized condition and the role of HIV stigma in the provision of NCD care is not well understood. METHODS We conducted a scoping literature review of both peer reviewed and grey literature to identify evidence of the role of HIV stigma in the NCD-care continuum (prevention, diagnosis, care seeking, retention in care, and adherence to treatment of NCDs). We searched PsychInfo and Pubmed and conducted additional searches of programmatic reports and conference abstracts. Included studies were published in English within the past decade and examined HIV-related stigma as it relates to NCD-care or to integrated NCD-and HIV-care programs. RESULTS Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest: fear of disclosure, internalized shame and embarrassment, and negative past experiences with or negative perceptions of health care providers negatively influence engagement with NCD care; HIV stigma can adversely affect not only people living with HIV in need of NCD care, but all NCD patients; some NCDs are stigmatized in their own right or because of their association with HIV; integrating NCD and HIV care can both reduce stigma for people living with HIV and a present a barrier to access for NCD care. CONCLUSION Due to the dearth of available research and the variability in initial findings, further research on the role of HIV stigma in the NCD-care continuum for people living with HIV is necessary. Lessons from the field of HIV-stigma research can serve as a guide for these efforts.","Stockton, Melissa A; Giger, Kayla; Nyblade, Laura",PloS one,65,1

STUDY DESIGN In a population-based analysis, data from 29,325 children and adolescents with T1D and at least five years of continuous follow-up were retrieved from the ""Diabetes Prospective Follow-up"" (DPV) multi-center registry in March 2020. Statistical analyses included unadjusted comparisons, logistic and negative binomial regression models. RESULTS Among 29,325 patients with T1D, 86.0% (n=25,219) reported no DKA, 9.7% (n=2,833) one, and 4.3% (n=1273) more than one episode, corresponding to a DKA rate of 4.4 [95% CI: 4.3-4.6] per 100 patient-years. Female sex, migratory background, higher HbA1c values, higher daily insulin doses, a lower glucose monitoring frequency and less CGM usage were associated with DKA. In patients with a previous episode, the DKA rate in the most recent year was significantly higher than in patients with no DKA (17.6 [15.9-19.5] vs. 2.8 [2.7-3.1] per 100 patient-years; p<0.001). Multiple DKAs further increased the recurrence rate. The risk for DKA in the most recent year was higher in patients with an episode in the preceding year than in patients with no previous DKA (OR: 10.0 [95% CI: 8.6-11.8]), and remained significantly elevated four years after an episode (OR: 2.3 [1.6-3.1]; p<0.001). CONCLUSION Each episode of DKA is an independent risk factor for recurrence, even four years after an event, underlining the importance of a close follow-up after each episode.

In transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B (complement of TRS-B) duplex formation is one of the factors regulating the transcription of sgmRNAs. In addition, N gene sgmRNA transcription is controlled by a transcription-regulating motif, including a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between complementary proximal and distal elements. The extension of complementarity between these two sequences increased N gene transcription. An active domain, a novel essential component of the transcription-regulating motif, has been identified. The active domain primary sequence was necessary for its activity. Relocation of the active domain upstream of the N gene TRS core sequence in the absence of the proximal and distal elements also enhanced sgmRNA N transcription. According to the proposed working model for N gene transcriptional activation, the long-distance RNA-RNA interaction relocates the distant active domain in close proximity with the N gene TRS, which probably increases the frequency of template switching during the synthesis of negative RNA. The transcription-regulating motif has been optimized to a minimal sequence showing a 4-fold activity increase in relation to the native RNA motif. Full-length TGEV infectious viruses were generated with the optimized transcription-regulating motif, which enhanced by 5-fold the transcription of the 3a gene and can be used in expression vectors based in coronavirus genomes.","Mateos-Gómez, Pedro A; Zuñiga, Sonia; Palacio, Lorena; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel",Journal of virology,65,20

This offers excellent opportunities to learn more about the influence of children's sociocultural environments on their development and mental health. A particular challenge when studying risk factors across cultures and populations is that the risk associated with a particular exposure may depend on its prevalence: rarity tends to aggravate impact. This phenomenon complicates not only comparisons across cultures, but also those across subpopulations and time periods within a population. Moreover, it may counteract the effectiveness of risk-reducing public health efforts. On the bright side, the extent to which the impact of a risk factor is determined by its rarity provides researchers with valuable tools to deepen and sharpen theories about the nature and working mechanisms of that risk factor, with prevention and treatment strategies that also benefit youth in exceptional conditions as a likely consequence.","Oldehinkel, Albertine J","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",65,14

Bronchoscopy has shown to be effective in obtaining diagnosis of peripheral lung tumors, staging the mediastinum (with endobronchial ultrasound- EBUS-), and placing fiducial markers (FMs). However, the combination of these 3 procedures in a single bronchoscopy has not been studied. The aim of this study is to describe safety and feasibility of performing diagnosis, systematic nodal staging, and placement of FMs in a single bronchoscopic procedure. METHODS Retrospective review of patients who underwent bronchoscopy with diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer, EBUS for nodal staging, and FM placement in a single procedure at Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center between January 2011 and July 2015. RESULTS Twenty-one patients met our criteria, one having 2 synchronous tumors. 95% of patients had an ASA score of at least 3. Twenty-two tumors were diagnosed with a size of 2.72±1.06 cm. Distance from pleura was 1.33±1.42 cm. Median duration of bronchoscopy was 96 minutes (range, 75 to 136 minutes). Guided-bronchoscopy provided diagnosis of lung cancer in all cases. Fluoroscopy and RP-EBUS were utilized in 21 patients, ""hybrid"" scope in 14, and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy in 3. A total of 100 lymph nodes (LN) were sampled with EBUS-TBNA, with 95% of the patients having at least 4 LN sampled. A total of 71 FM were placed for 22 tumors. All markers were retained and allowed for successful SBRT. There were no pneumothoraces and no major complications. CONCLUSIONS Although it results in lengthy procedures, a single bronchoscopy obtaining diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules, systematic nodal staging, and FM placement can be safely performed in high-risk patients. Our ""all-in-one"" strategy could potentially expedite treatment, decrease complications, and reduce costs. Further prospective studies are needed to corroborate our findings.","Kular, Harman; Mudambi, Lakshmi; Lazarus, Donald R; Cornwell, Lorraine; Zhu, Angela; Casal, Roberto F",Journal of thoracic disease,65,12

This study compares the safety, efficacy and long-term oncological outcomes of these treatment methods. All prospectively registered patients (AmCORE registry) treated with thermal ablation or SABR alone for unresectable CRLM between 2007 and 2020 were analyzed using multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression. In total 199 patients were included for analysis: 144 (400 CRLM) thermal ablation; 55 (69 CRLM) SABR. SABR patients were characterized by older age (p = 0.006), extrahepatic disease at diagnosis (p = 0.004) and larger tumors (p < 0.001). Thermal ablation patients were more likely to have synchronous disease, higher clinical risk scores (p = 0.030) and higher numbers of CRLMs treated (p < 0.001). Mortality was zero and morbidity low in both groups: no serious adverse events were recorded following SABR (n = 0/55) and nine (n = 9/144 [6.3%]; all CTCAE grade 3) after thermal ablation. SABR was associated with an inferior overall survival (OS) (median OS 53.0 months vs. 27.4 months; HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.49; p = 0.003), local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS) per-tumor (HR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.52; p = 0.044) and local control per-patient (HR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.20-2.04; p = 0.001) and per-tumor (HR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.44-2.49; p < 0.001). In this study thermal ablation was superior to SABR with regard to OS, LTPFS and local control, albeit at the cost of a limited risk of serious adverse events. Further studies are required to assess whether the worse outcomes following SABR were the effect of true differences in ablative treatment or a result of residual confounding.","Nieuwenhuizen, Sanne; Dijkstra, Madelon; Puijk, Robbert S; Timmer, Florentine E F; Nota, Irene M; Opperman, Jip; van den Bemd, Bente; Geboers, Bart; Ruarus, Alette H; Schouten, Evelien A C; de Vries, Jan J J; Scheffer, Hester J; van Geel, Anne M; van Waesberghe, Jan Hein T M; Swijnenburg, Rutger-Jan; Versteeg, Kathelijn S; Lissenberg-Witte, Birgit I; van den Tol, M Petrousjka; Haasbeek, Cornelis J A; Meijerink, Martijn R",Cancers,65,24

Therefore, functional properties for successful dural closure application of newly developed bilayer oxidized regenerated cellulose knitted fabric/poly ε-caprolactone knitted fabric-reinforced composites were studied and compared with human cadaveric dura mater and three commercial dural substitutes including two collagen matrices and one synthetic poly-L-lactide patch. It was found that oxidized regenerated cellulose knitted fabric/poly ε-caprolactone knitted fabric-reinforced composites uniquely contained a bilayer structure consisting of micropores distributed within the relatively dense microstructure. Density, tensile properties and stitch tear strength of oxidized regenerated cellulose knitted fabric/poly ε-caprolactone knitted fabric-reinforced composites were found to be closed to human cadaveric dura mater than those of dense-type and porous-type dural substitutes. Water tightness performance in both sutured and non-sutured forms of oxidized regenerated cellulose knitted fabric/poly ε-caprolactone knitted fabric-reinforced composites was slightly inferior to human cadaveric dura mater, but still better than those of commercial dural substitutes. This study revealed that oxidized regenerated cellulose knitted fabric/poly ε-caprolactone knitted fabric-reinforced composite showed better functional properties than typical dural substitutes and was found to be a good candidate for being employed as a dural substitute. The role and relationship of both microstructure and the type of materials on the functional properties and water tightness of the dural substitutes were also elucidated.","Hemstapat, Ruedee; Suvannapruk, Waraporn; Thammarakcharoen, Faungchat; Chumnanvej, Sorayouth; Suwanprateeb, Jintamai","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

We firstly developed a modified vagus nerve-preserving laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (MVLSD). In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether MVLSD is feasible and safe and to determine whether MVLSD can effectively eliminate postoperative digestive system complications, in comparison with CLSD. METHOD In this randomized controlled single-center study, 60 patients with cirrhosis were randomly assigned to undergo either CLSD (n = 30) or MVLSD (n = 30) between April and December 2018. The primary outcome was delayed gastric emptying (DGE). Endoscopic physicians were blinded to group assignments. RESULTS One patient who received MVLSD withdrew from the study. There were no significant differences in intraoperative blood loss, incidence of blood transfusion, time to off-bed activity, time to first flatus, and postoperative hospital stay between the two groups. Compared with CLSD, operation time and incidences of DGE, diarrhea, epigastric fullness, and overall postoperative complications were all significantly reduced in the MVLSD group (all P < 0.05). Compared with CLSD, MVLSD was associated with significantly increased weight and albumin levels at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively versus preoperative values (all P < 0.05). The curative effect of resolving gastroesophageal variceal bleeding was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION MVLSD is not only a technically feasible and safe procedure, it is also succinct and convenient. Furthermore, MVLSD effectively reduces postoperative digestive system complications, contributing to improved quality of life.","Bai, Dou-Sheng; Jin, Sheng-Jie; Qian, Jian-Jun; Zhang, Chi; Zhou, Bao-Huan; Jiang, Guo-Qing",Surgical endoscopy,65,1

However, little is known concerning parental factors that predict initial screen exposure in infancy. The primary goal of this study was to examine whether parental educational attainment and maternal stress were associated with infant screen exposure by 6 months of age. A diverse sample of mothers (N = 93) was recruited prenatally. In a follow-up visit when the infants were six months of age (N = 82), we examined factors that may be associated with initial infant exposure to screens. First, mothers reported whether they had already exposed their infants to screens. Thereafter, those mothers who reported already having exposed their infants to screens were further queried to determine the extent of infant screen use. Results demonstrated that among infants exposed to screens, mothers reported an average of nearly 3 h of daily screen use. Average parental educational attainment, but not maternal stress, was significantly associated with initial infant exposure. Of those families who endorsed screen exposure by 6 months, 70 % reported a screen in the room where the child sleeps, nearly half reported using screens to help calm the infant, and about a third reported using a screen at least sometimes during meals, when going to sleep, and while waiting. Parental education around infant screen use behaviors may be important to help promote child development and outcomes.","Wiltshire, Cynthia A; Troller-Renfree, Sonya V; Giebler, Melissa A; Noble, Kimberly G",Infant behavior & development,65,27

This has been further compounded by the COVID-19 global pandemic, where the subsequent lockdown and physical distancing measures implemented, caused exceptional challenges to all human activity. Online Focus Groups (OFGs) are an example of one alternative strategy, requiring investigation. At present, OFGs have mostly been studied and used in high-income countries with little information relating to their implementation in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE Our aim is to share our experiences of conducting OFGs through a web conferencing service and provide recommendations for future research. METHODS As part of a broader study, OFGs were developed with adults and adolescents in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a convenience sampling method, we invited eligible participants via e-mail in two different cities of Colombia to take part in OFGs conducted via Microsoft Teams®. Researcher notes and discussion were used to capture the participant and facilitator experiences as well as practical considerations. RESULTS We conducted 10 OFGs with a total of 45 participants. Data obtained met our expectations and the online methodology did not compromise the quality of our results. Technical issues arose but different measures were taken to minimize them: using a web conferencing service that was familiar to participants, sending written instructions and performing a trial meeting prior to the OFG. Adolescent participants unlike their adult counterparts, were fluent in using web conferencing platforms and did not encounter technical challenges. CONCLUSIONS OFGs have great potential in research settings especially during the current and any future public health emergencies. It is important to keep in mind that even with the advantages that they offer, technical issues (i.e., internet speed and access to technology) are major obstacles in LMICs. Further research is required and should carefully consider the appropriateness of OFGs in different settings.

A critical question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active site cavity are; resolving this point would help understand the catalytic details of the enzyme and inform rational drug development against this pernicious virus. Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro, which allowed direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states in the protease. We observe that the catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive form where Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state, and His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, instead of the neutral unreactive state usually envisaged. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states, and thus electrical charges, of all other amino acid residues and revealed intricate hydrogen bonding networks in the active site cavity and at the dimer interface. The fine atomic details present in this structure were made possible by the unique scattering properties of the neutron, which is an ideal probe for locating hydrogen positions and experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature. Our observations provide critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to the enzyme's electrostatic environment.","Kneller, Daniel W; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; Weiss, Kevin L; Pant, Swati; Zhang, Qiu; O'Neill, Hugh M; Coates, Leighton; Kovalevsky, Andrey",The Journal of biological chemistry,65,17

This relationship is one in which the public must trust the advice of health experts, even if that advice is not always readily understood or judged to be agreeable. However, it will be argued in this article that the pact of trust between public health workers and members of the public has been steadily eroded over many years. The reasons for this erosion are examined as are attempts to characterize the concept of trust in empirical studies. The discussion then considers how a so-called informal fallacy, known as the ""argument from authority,"" might contribute to attempts to understand the trust relationship between the public and health experts. Specifically, this argument enables the lay person to bridge gaps in knowledge and arrive at judgements about public health problems by attending to certain logical and epistemic features of expertise. The extent to which lay people are able to discern these features is considered by examining the results of a study of public health reasoning in 879 members of the public.","Cummings, Louise",Health communication,65,19

Sooty mangabeys (SMs), a reservoir host for SIV, do not develop disease following SIV infection, unlike nonnatural HIV-infected human or SIV-infected rhesus macaque (RM) hosts. SIV infections of SMs are characterized by an absence of chronic immune activation, in association with significantly reduced IFN-α production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) following exposure to SIV or other defined TLR7 or TLR9 ligands. In this study, we demonstrate that SM pDCs produce significantly less IFN-α following ex vivo exposure to the live attenuated yellow fever virus 17D strain vaccine, a virus that we show is also recognized by TLR7, than do RM or human pDCs. Furthermore, in contrast to RMs, SMs mount limited activation of innate immune responses and adaptive T cell proliferative responses, along with only transient antiviral Ab responses, following infection with yellow fever vaccine 17D strain. However, SMs do raise significant and durable cellular and humoral immune responses comparable to those seen in RMs when infected with modified vaccinia Ankara, a virus whose immunogenicity does not require TLR7/9 recognition. Hence, differences in the pattern of TLR7 signaling and type I IFN production by pDCs between primate species play an important role in determining their ability to mount and maintain innate and adaptive immune responses to specific viruses, and they may also contribute to determining whether disease follows infection.","Mandl, Judith N; Akondy, Rama; Lawson, Benton; Kozyr, Natalia; Staprans, Silvija I; Ahmed, Rafi; Feinberg, Mark B",Journal of immunology,65,30

This study compares the behaviour of a new mesh, Parietex™ Composite Ventral Patch (Ptx), with two commercially available meshes, Ventralex™ ST Hernia Patch and Proceed™ Ventral Patch. MATERIALS AND METHODS The following meshes were tested in a umbilical-hernia repair model using 54 rabbits: Ventralex™ ST Hernia Patch (Vent) (Bard Davol Inc., USA); Proceed™ Ventral Patch (PVP) (Ethicon, USA) and Ptx (Covidien, Sofradim, France) (n = 18 each). At 3, 7 and 14 days postimplantation, peritoneal behaviour and adhesion formation were assessed by sequential laparoscopy. Adhesions were scored for consistency and quantified by image analysis. The animals were euthanized at 2 (n = 27) and 6 weeks (n = 27) postsurgery. Mesothelial cover of meshes and tissue ingrowth were determined by scanning and light microscopy. RESULTS Seroma was observed in 1/18 Vent, 7/18 PVP and 4/18 Ptx, mainly between the implant and subcutaneous tissue. Firm omental adhesions between the mesh and parietal peritoneum were noted in 2/9 Vent, 6/9 PVP and 3/9 Ptx at 2 weeks and in 3/9 Vent, 5/9 PVP and 1/9 Ptx at 6 weeks. Three (out of 9) encapsulated PVP implants showed ""tissue-integrated"" adhesions affecting the intestinal loops. No differences between implants were detected in the surface area occupied by adhesions at 2 weeks, though at 6 weeks, percentages were significantly higher (p < 0.01; Mann-Whitney U test) for PVP compared to Ptx or Vent. At this time point, Ptx and Vent showed good host tissue incorporation and optimal mesothelialization. CONCLUSIONS The PVP implants showed greater adhesion formation than the other materials. Postimplantation behaviour was comparable for Ptx and Vent including scarce adhesion formation and optimal mesothelialization. Regarding tissue integration, Ptx showed greater long-term collagenization of the neoformed tissue.","García-Moreno, F; Sotomayor, S; Pérez-López, P; Pérez-Köhler, B; Bayon, Y; Pascual, G; Bellón, J M",Surgical endoscopy,65,1

The target population was the subjects aged 60 and over living in Tehran. Multistage cluster sampling was done to select the subjects from all Tehran districts. After an initial interview, all subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations including the measurement of visual acuity and refraction as well as slit lamp biomicroscopy to evaluate Meibomian glands. RESULTS Of 3791 selected subjects, 3310 participated in the study. The data of 3284 participants were analyzed. The mean age of the subjects was 68.24 ± 6.53 years (range: 60-97 years) and 57.8% of them were female. The total prevalence of MGD was 71.2% (68.3-74.1), and 38.1% (8.35-40.4), 30.3% (27.4-33.2), and 2.8% (2-3.6) of the subjects had MGD stage 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The prevalence of MGD was significantly higher in men (p < 0.001) and increased with age from 64.4% in the age group 60-64 years to 82.4% in subjects aged 80 years and over. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of MGD between smokers and nonsmokers; however, severe MGD was more common in smokers. The prevalence of MGD was 76.3% and 68.52% in subjects with and without a history of ocular surgery, respectively. The prevalence of MGD stage 3 and 4 was higher in subjects with a history of ocular surgery. CONCLUSIONS In line with the results of other studies in Asian countries, this study found a high prevalence of MGD in an elderly population of Iran. It was found that male gender and advanced age were risk factors of MGD and smoking and history of ocular surgery might worsen this disease in MGD patients.","Hashemi, Hassan; Asharlous, Amir; Aghamirsalim, Mohamadreza; Yekta, Abbasali; Pourmatin, Rama; Sajjadi, Masoome; Pakbin, Mojgan; Asadollahi, Mohammadreza; Khabazkhoob, Mehdi",International ophthalmology,65,1

OBJECTIVE We offer the first investigation of the effects of confinement during the COVID-19 crisis on neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD. METHODS We contacted caregivers of 38 patients with AD who were confined to their homes for nearly two months and asked them to report whether patients experienced any change in neuropsychiatric symptoms during, compared to before, the confinement and rate its severity and impact on themselves using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. RESULTS Among the 38 patients, only 10 demonstrated neuropsychiatric changes during the confinement. Cognitive function of these 10 patients, assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination, was worse than that of patients who did not demonstrate neuropsychiatric changes. Interestingly, among the 10 patients with neuropsychiatric changes, the duration of confinement significantly correlated with the severity of symptoms as well as with their caregivers' distress. DISCUSSION The confinement seems to impact neuropsychiatric symptomatology in AD patients with low baseline cognitive function.","Boutoleau-Bretonnière, Claire; Pouclet-Courtemanche, Hélene; Gillet, Aurelie; Bernard, Amelie; Laure Deruet, Anne; Gouraud, Ines; Mazoue, Aurelien; Lamy, Estelle; Rocher, Laetitia; Kapogiannis, Dimitrios; El Haj, Mohamad",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,65,5

The lack of vaccines and antivirals prevents clinical strategies against the disease, creating an emerging need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Strategies for vaccine development include complete vaccines against viruses, subunits, and nucleic acids, but are still in their early stages. Studies carried out to date on possible SARS-CoV2 drug targets highlight glycoprotein S, Mpro (main protease or protease type 3C), and a member of the transmembrane serine protease II families (TMPRSS2). However, due to the pandemic state, priority is given to marketed drugs. These include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV / r), in addition to treatment with convalescent plasma. But, therapeutic specific effects against SARS-CoV2 have not yet been verified. Most of the information obtained about treatment is based on preliminary and limited studies. We conclude that, at this time of emergency, the search for new therapies is more urgent due to the need to save lives.

METHODS Patients with Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic classes 2 and 3 were enrolled in this study. QoL was measured using the EuroQol descriptive system (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and patients chose to receive either endovenous treatment or surgery after consulting with their surgeons. The QoL before the intervention, at 1 week, and at 1 month after the intervention were evaluated. Patients who reported ""no problem"" in each domain of the EQ-5D questionnaire before and 1 month after the intervention were compared. Utility gain was estimated from the questionnaire and compared between clinical classes. The proportion of worsening QoL at 1 week after the intervention was compared between patients receiving endovenous procedures and surgery. RESULTS A total of 83 patients-56 received endovenous procedures [23 received ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) and 33 received radiofrequency ablation (RFA)] and 27 received surgery-were enrolled. QoLs were significantly better in all domains after the intervention: pain/discomfort (58%), mobility (42%), anxiety/depression (38%), usual activities (19%), and self-care (9%). Utility gain was 0.255 (95% confidence interval: 0.197-0.313) and higher in class 3. At 1 week after the intervention, surgery had significantly higher patients with worse mobility scores. Among endovenous procedures, UGFS had higher patients with worse pain/discomfort scores than RFA at 1 week after the intervention (16% vs. 0%, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION GSV ablation for GSV reflux in Thai patients with CEAP C2 and C3 categories significantly improves both physical and mental QoL; patients who received endovenous procedures were found to have better early physical QoL.","Siribumrungwong, Boonying; Noorit, Pinit; Wilasrusmee, Chumpon; Teerawattananon, Yot; Thakkinstian, Ammarin",Asian journal of surgery,65,8

However, epidemiological studies in ophthalmology are still scarce in Japan, and the sizes of the cohorts are relatively small. ""Ganka-Ekigaku Network"" (GEN, an acronym for the epidemiological network in ophthalmology in Japanese) is established to develop a capacity to boost each epidemiological study and enrich a potential inter-study collaboration to identify risk factors of visual impairment in aged society. METHODS We reviewed cohort studies in Japan with the inclusion criteria as: (1) at least n = 1000 at baseline, (2) multiple modalities of ophthalmic data, and (3) diagnosis reviewed by ophthalmologist(s), and (4) ophthalmologists are involved in the investigators group. As of January 2020, GEN includes 4 individual Japanese epidemiological studies namely, Hisayama study, Yamagata Study (Funagata), Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort study, and the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. RESULTS GEN includes approximately 25,000 Japanese participants. The baseline surveys started from 1998 to 2012, and since then the data has been prospectively collected approximately every 5 years. A variety of ophthalmic measurements and other factors have been collected in each study in GEN: ophthalmic measurements (fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, etc.), systemic conditions (laboratory data, etc.), and others (DNA, etc.). CONCLUSION GEN is an open platform for observational ophthalmic epidemiological studies to share standardized methodologies.

METHOD The experiment was conducted on five domestic pigs. Each animal received six implants in mandible according to the split-mouth design. On one randomly chosen jaw side, mini-incision flapless surgery was performed, whereas on the opposite jaw side, flap was raised. After 3 months of implant healing through submerged approach, the experimental animals were sacrificed and samples for immunohistochemical analyses were taken from the buccal side of peri-implant mucosa next to the neck of implants, from three levels. The study outcome was the presence of vascular structures and elements of the blood vessels in the peri-implant mucosa per microscopic field, estimated through ordinal scores from 0 to 2. Effects of surgical approach, site of implantation, and their interaction on vascular scores of peri-implant mucosa were assessed by Brunner and Langer nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data. RESULTS Statistically significant effect of surgical approach on vascularity of peri-implant mucosa has been revealed in the second mucosal layer, where flapless approach provided higher vascularity compared with flap approach (P = 0.002). In the remaining two layers, surgical approach did not affect mucosal vascularity significantly (layer 1: P = 0.071; layer 3: P = 0.433). CONCLUSION The flapless surgical implant placement approach using mini-incision provides better vascularization of peri-implant mucosa after 3 months of healing compared with flap surgery.","Lazić, Zoran; Golubović, Mileta; Marković, Aleksa; Šćepanović, Miodrag; Mišić, Tijana; Vlahović, Zoran",Clinical oral implants research,65,26

The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed >200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle's structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP's imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied. The PC on the nanoMIPs appeared to be driven by the protein composition of the plasma, while the template protein, towards which a nanoMIP was imprinted and that was proven to have high affinity for, did not influence the PC.","Capriotti, Annalaura; Piovesana, Susy; Chiozzi, Riccardo Zenezini; Montone, Carmela Maria; Bossi, Alessandra Maria; Laganà, Aldo",Journal of proteomics,65,1

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has the potential of generating highly conformal and concave dose distributions around complex target and is ideally suited for HNC treatment. Conventionally, the focus of IMRT for HNC patients has been on prevention of radiation-induced parotid dysfunction. In the present article, we review the potential of IMRT to reduce the risk of posttreatment aspiration and dysphagia and spare submandibular gland. We also discuss the impact of IMRT on overall survival and quality of life (QoL) for HNC patients. Small retrospective and prospective studies show that reducing dose to adjoining organs at risks is feasible and decreases the risk of posttreatment dysphagia and aspiration without compromising local control. IMRT is associated with improved QoL in several important domains including swallowing, dry mouth, sticky saliva, social eating, and opening of the mouth; however, improvement in global QoL is inconsistent. Delivery of IMRT for HNC is associated with improved survival at nasopharyngeal subsite. Small studies demonstrate improved treatment outcomes with swallowing-sparing IMRT.

RECENT FINDINGS When complications are methodically and systematically recorded, 64% of patients will sustain a complication within 90 days of radical cystectomy. Various preoperative, postoperative, and intraoperative strategies have been identified to reduce morbidity. Prior to surgery, patients should have reversible medical conditions treated, mechanical bowel preparation can be omitted if using small bowel for reconstruction, venous thromboembolism and antimicrobial infection prophylaxis should be initiated, nutrition should be optimized, and patient education should be provided. During surgery, complications can be attenuated by utilizing meticulous surgical technique, minimizing blood loss, fluid management can be guided by transesophageal cardiovascular Doppler, and lower extremity repositioning should be performed as soon as feasible. After surgery, early mobilization, incentive spirometry, early nasogastric tube removal, alvimopan usage, and judicious jejunostomy tube feeding, or total parenteral nutrition usage may reduce morbidity.

DESIGN Secondary analysis of prospective equivalence study. SETTING Three US urban teaching hospitals. SAMPLE Seventy-four parturients with a normal term pregnancy. METHODS The parent study assessed performance of two methods of external fetal heart rate monitoring (abdominal fetal electrocardiogram and Doppler ultrasound) and of uterine contraction monitoring (electrohystero-graphy and tocodynamometry) compared with internal monitoring with fetal scalp electrode and intrauterine pressure transducer. Reliability of external techniques was assessed by the success rate and positive percent agreement with internal methods. Bland-Altman analysis determined accuracy. We analyzed data from that study according to maternal body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed the relationship between body mass index and monitor performance with linear regression, using body mass index as the independent variable and measures of reliability and accuracy as dependent variables. RESULTS There was no significant association between maternal body mass index and any measure of reliability or accuracy for abdominal fetal electrocardiogram. By contrast, the overall positive percent agreement for Doppler ultrasound declined (p = 0.042), and the root mean square error from the Bland-Altman analysis increased in the first stage (p = 0.029) with increasing body mass index. Uterine contraction recordings from electrohysterography and tocodynamometry showed no significant deterioration related to maternal body mass index. CONCLUSIONS Accuracy and reliability of fetal heart rate monitoring using abdominal fetal electrocardiogram was unaffected by maternal obesity, whereas performance of ultrasound degraded directly with maternal size. Both electrohysterography and tocodynamometry were unperturbed by obesity.","Cohen, Wayne R; Hayes-Gill, Barrie",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,65,1

Patients with neurologic involvement had acute neurologic signs, symptoms, or diseases on presentation or during hospitalization. Life-threatening involvement was adjudicated by experts based on clinical and/or neuroradiologic features. Exposures Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Main Outcomes and Measures Type and severity of neurologic involvement, laboratory and imaging data, and outcomes (death or survival with new neurologic deficits) at hospital discharge. Results Of 1695 patients (909 [54%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 9.1 [2.4-15.3] years), 365 (22%) from 52 sites had documented neurologic involvement. Patients with neurologic involvement were more likely to have underlying neurologic disorders (81 of 365 [22%]) compared with those without (113 of 1330 [8%]), but a similar number were previously healthy (195 [53%] vs 723 [54%]) and met criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (126 [35%] vs 490 [37%]).

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HER3 are currently being investigated for treatment of various types of cancers. Cumulative evidence suggests that affibody molecules may be appropriate alternatives to mAbs. We previously reported a fusion construct (3A3) containing two HER3-targeting affibody molecules flanking an engineered albumin-binding domain (ABD035) included for the extension of half-life in circulation. The 3A3 fusion protein (19.7 kDa) was shown to delay tumour growth in mice bearing HER3-expressing xenografts and was equipotent to the mAb seribantumab. Here, we have designed and explored a series of novel formats of anti-HER3 affibody molecules fused to the ABD in different orientations. All constructs inhibited heregulin-induced phosphorylation in HER3-expressing BxPC-3 and DU-145 cell lines. Biodistribution studies demonstrated extended the half-life of all ABD-fused constructs, although at different levels. The capacity of our ABD-fused proteins to accumulate in HER3-expressing tumours was demonstrated in nude mice bearing BxPC-3 xenografts. Formats where the ABD was located on the C-terminus of affibody binding domains (3A, 33A, and 3A3) provided the best tumour targeting properties in vivo. Further development of these promising candidates for treatment of HER3-overexpressing tumours is therefore justified.","Altai, Mohamed; Leitao, Charles Dahlsson; Rinne, Sara S; Vorobyeva, Anzhelika; Atterby, Christina; Ståhl, Stefan; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Löfblom, John; Orlova, Anna",Cells,65,22

For this reason, public health interventions have sought to constrain unrepeated or recurrent gatherings to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Unfortunately, the range of different types of gatherings hinders specific guidance from setting limiting parameters (e.g. total size, number of cohorts, the extent of physical distancing). Methods We used a generic modelling framework, based on fundamental probability principles, to derive simple formulas to assess introduction and transmission risks associated with gatherings, as well as the potential efficiency of some testing strategies to mitigate these risks. Results Introduction risk can be broadly assessed with the population prevalence and the size of the gathering, while transmission risk at a gathering is mainly driven by the gathering size. For recurrent gatherings, the cohort structure does not have a significant impact on transmission between cohorts. Testing strategies can mitigate risk, but frequency of testing and test performance are factors in finding a balance between detection and false positives. Conclusion The generality of the modelling framework used here helps to disentangle the various factors affecting transmission risk at gatherings and may be useful for public health decision-making.","Champredon, David; Fazil, Aamir; Ogden, Nicholas H",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,65,16

Hospitals worldwide have decreased face-to-face visits to reduce the exposure to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prenatal and postpartum care are essential for the health of women and their fetuses. Therefore, many hospitals have incorporated telehealth into their protocols. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine how health care organizations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by incorporating telehealth visits into their protocols for obstetrics care, what services were converted to telehealth, and its benefits and barriers. Method: A computerized literature search was performed using PubMed and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases using terms, including ""telehealth,"" ""virtual visits,"" ""obstetric,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""postpartum,"" and ""COVID-19"" for articles published before October 2020. Peer reviewed articles and guidelines were included in this review. Results: A total of 25 articles were identified. Fifteen articles reported protocols. During this pandemic, protocols developed replaced some in-person visits with telehealth visits, when no testing or vaccinations are required. The main reported benefits were minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the continuity to provide high-quality and safe care. Lack of access to high-speed internet and hardware and inaccessibility to patients were the most reported barriers. Conclusion: Telehealth provided the opportunity for reducing in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some prenatal services could be completely provided through telehealth and others require medical equipment to be delivered. Health care organizations recognized that using telehealth could be continued beyond this pandemic, as they provided many benefits for patients, medical staff, and the organizations themselves.","Almuslim, Hameeda; AlDossary, Sharifah",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,65,1

However, evidence for the role of CCE as an adjunct or alternative to CC remains equivocal. In this observational cohort study, we report our experience of using CCE to investigate patients with suspected colon pathology at a tertiary referral centre. METHODS From 2007-2015, consecutive patients requiring colonoscopy were recruited from a tertiary care centre in Malmo, Sweden. Data collected: patient demographics, indication for CCE, findings, bowel cleansing, colon transit time (CTT) and completeness of colon examination. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients (57 F/20 F, median age 56 years) were included. The reason for CCE was previously incomplete or refused CC in 39 and 26 cases, and follow up of previous findings in 12 cases, respectively. The main clinical indications were gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (n=28; 36%) and suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or follow-up of known IBD (n=23; 30%). CCE was complete in 58/77 (75%) patients. In 3 patients the colon was not reached; in the other 16, the capsule reached the rectum (n=4), sigmoid (n=6), descending colon (n=5) and transverse colon (n=1). Findings were: normal CCE (n=15; 19%) colonic diverticula (n=29; 38%), polyps (n=17; 22%), active IBD (n=12; 16%), haemorrhoids (n=8; 10%), colonic angioectasia (n=4; 5%) and cancer (n=1; 1%). Small-bowel findings were recorded in 8 (10%) patients. All patients tolerated bowel preparation and CCE well. Two patients with an ulcerated small-bowel stricture and cancer respectively experienced temporary capsule retention with spontaneous resolution. CONCLUSIONS CCE is a well-tolerated alternative to CC, but requires technological improvement and optimisation of clinical practice to meet current reference standards. Although further technical development is required, CCE may complement or even replace CC for certain clinical indications.","Toth, Ervin; Yung, Diana E; Nemeth, Artur; Wurm Johansson, Gabriele; Thorlacius, Henrik; Koulaouzidis, Anastasios",Annals of translational medicine,65,11

We examined the effect of protective side-to-side anastomosis on nerve and end organ regeneration in proximal nerve injury model. METHODS The left common peroneal nerve of 24 Sprague Dawley rats was proximally transected. In groups B and C, side-to-side neurorrhaphy was performed distally between the peroneal and tibial nerves without (group B) and with (group C) partial donor nerve axotomy inside the epineural window. Group A served as an unprotected control. After 26 weeks, the proximal transection was repaired with end-to-end neurorrhaphy on all animals. Regeneration was followed during 12 weeks with the walk track analysis. Morphometric studies and wet muscle mass calculations were conducted at the end of the follow-up period. RESULTS The results of the walk track analysis were significantly better in groups B and C compared to group A. Groups B and C showed significantly higher wet mass ratios of the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscle compared to group A. Group C showed significantly higher morphometric values compared to group A. Group B reached higher values of the fibre count, fibre density, and percentage of the fibre area compared to group A. CONCLUSIONS Protective distal side-to-side neurorrhaphy reduced muscle atrophy and had an improving effect on the morphometric studies and walk track analysis. Distal side-to-side neurorrhaphy does not prevent the regenerating axons to grow from the proximal stump to achieve distal nerve stump.","Rönkkö, Henrikki; Göransson, Harry; Taskinen, Hanna-Stiina; Paavilainen, Pasi; Vahlberg, Tero; Röyttä, Matias",Acta neurochirurgica,65,1

However, WB and ELISA have limited ability to meaningfully quantitate relative protein levels in tissues with complex cell composition, while tissue dissociation followed by FC is not feasible when tissue is limiting and/or cells difficult to isolate. While protein detection in tissue using immunofluorescent (IF) probes has traditionally been considered a qualitative technique, advances in probe stability and confocal imaging allow IF data to be easily quantitated, although reproducible quantitation of relative protein expression requires careful attention to appropriate controls, experiment design, and data collection. Here we describe the methods used to quantify the data presented in Shihan et al. Matrix Biology, 2020 which lays out a workflow where IF data collected on a confocal microscope can be used to quantitate the relative levels of a molecule of interest by measuring mean fluorescent intensity across a region of interest, cell number, and the percentage of cells in a sample ""positive"" for staining with the fluorescent probe of interest. Overall, this manuscript discusses considerations for collecting quantifiable fluorescent images on a confocal microscope and provides explicit methods for quantitating IF data using FIJI-ImageJ.","Shihan, Mahbubul H; Novo, Samuel G; Le Marchand, Sylvain J; Wang, Yan; Duncan, Melinda K",Biochemistry and biophysics reports,65,25

When there are more than just a few labels, the efficiency of the interface decreases as the user has to search for a given label sequentially. The search can be accelerated by sorting the labels alphabetically, but sorting all labels results in long and intersecting leader lines from the anchor points to the labels. This paper proposes a partially-sorted concentric label layout that leverages the search efficiency of sorting while avoiding the label display problems of long or intersecting leader lines. The labels are partitioned into a small number of sorted sequences displayed on circles of increasing radii. Since the labels on a circle are sorted, the user can quickly search each circle. A tight upper bound derived from circular permutation theory limits the number of circles and thereby the complexity of the label layout. For example, 12 labels require at most three circles. When the application allows it, the labels are presorted to further reduce the number of circles in the layout. The layout was tested in a user study where it significantly reduced the label searching time compared to a conventional single-circle layout.","Zhou, Zijing; Wang, Lili; Popescu, Voicu",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,65,31

OBJECTIVE To present the results of the United States cases employing the PulseRider device as part of the ANSWER clinical trial. METHODS Aneurysms treated with the PulseRider device among sites enrolling in the ANSWER trial were prospectively studied and the results are summarized. Aneurysms arising at either the carotid terminus or basilar apex that were relatively broad necked were considered candidates for inclusion into the ANSWER study. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were enrolled (29 female and 5 male) with a mean age of 60.9 years (27 basilar apex and 7 carotid terminus). Mean aneurysm height ranged from 2.4 to 15.9 mm with a mean neck size of 5.2 mm (range 2.3-11.6 mm). In all patients, the device was delivered and deployed. Immediate Raymond I or II occlusion was achieved in 82.4% and progressed to 87.9% at 6-month follow-up. A modified Rankin Score of 2 or less was seen in 94% of patients at 6 months.

However, there is a lack of studies on developmental toxicity of azithromycin. In this study, we observed the developmental toxicity of fetal liver induced by prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAE) in mice and explored the potential mechanism. Pregnant Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with azithromycin (37.5 and 150 mg/kg·d) from gestational day (GD) 9 to 18. After PAE, the bodyweight gain rates of pregnant mice and the birthweights of the offspring were decreased, and the liver morphology, development indexes and metabolic function were all altered in different degree in the PAE fetuses. Meanwhile, PAE decreased the fetal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels and liver IGF1 signal pathway expression, accompanied by glucocorticoid receptor-CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (GR-C/EBPα) signal enhancement. Furthermore, azithromycin disturbed hepatocyte differentiation, maturation and metabolic function via upregulating GR-C/EBPα signal and reducing the expression and secretion levels of IGF1 in HepG2 cells. These changes could be reversed by GR siRNA or exogenous IGF1. These results indicated that PAE could cause fetal liver developmental toxicity in mice, and one of the main mechanisms was that azithromycin activated the GR-C/EBPα signal, inhibited the IGF1 signal pathway, and then disturbed the hepatic proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and glycose and lipid metabolism.","Liu, Kexin; Wang, Guihua; Li, Li; Chen, Guanghui; Gong, Xiaohan; Zhang, Qi; Wang, Hui",Biochemical pharmacology,65,12

The nano-SiC has good cross-linking with MUF shell. When the nano-SiC was added in microPCMs, it behaves superior thermal conductivity and thermal storage properties. When the content of nano-SiC arrives 6 wt%, the performance of the microPCMs whose encapsulation efficiency is 65.7% is the best, and thermal conductivity increase by 59.2%. Due to the proper amount of nano-SiC added into the MUF shell, it can effectively fill the tiny holes on the MUF shell. Therefore, the microPCMs with appropriate nano-SiC have better leakage prevention. It is worth noting that MicroPCMs-6% and MicroPCMs-8% show excellent photothermal conversion property, and the photothermal conversion rate is 74.4% and 71.1% respectively in the photothermal conversion experiment. Because nano-SiC can effectively capture and absorb photons under light irradiation and convert light into heat through internal molecular vibration, the microPCMs with appropriate nano-SiC behaves well in photothermal conversion.

Chemical methods using small molecules and biological methods using proteins and nucleic acids are employed for achieving this control, albeit with limitations. We found, for the first time, that retroviral DNA integration patterns in the human genome, the result of complicated interactions between cells and viruses, can be engineered by adapting cells to the defined nanotopography of silica bead monolayers. Compared with cells on a flat glass surface, cells on beads with the highest curvature harbored retroviral DNAs at genomic sites near transcriptional start sites and CpG islands during infections at more than 50% higher frequencies. Furthermore, cells on the same type of bead layers contained retroviral DNAs in the genomic regions near cis-regulatory elements at frequencies that were 2.6-fold higher than that of cells on flat glass surfaces.

Because of these children unique needs related to manage uncertainty and overcoming situations, an in-depth approach to how they navigated through quarantine urged to better comprehend their current support needs. Forty-seven families with a child with ASD ranging in age between 2 and 17 years old (M = 7.3, SD = 3.4) from the north of Spain responded to an online developed questionnaire on different aspects of their daily life management of quarantine. Most of the families stressed that their offspring better drove quarantine than expected. Some families reported that youth participated more often in families' routines and were more communicative with their parents. Families, beyond some difficulties aroused, had more time to qualitatively spend with their children to teach new skills as autonomy or house care related skills. Families also developed new strategies to manage quarantine, such as structuring their days, using visual supports or new technologies for learning or leisure, and found more useful in this effort their family cohesion, online contact with relatives, and having online psychological supports.","Mumbardó-Adam, Cristina; Barnet-López, Silvia; Balboni, Giulia",Research in developmental disabilities,65,17

Telemedicine was quickly adopted as a major tool for pediatric rehabilitation services. This paper describes the national legislative response of the United States to the COVID-19 pandemic and the opportunities and challenges of implementing telemedicine in pediatric rehabilitation outpatient settings, consultations, as well as physician and patient education. The feasibility of performing a remote pediatric musculoskeletal and neurological tele-evaluation is also discussed. Although challenges exist, telemedicine has demonstrated its potential and has proven to be a practical system. Future developments in technology and accessibility, in addition to support from government and third-party payers, have the potential to make telemedicine an effective and vital platform in a coordinated healthcare system.","Chen, Yuxi; Kathirithamby, Dona Rani; Li, Jinpu; Candelario-Velazquez, Coral; Bloomfield, Andrew; Ambrose, Anne Felicia",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,65,31

Our aim is to describe characteristics and outcomes of the donor program at our stool bank. METHODS Donor candidates underwent a four-step selection process, including a clinical interview, blood and stool testing, a further questionnaire and a direct stool testing the day of each donation. From March 2020, specific changes to this process were introduced to avoid the potential transmission of COVID-19. We evaluated the rate of excluded candidates at each step of the screening, as well as the number of total fecal aliquots provided by qualified donors. RESULTS Overall, 114 donor candidates were evaluated. Seventy-five candidates declined to join the program for logistic or personal issues, three were excluded after the questionnaire and seven for positive stool exams. Finally, 29 (25%) subjects qualified as stool donors, and provided 70 stool samples. Fifteen samples were excluded after direct molecular stool testing. A total of 127 aliquots was finally obtained. CONCLUSIONS Donor recruitment for FMT is a challenging process, and only a small rate of candidates are eligible as donors.","Ianiro, Gianluca; Porcari, Serena; Bibbò, Stefano; Giambò, Federica; Quaranta, Gianluca; Masucci, Luca; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Cammarota, Giovanni",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,65,17

The mechanical properties of the AM1 ensemble in the cohesive film state are qualitatively equivalent to the protein β-LG, while in the mobile detergent state they are equivalent to the low molecular weight surfactant, SDS. In this work the foaming properties of AM1 are compared to those of β-LG and SDS at the same weight concentration and it is found that AM1 adsorbs rapidly to the interface, initially forming a dense foam like that formed by SDS and superior to β-LG. In addition, under solution conditions where interfacially adsorbed AM1 forms a cohesive film state the foam stability is high, comparable to β-LG. However when the interfacially adsorbed AM1 forms a foam under detergent-state conditions, the foam stability is poor. We have achieved control of foam stability through the design of a peptide that exhibits stimuli-responsive changes in the extent of intermolecular interactions between peptide molecules adsorbed at the air-water interface. These results illustrate the exciting potential of peptide surfactants to form a new class of stimuli-responsive foaming agents.","Malcolm, Andrew S; Dexter, Annette F; Middelberg, Anton P J",Soft matter,65,5

As in humans, clinical outcome in dogs is variable, ranging from acute death to asymptomatic infections or chronic heart disease. In order to characterize cardiac manifestations of T. cruzi infections, we tracked a cohort of naturally-infected dogs and a matched cohort of uninfected dogs. We hypothesized that selected measures of cardiac disease (abnormal rate, abnormal rhythm, and elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI; a biomarker of cardiac injury)) would occur more commonly in infected than uninfected dogs matched by age, breed, sex and location. In addition to the clearly positive and negative dogs, we specifically tracked dogs with discordant test results across three independent serological assays to gather clinical data that might elucidate the infection status of these animals and inform the utility of the different testing approaches. RESULTS We placed an ambulatory ECG monitor (Holter) on 48 government working dogs and analyzed 39 successful recordings that met length and quality criteria from 17 T. cruzi-infected, 18 uninfected dogs and 4 dogs with discordant results. Overall, 76.5% of positive, 100.0% of discordant, and 11.1% of negative dogs showed > 1 ECG abnormality (p < 0.0001), and positive and discordant dogs had a higher mean number of different types of ECG abnormalities than negative dogs (p < 0.001-0.014). The most common cardiac abnormalities included supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and atrioventricular block. Positive dogs had higher serum concentrations of cTnI than both negative dogs (p = 0.044) and discordant dogs (p = 0.06). Based on dog handler reports, nearly all (4/5; 80%) dogs with reported performance decline or fatigue were T. cruzi-infected dogs. CONCLUSIONS Further understanding cardiac manifestations in dogs naturally infected with T. cruzi is critical for prognostication, establishing a baseline for drug and vaccine studies, and better understanding of zoonotic risk.","Meyers, Alyssa C; Ellis, Megan M; Purnell, Julia C; Auckland, Lisa D; Meinders, Marvin; Saunders, Ashley B; Hamer, Sarah A",BMC veterinary research,65,31

DBS teleprogramming technology was developed and deployed in China before the COVID-19 outbreak. In this report, the authors share their experiences with telemedical DBS treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS Four patients (2 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 1 with major depressive disorder, and 1 with anorexia nervosa) underwent DBS surgery at Ruijin Hospital and received continuous postoperative DBS telemedicine case management from January 2020 to July 2020. DBS teleprogramming, individualized psychological support, and medical consultations were provided via the authors' DBS telemedicine platform, which also incorporated a synchronous real-time video communication system. RESULTS Forty-five DBS telemedicine sessions were conducted; there was no unexpected loss of network connection during the sessions. Of these, 28 sessions involved DBS teleprogramming. Adjustments were made to the stimulation voltage, frequency, pulse width, and contact site in 21, 12, 9, and 9 sessions, respectively. Psychological support and troubleshooting were provided during the remaining telemedicine sessions. Modest to substantial clinical improvements after DBS surgery were observed in some but not all patients, whereas stimulation-related side effects were reported by 2 patients and included reversible sleep and mood problems, headache, and a sensation of heat. CONCLUSIONS DBS telemedicine seems to offer a feasible, safe, and efficient strategy for maintaining the delivery of medical care to psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors propose that implementation of a comprehensive DBS telemedicine system, which combines DBS teleprogramming with psychological counseling, medical consultations, and medication prescriptions and delivery, could be an efficient and effective approach to manage the mental health and quality of life of patients with psychiatric disorders during future local or global public health crises.","Lin, Zhengyu; Zhang, Chencheng; Zhang, Yingying; Dai, Lulin; Voon, Valerie; Li, Dianyou; Sun, Bomin",Neurosurgical focus,65,17

Peri-operative multimodal analgesia has been used for many years; however, its efficacy still needs improvement. In the present study, a thorough peri-operative pain counseling and stratified management program based on risk assessment was implemented, with the goal of improving post-operative analgesia and patient satisfaction. METHODS This prospective, controlled, pilot study included 361 patients who underwent elective surgery. Of these 361 patients, 187 received peri-operative pain risk assessment and stratified analgesia and counseling (stratified analgesia group), while 174 received conventional multimodal analgesia (conventional group). The two groups were compared regarding the post-operative pain intensity, rescue analgesia administration, post-operative quality of recovery as assessed via the quality of recovery 40 questionnaire, total dosage of peri-operative opioids, analgesic satisfaction, and analgesic costs. RESULTS Compared with the conventional group, the stratified analgesia group reported decreased pain intensity during motion at 24 h post-operatively and required lower dosages of rescue analgesia (P = 0.03). The total quality of recovery 40 questionnaire score and the scores for physical wellbeing and pain were significantly better in the stratified analgesia group than the conventional group (P = 0.04); the stratified analgesia group also reported better scores for analgesic satisfaction (P = 0.03) and received lower dosages of opioids (P = 0.03). Analgesic costs were lower in the stratified analgesia group than the conventional group; the cost-effective ratio was 109 in the conventional group and 62 in the stratified analgesia group. CONCLUSIONS The analgesic efficacy was improved by the implementation of stratified analgesia based on surgical pain risk assessment and counseling. This stratified analgesia protocol increased the patients' analgesic satisfaction and improved the quality of recovery without increasing healthcare costs. The present findings may help improve the efficacy of peri-operative multimodal analgesia in clinical practice.

To reverse this trend, public health authorities are exploring cost-effective interventions, especially in high-income and middle-income countries. Community gardening offers a unique opportunity for individuals to enhance physical activity levels and improve their diet. However, synthesised evidence on the short-term or long-term effectiveness and on the costs of community gardening interventions to prevent overweight/obesity remains limited. Therefore, this review will investigate: (1) the effectiveness of voluntary participation in community gardening compared with no or a control intervention on overweight/obesity and associated health outcomes, (2) effects on different subgroups of populations and (3) the costs of community gardening interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review, limited to evaluations of community gardening interventions with controlled quantitative and interrupted time series designs. To identify relevant articles, we will systematically search 12 academic and 5 grey literature databases, as well as 2 trial registers and 6 websites. Articles will then be assessed for eligibility based on a predefined set of criteria. At least two independent reviewers will assess each article for relevance, before evaluating the methodological quality and potential bias of the studies. Data relevant to the objectives of this review will be extracted and cross-validated. Any disagreements will be mediated by a third reviewer. If feasible, meta-analyses of primary outcomes (overweight/obesity, physical activity, food intake, energy intake) will be conducted. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method to assess the overall quality of evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION For this review, no ethical approval is required as we will only extract and analyse secondary data. We aim to submit the final review manuscript to an open access journal for publication and disseminate results via conferences and social media.

METHODS We compared the challenges in haemophilia management attributed to local COVID-19 containment policies, healthcare resource availability, clotting factors supply, daily living restrictions and coping strategies employed. RESULTS Wuhan was in lockdown with strict traffic controls, enforced quarantine and overwhelmed resources. Tianjin was in relatively relaxed countermeasures to COVID-19. In Wuhan, haemophilia treatment (for bleeding, prophylaxis, multidisciplinary team care, immune tolerance induction) and patient education were severely affected, while the challenges in Tianjin were less. In both cities, patients' fear for COVID-19 infection also affected their management. Coping strategy in Wuhan included channelling of clotting factors supply from hospitals to nine pharmacies; timely transfers of in-need patients to healthcare facilities by a volunteer service network jointly coordinated by the government, hospitals and the community. Although factor concentrate supply in each city was adequate, patients still worried whether there would be enough supply to last through the pandemics. Consequently, many downgraded their treatment regimens resulting in increased bleeding episodes. In both cities, telemedicine was promoted for patient care and education. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic had varying adverse impacts on haemophilia care depending on the local infection incidence. Our experience suggests that haemophilia management strategies in the pandemic need to be established according to the local virus containment/mitigation policies, daily living restrictions and resource availability.","Zhang, Ai; Liu, Wei; Poon, Man-Chiu; Liu, Aiguo; Luo, Xiaoping; Chen, Lingling; Hu, Qun; Yang, Renchi",Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,65,16

We sought to determine whether common genetic variants influencing CRC risk might exhibit topographical differences on CRC risk through regional differences in effects on gene expression in the large bowel mucosa. We conducted a site-specific genetic association study (10,630 cases, 31,331 controls) to identify whether established risk variants exert differential effects on risk of proximal, compared to distal CRC. We collected normal colorectal mucosa and blood from 481 subjects and assessed mucosal gene expression using Illumina HumanHT-12v4 arrays in relation to germline genotype. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were explored by anatomical location of sampling. The rs3087967 genotype (chr11q23.1 risk variant) exhibited significant site-specific effects - risk of distal CRC (OR=1.20, P=8.20x10-20 ) with negligible effects on proximal CRC risk (OR=1.05, P=0.10). Expression of 1261 genes differed between proximal and distal colonic mucosa (top hit PRAC gene, fold-difference=10, P=3.48x10-57 ). In eQTL studies, rs3087967 genotype was associated with expression of 8 cis- and 21 trans-genes. Four of these (AKAP14, ADH5P4, ASGR2, RP11-342M1.7) showed differential effects by site, with strongest trans-eQTL signals in proximal colonic mucosa (e.g. AKAP14, beta=0.61, P=5.02x10-5 ) and opposite signals in distal mucosa (AKAP14, beta=-0.17, P=0.04). In summary, genetic variation at the chr11q23.1 risk locus imparts greater risk of distal rather than proximal CRC and exhibits site-specific differences in eQTL effects in normal mucosa. Topographical differences in genomic control over gene expression relevant to CRC risk may underlie site-specific variation in CRC. Results may inform individualised CRC screening programmes.

Global burdens of drug-resistant TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens have a particular impact on paediatric age groups, necessitating a paediatric-focused agenda to address emerging resistance. Dedicated approaches are needed to find, successfully treat and prevent resistant infections in paediatric populations worldwide. Challenges include the diagnosis and identification of resistant infections, limited access to novel antimicrobials or to paediatric-friendly formulations, limited access to research and clinical trials and implementation challenges related to prevention and successful completion of treatment. In this review, the particular complexities of emerging resistance in TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens in children, with attention to both clinical and public health challenges, are highlighted. Key principles of a paediatric-focused agenda to address antimicrobial resistance are outlined. They include quality of care, increasing equitable access to key diagnostics, expanding antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention across global settings, and health system strengthening. Increased access to research studies, including clinical trials, is needed. Further study and implementation of care models and strategies for child- or adolescent-centred management of infections such as HIV and TB can critically improve outcome and avoid development of resistance.

In addition to apoptosis, necroptosis is also one of the mechanisms of cell death that can be activated by viral infection. Activation of necroptosis leads to the phosphorylation of mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) by receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and results in MLKL oligomerization and membrane translocation, leading to membrane disruption and a loss of cellular ion homeostasis. It has recently been reported that influenza A virus (IAV) infection induces necroptosis. However, the underlying mechanism of the IAV-mediated necroptosis process, particularly the roles of IAV proteins in necroptosis, remains unexplored. Here, we report that IAV infection induces necroptosis in macrophages and epithelial cells. We demonstrate that the NS1 protein of IAV interacts with MLKL. Coiled-coil domain 2 of MLKL has a predominant role in mediating the MLKL interaction with NS1. The interaction of NS1 with MLKL increases MLKL oligomerization and membrane translocation. Moreover, the MLKL-NS1 interaction enhances MLKL-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) processing and secretion.IMPORTANCE Necroptosis is a programmed cell death that is inflammatory in nature owing to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns from the ruptured cell membrane. However, necroptosis also constitutes an important arm of host immune responses. Thus, a balanced inflammatory response determines the disease outcome. We report that the NS1 protein of IAV participates in necroptosis by interacting with MLKL, resulting in increased MLKL oligomerization and membrane translocation. These results reveal a novel function of the NS1 protein and the mechanism by which IAV induces necroptosis. Moreover, we show that this interaction enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β processing and secretion. This information may contribute to a better understanding of the role of necroptosis in IAV-induced inflammation.","Gaba, Amit; Xu, Fang; Lu, Yao; Park, Hong-Su; Liu, GuanQun; Zhou, Yan",Journal of virology,65,27

This proportion may have declined during the COVID-19 pandemic because of social distancing, high-risk factors, and fear. Objective To evaluate optimal screening strategies in women who obtain some, but not all, US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)-recommended cancer screenings. Design, Setting, and Participants This modeling study was conducted from January 31, 2017, to July 20, 2020, and used 4 validated mathematical models from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network using data from 20 million simulated women born in 1965 in the US. Interventions Forty-five screening strategies were modeled that combined breast, cervical, colorectal, and/or lung cancer (LC) screenings; restricted to 1, 2, 3 or 4 screenings per year; or all eligible screenings once every 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Modeled life-years gained from restricted cancer screenings as a fraction of those attainable from full compliance with USPSTF recommendations (maximum benefits). Results were stratified by LC screening eligibility (LC-eligible/ineligible). We repeated the analysis with 2018 adherence rates, evaluating the increase in adherence required for restricted screenings to have the same population benefit as USPSTF recommendations. Results This modeling study of 20 million simulated US women found that it was possible to reduce screening intensity to 1 carefully chosen test per year in women who were ineligible for LC screening and 2 tests per year in eligible women while maintaining 94% or more of the maximum benefits. Highly ranked strategies screened for various cancers, but less often than recommended by the USPSTF. For example, among LC-ineligible women who obtained just 1 screening per year, the optimal strategy frequently delayed breast and cervical cancer screenings by 1 year and skipped 3 mammograms entirely. Among LC-eligible women, LC screening was essential; strategies omitting it provided 25% or less of the maximum benefits. The top-ranked strategy restricted to 2 screenings per year was annual LC screening and alternating fecal immunochemical test with mammography (skipping mammograms when due for cervical cancer screening, 97% of maximum benefits). If adherence in a population of LC-eligible women obtaining 2 screenings per year were to increase by 1% to 2% (depending on the screening test), this model suggests that it would achieve the same benefit as USPSTF recommendations at 2018 adherence rates. Conclusions and Relevance This modeling study of 45 cancer screening strategies suggests that women who are noncompliant with cancer screening guidelines may be able to reduce USPSTF-recommended screening intensity with minimal reduction in overall benefits.","Taksler, Glen B; Peterse, Elisabeth F P; Willems, Isarah; Ten Haaf, Kevin; Jansen, Erik E L; de Kok, Inge M C M; van Ravesteyn, Nicolien T; de Koning, Harry J; Lansdorp-Vogelaar, Iris",JAMA oncology,65,1

RESULTS The percentage of women 65 years or older who had an outpatient visits for UI over 12 months was 6.4% in the Nurses' Health Study cohort and 5.4% in the general population. The mean number of office visits for UI in 2012 was similar between nurses and the matched general population (mean = 1.8 vs 1.8; P = 0.3). A small percentage of women saw both nonspecialists and specialists for UI (9.3% in the Nurses' Health Study and 10.0% in the Center for Medicare Services cohorts). CONCLUSIONS We found that less than 7% of older women had outpatient evaluation of UI symptoms during a 12-month period, despite UI being very common in this age group. This was similar in nurses and the general population, suggesting that even high health care literacy does not increase UI care seeking.","Erekson, Elisabeth; Lane, Giulia; Mann, Jason; Austin, Andrea; Carmichael, Donald; Minassian, Vatche A; Grodstein, Francine; Bynum, Julie P W",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,65,9

India was free from PRRS until the first outbreak was reported from a North-East Indian state in 2013. Since then, disease outbreaks have been reported from North-East India and the pilot study conducted earlier showed that it is gradually spreading to the rest of India. Considering there are no locally developed population screening tests available for PRRS and imported diagnostic/screening tests are expensive, the present study was aimed at developing recombinant nucleocapsid (rN) protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Materials and Methods The rN protein of PRRS virus (PRRSV) was produced following standard cloning, expression, and purification procedures. Using this antigen, iELISA was optimized for the detection of serum antibodies to PRRSV. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were assessed by comparing it with a commercial PRRSV antibody detection kit. Result A total of 745 serum samples from ten different states of India were screened using the developed iELISA. The iELISA had a relative specificity of 76.18% and sensitivity of 82.61% compared to the commercial ELISA (Priocheck PRRSV ELISA kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Conclusion The iELISA, which deployed rN protein from Indian PRRSV, was found to be suitable in the serological survey and may be a useful tool in future disease surveillance programs.","Kashyap, S Phani; Hiremath, Jagadish; Vinutha, S; Patil, Sharanagouda S; Suresh, Kuralayanapalya P; Roy, Parimal; Hemadri, Divakar",Veterinary world,65,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty brainstem stroke patients were randomly divided into tDCS group and conventional comprehensive treatment group, including 20 patients in each group. Both groups were given routine swallowing function training, and tDCS group added transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) and Functional Dysphagia Scale (FDS) were evaluated respectively before and after 8 weeks of continuous treatment with VFSS. The white blood cell (WBC), c-reactive protein, prealbumin (PAB), albumin (Alb), and hemoglobin (Hb) were also compared between the two groups before and after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. RESULTS After 8 consecutive weeks of treatment, the score of DOSS scale and FDS scale in both groups was improved (P < 0.05), WBC and CRP were decreased (P < 0.05), and Alb and Hb were improved (P < 0.05), and PAB had no differences (P=0.474). The tDCS group was superior to conventional comprehensive group in improving the swallowing function and nutritional indexes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS tDCS therapy combined with routine training can improve the swallowing function and nutritional status of patients, and reduce infection.","Mao, Huiwen; Lyu, Yi; Li, Yan; Gan, Lin; Ni, Jiawei; Liu, Liang; Xiao, Zhengguang",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,65,12

PATIENTS AND METHODS Four patients underwent eight single-incision laparoscopic procedures. One patient underwent bilateral nephrectomies, a hernia repair, and an orchiectomy. The remaining three patients underwent unilateral nephrectomies. All procedures were performed in children using the Covidien SILS port system via an umbilical incision. RESULTS Procedures in three of four patients, representing seven of eight cases, were successfully performed via a single incision. Operative times ranged from 114 minutes to 360 minutes. There were no conversions to traditional laparoscopy. One nephrectomy was converted to an open procedure secondary to bleeding. There were no complications postoperatively, and at follow-up, all wounds were well healed. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic urologic surgery is safe and feasible in the pediatric population. The umbilical (trans or peri) approach confers improved cosmesis over traditional laparoscopy, and the scar is essentially concealed.","Marietti, Sarah; DeCambre, Marvalyn; Fairbanks, Timothy; Kling, Karen; Chiang, George",Journal of endourology,65,19

Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have an impact on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients' access to medical services. Although the difference between COVID-19 prevalence in HIV-infected individuals and general population is still unclear, the physical and mental health status of HIV infected people are needed to pay more attention on account of their growing concern of health status during COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we suggested that future studies should explore the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health outcomes of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection patients. Besides, rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection among HIV population through the high-risk population screening and the international assistance for low-income countries could be warranted.

No available reports have stated the intermediate- or long-term outcome. We report our intermediate results for the first 20 single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomies performed by a single laparoscopically trained surgeon at our institution. DESIGN Between February 2009 and September 2010, 20 consecutive patients with an indication for right hemicolectomy who were candidates for laparoscopic surgery underwent a single-port laparoscopic approach. The only exclusion was a previous midline laparotomy. The patients were followed for outcomes after a median of 27 months (range: 15 to 35). RESULTS The mean age was 65 years (range: 59 to 88). The mean body mass index was 28 (range: 20 to 35). Seventy five percent of patients had significant comorbidities, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists class of III or IV. The median estimated blood loss was 25 mL (range: 25 to 250). The mean number of lymph nodes was 13 (range: 0 to 29). There was one conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy and one to open colectomy secondary to bleeding. The mean hospital stay was 5 days (range: 3 to 7). Thirty-day postoperative complications included 1 wound infection, 1 patient with alcohol withdrawal, and 1 incidence of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection. At a median follow-up of 27 months, there were no local recurrences or distant metastases. One death occurred at 17 months from myocardial infarction. Two patients developed incisional hernias, with one requiring a laparoscopic hernia repair. One patient required a completion proctocolectomy for a pathological diagnosis of hyperplastic polyposis syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Single-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy has been safely performed in patients who are candidates for conventional laparoscopic hemicolectomy. This small series indicates that intermediate-term results are similar to conventional laparoscopic surgery in efficacy, safety, and oncological outcomes. Larger datasets are necessary to determine cost-effectiveness, differences in postoperative outcomes, and patient satisfaction.","Hopping, Jacob R; Bardakcioglu, Ovunc",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,65,17

METHODS All 62 PHEP awardees completed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's self-administered PHEP Impact Assessment as part of program review measuring public health preparedness capability before September 11, 2001 (9/11), and in 2014. We collected additional self-reported capability self-assessments from 2016. We analyzed trends in congressional funding for public health preparedness from 2001 to 2016. RESULTS Before 9/11, most PHEP awardees reported limited preparedness capabilities, but considerable progress was reported by 2016. The number of jurisdictions reporting established capability functions within the countermeasures and mitigation domain had the largest increase, almost 200%, by 2014. However, more than 20% of jurisdictions still reported underdeveloped coordination between the health system and public health agencies in 2016. Challenges and barriers to building PHEP capabilities included lack of trained personnel, plans, and sustained resources.

The hypoglossal nerve stimulator (HNS) is a promising treatment for patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA), many of whom have positive airway pressure (PAP) intolerance. Our aim was to determine adherence to and efficacy of HNS in veterans with COMISA refractory to PAP therapy compared to those with obstructive sleep apnea alone (OSA only). STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING A single, academic Veterans Affairs medical center. METHODS Review of clinical records, pre- and postoperative polysomnography, and clinical measures of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleepiness, and insomnia was conducted in 53 consecutive cases of veterans with OSA undergoing HNS implantation. HNS adherence was obtained at postoperative visits. HNS adherence and efficacy were compared between individuals with COMISA and OSA only. RESULTS COMISA was noted in 30 of 53 (56.6%) veterans studied. There was no significant difference between HNS adherence in patients with COMISA and OSA only (5.6 vs 6.4 h/night, P = .17). HNS implantation improved polysomnographic and clinical measures of OSA and sleepiness in both COMISA and OSA only, and 56.5% (13/23) of patients with COMISA self-reported improvement in insomnia after surgery. CONCLUSION HNS was successful in treating a complex veteran population with COMISA refractory to PAP when examining measures of treatment adherence and efficacy. Future studies of patients with COMISA undergoing HNS will examine effective combination therapy targeting insomnia and a multidisciplinary effort to optimize treatment adherence.","Dhanda Patil, Reena; Hong, Michael P; Ishman, Stacey L",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,65,12

Recently, our group has developed murine mAbs with specificity for the κ (Igκ) and λ (Igλ) L chains of ferret Ig. These mAbs were used to quantify the abundance of Igκ and Igλ in serum and to evaluate L chain usage of the Ab response against the hemagglutinin (HA) protein elicited by influenza infection. After influenza A infection of immunologically naive ferrets with various H1N1 or H3N2 strains, the acute Ab response against HA exhibited an inherent bias toward λ L chain usage. In contrast, secondary infection of H1N1 preimmune ferrets with an antigenically distinct H1N1 virus elicited a recall response against the original HA that was no longer biased toward Igλ and possessed differential specificity. Moreover, sequential infection of ferrets with H1N1 influenza viruses elicited an Igκ-biased Ab response directed against the HA globular head and stem regions. Furthermore, sequential infection of ferrets with viral vectors expressing chimeric HA, aimed at boosting Ab reactivity against the HA stem region, also elicited an Igκ-biased response. Collectively, these findings suggest that ferret B cells expressing an Igκ or Igλ BCR possess differential specificities, and highlight the utility of our recently developed mAbs for studying the immune response to influenza virus infection and vaccination in the ferret model.","Kirchenbaum, Greg A; Allen, James D; Layman, Thomas S; Sautto, Giuseppe A; Ross, Ted M",Journal of immunology,65,10

However, the jump to clinical testing was lethal in some cases as a full understanding of the mechanism of antiviral activity as opposed to pleiotropic activity/toxicity for these drugs was lacking. Through parallel lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses we observed massive reorganization of lipid profiles of infected Vero E6 cells, especially plasmalogens that correlated with increased levels of virus replication. Niclosamide (NIC), a poorly soluble anti-helminth drug identified for repurposed treatment of COVID-19, reduced the total lipid profile that would otherwise amplify during virus infection. NIC treatment reduced the abundance of plasmalogens, diacylglycerides, and ceramides, which are required for virus production. Future screens of approved drugs may identify more druggable compounds than NIC that can safely but effectively counter SARS-CoV-2 subversion of lipid metabolism thereby reducing virus replication. However, these data support the consideration of niclosamide as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic given its modulation of lipophagy leading to the reduction of virus egress and the subsequent regulation of key lipid mediators of pathological inflammation.","Garrett, Timothy J.; Coatsworth, Heather; Mahmud, Iqbal; Hamerly, Timothy; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Yazd, Hoda S.; Ayers, Jasmine; Miller, Megan R.; Lednicky, John A.; Dinglasan, Rhoel R.",bioRxiv,65,27

Our objective was to examine the odds of neurological and psychiatric adverse reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We analyzed all Adverse Vaccine Reaction reports to the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency between December 9, 2020 and June 30, 2021 that mentioned the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines. We compared the rates of adverse neurological and psychiatric reactions with ChAdOx1 to those with BNT162b2. P-values were obtained by a Bonferroni-adjusted Z-test for proportions. Results: As of June 30, 2021, 53.2 M doses of ChAdOx1 and 46.1 M doses of BNT162b2 had been administered. We extracted information from 300,518 distinct reports. The number of individual adverse neurologic or psychiatric reaction reports were less than 200/M doses administered, except headache which was reported in 1,550 and 395 cases/M doses of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, respectively. Compared to BNT162b2, cerebral hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, headaches and migraines, Guillain-Barre syndrome and paresthesias, tremor and freezing, delirium, hallucinations, nervousness, poor sleep quality, and postural dizziness were more frequently reported with ChAdOx1. Reactions more frequently reported with BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 were Bell's palsy, facial paralysis, dysgeusia, anxiety, and presyncope or syncope. Conclusion: Significant differences in the neurologic and psychiatric adverse event profiles of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines may exist, emphasizing the need for additional research.

The objective of this study was to determine the clinical and radiological presentations, and clinical outcomes in cases of PRES admitted over the last one year at a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analysed all cases diagnosed with PRES from May 2019 to May 2020. We reviewed clinical presentations, etiological history, imaging characteristics, management and clinical outcomes. Results: Five patients diagnosed with PRES were identified. All patients were females, with age range between 16 to 32 years. Etiological factors were eclampsia (2/5), drug (tacrolimus), massive blood transfusion and chronic kidney disease with hypertension. Headache was the most common clinical presentation. Other clinical presentations were visual symptoms, seizures, altered sensorium, vertigo and vomiting. The most common imaging characteristic was supratentorial T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensity on MRI, predominantly in parieto-occipital region. Other areas of white matter involvement were cerebellum and brainstem. One patient had hemorrhage complicating PRES. All patients were primarily managed by elimination and treatment of the precipitating factors, along with standard antioedema measures and anti-epileptic drugs. There was complete recovery in all patients within one week. Conclusion: PRES has variable clinical and radiological presentation. Early diagnosis and elimination of precipitating factors are vital for complete recovery. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y.

Objectives: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on therapeutic maintenance of patients with Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases (CIRD) and to identify related factors to difficulties in access to rheumatologist care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with rheumatic diseases using a questionnaire providing information on patients and disease characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on access to rheumatologist care and therapeutic maintenance during the confinement. Reasons of therapeutic interruption and of diificulties in access to healthcare were precised. Results: We received answers from 350 patients (female sex of 68%, mean age of 46,1 ± 14,4 years) suffering from Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases (CIRD):rheumatic arthritis (RA) (62.3%), spondyloarthropathies (34.3%), and undifferentiated CIRD (3.4%). The global average disease evolution was 12,1 ± 9,7 years. The patients were treated with conventional Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) and biologic Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in respectively 67.4% and 30.6% of cases. Corticosteroids and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatories (NSAIDs) intake was noted in 39.1 and 33.7% of patients. Difficulties to access to rheumatologist care appointments were reported in 82.9% of the participants. Reasons of thoses difficulties are summurized in Figure 1. Half of patients declared that the pandemic had affected their therapeutic compliance. Discontinued drugs were in decreasing order: Synthetic antimalarials (68.4%), NSAIDs (45.8%), Methotrexate (43.8%), bDMARDs (25.2%), Sulfasalazine (18.2%) and Corticosteroids (10,2%). Causes of treatments interruption are summarized in Table I. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted heavly on therapeutic maintenance in CIRD patients in our country. Patients expressed many difficulties in access to appropiate management. Facing to all thoses consequences, we need to devolopp as soon as possible adequate solutions adapted in such health crisis, especially therapeutic education and telemedecine.","El Joumani, T.; Rkain, H.; Fatima Zahrae, T.; Kenza, H.; Radouan, A.; Laila, N.; Bahloul, S.; Nada, E.

It documents how its economic impact will be severe and highly differentiated. It will be differentiated among industries and firms, hitting more services than manufacturing, and some services at most. Among people, hitting more less qualified workers than highly skilled;younger workers more than older ones;women more than men. Among territories: hitting more touristic areas;its long term effects on cities are still difficult to be quantified. The recovery plan under definition by the Italian government will play a crucial role in reducing those effects and relaunching the economy: however, planning and implementing public investments requires a careful design. © 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

Increasing safety comes in many forms: directly, as when doctors, paramedics, and nurses assist patients, and indirectly, as when farmworkers produce life-sustaining food, garbage collectors protect sanitation, and social workers respond to emergency calls. A range of such workers are owed gratitude-derived duties from citizens that are best fulfilled via permanent residency. I defend this claim first for authorized migrants and then for unauthorized migrants, whose presence citizens would consent to if they were aware of the benefits they provide. Finally, I defend the claim that many frontline workers not owed gratitude are owed duties of justice, acquiring rights similar to those of permanent residency. © The Author(s), 2021.

Failure would result in significant strain on staff wellbeing and patient safety.MethodsWe assessed the challenge by discussing with colleagues, meeting the site medical director and joining calls with strategic leaders.Central hospital planning provided details of expected clinical need and acuity. Junior doctors were engaged in daily handover meetings and via instant messaging.We developed a rota covering all medical wards, increasing on-call and night staffing and ensuring adequate rest. We split the hospital into zones and organised colleagues into colour-coded teams. This provided team spirit and support in a difficult environment. Evident immediately were improvements in both perceptions of patient safety and morale.ResultsWe carried out a survey of colleagues. Of the approximately 60 colleagues involved, 37 responded to 21 questions. (A = Agree, SA = Strongly Agree, N = Neutral)Perceptions of safe ward staffing before and after rota introduction: 32% vs 86% (A/SA)Perceptions of safe on-call staffing before and after rota introduction: 24% vs 92% (A/SA)Adequate notice on COVID rota change: 73% (A/SA/N)Adequate consultation on COVID rota change: 92% (A/SA/N)Team-based rota pattern beneficial86% (A/SA)ConclusionsThis work identified the need for adequate consultation when changing working practices.

In spite of the advances made in the comprehension of these concepts, the dynamic nature of the industry continually generates new practical challenges for the public and private agents of the sector and scientific challenges for tourism researchers. Currently, globalization and digital progress, the emergence of new marketing platforms, the increased saturation of certain destinations and the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly affecting the competitiveness and sustainability of tourism activity. This calls for a scientific review of what we know about the competitiveness and sustainability of the sector and an analysis of its feasibility in this new competitive environment that is constantly and intensely transforming, even more so in the post-COVID19 era. The objective of this article is to conceptually analyze the state of this question, using Spain as a case study, as it has been the global leader in tourism competitiveness in recent years. The high level of consolidation of the Spanish tourism sector enables us to make a more in-depth analysis of the implications of these phenomena and to extract practical lessons for destinations that are in the more initial phases of their life cycles.","Ramon-Rodriguez, A.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to run traditional local evaluations due to social distancing restrictions to reduce infections. Remote synchronous and asynchronous evaluation methods may be a solution if it can be used by various user groups, including people with impairments. Incorporating video conferencing systems into traditional remote evaluations can be a valuable supplement to—or, given the current situation, alternative to—traditional usability and accessibility evaluations. We present a protocol for remote formative usability evaluations designed with accessibility in mind. The protocol explains how to prepare for an evaluation and its technical setup, how to conduct synchronous evaluations using video conferencing systems, and how to debrief and analyze the collected data. We tested this protocol in a pilot study for an ongoing project where we ran both synchronous and asynchronous remote evaluations. In our pilot, the synchronous evaluation using video conferencing systems provided opportunities for richer qualitative data than the asynchronous evaluation as we ran it. The findings from the pilot study indicate that the protocol is feasible and can be used when having participants with diverse abilities or impairments. We also provide suggestions for others that wish to adapt the protocol. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Simon-Liedtke, J. T.; Bong, W. K.; Schulz, T.; Fuglerud, K.

Therefore, teachers have switched to distance education;students have been invited to join the platforms set up. Similarly, Regional Center for Education and Training (CRMEF) has been mobilized to ensure the continuity of the pre-service training for future teachers. This research aims to assess the distance education satisfaction of future teachers during confinement. A descriptive study was conducted by using the Google Forms tool. No less than 360 trainee teachers from the Rabat-Salé-Kenitra Regional Center (CRMEF) participated in the study. A qualitative approach was carried out to develop the construct. After validation of the questionnaire by the research committee, the questionnaire was self-administered. The reliability of the questionnaire was determined. A total of 360 responses were received (30% men and 70% women). Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire turns out to be 0.8. On the whole, 58.33% of the confined trainees were dissatisfied about distance learning. 60% of the participants did not have computer equipment, while 73.33% reported that they have connection and network problems. Switching to distance learning was not a choice. Remains the best solution to complete the modules of the qualifying training of trainee teachers before their assignment.

Selective perfusion techniques have been developed to prevent the deleterious consequences of DHCA associated hypoperfusion. The effectivity of low body perfusion through cannulation of the femoral artery with an arterial sheath remains to be elucidated. We compared perfusion and inflammation in patients receiving selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) only to low body perfusion (LBP) in addition to ACP during DHCA for aortic arch reconstruction surgery. There was no difference in patient characteristics, cardiac pathologies, or performed procedures between ACP and LBP groups. Lactate levels increased after cardiac arrest in both groups. However, lactate levels were lower after 1 h reperfusion, at the end of extracorporeal circulation (ECC), and after surgery in LBP group compared to ACP only. Furthermore, creatinine was increased in ACP group on postoperative day 1 compared to LBP group but no acute kidney injury was observed in any group. IL-6 concentration increased in ACP group, while remained unchanged in LBP group compared to pre surgical values and were significantly lower compared to ACP group on postoperative days 1 and 2. LBP via an arterial sheath during cardiac arrest for aortic arch reconstruction surgery in addition to ACP, improves post ECC tissue perfusion as indicated by lower lactate levels and reduces creatinine levels suggesting milder kidney injury. LBP seems to prevent postoperative inflammation through a reduction in procedural duration or enhanced perfusion and thereby improves the outcome after aortic arch reconstruction surgery. © The Author(s) 2021.","Baehner, T.; Breuer, J.; Heinze, I.; Duerr, G.

The nucleic acids are compartmentalized into aqueous microdroplets, picoliters in volume, separated by an immiscible oil, and stabilized by a surfactant. In droplet qPCR, accurate data can only be obtained if the drops remain stable to coalescence upon thermocycling and drop contents do not diffuse to neighboring drops. In this work, we present a droplet qRT-PCR assay for quantifying influenza A virus (IAV) following systematic testing of different PCR additives, resulting in the optimal combination of Tween-20 / BSA / betaine to maintain drop stability and limit dye diffusion. We use a standard qPCR machine to generate real time amplification curves of hundreds of thousands of drops and correlate this data with constructed amplification curves obtained from hundreds of drops sampled at various cycle numbers and imaged using epifluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we tested a range of in vitro transcribed M gene and IAV viral supernatant from infected cells. We directly amplified IAV genomes from infected supernatant without an RNA extraction step. Our droplet qPCR assay enables detection of IAV down to 0.274 cpd, or a single viral genome per drop, establishing the high sensitivity and precision of our method.","Loveday, Emma Kate; Zath, Geoffrey K.; Bikos, Dimitri A.; Jay, Zackary J.; Chang, Connie B.",bioRxiv,65,29

A self administered online survey was conducted with 330 participants answering. The partial least square approach to structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to investigate the direct effects of the proposed variables. Besides, the mediation test was used to examine the indirect effects. The outcomes of the study showed that the current pandemic has an essential influence on job depression and anxiety at the retail level. Furthermore, the direct relationship between Covid-19, salary, and layoff is significant, suggesting that COVID-19 is a severe problem for employees' salaries and layoffs. In contrast, the indirect effect of Covid19, job depression, job anxiety, salary, and layoff confirm a significant relationship with partial mediation. Job depression, however, does not mediate the relationship between COVID-19 and layoff. This research only considered Klang Valley area in addition to the data collected through the convenient sampling method by using an online survey form.

It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected person during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine. However, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency issues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of depending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health authorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of failure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all transactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system consists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public places access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control subsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones. Our analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy of the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system (which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation, and storage overheads.

Little is known about the quality of death in developing countries. End-of-life cancer care varies widely, and very few centers evaluate it systematically. The aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of follow-up of cancer patients by an outpatient palliative care team (OPCT) on the end-of-life outcomes at a Cancer Center in Brazil. Methods: We retrospectively retrieved data from electronic medical records of cancer patients who were treated at a Cancer Center in Brazil and who died from cancer or associated complications during the year of 2020. They were divided into two groups: OPCT and No-OPCT. OPCT group was followedup by a multidisciplinary team composed of physician, nurse, physiotherapist, psychologist, nutritionist, social worker, speech-language therapist, and pharmacist, who regularly evaluated cancer patients during their treatments at outpatient setting. During COVID-19 pandemic, some patients were evaluated by telemedicine appointments. No-OPCT group was followed-up by cancer physicians exclusively. We performed univariate comparisons and multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards model. p &lt; 0.05 was deemed as statistically significant. Results: A total of 315 patients were included in the study: OPCT (N=122) and No-OPCT (N=193). The groups were well balanced in relation to median age (61yo vs 63yo), gender (women: 51% vs 54%), and TNM stage (stage IV: 69% vs 65%). Gastrointestinal and breast cancers were the most prevalent. The rate of home death was 44% in the OPCT group, compared to 16% in the No-OPCT group (p&lt;0.001). The rate of admission in intensive care unit in the last 30 days of life (ICU30) was 13% vs 10%, respectively (p=0.413). Likewise, the rate of patients treated with chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life (CT30) was 42% vs 51% (p=0.146). In multivariate analysis, follow-up by the OPCT was the strongest independent predictor of home death (Table). In contrast, ICU30 and CT30 were inversely correlated with this outcome. Age, gender, and TNM stage did not have influence on the place of death. Conclusions: Follow-up by an OPCT had a strong positive impact on end-of-life care of cancer patients in a country which does not have Hospice culture. The OPCT was able to offer home death to a greater number of patients, with proximity to caregivers, and respect to their beliefs and values. Our data highlight the importance of early conversations about goals of care, prognostic awareness, and end-of-life preferences, while also reinforcing the need of early referral to a palliative care team.

Previous studies hypothesized that this was due to reduced pneumococcal transmission resulting from non-pharmacological interventions. We used multiple ongoing cohort surveillance projects in children <5 years to test this hypothesis. Methods: The first SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in February-2020, resulting in a full lockdown, followed by several partial restrictions. Data from ongoing surveillance projects captured the incidence dynamics of community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP), non-alveolar lower respiratory infections necessitating chest X-rays (NA-LRI), nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in non-respiratory visits, nasopharyngeal respiratory virus detection (by PCR), and nationwide invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Monthly rates (January-2020 through February-2021 vs. mean monthly rates 2016-2019 [expected rates]) adjusted for age and ethnicity, were compared. Findings: CAAP and bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia were strongly reduced (incidence rate ratios, [IRRs] 0.07 and 0.19, respectively); NA-LRI and non-pneumonia IPD were also reduced, with a lesser magnitude (IRRs, 0.46 and 0.42, respectively). In contrast, pneumococcal carriage prevalence was only slightly reduced and density of colonization and pneumococcal serotype distributions were similar to previous years. The pneumococcus-associated disease decline was temporally associated with a full suppression of RSV, influenza viruses, and hMPV, often implicated as co-pathogens with pneumococcus. In contrast, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza activities were within or above expected levels. Interpretation: Reductions in pneumococcal and pneumococcus-associated diseases occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic were not predominantly related to reduced pneumococcal transmission and carriage but were strongly associated with the complete disappearance of specific respiratory viruses.

Only one of these proteins is essential under normal laboratory conditions: CSR-1. While CSR-1 has been studied in various developmental and functional contexts, nearly all studies investigating CSR-1 have overlooked the fact that the csr-1 locus encodes two isoforms. These isoforms differ by an additional 163 amino acids present in the N-terminus of CSR-1a. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce GFP::3xFLAG epitopes into the long (CSR-1a) and short (CSR-1b) isoforms of CSR-1, we identified differential expression patterns for the two isoforms. CSR-1a is expressed specifically during spermatogenesis and in select somatic tissues, including the intestine. In contrast, CSR-1b, is expressed constitutively in the germline. Essential functions of csr-1 described in the literature coincide with CSR-1b. In contrast, CSR-1a plays tissue specific functions during spermatogenesis, where it integrates into a spermatogenesis sRNA regulatory network including ALG-3, ALG-4, and WAGO-10 that is necessary for male fertility. CSR-1a is also required in the intestine for the silencing of repetitive transgenes. Sequencing of small RNAs associated with each CSR-1 isoform reveals that CSR-1a engages with 22G- and 26G-RNAs, while CSR-1b interacts with only 22G-RNAs to regulate distinct groups of germline genes and regulate both sperm and oocyte-mediated fertility.","Charlesworth, Amanda G.; Lehrbach, Nicolas J.; Seroussi, Uri; Renaud, Mathias S.; Molnar, Ruxandra I.; Woock, Jenna R.; Aber, Matthew J.; Diao, Annette J.; Ruvkun, Gary; Claycomb, Julie M.",bioRxiv,65,25

There exists an extreme shortage of specialist physicians which are being reported, which in turn affects the treatment of the pandemic disaster. The health sector is forcibly being switched to telemetry diagnoses and treatments. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop an efficient compression system for transmission and storage of applications in short time with great efforts. For biomedical applications, neurologists require an efficient system which provides more accurate and error free data once the signal is reconstructed. The aim is to improve the compression ratio and minimize the reconstruction error of electroencephalographic signal, designed by a two-stage compression scheme. Here, an empirical mode decomposition technique is used to breakdown the signal. The overall compression ratio (CR) of this method is 12.5:1. The transmitted EEG signals and the reconstructed EEG signal are found to be almost same with a percentage rate of distortion of 5.4%. In comparison with other lossless compression techniques, the proposed method offers high compression rate with a minimum probability of error.","Sivathanu, B. K.; Madhusoodanan, M.; Jose, C.

The purpose of this study is to explore how English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching and learning at the tertiary level in Saudi Arabia was impacted negatively and positively by the move to online learning. It reviews research published since the onset of the pandemic, with a specific focus on English language teaching at Saudi universities, to analyze the challenges faced by Saudi EFL teachers and learners since the shift to e-learning. One of the biggest challenges observed was students' lack of motivation, which upon further review was found to be linked to other contributing factors, such as technological issues, inapt learning environments, and students' mental health. This paper also examines the unforeseen positive outcomes resulting from the digital transformation, including the benefits of the flexibility of place and time and promotion of particular language skills.

Inflammatory markers LDH, Ferritin, Procalcitonin, D-Dimers and viral load itself (CT) all correlated with higher mortality while IL-6 did not. Conclusion: Serum viral load in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 correlates with higher mortality rates itself and also raises certain inflammatory markers (IL-6, D-Dimers), which are independently accountable for causing higher mortality as well. Hence, increased inflammatory markers resulted in poor prognosis regardless of high or low viral load.

The SIQR model, which is an improvement on the conventional SIR model, is unique in that it allows us to theoretically clarify the epidemic phenomenon by separating the number of daily confirmed new cases by testing and the number of infecteds at large who remain untested, and also allows us to theoretically consider measures to control the epidemic. The infection control measures of each country were analyzed by dividing them into three groups according to the size of the decay (or growth) rate of infected at large ({lambda}). The active group includes China and South Korea, the passive group includes the United States and Sweden, and the average group includes Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Japan. China and South Korea are the countries with the best testing and quarantine systems, and South Korea in particular having managed to contain the infection without lockdown through early quarantine by thorough testing. On the other hand, the United States and Sweden do not have a well-developed inspection and quarantine system and have shown little restraint in social distancing. In the case of Japan, the following special factors may have contributed to the extreme lack of PCR testing : (1) The ""4-day fever rule"" established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was strictly enforced. (2) Even after the decision to postpone the Olympics, the government continued to monopolize PCR testing for the sake of unified analysis of infection data, and the policy of expanding PCR testing by private companies was not implemented.","reiji, suda",,65,20

Previous studies have shown that antibodies that cross-react with thrombopoietin, a regulator of platelet production, can induce thrombocytopenia which is characterized by low platelet count. Thrombocytopenia is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients and is a rare side effect following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show molecular mimicry between the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, and human thrombopoietin. Our computational analyses identify a shared five-amino acid long sequence motif (TQLPP) with similar structure and antibody-binding properties for these proteins, strongly indicative of molecular mimicry with potential for cross-reactivity. Our results are supported by reports of the presence of antibodies against epitopes containing TQLPP in both COVID-19 and pre-pandemic patient samples, indicating antibody cross-reactivity between Spike and a human protein. Since the Spike protein is the antigenic component of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, altering the motif may reduce the risk for thrombocytopenia and improve long-term protection against evolving variants.

Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA virus, coronavirus, mutates frequently and circulates among animals, imposing great threat to public safety and animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infections is largely unknown. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provide evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately 80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We show that the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 is responsible for the inhibition of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs, along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A triggered transcription of IFN-β which in turn greatly affected recombinant virus replication. Further analysis showed that SGs function as antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells. Additional evidence includes the aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease nsp15 of IBV suppresses the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually ensuring productive virus replication. We speculate that coronaviruses employ similar mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation for efficient virus replication, as the endoribonuclease function of nsp15 is conserved in all coronaviruses. Author summary It has been reported that stress granules (SGs) are part of the host cell antiviral response. Not surprisingly, viruses in turn produce an array of antagonists to counteract such host response. Here, we show that IBV inhibits the formation of SGs through its endoribonuclease nsp15, by reducing the accumulation of viral dsRNA, evading the activation of PKR, and by subsequently inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation and SGs formation. Nsp15 also inhibits SG formation independent of the eIF2α pathway, probably by targeting host mRNA. Depletion of SG scaffold proteins decreases IRF3-IFN response and increases the production of IBV. All coronaviruses encode a conserved endoribonuclease nsp15, and it will be important to determine whether also other (non-avian) coronaviruses limit the formation of anti-viral SGs in a similar manner.","Gao, Bo; Gong, Xiaoqian; Fang, Shouguo; Weng, Wenlian; Sun, Yingjie; Meng, Chunchun; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Liu, Weiwei; Forlenza, Maria; Ding, Chan; Liao, Ying",bioRxiv,65,1

This study used a descriptive cross-sectional design with 111 nursing students in a public and a private nursing school as study participants. The data were collected via an online survey tool and were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The results indicated that most nursing students had intermediate computer competency (74.8%) and somewhat stable internet connection (66.7%). They generally had negative (40.5%) and ambivalent attitudes (30.6%) towards e-learning. The nursing students considered e-learning to be impersonal and to lack feeling (80.18%) and that it results in less student-teacher interaction (75.66%). There were no significant differences (p > .05) in the e-learning attitude according to the type of school, gender, ownership of a computer, level of computer competency, stability connection and internet usage. Although not statistically significant, those students with stable internet connections appear to have a better attitude towards e-learning. Ambivalence and negative attitudes seem to dominate nursing students' attitudes towards e-learning in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The MesAur1.0 genome assembly was published in 2013 using whole-genome shotgun sequencing with short-read sequence data. Current more advanced sequencing technologies and assembly methods now permit the generation of near-complete genome assemblies with higher quality and higher continuity. Findings Here, we report an improved assembly of the M. auratus genome (BCM_Maur_2.0) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to produce a chromosome-scale assembly. The total length of the new assembly is 2.46 Gbp, similar to the 2.50 Gbp length of a previous assembly of this genome, MesAur1.0. BCM_Maur_2.0 exhibits significantly improved continuity with a scaffold N50 that is 6.7 times greater than MesAur1.0. Furthermore, 21,616 protein coding genes and 10,459 noncoding genes were annotated in BCM_Maur_2.0 compared to 20,495 protein coding genes and 4,168 noncoding genes in MesAur1.0.

Bangladesh is a lower middle-income country with declining rates of poverty among its 160 million people due to persistent economic growth in conjunction with balanced agricultural improvements. Most of the rural households adopt a mixed farming system by cultivating crops and simultaneously rearing livestock. Among the animals raised, cattle are considered as the most valuable asset for the small-/medium-scale farmers in terms of their meat and milk production. Currently, along with the major health issue, the COVID-19 pandemic is hindering the world’s economic growth and has thrust millions into unemployment;Bangladesh is also in this loop. However, natural disasters such as COVID-19 pandemic and floods, largely constrain rural smallholder cattle farmers from climbing out of their poverty. In particular, small- and medium-scale cattle farmers face many issues that obstruct them from taking advantage of market opportunities and imposing a greater burden on their families and incomes. An appropriate measure can give a way to make those cattle farmers’ businesses both profitable and sustainable. Optimization of thin-film coating-assisted, self-sustainable, off-grid hybrid power generation system for cattle farming is a new and forward-looking approach for sustainable development of the livestock sector. In this study, we design and optimize a thin-film coating-assisted hybrid (photovoltaic battery generator) power system by using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER, Version 3.14.0) simulation tool. An analysis of the results has suggested that the off-grid hybrid system is more feasible for small- and medium-scale cattle farming systems with long-term sustainability to overcome the significant challenges faced by smallholder cattle farmers in Bangladesh.","Nur-E-Alam, Mohammad Hoque Mohammad Nasirul Soyed Mohiuddin Ahmed Mohammad Khairul Basher Das Narottam",Sustainability,65,27

This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of ±1.3°C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of 10×10×0.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is operated digitally, portable and low power – capable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone). We were able to quantitatively detect a 563-bp fragment (Insertion Sequence IS900) of the genomic DNA of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (extracted from cultured field samples) through PCR in real-time with a Limit-of-Detection of 20 fg, equivalent to a single bacterium, at the 30th cycle. Using TriSilix, we also detected the cDNA from SARS-CoV-2 (1 pg), through PCR, with high specificity against SARS-CoV (2003).","Nunez-Bajo, Estefania; Kasimatis, Michael; Cotur, Yasin; Asfour, Tarek; Collins, Alex; Tanriverdi, Ugur; Grell, Max; Kaisti, Matti; Senesi, Guglielmo; Stevenson, Karen; Güder, Firat",bioRxiv,65,16

Spatter generation was attributed to a number of sources including incorrect machine settings, surface contaminants, and erratic wire feeding. Random variation of different welding process parameters such as voltage, wire feed speed, and torch travel angle, affected spatter production, which served as a motivation to embark on a systematic study involving design of experiments. A total of ten most significant parameters were identified through a brainstorming process involving robotic cell operators, section managers, and subject matter experts. Using the selected ten parameters, preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate operating range for each process parameter that has the most significant impact on weld spatter. An Orthogonal L16 Array from Taguchi’s designs was chosen with four parameters at 4-levels, four parameters at 2-levels, and two parameters were held constant at 1-level. Following the establishment of a defined set of parameters and corresponding ranges of values, a series of designed experiments were conducted to measure the effect of process parameters on weld spatter production. During each designed experiment, six different responses were recorded that included, the weight of wire used, the weight of the weld bead deposited, the mass of spatter collected in a tray, audio signals generated, the spatter particle count using ImageJ, and the quality of the weld bead. The optimal process parameters identified in this study were of practical significance, and as such the recommended parameters were implemented in the industry.","Shareef, Iqbal; Martin, Christopher",Procedia Manufacturing,65,25

Objectives: Through the specific measures that have been imposed to reduce the risk of infection and death, the working hypothesis is prepared: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically decreased the hospital admissions of cancer patients, the frequency of hospitalizations and determined an increased mortality rate through the infection with SARS- CoV-2 virus in cancer patients. Methods: For a period of 16 weeks, the hospitalizations of patients to the Chronic Oncology-Palliative Care Department of ""St. Luke"" Hospital for Chronic Diseases, Bucharest, were analyzed, being compared to the same period of the previous year and, also, there were patients with symptoms specific to COVID-19 infection, tested for SARS-CoV-2 by means of RT-PCR. Results: The data analysis shows a 53.7% decrease among hospitalized patients - with 51.4 for day hospitalization and 50.2% for inpatient hospitalization, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 patients out of the 477 admitted to the Oncology Department in this period had a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test during their hospitalization and 5 patients with symptoms common for both cancer and COVID-19 had a negative result through specific testing (Table I, Table II). Two other patients recorded on the unit were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus and required admission and treatment in the COVID-19 Department. The willingness of the cancer patient to consult a physician for admission has greatly decreased in the first 16 weeks from the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Cancer patients, although at an increased risk of being infected, did not exhibit severe symptoms, and the evolution of the symptoms and the performance state after the discharge from the COVID-19 department was influenced by the age and the associated comorbidities.","Rahnea-Nita, G.; Badiu, D.

A representative quota sample of 572 adults in the US and UK participated in an online survey. First, the participants' medical use tendencies and initial vaccine acceptance were assessed; then, short vignettes were provided to evaluate their changes in attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines. For data analysis, ANOVA and post hoc pairwise comparisons were used. The participants were more reluctant to vaccinate their children than themselves and the elderly. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in vaccine development did not influence vaccine acceptance. Vignettes that explicitly stated the high effectiveness of vaccines led to an increase in vaccine acceptance. Our study suggests public policies emphasizing the vaccine effectiveness against the virus could lead to higher vaccination rates. We also discuss the public's expectations of governments concerning vaccine safety and present a series of implications based on our findings.","Lima, Gabriel; Cha, Meeyoung; Cha, Chiyoung; Hwang, Hyeyoung",,65,24

Most of the countries were affected by the COVID-19 during the year 2020. Demographic data are important to understand the impact of COVID-19 across the country and also provide information on an appropriate response, planning, and allocation of resources. This study aims to assess the demographic data of COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in a tertiary care hospital, Jaipur. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Jaipur. A total of 1149 patients' data like age, gender, area they belong to, duration of the treatment, etc., were collected from the medical records department (MRD) department between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020. The data were expressed as counts, number, and percentage (%). The data were analyzed using Excel software. Results: Out of 1149 patients, 70% were males and 30% were females, respectively, and mean ± SD (standard deviation) of age was 44.23 ± 3.57. Most of the cases were obtained from Jaipur 63%, Bikaner 5.4%, Ajmer 4.4%, Alwar 2.6%, Sawai Madhopur 2.6%, Dausa 2.3%, Nagaur 2.3%, Bharatpur 2.1%, and Karauli 1.7%, respectively, and remaining places reported <1.5% cases. Also 40 to 80 years age groups were most affected. About 32.4% mild, 55.7% moderate, and 11.8% severe cases were reported. Conclusions: More male patients were affected when compared with female patients. Age and other disease conditions have a positive correlation with COVID-19. Older people should take extra precautions and avoid going to markets, parties, etc., unless it is essential. Early identification and detection of COVID-19 helps in better treatment and preventing the conversion of mild cases into moderate or severe cases and prevents the transmission from one to another.","Babu, G.; Chundawat, B.; Pareek, R.; Kadali, R.; Thakur, A.","International Journal of Nutrition, Pharmacology, Neurological Diseases",65,20

Unfortunately our understanding of the therapeutic benefit of combining surgery with different treatment modalities including promising immunotherapeutics is limited by the current lack of easily adopted surgical models. The purpose of this study was to develop a surgically resectable model of PDAC in immunocompetent mice for use in preclinical investigations. Materials and Methods Surgically resectable orthotopic tumors were generated by injecting Pan02 cells into the tail of the pancreas. Fifteen days post implantation the primary tumors and tail of the pancreas were resected by laparotomy while preserving the spleen. Splenic function, tumor growth, immune phenotyping and survival were assessed following surgical resection of the primary tumor mass. Results As expected orthotopic tumor implants recapitulated many of the major histological hallmarks of PDAC including disrupted lobular structure and vascular invasion. Preservation of splenic immune cell viability and function was not associated with improved survival following surgery alone. However, pre-operative vaccination with GVAX was associated with improved survival which was not impacted by surgery. Conclusion This represents the first murine model of surgically resectable murine model of PDAC which recapitulates known pathological hallmarks of human disease in an immune competent model while allowing spleen preservation. This relatively simple and easily adopted approach provides an ideal platform to examine the efficacy of potential immunotherapy combinations for PDAC surgery patients.","Baxter, Katherine E; de Souza, Christiano Tanese; Tai, Lee-Hwa; Yaghini, Pasha; Daneshmand, Manijeh; Bell, John C; Lichty, Brian D; Kennedy, Michael A; Auer, Rebecca C",bioRxiv,65,24

Therefore, it is important that the required insulin value is constant and controlled. The aim of this study is to control the blood glucose value that is achieved as a desired value and to maintain it as a constant value using a proportional, integral, and derivative control unit (FOPID) fractional order of the control parameters. In this research, the new control unit is applied to Bergman's mathematical model as a non-linear and simple model that simulates the mechanism of the interaction of glucose and insulin in the blood, and based on this, a closed control loop was designed to regulate the level of blood sugar to be an automatic control of blood glucose using the measured data from Special sensor. The contribution in this scientific paper is to define the (FOPID) parameters according to the closed loop responses of the system, and these parameters were adjusted using new meta-heuristic algorithms including the Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO), the PSO Particle Swarm optimization, the Genetic Algorithm (GA), The bat optimization algorithm (BA) and (ACO). As a result, the results of the five modern algorithms were compared based on several criteria to find out which one was better using MATLAB / SIMULINK simulation. It was found that the IWO algorithm performs better than PSO. The simulation results of the closed-loop system of this controller at the time of settling, overshoot and control inputs indicate very positive results compared to previous results. In addition, a new method has been proposed which is to design a pump in the form of a valve to control insulin pumping by controlling it with the fuzzy logic control unit, which in turn, we obtained better results, compared to the results of other previous studies. © 2021 Lavoisier.

Here we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris. The RBD was modified with the addition of flexible N- and C-terminal amino acid extensions aimed to modulate the protein/protein interactions and facilitate protein purification. Fermentation with yeast extract culture medium yielded 30-40 mg/L. After purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the RBD protein was characterized by mass-spectrometry, circular dichroism, and binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The recombinant protein shows high antigenicity with convalescent human sera and also with sera from individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA or Sputnik V adenoviral-based vaccines. The RBD protein stimulates IFN{gamma}, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF in mice secreting splenocytes from PBMC and lung, CD3+ enriched cells. Immunogenicity studies with 50 g of the recombinant RBD formulated with alum, induce high levels of binding antibodies in mice and non-human primates, assessed by ELISA plates covered with RBD protein expressed in HEK293T cells. The mouse sera inhibited the RBD binding to ACE2 receptor in an in-vitro test and show neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells.

We sought to document measures of distress and perceived preparedness from diverse oncology staff during the COVID-19 pandemic response, and correlate these with unfolding events. Methods:We utilized a mixed-methods approach comprising weekly diarising of executive communications and eventsby investigators, and prospective self-administered online surveys-by staff. Survey domains included perceived institutional preparedness, personal wellbeing, and perceived stress using a distress thermometer (0-10, no-extreme distress). Responses were Likert-scaled or free-text. Quantitative responses were aggregated by role/site and analysed using R. These were correlated with emergent qualitative themes using the Framework Method. The study was conducted at a metropolitan and a regional hospital in Queensland, Australia. Results: 12 surveys across 18 weeks commencing April 3, 2020 (encompassing 1st lockdown, lockdown easing, and 2nd lockdown) had 993 individual responses. 40% respondents were located regionally. Role categories included: nursing (50%), allied health (18%), medical (16%), administrative (15%), ancillary (e.g. cleaner, food service) (1%). Emergent themes were: Strategies for protectionat work and home. Up to 27% respondents reported being able to attend to critical personal needs only sometimes or less, although patients were perceived to be well supported most/all of the time (&gt;90% responses). Navigating rules and keeping up-high levels of perceived institutional preparedness in &gt;75% responders coexisted alongside fluctuating levels of self-reported distress, from median 5 (IQR 3-7) at 1st lockdown outset to 1 (IQR 1-4) after lockdown restriction easing. Tempered optimism-pride in one's place was reported both as reflecting healthcare worker identity and as Australians in the context of low local infection rates. No significant differences in distress or preparedness perceptions were evident comparing geographic sites. Framing the new normal-although respondents longitudinally reported increasing familiarity with pandemic directives, distress levels increased concurrently with the announcement of 2nd lockdown. Conclusions: In the context of low local COVID-19 infection rates, oncology staff regardless of role and geographic setting reported high perceptions of institutional preparedness. Distress levels increased concurrently with lockdown phases and reports of distress and psychosocial workload fatigue were made by various workers including administrative and ancillary. These should be considered frontline staff for the purpose of workplace psychosocial support in pandemic responses.","Ahern, E. S.; Roberts, N. A.; Chan, B. A.; Gasper, H.

If we accept the principle that cancer is individualized then the most effective therapies will have to be designed for the individual patient and for their tumors genetic profile. Access to tumor mutational profiling is now widely available but continues to be limited by cost and actionable information. For example, novel combinations of approved drugs are rarely considered. These considerations lead us to hypothesize that artificially induced Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) derived lung organoids could provide a novel, alternate approach for LUAD disease modeling and large-scale targeted drug screening. In this project, we used data from a commercially available tumor mutation profile to generate and then validate the artificially induced LUAD-derived lung organoid simulations (aiLUNG-LUAD) to model LUAD and identify several drug combinations that effectively reverse genotypic and phenotypic features of the tumors when compared with placebo. These results complement previous LUAD-derived lung organoids research and provide a novel and widely applicable cancer drug-screening approach for precision/individualized oncology.","Esmail, S.; Danter, W.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled proportion of TB affected households who face catastrophic cost. Method: A search of the online database through September 2020 was performed. A total of 5114 articles were found, of which 29 articles got included in quantitative synthesis. Catastrophic cost is defined if total cost related to TB exceeded 20% of annual pre-TB household income. R software was used to estimate the pooled proportion at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed/random-effect models. Result: The proportion of patients faced catastrophic cost was 43% (95% CI 34-52, I2= 99%. 32% (95% CI 29 - 35, I2= 70%) among drug sensitive, and 80% (95% CI 74-85, I2=54%) among drug resistant, and 81% (95% CI 78-84%, I2= 0%) among HIV patients. Regarding active versus passive case finding the pooled proportion of catastrophic cost was 12% (95% CI 9-16, I2= 95%) versus 42% (95% CI 35-50, I2= 94%). The pooled proportion of direct cost to the total cost was 45% (95% CI 39-51, I2= 91%). The pooled proportion of patients facing catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) at cut of point of 10% of their yearly income was 45% (95% CI 35-56, I2= 93%) while at 40% of their capacity to pay was 63% (95% CI 40-80, I2= 96%). Conclusion: Despite the ongoing efforts, there is a significant proportion of patients facing catastrophic cost, which represent a main obstacle against TB control.","Ghazy, R.; El Saeh, H.

Globally, there are an estimated 685 million infections annually due to norovirus, among them 200 million children under the age of 5, causing approximately 50,000 child deaths per year and costing an estimated $60 billion annually in healthcare. In the USA, HuNoV is responsible for 19-21 million illnesses, with an average of 570-800 deaths per year. HuNoV is especially pernicious because it requires less than 100 viral particles to cause an infection, and there are few effective disinfectants. It is believed that Ultraviolet Subtype C (UVC) irradiation might prove to be an effective disinfectant. This study seeks to determine the inactivation profile of UVC against norovirus using a Klaran UVC Light-emitting diode (LED) array product number KL265-50V-SM-WD, emitting radiation at 269 nm peak wavelength and a measured fluence of 1.25 mW/cm2 at a 7 cm source-surface distance. Since the HuNoV cannot currently be propagated in cell cultures, the study utilized feline calicivirus (FCV), a recommended surrogate as challenge organism. The test followed Modified ASTM E2197. Assessment of virus inactivation was performed using plaque assay method, with Crystal Violet as a staining agent to enhance plaque visualization. Within 18 seconds of exposure time at a UVC irradiance of 1.25mW/cm2 and a dose of 22.5 mJ/cm2, the study obtained 99.9 % virus reduction (3 log reduction value). These results demonstrate that Klaran UVC-LED array (KL265-50V-SM-WD) can provide effective inactivation of HuNoV.","Mariita, Richard M.; Wilson Miller, Amy C.; Randive, Rajul V.",bioRxiv,65,19

The physical environment plays an important role in transmitting the infection. We must urgently find a solution and answer to all situations in society that have a detrimental effect on human health. When it comes to virus transmission, it is necessary to disinfect both the body and the room. The development of new technologies leads to the development of service robots that are implemented for disinfection in the medical institutions. The paper presents a review of the implementation of service robots that use ultraviolet light for disinfection in medical institutions. UV disinfection of surface with service robots is one of the most promising new technologies for several reasons, of which some are: faster treatment in the room, higher productivity, highly effective treatments, whole room treatment, one room treatment, etc. In addition to service robots for indoor disinfection, service robots for disinfection of outdoor surfaces have also been developed.

Cancer patients who utilize the PRO-CTCAE - a standardized, validated method of capturing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) - to report their symptoms have been shown to reduce symptom burden, decrease the need for acute care, and preserve quality of life. Building off this work, a fully EHR-integrated PRO system capturing side effects from surgery could significantly improve health care delivery, particularly in rural populations which has been further challenged by the COVID-pandemic. Through the NCI's Moonshot-funded IMPACT consortium, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) in collaboration with 5 other health systems and Epic designed eSyM, an EHR-integrated electronic symptom management program based on the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. eSyM was deployed at DHMC, a large rural academic medical cancer center, systems beginning in spring 2020, for gynecologic oncology patients having surgery. Prompts to complete questionnaires were disseminated via the standard DHMC Epic-based patient portal (MyChart) on a tapered schedule averaging approximately twice/week for 90 days after surgery. Each survey included at least 6 PRO-CTCAE symptom items including pain, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, wound redness and discharge as well items assessing overall wellbeing and functional status. Composite scores were generated for each symptom: 0 for no symptoms, 1-2 for mild/moderate symptoms, and 3 for severe symptoms. Reported severe symptoms automatically prompted an alert message sent directly to nursing staff. Over the past 90 days, 134 women were eligible to participate in eSyM. 101 women were sent automated eSyM questionnaires after surgery through their patient portal. 69 (68%) activated their portal account and 48 (70%) completed at least 1 questionnaire electronically to report symptoms. Women who used eSyM were younger than those who did not activate their account, 54 vs. 61 years (p=0.05). Women completed a mean of 5 questionnaires over a mean of 19 days after surgery. 20% of patients reported severe symptoms, of which pain was the most common. Women who used eSyM were less likely to require hospitalization in the 90 days after surgery than women who did not participate (p<0.005). Urgent care and ED visits following surgery were comparable between eSyM users and those never activated their account Women with activated portal accounts had high rates of eSyM utilization to report symptoms after surgery. eSyM users tended to be younger than women who did not activate their accounts. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, an electronic platform to report and monitor symptoms following surgery alleviates some of the some of the burdens placed upon the patient and health care systems with in-person care, especially in rural settings. Future areas of research will include more robust patient cohorts from other institutions utilizing eSyM, and an evaluation of health care outcomes, including symptom burden, acceptability and acute care needs associated with eSyM.

In the scheme, large amounts of resource data are stored in a distributed storage system;the evidences of uploaded data are stored in blockchain network established by high credible institutions. Once the data in the distributed storage are tampered, it will be discovered by looking up blockchain transactions. In order to make up for the lack of privacy protection in blockchain, we adopt attribute encryption. For different resources, different ciphertext policies are given. Only the users whose attributes satisfy the policy can decrypt the data. Further, a fine-grained access control scheme for e-learning is designed. In addition, the scheme can prevent collusion attacks;even if multiple users collude, they will not get more resources.","Cao, C. L.; Zhu, X.

The preformed NC is thought to act as a template on which the viral envelope can be organized. In the present work we have characterized two SFV deletion mutants which did not assemble NCs in the cytoplasm but which instead appeared to form NCs at the PM simultaneously with virus budding. The deletions were introduced in a conserved 14 residue long linker peptide that joins the amino-terminal RNA-binding domain with the carboxy-terminal serine-protease domain of the capsid protein. Despite the deletions and the change in morphogenesis, wild-type (wt)-like particles were produced with almost wt efficiency. It is suggested that the NC assembly defect of the mutants is rescued through spike-capsid interactions at PM. The results show that the preassembly of NCs in the cytoplasm is not a prerequisite for alphavirus budding. The apparent similarities of the morphogenesis pathways of wt and mutant SFV with those of type D and type C retroviruses are discussed.","Forsell, K; Griffiths, G; Garoff, H",,65,1

Infant C(3)H mice, however, developed infection and died from mouse hepatitis virus when minimal infectious doses of virus were given to them. There was a delay in the time of death compared to that of the genetically susceptible strain, and the virus recovered from these mice had increased pathogenicity for C(3)H mice. The ontogeny of resistance to hepatitis in the C(3)H mice thus progresses from delayed susceptibility to complete resistance as the age of the host increases. It is reflected in increased resistance of macrophages derived in vitro from liver cultures of infant mice of different ages. This increase in resistance with age was reduced by maintaining the cultures for a longer period of time before inoculation, or by increasing the number of explants in a given culture. Resistant cells were uniformly furnished by mice age 16 days, or more. It is concluded that a process of maturation of resistance of the cells takes place after the mice are born, but that this does not continue under in vitro conditions, and that it may be modified by the environment of the cells.","Gallily, Ruth; Warwick, Anne; Bang, Frederik B.",J Exp Med,65,33

Virus-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that recognize infected cells and contribute to viral clearance and tissue injury during HCV infection could be involved in the induction of AIH. To explore whether the antiviral cellular immunity may turn against self-antigens, we characterized the primary CTL response against an HLA-A*0201–restricted HCV-derived epitope, i.e., HCV core 178–187, which shows sequence homology with human CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 8–17. To determine the relevance of these homologies for the pathogenesis of HCV-associated AIH, we used synthetic peptides to induce primary CTL responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors and patients with chronic HCV infection. We found that the naive CTL repertoire of both groups contains cross-reactive CTLs inducible by the HCV peptide recognizing both CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 peptides as well as endogenously processed CYP2A6 protein. Importantly, we failed to induce CTLs with the CYP-derived peptides that showed a lower capacity to form stable complexes with the HLA-A2 molecule. These findings demonstrate the potential of HCV to induce autoreactive CD8(+) CTLs by molecular mimicry, possibly contributing to virus-associated autoimmunity.","Kammer, Andreas R.; van der Burg, Sjoerd H.; Grabscheid, Benno; Hunziker, Isabelle P.; Kwappenberg, Kitty M.C.; Reichen, Jürg; Melief, Cornelis J.M.; Cerny, Andreas",J Exp Med,65,28

By Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that all the antibodies are specific and highly sensitive to both the native and denatured forms of the full-length S protein expressed in virus-infected cells and transfected cells, respectively. Indirect immunofluorescence performed on fixed but unpermeabilized cells showed that these antibodies can recognize the mature form of S on the cell surface. All the antibodies were also able to detect the maturation of the 200-kDa form of S to the 210-kDa form by pulse-chase experiments. When the antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV propagation in Vero E6 culture, it was found that the anti-SDelta10 antibody, which was targeted to amino acid residues 1029 to 1192 of S, which include heptad repeat 2, has strong neutralizing activities, suggesting that this region of S carries neutralizing epitopes and is very important for virus entry into cells.","Keng, Choong-Tat; Zhang, Aihua; Shen, Shuo; Lip, Kuo-Ming; Fielding, Burtram C; Tan, Timothy H P; Chou, Chih-Fong; Loh, Chay Boon; Wang, Sifang; Fu, Jianlin; Yang, Xiaoming; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo",Journal of virology,65,28

Comparison of the available nucleotide sequences obtained from the different viral isolates revealed almost complete sequence identity with the exception of variations and truncations in open reading frame 3 (ORF3) observed exclusively in ca-PEDV isolates. In order to study the biological function(s) of the putative ORF3 product, the molecule was expressed as a heterodimeric fusion protein in E. coli. ORF3 was fused in frame to the alkaline phosphatase gene. Simultaneously, the construct was designed to form specific heterodimers by inclusion of the well known leucine zipper motiv of Jun and Fos. The heterodimerization partner contained the E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin subunit B (LTB) to allow specific binding to the eukaryotic cell receptor GM1. Our results indicate that heterodimeric fusion protein containing a truncated form of ORF3 was produced in high amounts, carried the expected ORF3 epitope, showed phosphatase activity, and was able to bind to the GM1 receptor. In contrast, a fusion protein containing the entire sequence of the ORF3 product was produced in minute amounts, indicating that it may have biological activity in prokaryotes, which led to the reduction of the amounts of proteins expressed.","Schmitz, A; Tobler, K; Suter, M; Ackermann, M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,65,16

To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. METHODS After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer. RESULTS The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings. CONCLUSIONS Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.","Cohen, S; Tyrrell, D A; Smith, A P",The New England journal of medicine,65,16

Blood parameters, such as lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, or D-dimer, are associated with severity and prognosis of SARS CoV-2 patients. This study aims to identify blood-related predictors of severe hospitalization in patients diagnosed with SARS CoV-2. Methods Observational retrospective study of all rt-PCR and blood-test positive (at 48 hours of hospitalization) SARS CoV-2 diagnosed inpatients between March-May 2020. Deceased and/or ICU inpatients were considered as severe cases, whereas those patients after hospital discharge were considered as non-severe. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of severity, based on bivariate contrast between severe and mild inpatients. Results The overall sample comprised 540 patients, with 374 mild cases (69.26%), and 166 severe cases (30.75%). The multivariate logistic regression model for predicting SARS CoV-2 severity included lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, total protein levels, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase as predictors, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895 at a threshold of 0.29, with 81.5% of sensitivity and 81% of specificity.

DESIGN Cross sectional survey. SETTING General population of Hong Kong at the height of the SARS outbreak (29 March to 6 April 2003). PARTICIPANTS 1115 ethnic Chinese adults. MAIN RESULTS Forty per cent did not recognise fomites as a possible mode of transmission whereas 55.1% believed that the infection could be transmitted airborne. A large proportion (30.1%) believed they were very or somewhat likely to contract SARS while only one quarter believed they were very likely to survive if they contracted the disease, benchmarked against an actual case fatality ratio of 2.8% at the time of the survey and 15%-20% according to current best estimates. Precautionary measures directed against person to person droplet spread were generally adopted by most while the prevention of transmission through fomites was not practised as frequently. Respondents with higher risk perceptions and a moderate level of anxiety were most likely to take comprehensive precautionary measures against the infection, as were older, female, more educated people as well as those with a positive contact history and SARS-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate that the promotion of protective personal health practices to interrupt the self sustaining transmission of the SARS virus in the community must take into account background perceptions of risk and anxiety levels of the public at large. Continuing public education about preventive measures should be targeted at the identified groups with low current uptake of precautions.","Leung, G M; Lam, T-H; Ho, L-M; Ho, S-Y; Chan, B H Y; Wong, I O L; Hedley, A J",Journal of epidemiology and community health,65,24

Although the key driver behind this acquisition would be an improvement in company performance and shareholder value, past evidence suggests that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of large pharmaceutical companies imply a neutral net effect on productivity, if not a decline, with employment decreasing and R&D spend following a similar trend. Similarities between the two companies include dropping sales; however, relative to its size, AstraZeneca has a more promising R&D pipeline, especially in therapeutic areas where Pfizer's strength is currently limited (e.g. oncology).

Generally, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies derived from primary infection play a significant role in protecting against subsequent infection with the same serotype. By contrast, these pre-existing antibodies are believed to mediate a non-protective response to subsequent heterotypic DENV infections, leading to the onset of dengue illness. In this study, two monoclonal antibodies prepared by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with dengue fever were characterized. Epitope mapping revealed that amino acid residues 254-278 in domain II of the viral envelope protein E were the target region of these antibodies. A database search revealed that certain sequences in this epitope region showed high conservation among the four serotypes of DENV. These two human monoclonal antibodies could neutralize DENV-2,-4 more effectively than DENV-1,-3. The amino acid sequences could not explain this difference in neutralizing activity. However, the 3D structure results showed that amino acid 274 could be the critical residue for the difference in neutralization. These results may provide basic information for the development of a dengue vaccine.","Li, Z-Y; Yamashita, A; Kawashita, N; Sasaki, T; Pan, Y; Ono, K-I; Ikuta, K; Li, Y-G",Acta virologica,65,5

But its association with COVID-19 epidemics in the European Union (EU) is unclear. METHODS In this quasi-experimental interrupted time-series study, we modelled trends in human mobility and epidemics of COVID-19 in 27 EU states between January 15 and May 9, 2020. The associations of lockdown-date, and turning points of these trends were assessed. RESULTS There were 982,332 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the EU states (median 7,896, interquartile 1,689 to 25,702 for individual states) during the study-period. COVID-19 and human mobility had 3 trend-segments, including an upward trend in COVID-19 daily incidence and a downward trend in most human mobilities in the middle segment. Compared with the states farther from Italy, the state-wide lockdown dates were more likely linked to turning points of human mobilities in the states closer to Italy, which were also more likely linked to second turning points of COVID-19 epidemics. Among the examined human mobilities, the second turning points in driving mobility and the first turning points in parks mobility were the best factors that connected lockdown dates and COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states closer to Italy. CONCLUSIONS We show state- and mobility-heterogeneity in the associations of public health interventions and human mobility with the changes of COVID-19 epidemics in the EU. These findings may help inform policymakers on the best timing and monitoring-parameters of state-level interventions in the EU.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Hu, Kun; Xu, Jie; Zhang, Xuchen; Bao, Wei; Lynch, Charles F; Zhang, Lanjing",American journal of translational research,65,20

Could current nursing practices support the care of SARS or SARS-like patients in the future? If not, alternative practices would be needed. Providing a preliminary understanding, this paper compares the conventional with different nursing delivery models in a simulated SARS ward and focuses on nurses' efficiency, infection control practices and views of the two models. DESIGN AND METHODS This study was conducted in three phases. First, a baseline understanding of nursing practices was achieved through four workflow observations. In an eight-hour day, four research assistants observed nursing activities in the medical and fever wards. These data were used in the second phase to construct two sets of clinical vignettes, pertaining to SARS patient care in both conventional and alternative practice models. These scripts were discussed with nine nurses of various ranks from the hospital under study for their expert validation and input. In the third phase, nurse participants and patient actors enacted the vignettes in a simulated setting. Video-taped observations and four nurse participant interviews were employed. Observational data were analysed through descriptive statistics and independent t-tests. Textual data were coded and categorized for common meanings. RESULTS Conventional practice from the findings consisted of cubicle and named nurse nursing. While the former reflected modified team and functional nursing, it did not confine patient care within a cubicle as suggested by its name. The latter depicted a modified primary nursing approach in a team, with delegation of care. Preliminary findings concerning infection control and nurse satisfaction revealed that the alternative model had an advantage over the conventional.

Scientific evidence supports that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing severe complications. COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic during part or all of their disease course, therefore it is a compelling need to develop universal pre-interventional COVID-19 screening guidelines. The aim of this study is to is review COVID-19 positive rate among asymptomatic cancer patients since the implementation of universal policy at our institution, and assess the impact of diagnosing COVID-19 on delay of oncologic interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study population comprised of all cancer patients planned for high risk interventions between April 1, 2020 - May 14, 2020 at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi [CCAD] after implementing universal COVID-19 screening policy. DISCUSSION Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among cancer patients could result in poor outcomes. Universal screening for high-risk populations may facilitate earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 and implementation of control strategies. Our review demonstrated that [7.5%] of asymptomatic cancer patients tested positive for COVID-19 after implementation of universal prospective screening policy. The overall evidence supporting universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients is limited, yet as tests become more widely available, it may be reasonable to screen all cancer patients for COVID-19 before anticancer therapies. While such policy may delay and affect the timing of anticancer therapy as shown in this report, it should improve the safety of care for oncology patients and help protect healthcare workers. CONCLUSION COVID-19 infection rate is higher in cancer patients than general population and can present without symptoms.

FM patients often experience clinical impairment with stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether severity of FM increases because of confinement by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This prospective study includes patients from the Combined Index of Severity of Fibromyalgia (ICAF) cohort who met the 2010 ACR FM criteria. In this cohort, all patients have a periodical evaluation of their quality of life through two questionnaires, the ICAF, which assesses the ability to perform daily living activities, anxiety and depression, and through the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), which assesses overall change after a therapeutical intervention. Pre- and post-confinement measurements were analysed. Inferential statistical analysis and ANOVA for repeated measurements were used. RESULTS A total of 93 patients received a phone consultation, (95.5% females), mean (SD) age of 48.23 (8.38) years. Four patients were excluded as presenting COVID-19 and 51 (57%) completed the post-confinement ICAF. Following confinement, 25 (49%) patients got worse (group-worse) and 26 (51%) patients experienced no change or improved (group-stable). Comparisons between pre- and post-confinement ICAF did not show significant differences in both groups. Passive coping was significantly different in group-worse in pre-confinement evaluation. In the 80% of patients with passive coping predominance there were no changes in coping strategy. CONCLUSIONS No clinical impairment due to COVID-19 confinement occurred. The perceived worsening among FM patients relies primarily on how patients cope with their disease, without a real impact on clinical manifestations.","Rivera, Javier; Castrejón, Isabel; Vallejo-Slocker, Laura; Offenbächer, Martin; Molina-Collada, Juan; Trives, Laura; López, Katy; Caballero, Liz; Hirsch, Jameson K; Toussaint, Loren; Nieto, Juan C; Alvaro-Gracia, Jose M; Vallejo, Miguel A",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,65,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) group sought to address three questions for the management of patients who have ONFH: 1) What imaging studies are most sensitive and specific for the diagnostic evaluation of patients who have ONFH?; 2) What is the best treatment strategy for preventing disease progression in patients who have pre-collapse lesions?; and 3) What is the best treatment strategy for patients who have post-collapse disease?

A systematic review will be performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. ARCO participants have been allocated to three groups, each representing one of the PICO questions. After qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data extracted from studies pertaining to each of the three research questions, a set of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines will be proposed for the management of patients who have ONFH. DISCUSSION It is not always clear which treatment method is optimal for the management of ONFH. Thus, many surgeons have developed and performed various procedures based on patient-specific factors. As there is no consensus on the optimal treatment for various stages of disease, it was clear that developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines would provide more structure and uniformity to management of these patients. Therefore, the results of this systematic review will lead to the development guidelines that may improve patient-care strategies and result in better outcomes for patients who have ONFH.","Cheng, Edward Y; Cui, Quanjun; Goodman, Stuart B; Ando, Wataru; Baek, Seung-Hoon; Bakker, Caitlin; Drescher, Wolf; Hernigou, Philippe; Jones, Lynne C; Kim, Harry; Kim, Shin-Yoon; Kim, Tae-Young; Ha, Yong-Chan; Koo, Kyung-Hoi; Lee, Mel S; Mont, Michael A; Reichert, Ines; Sakai, Takashi; Salem, Hytham S; Sierra, Rafael J; Stronach, Ben; Sugano, Nobuhiko; Yamamoto, Takuaki; Yoon, Byung-Ho; Zhao, Dewei",Surgical technology international,65,33

Nevertheless there is a great lack of knowledge among those veterinarians who usually do not work with these methods. Therefore we want to give an introduction into the advantages and dangers of this technology concerning veterinary medicine. Some important analytical methods are explained. Related viruses such as WEE and EEE or canine parvovirus, feline parvovirus and mink enteritis virus, or the related coronaviruses FIPV and TGEV serve as examples for the possibilities in molecular diagnosis and epidemic monitoring. The history of the gl- mutants of PRV, now prescribed as vaccine strains in the FRG, is an example of the development of genetic engineered vaccines. A new generation of vaccines based on recombinant vaccinia viruses is imminent. Thus we have to be aware of the high risks and responsibility of everybody who is involved in these new systems, especially the scientist who produces genetically altered organisms.","Mayr, A; Hübert, P",Tierarztliche Praxis,65,19

The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 and obesity. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL, OpenGrey and preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv was performed, with no restriction on language or date of publication. Primary outcomes of this study were intensive care unit (ICU) admission or critical disease, severe disease and mortality. Secondary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test. Meta-analysis was performed using OpenMeta-Analyst software, and heterogeneity was tested using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020184953). RESULTS A total of 1,493 articles were identified and 61 studies on 270,241 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of obesity was 27.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0-33.2) in hospitalised patients. Obesity was not significantly associated with increased ICU admission or critical illness (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.58, P=0.062, I2 =31.0) but was significantly associated with more severe disease (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.41-6.92, P=0.005, I2 =82.6), mortality (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69, P=0.006, I2=88.5) and a positive COVID-19 test (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSION Obesity increased the risk of severe disease, mortality and infection with COVID-19. Higher body mass index was associated with ICU admission and critical disease. Patients who are obese may be more susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and infected patients should be monitored closely for adverse outcomes.","Ho, Jamie S Y; Fernando, Daniel I; Chan, Mark Y; Sia, Ching Hui","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",65,17

This activity was not found in uninfected control cells, nor was it found in purified virus. The activity was associated with the mitochondrial fraction of infected cells, suggesting that the enzyme is membrane bound. The activity required the presence of all three ribonucleoside triphosphates in addition to [3H]UTP, and it was not inhibited by actinomycin D. The heated product was digested by RNase but not by DNase. Mg2+ was required for enzymatic activity, and its optimal concentration was approximately 5 mM. The size of the in vitro products was compared by electrophoresis with that of in vivo-synthesized virus-specified RNA to confirm the viral specificity of the polymerase activity. Virus-specified RNA from infected cells consisted of 10 species of single-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with molecular weights of 6.8 X 10(6), 6.2 X 10(6), 3.15 X 10(6), 1.40 X 10(6), 1.05 X 10(6), 0.94 X 10(6), 0.66 X 10(6), 0.39 X 10(6), 0.34 X 10(6), and 0.24 X 10(6).

Despite intense efforts to elucidate the conditions that permit NP penetration, there remains a lack of translatable results from animal models to human skin. The objectives of this study are to investigate the impact of common skin lotions on NP penetration and to quantify penetration differences of quantum dot (QD) NPs between freshly excised human and mouse skin. QDs were mixed in 7 different vehicles, including 5 commercial skin lotions. These were topically applied to skin using two exposure methods; a petri dish protocol and a Franz diffusion cell protocol. QD presence in the skin was quantified using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. Results show that the commercial vehicles can significantly impact QD penetration in both mouse and human skin. Lotions that contain alpha hydroxyl acids (AHA) facilitated NP penetration. Lower QD signal was observed in skin studied using a Franz cell. Freshly excised human skin was also studied immediately after the sub-cutaneous fat removal process, then after 24 hours rest ex vivo. Resting human skin 24 hours prior to QD exposure significantly reduced epidermal presence. This study exemplifies how application vehicles, skin processing and the exposure protocol can affect QD penetration results and the conclusions that maybe drawn between skin models.","Jatana, Samreen; Callahan, Linda M; Pentland, Alice P; DeLouise, Lisa A",Cosmetics,65,19

These severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by high ferritin levels. These findings mirror what was previously reported about the prognostic role of this iron storage protein in other inflammatory diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome. The latter suggests that ferritin could be a further pathogenic mediator in enhancing the inflammatory process, stimulating inflammatory pathways, and thus perpetuating a vicious pathogenic loop. Considering its activity as an immune activator, a therapeutic approach targeting ferritin may be also postulated in these diseases. Considering these observations, high ferritin levels characterize severe COVID-19 and other diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Because ferritin could enhance the inflammatory process, it could be tested as a possible new therapeutic target to improve the outcome of these patients.","Ruscitti, Piero; Giacomelli, Roberto",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,65,1

This study evaluates the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs in a national paediatric referral centre. METHODS This was a survey-based study that collected demographic, work environment and mental health data from paediatric HCWs in the emergency, intensive care and infectious disease units. Psychological impact was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS The survey achieved a response rate of 93.9% (430 of 458). Of the 430 respondents, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were reported in 168 (39.1%), 205 (47.7%) and 106 (24.7%), respectively. Depression was reported in the mild (47, 10.9%), moderate (76, 17.7%), severe (23, 5.3%) and extremely severe (22, 5.1%) categories. Anxiety (205, 47.7%) and stress (106, 24.7%) were reported in the mild category only. Collectively, regression analysis identified female sex, a perceived lack of choice in work scope/environment, lack of protection from COVID-19, lack of access to physical activities and rest, the need to perform additional tasks, and the experience of stigma from the community as risk factors for poor psychological outcome. CONCLUSION A high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was reported among frontline paediatric HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal psychoneuroimmunity and organisational prevention measures can be implemented to lessen psychiatric symptoms. At the national level, involving mental health professionals to plan and coordinate psychological intervention for the country should be considered.","Kirk, Angela H P; Chong, Shu Ling; Kam, Kai Qian; Huang, Weili; Ang, Linda S L; Lee, Jan Hau; Sultana, Rehena; Hon, Kam Lun; Wong, Judith J M","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",65,11

Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to these psychological consequences. Thus, the objective of this study was to verify the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral stress control program in reducing psychological stress and increasing resilience in pregnant women, which ended at the begining of the confinement due to COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS The study included 22 pregnant women who were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (GT) consisted of 11 participants and the control group (GC) also consisted of 11 participants. Participants were recruited from the Hospital Universitario Clínico San Cecilio in the province of Granada (Spain), where the weekly cognitive behavioral intervention was also carried out, which was implemented between January 22 and March 11, 2020. They used the assessment instruments: Pregnancy Distress Questionnaire (PDQ), Perceived Stress Scale (EEP-14), Inventory of Vulnerability to Stress (IVE) and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). A mixed ANOVA of repeated measures 2*2 was performed, with the variable between groups having two levels (CG and GT), and the within-subject having two time periods (pre and post). RESULTS The repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed group*time interaction effects between the therapy group and the control group and the CD-RISC scores (F1,20=10.658; p<0.02). Intrasubject differences in CD-RISC scores were found in the (GT) (t=-2.529; p<0.05), with a moderate effect size.

Since then, a large body of research on the syndrome has been published; the most updated developments are summarized here. RECENT FINDINGS Recent findings suggest that animal severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses may have been transmitted to humans without detection for years before the recent outbreak, and that such transmission may be continuing today. The 2002-2003 outbreak probably originated from similar animal-to-human transmission, but selection and purification of the animal severe acute respiratory syndrome-like virus appears to have occurred, creating the more virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Recent studies have documented that severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is primarily transmitted via contact and/or respiratory droplets and that the combination of standard, contact, and droplet precautions is generally effective for its control. It has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is typically relatively inefficiently transmitted, with the notable exception of transmission during superspreading events. Insights into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome have been made: one study suggests that human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*4601 is a possible risk factor for more severe disease, while another identifies angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Promising treatments have been identified, including interferons, an anti-spike monoclonal antibody, and fusion inhibitors. In addition, many promising vaccines are currently in development. SUMMARY New findings regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome are continuing to be discovered at an unprecedented pace, permitting a better understanding of the disease and enabling better preparation for its possible return.","Poutanen, Susan M; Low, Donald E",Current opinion in infectious diseases,65,1

Secondary changes of inner retinal atrophy, optic disc cupping, scleral thinning with megaglobus, and atrophy of ciliary processes were similar to those described in dogs and human beings with chronic glaucoma. In light of the duration and severity of the glaucoma, the degree of inner retinal atrophy was often less than expected. Diffuse corneal edema and breaks in Descemet's membrane, changes typical of glaucoma in other species, were rarely detected. Eyes with chronic uveitis and glaucoma had collapsed ciliary clefts, iridoscleral adhesions, and posterior displacement of the iris.

METHODS Thirty-three patients with SARS referred to Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease (GIRD) between December 2002 and March 2003 were studied retrospectively. Paired t-test using statistical software SPSS 10.0 was employed to compare the respiratory frequency and pulse O(2) saturation (SpO(2)) before and after noninvasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the 33 patients. Among them, 18 patients who presented with SpO(2) of 90% - 93% at rest under O(2) inhalation 5 L/min were further recorded for their SpO(2) during slight physical movement and CPAP. The possible death-related risk factors including age, underlying diseases, leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia were analyzed by the Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test. RESULTS The respiratory frequencies were significantly decreased and SpO(2) was improved in the 33 patients after one hour of noninvasive ventilation. The SpO(2) in the latter 18 patients fell during slight physical movement and improved one hour after CPAP (p < 0.01). The RRs of the five death predictors concerning thrombocytopenia, age (> 50 yrs, underlying diseases, leucocytosis, and lymphopenia were 25.83, 8.57, 6.40, 1.64, and 1.17, respectively, with the 95% CI of 3.64 - 183.59, 1.94 - 37.83, 1.75 - 23.33, 0.38 - 7.05 and 0.16 - 8.48, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS Noninvasive ventilation relieves dyspnea and SpO(2) in patients with critical SARS, and should also be employed in those with SpO(2) of 90% - 93% at rest under O(2) inhalation 5 L/min. Noninvasive as an add-on management may probably cut down on the dosage and duration of corticosteriod therapy. Among 5 possible risk factors, 3 were recognized as death-related, turning out to be thrombocytopenia, age (> 50 yrs) and underlying diseases.","Liu, Xiao-qing; Chen, Si-bei; He, Guo-qing; Li, Yi-min; He, Wei-qun; Chen, Rong-chang; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,65,0

To determine the region of S responsible, overlapping DNA fragments spanning the entire S gene were cloned and expressed as fusion proteins by in vitro transcription and translation. Fusion proteins containing relevant epitopes were identified by radioimmunoprecipitation with neutralizing and enhancing FIPV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). A region spanning residues 509 to 673 reacted with most MAbs tested. Translation in the presence of microsomal membranes did not enhance reactivity, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for recognition by the MAbs. To localize the antigenic sites further, several MAb-resistant (mar) mutants of FIPV were cloned and sequenced. Amino acid residues that contribute to the neutralizing and enhancing epitopes were localized to two regions, designated A1 and A2, which show partial overlap with the homologous antigenic site A of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Site A1 contains residues 568 and 591 and is homologous with part of subsite Aa of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Site A2 contains residues 643, 649, and 656. Double mutations in sites A1 and A2 were found in mar mutants derived from neutralizing and enhancing MAbs 23F4.5 and 18A7.4, while a single mutation in site A2 was found in a mar mutant derived from MAb 24H5.4, which is neutralizing but not enhancing. The data suggest that site A2, which includes residues 643 to 656, is a dominant neutralizing site of FIPV and that sites A1 and A2 may act in concert to induce antibody-dependent enhancement.","Corapi, W V; Darteil, R J; Audonnet, J C; Chappuis, G E",Journal of virology,65,17

We observed that the removal or extension of the poly(U) tract reduced or increased recombination, respectively. Deletion of the sgp core hairpin or its replacement by a different stem-loop structure inhibited recombination activity. Nucleotide substitutions at the +1 or +2 transcription initiation position reduced recombination. The sgp core alone supported only basal recombination activity. The sites of crossovers mapped to the poly(U) region and to the core hairpin. The observed effects on recombination did not parallel those observed for transcription. To explain how both activities operate within the sgp sequence, we propose a dual mechanism whereby recombination is primed at the poly(U) tract by the predetached nascent plus strand, whereas transcription is initiated de novo at the sgp core.","Wierzchoslawski, Rafal; Dzianott, Aleksandra; Bujarski, Jozef",Journal of virology,65,24

Myocarditis, pleural effusion, calcification of myocytes, and congestion in the liver and lungs were seen in the subacute phase. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) exhibited low voltage, nonspecific ST-T wave changes, sinus tachycardia, occasional ventricular and supraventricular premature complexes and 2(0) AV block consistent with myocarditis and heart failure. Forty-one percent of the survivors exhibited increased HW and HW/BW ratios, biventricular dilation, interstitial and replacement fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy and myocarditis. ECGs exhibited nonspecific ST-T wave changes, sinus arrhythmia, occasional ventricular and supraventricular premature complexes and 2(0) AV block. These data suggest that RbCV infection may result in viral myocarditis and heart failure with a proportion of survivors progressing into DCM.","Alexander, L K; Keene, B W; Small, J D; Yount, B; Baric, R S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,65,12

However, a styletted endotracheal tube can elicit rare but potentially serious complications. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a nonstyletted tube with exaggerated curvature would be noninferior to a styletted tube for orotracheal intubation using McGrath VL in patients with expected normal airway, by comparing the time to intubation and ease of intubation. METHODS One hundred forty patients, ages 19 to 70 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II), undergoing tracheal intubation for elective surgery were randomly allocated to the nonstylet group (n = 70) or the stylet group (n = 70). Anesthesia induction consisted of propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. The primary outcome was time to intubation assessed by a blind observer. Cormack and Lehane glottic grade, easy of intubation, and intubation difficulty score (IDS) were also assessed. RESULTS Median time to intubation [interquartile range] was not different between the nonstylet group and the stylet group (26 [24-32.5] s vs 27 [25-31] s, P = 0.937). There was no significant in median IDS between the nonstylet group and the stylet group (P = 0.695). CONCLUSION This study shows that a nonstyletted endotracheal tube with exaggerated curvature has a similar performance to a styletted tube with a hockey-stick curvature during intubation using McGrath VL regarding time taken to successful intubation and easiness of intubation.","Kwak, Hyun Jeong; Lee, Sook Young; Lee, Su Youn; Kim, Yong Beom; Kim, Jong Yeop",Medicine,65,28

Traditionally, wildlife professionals and conservationists have focused on the former, while most human/animal health specialists have been concerned largely with the latter. Lately, the (re-)emergence of many high-profile infectious diseases in a world with ever-increasing globalisation has led to a more holistic approach in the assessment and mitigation of health risks involving wildlife (with a concurrent expansion of literature). In this paper, the authors review the role of wildlife in the ecology of infectious disease, the staggering magnitude of the movement of wild animals and products across international borders in trade, the pathways by which they move, and the growing body of risk assessments from a multitude of disciplines. Finally, they highlight existing recommendations and offer solutions for a collaborative way forward.","Travis, D A; Watson, R P; Tauer, A",Revue scientifique et technique,65,1

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rohani, Pejman; Ahmadi Badi, Sara; Moshiri, Arfa; Siadat, Seyed Davar",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,65,17

We hypothesized that ACE2 is part of the brain renin-angiotensin system, and its expression is regulated by the other elements of this system. ACE2 immunostaining was performed in transgenic mouse brain sections from neuron-specific enolase-AT(1A) (overexpressing AT(1A) receptors), R(+)A(+) (overexpressing angiotensinogen and renin), and control (nontransgenic littermates) mice. Results show that ACE2 staining is widely distributed throughout the brain. Using cell-type-specific antibodies, we observed that ACE2 staining is present in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies but not in glial cells. In the subfornical organ, an area lacking the blood-brain barrier and sensitive to blood-borne angiotensin II, ACE2 was significantly increased in transgenic mice. Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated in the nucleus of tractus solitarius/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral medulla, when comparing transgenic to nontransgenic mice. These results suggest that ACE2 is localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain and that ACE2 levels appear highly regulated by other components of the renin-angiotensin system, confirming its involvement in this system. Moreover, ACE2 expression in brain structures involved in the control of cardiovascular function suggests that the carboxypeptidase may have a role in the central regulation of blood pressure and diseases involving the autonomic nervous system, such as hypertension.","Doobay, Marc F; Talman, Lauren S; Obr, Teresa D; Tian, Xin; Davisson, Robin L; Lazartigues, Eric","American journal of physiology.

Peptide antigens were identified with C. psittaci B577-immune sera by solid-phase scanning of overlapping octapeptides of variable domains (VDs) of the major outer membrane protein of C. psittaci serovar 1 (omp1 type C. psittaci B577). Two VD 4 regions and one VD 2 region were strongly reactive with all C. psittaci B577 antisera. Peptides encompassing these regions were synthesized with biotin and a serine-glycine-serine-glycine spacer at the N terminus and were attached to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. In direct ELISAs with these plates, the synthetic peptides reacted with C. psittaci B577 antisera, but not with sera from specific-pathogen-free animals. Serum specimens from 40 sheep and 40 cattle, obtained from herds with abortion problems, were screened for antibodies by these C. psittaci B577 peptide ELISAs and an ELISA with recombinant, genus-specific Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen. Results from these newly developed ELISAs were compared to those from the reference C. psittaci B577 elementary body (EB) ELISA and the Chlamydia complement fixation test (CFT). The C. psittaci B577 peptide ELISAs, the LPS ELISA, and the EB ELISA correctly identified the presence or absence of antibodies against chlamydiae in all sheep and bovine sera. The Chlamydia CFT, which is the most widely accepted serodiagnostic method for chlamydial infections in animals, correctly identified the presence or absence of antibodies against chlamydiae in only 78 and 4.9% of sheep and bovine sera, respectively. These results suggest that the C. psittaci B577-peptide and Chlamydia LPS ELISAs are superior for the serodiagnosis of ruminant infections with abortigenic chlamydiae, since they are more sensitive than the CFT, they are easy to standardize, and they use readily available synthetic antigens instead of organism-derived CFT antigen.","Kaltenboeck, B; Heard, D; DeGraves, F J; Schmeer, N",Journal of clinical microbiology,65,1

Logistic regression analysis found that the factors related to sleep quality included poor physical health (OR = 3.382, p < 0.001), respiratory disease (OR = 1.629, p = 0.008), other diseases (OR = 2.504, p = 0.012), suspected case of COVID-19 in the same community (OR = 1.928, p = 0.002), confirmed case of COVID-19 in the same community (OR = 2.183, p = 0.007), worry about being infected (OR = 2.336, p < 0.001), &#8805;1 h/day spent hearing COVID-19 information (OR = 1.960, p < 0.001), time difference in midpoint time in bed (OR = 1.230, p < 0.001), and time difference in time in bed (OR = 0.711, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that more than one-fourth of the participants suffered poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the poor health status and COVID-19-related anxiety, delayed sleep phase and reduced time in bed impacted sleep quality in the general population in China.","Lin, Yanmei; Liu, Shuai; Li, Shuangyan; Zuo, Heming; Zhang, Bin",Sleep medicine,65,20

We examined viral loads of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fatal (15 cases), symptomatic/survived (133 cases), and asymptomatic cases (138 cases) using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). We examined 5768 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and attempted to detect the SARS-CoV-2 genome using RT-qPCR. Among them, the viral genome was detected using the method for the 370 NPS samples with a positive rate of 6.4%. A comparison of each age showed that the fatal case was higher than the survived case and asymptomatic patients. Survived cases were older than asymptomatic patients. Notably, the viral load in the fatal cases was significantly higher than in symptomatic or asymptomatic cases (p < 0.05). These results suggested that a high viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 in elderly patients at an early stage of the disease results in a poor outcome. We should, therefore, intervene early to prevent a severe stage of the disease in such cases.","Tsukagoshi, Hiroyuki; Shinoda, Daisuke; Saito, Mariko; Okayama, Kaori; Sada, Mitsuru; Kimura, Hirokazu; Saruki, Nobuhiro",Viruses,65,21

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective case series studies and case reports that evaluated use of remdesivir in COVID-19. The outcomes were mortality, recovery rate, length of hospital stay and clinical outcome. Though the drug remdesivir (RDV) is not approved by the FDA, still the ""Emergency Use Authorization"" (EUA) for compassionate use in severe cases is endorsed. After vigorous searching, screening and sorting of completed and published scientific evidences in electronic database, there were only 2 randomized control trial (RCT), 2 uncontrolled trials found until April 2020. We also included 3 published case reports to analyze the validity use of RDV because of the scarcity of evidence based reports. Remdesivir was thought to be one of the promising options for treating the patients of COVID-19 based on few laboratory experiments and reports from some compassionate use and case reports.

The reason why its impact seems to be less pronounced in the elderly may be due to the concomitant presence of other comorbidities. However, all reports only focus on BMI, an indirect marker of body fat. AIM: To explore the impact on COVID-19 severity of abdominal fat as a marker of body composition easily collected in patients undergoing a chest CT scan. METHODS: Patients included in this retrospective study were consecutively enrolled among those admitted to an Emergency Department in Rome, Italy, who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 and underwent a chest CT scan in March 2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: 150 patients were included (64.7% male, mean age 64â¯±â¯16â¯years). Visceral fat (VAT) was significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care (pâ¯=â¯0.032), together with age (pâ¯=â¯0.009), inflammation markers CRP and LDH (pâ¯<â¯0.0001, pâ¯=â¯0.003, respectively), and interstitial pneumonia severity as assessed by a Lung Severity Score (LSS) (pâ¯<â¯0.0001). Increasing age, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, LSS, total abdominal fat as well as VAT were found to have a significant univariate association with the need of intensive care. A multivariate analysis showed that LSS and VAT were independently associated with the need of intensive care (OR: 1.262; 95%CI: 1.0171-1.488; pâ¯=â¯0.005 and OR: 2.474; 95%CI: 1.017-6.019; pâ¯=â¯0.046, respectively).

Recently OTT service providers are extending their service to video broadcasting. As a one type of video broadcasting, this paper covers multimedia streaming with multiple sources. Multimedia streaming with multiple sources has multiple sources, and receivers can select one specific source to watch the video from the source. Sources include cameras capturing different angles of same event or location, cameras in geographical locations, etc. For delivering video to rapidly increasing number of users, multimedia streaming with multiple sources system needs efficient and scalable delivery method. Tree-based Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking has been investigated as the delivery solution of multimedia streaming with multiple sources, and set-top boxes or mobile apps of OTT service can be used as peers connecting the subscriber of OTT service. However, the scalability of the tree-based P2P networking is limited by the out-degree of a tree that branches linearly with the number of users. Hence, this study proposes clustering peers based on the location proximity of the peers to enhance the scalability of the P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources. By clustering peers, one or more peers can be grouped into a virtual peer with an aggregated uplink/downlink capacity. This paper describes P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources and algorithms for the proposed clustering method. Two applications which are one-view multiparty video conferencing and multi-view video streaming are introduced, and considerations for applying the proposed method to the applications are also discussed. The experimental results show that location-proximity-based clustering is effective in achieving a scalable P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources by reducing the out-degree of a tree for the introduced applications. The proposed clustering leads improvement in the maximum achievable video bit rate, the average viewing video bit rate, and perceived delay.","Lee, Changkyu; Kang, Shin-Gak; Nayyar, Anand",Multimed Tools Appl,65,26

Accordingly, testing is crucial for mitigating the economic and public health effects. In order to facilitate point-of-care diagnosis, this study aims at presenting a label-free electrochemical biosensor as a powerful nanobiodevice for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface. Accordingly, the sensitivity and stability of the sensing platform significantly increased. The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25 fg mL-1 to 1 µg mL-1. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20 min with a low detection limit of 0.04 fg mL-1 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97-103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability. The nanobiodevice was also tested using real patients and healthy samples, where the results had been already obtained using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, and showed satisfactory results.

Little is known about the associations between loneliness and symptom burden in oncology patients before and during the pandemic. Study purposes include determining the prevalence of loneliness in a sample of oncology patients; evaluating for differences in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics between lonely and nonlonely patients; and determining which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with membership in the lonely group. METHODS: A convenience sample (n = 606) completed online surveys that evaluated the severity of loneliness, social isolation, and common symptoms (ie, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and pain) in oncology patients. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to evaluate for differences in scores between the lonely and nonlonely groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for membership in the loneliness group. RESULTS: Of the 606 patients, 53.0% were categorized in the lonely group. The lonely group reported higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher symptom severity scores for all of the symptoms evaluated. In the multivariate model, being unmarried, having higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with membership in the lonely group. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that a significant number of oncology patients are experiencing loneliness, most likely as a result of mandate social distancing and isolation procedures. The symptom burden of these patients is extremely high and warrants clinical evaluation and interventions.","Miaskowski, Christine; Paul, Steven M; Snowberg, Karin; Abbott, Maura; Borno, Hala T; Chang, Susan M; Chen, Lee May; Cohen, Bevin; Cooper, Bruce A; Hammer, Marilyn J; Kenfield, Stacey A; Kober, Kord M; Laffan, Angela; Levine, Jon D; Pozzar, Rachel; Rhoads, Kim; Tsai, Katy K; Van Blarigan, Erin L; Van Loon, Katherine",Cancer,65,25

The disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread rapidly causing a worldwide pandemic. Here we examine the added value of near real-time genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in a subpopulation of infected patients during the first 10 weeks of COVID-19 containment in Australia and compare findings from genomic surveillance with predictions of a computational agent-based model (ABM). Using the Australian census data, the ABM generates over 24 million software agents representing the population of Australia, each with demographic attributes of an anonymous individual. It then simulates transmission of the disease over time, spreading from specific infection sources, using contact rates of individuals within different social contexts. We report that the prospective sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 clarified the probable source of infection in cases where epidemiological links could not be determined, significantly decreased the proportion of COVID-19 cases with contentious links, documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent transmission in several institutions and identified previously unsuspected links. Only a quarter of sequenced cases appeared to be locally acquired and were concordant with predictions from the ABM. These high-resolution genomic data are crucial to track cases with locally acquired COVID-19 and for timely recognition of independent importations once border restrictions are lifted and trade and travel resume.","Rockett, Rebecca J; Arnott, Alicia; Lam, Connie; Sadsad, Rosemarie; Timms, Verlaine; Gray, Karen-Ann; Eden, John-Sebastian; Chang, Sheryl; Gall, Mailie; Draper, Jenny; Sim, Eby M; Bachmann, Nathan L; Carter, Ian; Basile, Kerri; Byun, Roy; O039,; Sullivan, Matthew V; Chen, Sharon C-A; Maddocks, Susan; Sorrell, Tania C; Dwyer, Dominic E; Holmes, Edward C; Kok, Jen; Prokopenko, Mikhail; Sintchenko, Vitali",Nat Med,65,15

Paradoxically, FGF21 cardiac and circulating levels correlate with cardiac damage and oxidative stress in patients with ACM, pointing to FGF21 as a potential biomarker of alcohol-induced cardiac damage.

A Dentoform model was fitted into a dental mannequin and coated with Glo Germ to detect splatter during simulated dental AGPs produced with use of a high-speed handpiece, an ultrasonic scaler, and an air-water syringe, all in conjunction with high-volume suction. A simulated cough was also created using a ventilator programmed to expel Glo Germ within the velocity and volume parameters of a natural cough with dental personnel in their customary positions. A UV light was used after each procedure to systematically evaluate the deposition of Glo Germ splatter on each person. After AGPs were performed, splatter was noted on the face, body, arms, and legs of the dentist and dental assistant. The simulated cough produced more extensive splatter than AGPs; additional Glo Germ was seen on the shoes, the crown of the head, and the back of the dental personnel.

The possibility of using seismic noise as another proxy to estimate social isolation was tested with a station within Rio de Janeiro city. We used the isolation index measured from smartphone movement to calibrate the seismic noise levels and estimated an Isolation Seismic Index, ISI (% of the population at home), using the seismic noise energy. Noise levels best correlate with isolation measures in the frequency range 4–8 Hz. Small differences between the smartphone and the ISI indexes are interpreted as differences in social activities and noise sources. All mobility indexes are proxies to the actual isolation. Although ISI does not measure the number of people outside, it measures the number of noise sources (vehicles, trains, factories, etc.) and can be used as additional information to interpret anomalies in other proxies.","Dias, Fábio L.; Assumpção, Marcelo; Peixoto, Pedro S.; Bianchi, Marcelo B.; Collaço, Bruno; Calhau, Jackson",Geophys.

New or existing heart failure in the setting of COVID-19 can present a set of unique challenges that can complicate presentation, management, and prognosis. A careful understanding of the hemodynamic and diagnostic implications is essential for appropriate triage and management of these patients. Abnormal cardiac biomarkers are common in COVID-19 and can stem from a variety of mechanisms that involve the viral entry itself through the ACE2 receptors, direct cardiac injury, increased thrombotic activity, stress cardiomyopathy, and among others. The cytokine storm observed in this pandemic can be a culprit in many of the observed mechanisms and presentations. A correct understanding of the two-way interaction between heart failure medications and the infection as well as the proposed COVID-19 medications and heart failure can result in optimal management. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure should not be interrupted for theoretical concerns but rather based on tolerance and clinical presentation. Initiating specific cardiac or heart failure medications to prevent the infection or mitigate the disease is also not an evidence-based practice at this time. Heart failure patients on advanced therapies including those with heart transplantation will particularly benefit from involving the advanced heart failure team members in the overall management if they contract the virus.","Bader, Feras; Manla, Yosef; Atallah, Bassam; Starling, Randall C",Heart fail. rev,65,16

Previously, the accuracy of the quantitative LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 antigen test was demonstrated using samples collected retrospectively. In this study, the LUMIPULSE antigen test was clinically validated using prospective samples. METHODS: In total, 1033 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 1033 individuals, and an additional 275 follow-up samples were collected from 43 patients who subsequently tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All 1308 samples were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and the antigen test. The antibody response was investigated for patients with discordant results to clarify if seroconversion had occurred. RESULTS: RT-qPCR identified 990 samples as negative and 43 as positive, while the antigen test identified 992 samples as negative, 37 as positive and four as inconclusive. The overall concordance rate was 99.7% (1026/1029). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 92.5% (37/40), 100% (989/989), 100% (37/37) and 99.7% (989/992), respectively, after exclusion of the four inconclusive results. The kappa coefficient was 0.960 (95% confidence interval 0.892-0.960), suggesting excellent agreement between the two tests. Seropositivity in five of seven patients with discordant results suggested that the discrepancy was caused by samples collected during the late phase of infection. Using follow-up samples, correlation was observed between the antigen level and the viral load or cycle threshold value. The concordance rate between these test results tended to be high among samples collected 0-9 days after symptom onset, but this decreased gradually in samples collected thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrated that the LUMIPULSE antigen test is a highly accurate diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Maejima, Makoto; Shibusawa, Masahiro; Amemiya, Kenji; Nagakubo, Yuki; Hosaka, Kazuhiro; Sueki, Hitomi; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Miyashita, Yoshihiro; Omata, Masao",Int J Infect Dis,65,1

However, monitoring the efficacy of these guidelines at a large scale (nationwide or worldwide) is difficult. To make matters worse, traditional observational methods such as in-person reporting is dangerous because observers may risk infection. A better solution is to observe activities through network cameras; this approach is scalable and observers can stay in safe locations. This research team has created methods that can discover thousands of network cameras worldwide, retrieve data from the cameras, analyze the data, and report the sizes of crowds as different countries issued and lifted restrictions (also called ''lockdown''). We discover 11,140 network cameras that provide real-time data and we present the results across 15 countries. We collect data from these cameras beginning April 2020 at approximately 0.5TB per week. After analyzing 10,424,459 images from still image cameras and frames extracted periodically from video, the data reveals that the residents in some countries exhibited more activity (judged by numbers of people and vehicles) after the restrictions were lifted. In other countries, the amounts of activities showed no obvious changes during the restrictions and after the restrictions were lifted. The data further reveals whether people stay ''social distancing'', at least 6 feet apart. This study discerns whether social distancing is being followed in several types of locations and geographical locations worldwide and serve as an early indicator whether another wave of infections is likely to occur soon.","Ghodgaonkar, Isha; Chakraborty, Subhankar; Banna, Vishnu; Allcroft, Shane; Metwaly, Mohammed; Bordwell, Fischer; Kimura, Kohsuke; Zhao, Xinxin; Goel, Abhinav; Tung, Caleb; Chinnakotla, Akhil; Xue, Minghao; Lu, Yung-Hsiang; Ward, Mark Daniel; Zakharov, Wei; Ebert, David S.; Barbarash, David M.; Thiruvathukal, George K.",,65,16

We aimed to describe the real-word incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients and the impact of oncologic therapies on the infection. Materials & Methods: In this study, we analysed all consecutive cancer patients with solid tumours undergoing active intravenous treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, alone or in combination) between 21 February and 30 April 2020, in a high-volume cancer centre in Lombardy, Italy. We focused on SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, reporting on the clinical characteristics of the cancer and the infection. Results: We registered 17 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients among 1267 cancer patients on active treatment, resulting in an incidence of 1.3%. The median age was 69.5 years (range 43-79). Fourteen patients (82%) required hospitalisation for COVID-19 with a median in-hospital stay of 11.5 days (range 3-58). Fourteen of the seventeen (82%) were treated for locally advanced or metastatic disease. We could not demonstrate any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and tumour or treatment type. The COVID-19-related fatality rate was 29% (5/17), which was higher than that of the general population cared for in our centre (20%). Conclusions: Active oncologic treatments do not represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. However, the prognosis of infected cancer patients appears to be worse compared with that of the non-oncologic population. Given the low number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and the uncertainties in risk factors that may have an impact on the prognosis, we advocate for the continuum of cancer care even during the current pandemic.","Bertuzzi, Alexia Francesca; Marrari, Andrea; Gennaro, Nicolò; Cariboni, Umberto; Ciccarelli, Michele; Giordano, Laura; Quagliuolo, Vittorio Lorenzo; Santoro, Armando",,65,6

METHODS: Based on ""fearonomic effects,"" a qualitative framework that conceptualizes the direct and indirect economic effects caused by the fear of contagion, we created a checklist to facilitate empirical estimation. As a case study, we first identified relevant sectors affected by China's lockdown policies implemented just before the Lunar New Year (LNY) week. To quantify the immediate impact, we then estimated the projected spending levels in 2020 in the absence of COVID-19 and compared these projections with actual spending during the LNY week. Data sources used include Chinese and global websites. To characterize uncertainty, we reported upper and lower bound estimates and calculated midpoints for each range. RESULTS: The COVID-19 epidemic is estimated to cost China's economy $283 billion ($196-369 billion), that is, ¥2.0 trillion renminbi (¥1.4-¥2.6 trillion), during the LNY week. Reduced restaurant and movie theater business ($106 [$103-$109] billion, 37.5% [36.4%-38.5%]) and reduced public transportation utilization ($96 [$13-$179] billion dollars, 33.9% [4.6%-63.3%]) explain most of this loss, followed by travel restrictions and the resulting loss of hotel business and tourism ($80.36 billion, 28.4%). CONCLUSION: Our checklist can help quantify the immediate and near-term impact of COVID-19 on a country's economy. It can also help researchers and policy makers consider the broader economic and social consequences when valuing future vaccines and treatments.","Ma, Siyu; Kim, David D; Cohen, Joshua T; Neumann, Peter J",Value Health,65,1

METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was used with health professionals working in selected public university hospitals of Ethiopia. A structured survey questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic, risk perception, and behavioral response items were used. The survey questions were designed on Google form. All academic and clinical staff invited to participate in the online survey, which was carried out from May 1-14, 2020. Data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24. Descriptive statistics computed and the result is presented by tables and figures. RESULTS: A total of 273 health professionals participated in this study. The mean (± SD) age of participants was 31.03 ± 5.11. Study participants' overall mean score of perceived risk was 23.59 ± 4.75. The study participants' mean score of perceived vulnerability (4.01 ± 1.17) was higher than the human immunodeficiency virus, common cold, malaria, and tuberculosis. Regarding precautionary health behavior, the lowest mean score is for wearing gloves 1.82 ± 1.15. CONCLUSION: Participants mean score of perceived vulnerability of coronavirus disease was higher than some of the prevalent infectious disease in the area. Almost all participants applied recommended protective measures to the acceptable level, except for wearing mask and gloves. Therefore, there is a need to further intensification of more effective ways to support health professionals' adherence to major precautionary measure is important.","Girma, Shimelis; Agenagnew, Liyew; Beressa, Girma; Tesfaye, Yonas; Alenko, Arefayne",PLoS One,65,26

Recent publications show that IMID patients and its treatments do not worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with IMID who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection with IMID and those who were not affected. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study, including admitted patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated according to medical criteria and local protocols based on the best available scientific evidence. Clinical data were collected from their electronical clinical history. Statistical analysis determined the differences in the characteristics and clinical outcome of the infection in IMID patients. RESULTS: Of a total number of 612 revised patients, 23 had an IMID and 9 of them were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not observe a correlation between these two disorders. There was a higher frequency of obesity and cardiovascular disease among IMID patients, but without statistical significance. The clinical outcomes were no different between hospitalized IMID and non IMID patients. CONCLUSION: IMID and its treatments do not determine the outcome of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Robustillo-Villarino, Montserrat; Álvarez-Arroyo, Laura; Carrera-Hueso, Francisco Javier; Barreda-Altaba, Inés; Nieto-Cid, María; Girona-Sanz, Ana María; El-Qutob, David",,65,16

Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than pre-existing variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity2. Here we analyse a dataset that links 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 deaths associated with COVID-19 in England from 1 November 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike (S) gene target (known as S gene target failure (SGTF)1). On the basis of 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% confidence interval, 39-72%) higher than in cases without SGTF after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, residence in a care home, the local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55-69-year-old man increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.0%) within 28 days of a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7 is 61% (42-82%) higher than with pre-existing variants. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness.","Davies, Nicholas G; Jarvis, Christopher I; Edmunds, W John; Jewell, Nicholas P; Diaz-Ordaz, Karla; Keogh, Ruth H",Nature,65,1

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges in the contexts both of older peoples' lives, wellbeing, and health, and also within prison settings, and thus it is timely to reflect on the links between older people, prisons, and cities, at a time of ongoing change. Just as there is an extensive body of ongoing research exploring age-friendly cities and communities, there is extensive published research on older people's experiences of imprisonment, and a growing body of research on ageing in the prison setting. However, these two research and policy fields have evolved largely independently and separately, leading to a lack of visibility of prisons and prisoners within AFCC research and policy and, similarly, the omission of consideration of the relevance of AFCC research and policy to older prisoners and ex-prisoners. Existing checklists and tools for assessing and measuring the age-friendliness of cities and communities may be of limited relevance in the context of prisons and prisoners. This article identifies the potential for integration and for cross-disciplinary research in this context, concluding with recommendations for developing inclusive research, policies, and evaluation frameworks which recognise and include prisons and older prisoners, both during and after incarceration.","Codd, Helen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),65,24

Russia’s GDP in 2020 fell by 3.1% in relation to the level of 2019, so that the decline was more moderate than in 1998 (–5.3%) and 2009 (–7.8%). In the coming years, the Russian economy will have to recover and enter a new long-term growth path. At what expense and in which industries will this happen? Based on the experience of previous crises and using industry accounts of economic growth and Russia KLEMS data, we have examined possible sources of recovery of the Russian economy after the crisis of 2020. By analogy with the recovery after 2008—2009, it is likely to be associated with increased demand for raw materials on world markets and the reaction of the Russian oil and gas complex. Stagnation after 2008—2009 is due to a decrease in production efficiency, especially in the expanded mining complex (EMC), as well as the cessation of technological catching-up. Growth stimulation measures should include increasing the efficiency of the EMC, providing the adaptation of advanced technologies, and preserving existing adaptation channels in times of crisis — for example, successful export-oriented industries integrated into global value chains.

However, the quality of ICU-based communication has remained suboptimal, particularly concerning for Black patients and their family members. Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. OBJECTIVE: To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting.

Institutional social distancing requirements have resulted in many neurosurgical programs utilizing video conferencing for educational activities. However, it is unclear how or if these practices should continue after the pandemic. The objective of this study was to characterize virtual education in neurosurgery and understand how it should be utilized after COVID-19. METHODS: A 24-question, 3-part online survey was administered anonymously to all 117 US neurosurgical residency programs from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Questions pertained to the current use of virtual conferencing, preferences over traditional conferences, and future inclinations. The Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree) was used. Comparisons were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: One-hundred eight responses were recorded. Overall, 38 respondents (35.2%) were attendings and 70 (64.8%) were trainees. Forty-one respondents (38.0%) indicated attending 5-6 conferences per week and 70 (64.8%) attend national virtual conferences. When considering different conference types, there was no overall preference (scores < 3) for virtual conferences over traditional conferences. In regard to future use, respondents strongly agreed that they would continue the practice at some capacity after the pandemic (median score 5). Overall, respondents agreed that virtual conferences would partially replace traditional conferences (median score 4), whereas they strongly disagreed with the complete replacement of traditional conferences (median score 1). The most common choices for the partial replacement of tradition conferences were case conferences (59/108, 55%) and board preparation (64/108, 59%). Lastly, there was a significant difference in scores for continued use of virtual conferencing in those who attend nationally sponsored conferences (median score 5, n = 70) and those who do not (median score 4, n = 38; U = 1762.50, z = 2.97, r = 0.29, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual conferences will likely remain an integral part of neurosurgical education after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. Across the country, residents and faculty report a preference for continued use of virtual conferencing, especially virtual case conferences and board preparation. Some traditional conferences may even be replaced with virtual conferences, in particular those that are more didactic. Furthermore, nationally sponsored virtual conferences have a positive effect on the preferences for continued use of virtual conferences.","Lazaro, Tyler; Srinivasan, Visish M; Rahman, Maryam; Asthagiri, Ashok; Barkhoudarian, Garni; Chambless, Lola B; Kan, Peter; Rao, Ganesh; Nahed, Brian V; Patel, Akash J",Neurosurg Focus,65,16

Telehealth has been viewed as ""electronic personal protective equipment"" during the COVID-19 pandemic; although telerehabilitation has been shown to be effective with outpatients, it is unknown whether it is a viable option for hospitalized patients. Purpose: Our facility developed an algorithm for the use of a physical therapy telerehabilitation program for inpatients with COVID-19. We sought to investigate the safety and viability of the program. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who received either telerehabilitation only or a combination of telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation. Based on the algorithm, COVID-19 inpatients were selected to receive telerehabilitation if they could ambulate independently, could use technology, had stable vital signs, required minimal supplemental oxygen, and were cognitively intact. We analyzed data of inpatients who received telerehabilitation only, which included patient education, therapeutic exercises, and breathing techniques. Results: Of 33 COVID-19 inpatients who received telerehabilitation, in-person rehabilitation, or a combination of the two, 12 patients received telerehabilitation only (age range, 33 to 65 years; all but one male). They demonstrated independence with their individualized home exercise programs in one to two sessions, did not require an in-person rehabilitation consultation, did not require increased oxygen, experienced no exacerbation of symptoms, and were discharged home. Conclusions: Inpatient telerehabilitation appears to be a viable option for selected hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be a safe way of delivering inpatient rehabilitation to isolated or at-risk populations. At our hospital, the use of inpatient telerehabilitation reduced staff exposure while providing important education and services to patients. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the use of telerehabilitation for hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19. Our findings suggest that this innovative approach warrants further study.","Rosen, Kelsey; Patel, Monika; Lawrence, Cecelia; Mooney, Brianne",HSS J,65,16

This paper explores the factors associated with long-term unemployment in European countries using a panel of 25 European countries over the period 2000-2018. We find that skill mismatches, labor market matching efficiency, and labor market policies are associated with the incidence of long-term unemployment.

Recent evidence suggests that this will cause additional maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here we have explored the contextual factors influencing maternal, neonatal and children health (MNCH) care in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Africa amidst the pandemic. Our findings suggest that between March and May 2020, there was a reduction in utilisation of basic essential MNCH services such as antenatal care, family planning and immunization due to: a) the implementation of lockdown which triggered fear of contracting the COVID-19 and deterred people from accessing basic MNCH care, and b) a shift of focus towards pandemic, causing the detriment to other health services, and c) resource constraints. Taken together these issues have resulted in compromised provision of basic general healthcare. Given the likelihood of recurrent waves of the pandemic globally, COVID-19 mitigation plans therefore should be integrated with standard care provision to enhance system resilience to cope with all health needs. This commentary suggests a four-point contextualised mitigation plan to safeguard MNCH care during the pandemic using the observed countries as exemplars for LMIC health system adaptations to maintain the trajectory of progress regarding sustainable development goals (SDGs).","Ahmed, Tanvir; Rahman, Ahmed Ehsanur; Amole, Taiwo Gboluwaga; Galadanci, Hadiza; Matjila, Mushi; Soma-Pillay, Priya; Gillespie, Bronwen M; El Arifeen, Shams; Anumba, Dilly O C",Int J Equity Health,65,8

They evaluate their utility; differentiating between academic exercises in graph theory, and useful tools to derive novel insights, highlighting target identification and drug repurposing as two areas showing particular promise. They provide a case study on COVID-19, summarizing the research that used knowledge graphs to identify repurposable drug candidates. They describe the dangers of degree and literature bias, and discuss mitigation strategies. EXPERT OPINION: Whilst knowledge graphs and graph-based machine learning have certainly shown promise, they remain relatively immature technologies. Many popular link prediction algorithms fail to address strong biases in biomedical data, and only highlight biological associations, failing to model causal relationships in complex dynamic biological systems.

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","Vella, Laura A; Giles, Josephine R; Baxter, Amy E; Oldridge, Derek A; Diorio, Caroline; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Alanio, Cécile; Pampena, M Betina; Wu, Jennifer E; Chen, Zeyu; Huang, Yinghui Jane; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Gouma, Sigrid; McNerney, Kevin O; Chase, Julie; Burudpakdee, Chakkapong; Lee, Jessica H; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Huang, Alexander C; Mathew, Divij; Kuthuru, Oliva; Goodwin, Eileen C; Weirick, Madison E; Bolton, Marcus J; Arevalo, Claudia P; Ramos, Andre; Jasen, C J; Conrey, Peyton E; Sayed, Samir; Giannini, Heather M; D039,; Andrea, Kurt; Meyer, Nuala J; Behrens, Edward M; Bassiri, Hamid; Hensley, Scott E; Henrickson, Sarah E; Teachey, David T; Betts, Michael R; Wherry, E John",Sci. immunol,65,26

It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score. A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms. Results: The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001). Conclusions: The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.","Zhu, Juhong; Sun, Lin; Zhang, Lan; Wang, Huan; Fan, Ajiao; Yang, Bin; Li, Wei; Xiao, Shifu",Front.

One of their most controversial and puzzling features is their distinctive caudal anatomy, which has been suggested as a mechanism to facilitate caudal autotomy. Several researchers have described putative fracture planes in mesosaur caudal vertebrae - unossified regions in the middle of caudal vertebral centra - that in many extant squamates allow the tail to separate and the animal to escape predation. However, the reports of fracture planes in mesosaurs have never been closely investigated beyond preliminary descriptions, which has prompted scepticism. Here, using numerous vertebral series, histology, and X-ray computed tomography, we provide a detailed account of fracture planes in all three species of mesosaurs. Given the importance of the tail for propulsion in many other aquatic reptiles, the identification of fracture planes in mesosaurs has important implications for their aquatic locomotion. Despite mesosaurs apparently having the ability to autotomize their tail, it is unlikely that they actually made use of this behaviour due to a lack of predation pressure and no record of autotomized tails in articulated specimens. We suggest that the presence of fracture planes in mesosaurs is an evolutionary relic and could represent a synapomorphy for an as-yet undetermined terrestrial clade of Palaeozoic amniotes that includes the earliest radiation of secondarily aquatic tetrapods.","MacDougall, Mark J; Verrière, Antoine; Wintrich, Tanja; LeBlanc, Aaron R H; Fernandez, Vincent; Fröbisch, Jörg",Sci Rep,65,24

Individualizing the exercise intensity by metabolic response provide good physiological results. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of EMG as a non-invasive determinant of the anaerobic threshold and respiratory compensation point, for more precise exercise intensity prescription. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study with 66 recovered COVID-19 patients was carried out. The patients underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test with simultaneous assessment of muscle electromyography in vastus lateralis. EMG breakpoints were analyzed during the ramp-up protocol. The first and second EMG breakpoints were used for anaerobic threshold and respiratory compensation point determination. RESULTS: EMG and gas exchange analysis presented strong correlation in anaerobic threshold (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) and respiratory compensation point detection (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001) detection. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a bias = -4.7 W (SD = 6.2 W, limits of agreement = -16.9 to 7.6) for anaerobic threshold detection in EMG compared to gas exchange analysis. In respiratory compensation point detection, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a bias = -2.1 W (SD = 4.5 W, limits of agreement = -10.9 to 6.6) in EMG compared to gas exchange analysis. EMG demonstrated a small effect size compared to gas exchange analysis in oxygen uptake and power output at anaerobic threshold and respiratory compensation point detection. CONCLUSIONS: EMG analysis detects anaerobic threshold and respiratory compensation point without clinical significant difference than gas exchange analysis (gold standard method) in recovered COVID-19 patients.","Frazão, Murillo; Silva, Paulo Eugênio; Cacau, Lucas de Assis Pereira; Petrucci, Tullio Rocha; Assis, Mariela Cometki; Santos, Amilton da Cruz; Brasileiro-Santos, Maria do Socorro",J Electromyogr Kinesiol,65,24

In this article, we focus on two jurisdictions with distinct paths of development - England and France - to examine if they have drawn from their own legal history to craft solutions to this challenge and to consider if either has bettersuited tools to address it. Notably, the UK has refrained from intervening in the area of contract law, thus relying on long-standing common law doctrines and equitable remedies, while, in France, the government has intervened with a series of ordonnances providing contracting parties with new tools tackling difficulties of performance, which add to the existing arsenal in the Code civil. The article demonstrates that the responses to the COVID-19 challenge by England and France have historic roots and illustrate important legal cultural differences vis-à vis state intervention in the area of contract in trying times. Moreover, even though, at first glance, parties contracting under French law have more tools balancing freedom of contract and fairness, a closer look reveals that over protection or under protection may lead to the same outcome for contractual relationships on both sides of the Channel. Ultimately, in both countries, parties seem better off settling their disputes themselves, away from the courts. © 2020 Kluwer Law International.

So far, there are no studies in the Indian population comparing IADPSG with NICE criteria. OBJECTIVE: To compare International Association of Pregnancy and Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus and its influence on maternal and perinatal outcomes. METHOD: This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of a tertiary care institute in South India from March 2017 to October 2018. Six-hundred and eighty women with or without risk factors for GDM were recruited in the study and screened for GDM based on IADPSG and NICE criteria. Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus or with fasting plasma glucose &#8805; 126 mg/dl were excluded. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GDM in our study was 27.2% by either IADPSG/NICE criteria. In this study, 25.1% women and 11.6% women were diagnosed as GDM using IADPSG and NICE criteria, respectively. The level of agreement between the two diagnostic criteria was found to be poor in our study and was statistically significant (kappa = 0.429, p < 0.001). Women testing IADPSG-positive NICE-negative had a higher risk of GHTN, abortions, PROM, preterm delivery, caesarean section and congenital anomalies, meconium-stained liquor, and low Apgar scores at 1 min when compared to non GDM group. In addition, except for preterm delivery, women diagnosed as GDM by both IADPSG and NICE criteria had adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia, urinary tract infection, and polyhydramnios. Women diagnosed as GDM in IADPSG-negative NICE-positive had no significant adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: IADPSG criteria appear to be more robust than NICE criteria for diagnosis of GDM. Women with substantial risk of maternal and perinatal outcomes are better identified by IADPSG criteria who would have been missed if NICE criteria was used.","Todi, Sushila; Sagili, Haritha; Kamalanathan, Sadish Kumar",Arch. gynecol. obstet,65,27

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19) was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing. METHODS: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online-survey-platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia and the Americas. All participants were asked for their mental wellbeing (SWEMWS) and depressive symptoms (SMFQ) with regard to ""during"" and ""before"" home confinement. RESULTS: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental-wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p < .001 and &#916;% = 9.4%) in total score of the SWEMWS questionnaire was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing ""during"" compared to ""before"" home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p < .001) in SMFQ total score with more people (+10%) showing depressive symptoms ""during"" compared to ""before"" home confinement. CONCLUSION: The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed.","Ammar, Achraf; Mueller, Patrick; Trabelsi, Khaled; Chtourou, Hamdi; Boukhris, Omar; Masmoudi, Liwa; Bouaziz, Bassem; Brach, Michael; Schmicker, Marlen; Bentlage, Ellen; How, Daniella; Ahmed, Mona; Aloui, Asma; Hammouda, Omar; Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Wrede, Christian; Bastoni, Sophia; Pernambuco, Carlos Soares; Mataruna-Dos-Santos, Leonardo Jose; Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Khacharem, Aïmen; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Adrian Washif, Jad; Glenn, Jordan M; Bott, Nicholas T; Gargouri, Faiez; Chaari, Lotfi; Batatia, Hadj; Khoshnami, Samira C; Samara, Evangelia; Zisi, Vasiliki; Sankar, Parasanth; Ahmed, Waseem N; Ali, Gamal Mohamed; Abdelkarim, Osama; Jarraya, Mohamed; El Abed, Kais; Romdhani, Mohamed; Souissi, Nizar; Van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; Bailey, Stephen J; Moalla, Wassim; Gómez-Raja, Jonathan; Epstein, Monique; Sanderman, Robbert; Schulz, Sebastian; Jerg, Achim; Al-Horani, Ramzi",PLoS One,65,26

Quarantines, lock-downs of commercial places, school closures and many other types of interventions converged as cases and the number of deaths has increased. Causality and linkage between measures and their effects have become a concern. This study aims to compare the country policies (Italy, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Germany and Turkey) in terms of stringency levels and the dates interventions put into effect for containment of the pandemic and explore its effects on numbers of cases and deaths. Methods: The Government Response Stringency Index (GRSI), which is created to measure stringency of government measures against COVID-19 was used for the comparisons. In order to compare countries' policies and their effects on case and death statistics, we initially aggregated the stringency data of countries and compiled them with logistic numbers of cases and deaths. Additionally, variation between country responses could be more apparent by decomposing the total stringency score to individual policy components. Results: Number of cases and deaths, intervention stringency levels and components of policies were compared. The number of cases per million population was higher than other countries for Spain and Italy despite their more stringent measures. Turkey had the least cases per million value with relatively less stringent policies. The number of deaths per million population and stringency levels was higher for French, Italy, and Spain. Turkey and Germany seem to control at least the number of deaths with less stringent measures. United Kingdom had the least stringent scores but a considerable number of deaths. After close investigation of countries' stringency patterns with first case dates, it can be observed that Turkey is diverse from any other country, having taken action for any type of intervention before or concurrent with the first case, as the other countries had taken the measures weeks after their first cases. Conclusion: Inconsistency of perspective towards the outbreak and delay for implementation led European countries to take strict precautions against COVID-19 for longer period for the next phases of intervention. Turkey took action earlier than other nations before the number of cases increased, and reached less number of cases and deaths with less stringent measures. Comparison between intervention stringency levels and policy enforcement rapidity of selected countries highlighted the importance of implementation of measures on time.","Kaçak, Hakan; Yildiz, Mustafa Said",Turk Hijyen Deney.

OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in patients older than 85 years and study risk factors for mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients aged 85 years and older, admitted in noncritical care units at the University Hospital Lariboisière Fernand-Widal (Paris, France) for confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included and followed up for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory findings were collected. Cox survival analysis was performed to explore factors associated with death. RESULTS: From March 14 to April 11, 2020, 76 patients (median age = 90 (86-92) years; women = 55.3%) were admitted for confirmed COVID-19. Of the patients, 64.5% presented with three or more comorbidities. Most common symptoms were asthenia (76.3%), fever (75.0%) and confusion and delirium (71.1%). An initial fall was reported in 25.0% of cases, and digestive symptoms were reported in 22.4% of cases. COVID-19 was severe in 51.3% of cases, moderate in 32.9%, and mild in 15.8%. Complications included acute respiratory syndrome (28.9%), cardiac decompensation (14.5%), and hypotensive shock (9.0%). Fatality at 21 days was 28.9%, after a median course of disease of 13 (8-17) days. Males were overrepresented in nonsurvivors (68.2%). In survivors, median length of stay was 12 (9-19.5) days.

One feature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is not present in related, common coronaviruses is ORF10, a putative 38-amino acid protein-coding gene. Proteomic studies found that ORF10 binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Cullin-2, Rbx1, Elongin B, Elongin C, and ZYG11B (CRL2ZYG11B). Since CRL2ZYG11B mediates protein degradation, one possible role for ORF10 is to ""hijack"" CRL2ZYG11B in order to target cellular, antiviral proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Here, we investigated whether ORF10 hijacks CRL2ZYG11B or functions in other ways, for example, as an inhibitor or substrate of CRL2ZYG11B While we confirm the ORF10-ZYG11B interaction and show that the N terminus of ORF10 is critical for it, we find no evidence that ORF10 is functioning to inhibit or hijack CRL2ZYG11B Furthermore, ZYG11B and its paralog ZER1 are dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells. We conclude that the interaction between ORF10 and CRL2ZYG11B is not relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.","Mena, Elijah L; Donahue, Callie J; Vaites, Laura Pontano; Li, Jie; Rona, Gergely; O039,; Leary, Colin; Lignitto, Luca; Miwatani-Minter, Bearach; Paulo, Joao A; Dhabaria, Avantika; Ueberheide, Beatrix; Gygi, Steven P; Pagano, Michele; Harper, J Wade; Davey, Robert A; Elledge, Stephen J",Proc.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has left the world in a unique state of crisis. The aim of this analysis was to explore whether Google searches can be used to retrospectively retrace the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and to detect local outbreaks by reflecting public interest in the virus. METHODS: Google Trends was used to explore the relative search volume (RSV) related to ""coronavirus"" from January 2020 to July 2020 in Germany. The RSV ranging between 0-100 was compared to new SARS-CoV-2 infections per day on a national level and to the cumulative infection numbers on a state level, as well as to important infectiological and political events. RESULTS: The most striking search peaks occurred after the first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany (January 27), during a major local outbreak in Heinsberg (February 25), after school closings (March 13) and the largest peak after nationwide contact restrictions (March 22) were announced. On a state level, peaks in RSV were observed after the first reported infection in each respective state. In addition, a higher RSV was recorded in states with higher numbers of infections (r=0,6, p=0,014) such as in Bavaria (RSV=96, 391 infections/100,000 inhabitants) and Baden-Württemberg (RSV=98, 340 infections/100,000 inhabitants). The lowest RSV (n=83) and lowest number of infections (50 infections/100,000 inhabitants) was observed in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Since the end of May, SARS-CoV-2 related RSV remained at low level even when numbers of infections were temporarily rising due to local outbreaks such as the outbreak in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia. CONCLUSION: RSV related to ""coronavirus"" precisely reflected public interest during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As public interest has strongly declined, information distribution regarding the newest developments over the entire course of the pandemic will be a major public health challenge. ZIEL DER STUDIE: Während Pandemien ist die gesamte Gesellschaft zur gleichen Zeit mit derselben Erkrankung konfrontiert, was zu großem öffentlichen Interesse führt. Die aktuelle COVID-19 Pandemie hat die ganze Welt in einen einmaligen Ausnahmezustand versetzt. Ziel dieser Studie war es zu untersuchen ob das Pandemiegeschehen in Deutschland anhand von Google Suchanfragen retrospektiv rekonstruiert werden kann und ob lokale Ausbrüche mithilfe von Google Daten detektiert werden können. METHODIK: Das relative Google Suchvolumen (RSV) zum Thema ""Coronavirus"" wurde für den Zeitraum von Januar bis Juli 2020 mit Google Trends analysiert. Das RSV, das zwischen 0 und 100 betragen kann, wurde auf Bundesebene mit den täglich neu gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2 Infektionszahlen und auf Länderebene mit den kumulativen Infektionszahlen pro Bundesland sowie wichtigen infektiologischen und politischen Ereignissen verglichen. ERGEBNISSE: Höchstwerte im Google Suchvolumen nach der ersten gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektion in Deutschland (27. Januar), während des lokalen Ausbruchs in Heinsberg (25. Februar), nach den Schulschließungen (13. März) sowie, der absolute Höchstwert, nach Verkündung der bundesweiten Kontaktbeschränkungen (22. März) verzeichnet worden. Auf Bundesländerebene wurde immer dann ein Anstieg im Suchvolumen beobachtet, wenn die erste SARS-CoV-2 Infektion im jeweiligen Bundesland gemeldet wurde. Zudem wurde ein höheres RSV in Bundesländern mit mehr gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen registriert (r=0,6, p=0,014), wie z. B. in Bayern (RSV=96, 391 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) und Baden-Württemberg (RSV=98, 340 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner). Das niedrigste RSV (n=83) und die niedrigste Anzahl an Infektionen (50 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) wurde in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern beobachtet. Seit Ende Mai ist das RSV bezüglich SARS-CoV-2 konstant gering, obwohl die Zahl an Neuinfektionen zwischenzeitlich aufgrund lokaler Ausbrüche gestiegen war wie z. B. der lokale Ausbruch in Gütersloh, Nordrhein-Westfalen. SCHLUßFOLGERUNG: Das RSV zum Thema ""Coronavirus"" bildeten das öffentliche Interesse während der ersten Monate der COVID-19 Pandemie präzise ab. Da das öffentliche Interesse jedoch stark nachgelassen hat, könnte es eine zentrale Herausforderung im weiteren Verlauf der Pandemie darstellen, die Bevölkerung weiterhin über neueste Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen informiert zu halten.","Schuster, Barbara; Tizek, Linda; Schielein, Maximilian C; Ziehfreund, Stefanie; Rothe, Kathrin; Spinner, Christoph D; Biedermann, Tilo; Zink, Alexander",Gesundheitswesen,65,16

It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system's vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system's response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy.","Madison, Annelise A; Shrout, M Rosie; Renna, Megan E; Kiecolt-Glaser, Janice K",Perspect Psychol Sci,65,20

Biochemical studies revealed that the active form of the drug targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and causes delayed chain-termination. Delayed chain-termination is incomplete, but the continuation of RNA synthesis enables a partial escape from viral proofreading. Remdesivir becomes embedded in the copy of the RNA genome that later serves as a template. Incorporation of an incoming nucleotide triphosphate is now inhibited by the modified template. Knowledge on the mechanism of action matters. Enzymatic inhibition links to antiviral effects in cell cultures, animal models and viral load reduction in patients, which provides the logical chain that is expected for a direct acting antiviral. Hence, remdesivir also serves as a benchmark in current drug development efforts that will hopefully lead to orally available treatments to the benefit of a broader population.","Götte, Matthias",Curr Opin Virol,65,24

Although more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.","Arruda, Edilson F.; Alexandre, Rodrigo e Alvim; Fragoso, Marcelo D.; val, Joao B.

This single-center retrospective study aims to analyze temporal relationships of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany with the number of patients who sought and received elective neurosurgical treatment at a German university hospital. METHODS: Daily outpatient numbers (ON) and elective procedures (EP) were recorded at our department between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 (baseline: between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2019). In patients who received EP, we recorded indication, outcome, and length of stay (LOS). Moving averages of ON (MAON) and of EP were calculated. Data on governmental action taken in response to the pandemic and on coronavirus-positive cases in Germany (CPCG) were superimposed. Exponential and arc tangent curves (ATC) were fitted to the absolute numbers of CPCG. Phase shifts were estimated, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, rho, was calculated between the 2020 MAON and the derivative function of the fitted ATC (DFATC). Wilcoxon rank sum served as statistical test. Significance was assumed with p values of less than 0.05. RESULTS: ON were significantly decreased in April 2020 as compared to April 2019 (p = 0.010). A phase shift between the German lockdown, the DFATC, and the decrease in MAON was not detected, while a phase shift of 10 days between the DFATC and the subsequent increase in MAON was detected. The DFATC was significantly negatively correlated (rho = -0.92, p < 0.0001) to the MAON until 31 March 2020, and, when shifted by 10 days, the DFATC was significantly negatively correlated (rho = -0.87, p < 0.0001) to the MAON from 01 April 2020. EP (p = 0.023), including the subset of non-oncological EP (p = 0.032), were significantly less performed in the first half of 2020 as compared to the first half of 2019. In March and April 2020, we conducted significantly more EP due to motor deficits (p = 0.0267, and less), visual disturbances (p = 0.0488), and spinal instability (p = 0.0012), and significantly less EP due to radicular pain (p = 0.0489), as compared to March and April 2019. LOS ranked significantly higher in patients who received cranial or spinal EP in March and April 2020 as compared to March and April 2019 (p = 0.0497). Significant differences in outcome were not observed. CONCLUSION: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated to an immediate and significant decrease in ON, and to a significant decrease in the number of EP performed. The subsequent increase in ON was delayed. Adequate measures to promote timely discharge of patients may become increasingly relevant as the pandemic proceeds. Although we observed a shift in the range of indications towards significantly more EP in patients with neurological deficiencies, care should be taken to avoid potentially deleterious delays of necessary elective treatment in future pandemic situations.","Rupa, Rosita; Sass, Benjamin; Morales Lema, Maria Alejandra; Nimsky, Christopher; Voellger, Benjamin",,65,1

We verified the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace-2), the receptor for SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, in pulmonary ECs using flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence labeling. Treating ECs with recombinant spike protein caused increased F-actin stress fibers, enhanced phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2, and disruption of adherens junction continuity. In addition to the junction and cytoskeletal changes, spike protein-treated ECs showed increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and enhanced adherence for monocytic cells. Interestingly, there was a significant accumulation of von Willebrand factor long strands on the cell surface in ECs isolated from COVID-19 positive human lungs, as well as on ECs from normal human lungs following spike protein treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein is capable of directly activating human lung ECs and promoting inflammation/coagulopathy.","Chatterjee, Victor Yang Xiaoyuan Ma Yonggang Yuan Sarah",The FASEB Journal,65,24

Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach. © 2021 by the authors.

During additional seasonal epidemics with Influenza A/B and RSV clinical signs and symptoms cannot be distinguished easily from SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a new assay combining four targets in the form of the new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay was evaluated. The assay was compared to the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV, Seegene Flu/RSV, Influenza A/B r-gene® and RSV/hMPV r-gene®. A total of 295 nasopharyngeal and throat swabs tested at four institutes throughout Europe including 72 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2, 65 for Influenza A, 47 for influenza B and 77 for RSV. Sensitivity of the new assay was above 95% for all targets, with the highest for SARS-CoV-2 (97.2%). The overall correlation of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values between Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay and Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay was high. The agreement between Ct values above 30 showed the multiplex giving higher Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 on average than the singleplex assay. In conclusion, the new assay is a rapid and reliable alternative with a less hands-on time for the detection of not one, but four upper respiratory tract pathogens that may circulate at the same time.

The order allowed police to fine people who left their houses without a ?reasonable excuse?. This article considers the confusion around the order in the community and upper levels of the government. Publicly available information about the fines issued by the police is analysed and it is argued that an overly narrow application of the order by police meant that its application was not reasonably proportionate to the authorising legislation, the Public Health Act 2010 (NSW). It is concluded that if future lockdowns are required, care will need to be taken to ensure that Ministerial orders are crafted in line with the legislation and that police officers clearly understand their operation.","Mostyn, Ben Kinchin Niamh",Federal Law Review,65,16

Within the I-MOVE-COVID-19 primary care multicentre study, we measured the association between 2019-20 influenza vaccination and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre test-negative case-control study at primary care level, in study sites in five European countries, from March to August 2020. Patients presenting with acute respiratory infection were swabbed, with demographic, 2019-20 influenza vaccination and clinical information documented. Using logistic regression, we measured the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), adjusting for study site and age, sex, calendar time, presence of chronic conditions. The main analysis included patients swabbed &#8804;7 days after onset from the three countries with <15% of missing influenza vaccination. In secondary analyses, we included five countries, using multiple imputation with chained equations to account for missing data. RESULTS: We included 257 COVID-19 cases and 1631 controls in the main analysis (three countries). The overall aOR between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.66-1.32). The aOR was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.58-1.46) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.51-1.67) among those aged 20-59 and &#8805;60 years, respectively. In secondary analyses, we included 6457 cases and 69 272 controls. The imputed aOR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.95) among all ages and any delay between swab and symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that COVID-19 cases were more likely to be vaccinated against influenza than controls. Influenza vaccination should be encouraged among target groups for vaccination. I-MOVE-COVID-19 will continue documenting influenza vaccination status in 2020-21, in order to learn about effects of recent influenza vaccination.","Kissling, Esther; Hooiveld, Mariëtte; Brytting, Mia; Vilcu, Ana-Maria; de Lange, Marit; Martínez-Baz, Iván; Sigerson, Debbie; Enkirch, Theresa; Belhillil, Sylvie; Meijer, Adam; Castilla, Jesus; William, Naoma; Carnahan, AnnaSara; Falchi, Alessandra; Hendriksen, Janneke; Casado, Itziar; Murray, Josie; Enouf, Vincent; Dijkstra, Frederika; Marques, Diogo F P; Valenciano, Marta",Influenza other respir. viruses,65,11

METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study, patients recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study. All included subjects exhibited a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Spectral domain macular OCTA was performed at least 2 weeks after recovery from systemic COVID-19. Vessel density (VD) of the superficial (SCP) and deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) and the area of the FAZ were measured in COVID-19 recovered patients versus age-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Thirty-one recovered COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy normal controls were studied. Mean quality scan index was 7.64 ± 0.66 in the COVID cases and 8.34 ± 0.71 in the normal controls (pâ¯=â¯0.001). Mean SCP VD and DCP VD of the COVID cohort were significantly lower than the SCP VD and DCP VD of the control group in the foveal and parafoveal regions. FAZ area was greater in the COVID cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, in the COVID cohort, VD of the SCP and DCP were lower in patients with a history of COVID-19 hospitalization versus those without such a history, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Patients recovered from COVID-19 displayed alterations in the retinal microvasculature, including a significantly lower VD in the SCP and DCP.

The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of yoga-based interventions on self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in people with cancer in randomized controlled trials. METHOD: Six databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Systematic review procedures were followed including a quality assessment. Meta-analysis of suitable studies was conducted. RESULTS: 26 studies from our search criteria were eligible for inclusion for depressive and 16 for anxiety symptoms. Meta-analyses revealed evidence for significant medium effects of yoga on depression symptoms (N = 1,486, g = -0.419, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.558 to -0.281, p < 0.001) and anxiety (N = 977, g = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 to -0.221, p < 0.001) compared to controls. Subgroup analyses for depressive symptoms revealed significant effects for all analyses performed (type of cancer, type of control, treatment status, duration of intervention or frequency of yoga sessions), with effect sizes being comparable between subgroups. Similar findings were found for anxiety symptoms except for treatment status, where the only significant effect was found when yoga was delivered during active treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that in people with cancer, yoga-based interventions are associated with amelioration of depression and anxiety symptoms and therefore a promising therapeutic modality for their management. However, the potential for risk of bias together with control group design challenges means the results should be interpreted with caution.","Gonzalez, Maria; Pascoe, Michaela C; Yang, Guoyan; de Manincor, Michael; Grant, Suzanne; Lacey, Judith; Firth, Joseph; Sarris, Jerome",Psycho-oncol.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH. RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8 ± 17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, -3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, -3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19-positive patients without DVT/PE. Advancements in DVT/PE prevention are needed for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.","Erben, Young; Franco-Mesa, Camila; Gloviczki, Peter; Stone, William; Quinones-Hinojoas, Alfredo; Meltzer, Andrew J; Lin, Michelle; Greenway, Melanie R F; Hamid, Osman; Devcic, Zlatko; Toskich, Beau; Ritchie, Charles; Lamb, Christopher J; De Martino, Randall R; Siegel, Jason; Farres, Houssan; Hakaim, Albert G; Sanghavi, Devang K; Li, Yupeng; Rivera, Candido; Moreno-Franco, Pablo; O039,; Keefe, Nancy L; Gopal, Neethu; Marquez, Christopher P; Huang, Josephine F; Kalra, Manju; Shields, Raymond; Prudencio, Mercedes; Gendron, Tania; McBane, Robert; Park, Myung; Hoyne, Jonathan B; Petrucelli, Leonard; Horo, John C; Meschia, James F",J.

The present study explores the potential association between serum nitrate levels and mortality in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective observation study was carried out. SETTING: Eight Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain). PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Determination of serum nitrate levels at ICU admission. MAIN VARIABLE OF INTEREST: Mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: Non-surviving (n=11) compared to surviving patients (n=42) showed higher APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA scores (p=0.004), and higher serum nitrate levels (p=0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed serum nitrate levels to be associated to 30-day mortality after controlling for SOFA (OR=1.021; 95%CI=1.006-1.036; p=0.01) or APACHE-II (OR=1.023; 95%CI=1.006-1.041; p=0.01). There were no differences in the area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction by serum nitrate levels (AUC=83%; 95%CI=73-92%; p<0.001), APACHE II (AUC=85%; 95%CI=75-96%; p<0.001) and SOFA (AUC=78%; 95%CI=63-92%; p=0.005) based on the DeLong method. The Kaplan-Meier analysis found patients with serum nitrates levels>68.4µmol/l to have a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio=138.8; 95%CI=22.3-863.9; p<0.001).

Previous influenza pandemics showed that socioeconomic factors may determine both disease detection rates and overall outcomes, and preliminary data from the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic suggests that this is still true. Over the past years it has become clear that early-life adversity (ELA) plays a critical role biasing the immune system towards a pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype many years later. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be particularly sensitive to the early life social environment. As we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 it appears that a functional CTL (CD8+) response is required to clear the infection and COVID-19 severity is increased as the CD8+ response becomes somehow diminished or exhausted. This raises the hypothesis that the ELA-induced pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype may play a role in determining the clinical course of COVID-19, and the convergence of ELA-induced senescence and COVID-19 induced exhaustion represents the worst-case scenario with the least effective T-cell response. If the correct data is collected, it may be possible to separate the early life elements that have made people particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 many years later. This will, naturally, then help us identify those that are most at risk from developing the severest forms of COVID-19. In order to do this, we need to recognize socioeconomic and early-life factors as genuine medically and clinically relevant data that urgently need to be collected. Finally, many biological samples have been collected in the ongoing studies. The mechanisms linking the early life environment with a defined later-life phenotype are starting to be elucidated, and perhaps hold the key to understanding inequalities and differences in the severity of COVID-19.","Holuka, Cyrielle; Merz, Myriam P; Fernandes, Sara B; Charalambous, Eleftheria G; Seal, Snehaa V; Grova, Nathalie; Turner, Jonathan D",Int. j. mol. sci.

Recent work has made use of a generalized hypergraph cut function which for a hypergraph $\mathcal{H} = (V,E)$ can be defined by associating each hyperedge $e \in E$ with a splitting function ${\bf w}_e$, which assigns a penalty to each way of separating the nodes of $e$. When each ${\bf w}_e$ is a submodular cardinality-based splitting function, meaning that ${\bf w}_e(S) = g(|S|)$ for some concave function $g$, previous work has shown that a generalized hypergraph cut problem can be reduced to a directed graph cut problem on an augmented node set. However, existing reduction procedures often result in a dense graph, even when the hypergraph is sparse, which leads to slow runtimes for algorithms that run on the reduced graph. We introduce a new framework of sparsifying hypergraph-to-graph reductions, where a hypergraph cut defined by submodular cardinality-based splitting functions is $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximated by a cut on a directed graph. Our techniques are based on approximating concave functions using piecewise linear curves. For $\varepsilon>0$ we need at most $O(\varepsilon^{-1}|e| \log |e|)$ edges to reduce any hyperedge $e$, which leads to faster runtimes for approximating generalized hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problems. For the machine learning heuristic of a clique splitting function, our approach requires only $O(|e| \varepsilon^{-1/2} \log \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ edges. This sparsification leads to faster approximate min $s$-$t$ graph cut algorithms for certain classes of co-occurrence graphs. Finally, we apply our sparsification techniques to develop approximation algorithms for minimizing sums of cardinality-based submodular functions.","Benson, Austin R.; Kleinberg, Jon; Veldt, Nate",,65,24

Till now, 15 million people are infected, causing more than 600,000 deaths. The disease, commonly known as, COVID-19, was initially thought to be associated with ARDS only, but later on revealed to have many unexplained and atypical clinical features like coagulopathy and cytokinemia, leading to multi-organ involvements. The patients also suffer from 'Silent Hypoxemia', where there is no immediate respiratory signs and symptoms even though alarmingly low SpO2 level. We hypothesize that this covert hypoxemia may lead to molecular changes exacerbating coagulopathy and cytokine storm in COVID19 patients, which again, in turn, causes a vicious cycle of more hypoxemia/hypoxia and progression of the infection to more severe stages through HIF-1&#945; dependent pathway. Although molecular mechanisms are yet to be substantiated by scientific evidence, hypoxemia remains an independent worsening factor in serious COVID 19 patients. Keeping all in mind, we propose that even in the early and asymptomatic cases, prophylactic oxygen therapy to be initiated to break the vicious cycle and to reduce the mortality in COVID 19 to save precious human lives.","Chauhan, Anshika; Kaur, Rajandeep; Chakrbarti, Prantar; Pal, Arnab",Indian J Clin Biochem,65,10

Therefore, based on the fast and global spread of the virus, urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop preventive and therapeutic drugs. In this regard, treatments addressing the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become a major focus. Notably, while a rapid and well-coordinated immune response represents the first line of defense against viral infection, excessive inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive host immune defense may lead to tissue damage both at the site of virus entry and at systemic level. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in COVID-19 patients. In particular, the massive cytokine and chemokine release, the so-called ""cytokine storm"", clearly reflects a widespread uncontrolled dysregulation of the host immune defense. Although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling, a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identification of signaling pathways altered during viral infections may help to unravel the most relevant molecular cascades implicated in biological processes mediating viral infections and to unveil key molecular players that may be targeted. Thus, given the key role of the immune system in COVID-19, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the immune dysregulation might give us clues for the clinical management of the severe cases and for preventing the transition from mild to severe stages.","Catanzaro, Michele; Fagiani, Francesca; Racchi, Marco; Corsini, Emanuela; Govoni, Stefano; Lanni, Cristina",Signal Transduct Target Ther,65,14

Reuse may minimise the impact of the shortage but requires the availability of an efficient and safe decontamination method. AIM: our objective is to determine whether the low-temperature-steam-2%-formaldehyde (LTSF) sterilisation process is effective, preserves the properties of filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators and allows safe reuse. METHODS: 14 unused FFP2, FFP3 and N95 respirator models were subjected to two decontamination cycles. After the second cycle, each model was visually inspected and accumulated residual formaldehyde levels were analysed according to the EN 14180. After one and two cycles, Fit factor (FF) was tested on all models and penetration tests with sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols were additionally performed on five models. FINDINGS: decontamination physically altered three of the 14 models. All the residual formaldehyde values were below the permissible threshold. Irregular FF decreases and increases were observed after each cycle. In the sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol penetration test, three devices obtained equivalent or superior results to those of the FFP classification with which they were marketed, both at the baseline level and after one and two decontamination cycles. Two other devices reduced their filtering capacity. CONCLUSION: One and two sterilisation cycles using LTSF do not alter the structure of most (11/14) respirators tested and did not degrade the fit or filtration capacity of any of the analysed respirators. The residual formaldehyde levels comply with the EN 14180 standard. This reprocessing method could be used in times of shortage of personal protective equipment.","Haro, García; Bischofberger Valdés, Cornelia; Vicente-Guijarro, Jorge; Díaz-Agero Pérez, Cristina; Fabregate-Fuente, Martín; Moreno-Nunez, Paloma; Aranaz Andrés, Jesús María",J. hosp. infect,65,1

Molecular docking and simulations of these molecules targeting the ACE2-Spike complex were performed. Rutin DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were obtained as the top-scored drugs as per the docking protocol. The MD simulations of ligand-free, Rutin DAB10-bound, and Swertiapuniside-bound ACE2-Spike complex revealed abrogation of the hydrogen bonding network between the two proteins. The principal component and dynamic cross-correlation analysis pointed out conformational changes in both the proteins unique to the ligand-bound systems. The interface residues, His34, and Lys353 from ACE2 and Arg403, and Tyr495 from the Spike protein formed significant strong interactions with the ligand molecules, inferring the inhibition of ACE2-Spike complex.

Model prediction method can serve as a pre-screening tool to quickly estimate the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation on emerging or unculturable viruses. In this study, an improved prediction model was applied to estimate UV254 photolysis kinetics of viral genomes (kpred, genome) based on the genome sequences and their photoreactivity and to correlate with the experimental virus infectivity loss kinetics (kexp, infectivity). The UV254 inactivation data of 102 viruses (including 2 dsRNA, 65 ssRNA, 33 dsDNA and 2 ssDNA viruses) were collected from the published experimental data with kexp, infectivity ranging from 0.016 to 3.49 cm2 mJ-1. The model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to UV254 irradiation except dsRNA viruses (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.64) and 70% of kpred, genome fell in the range of 1/2 to 2 times of kexp, infectivity. The positive deviation of the model often occurred for photoresistant viruses with low kexp, infectivity less than 0.20 cm2 mJ-1 (e.g., Adenovirus, Papovaviridae and Retroviridae). We also applied this model to predict the UV254 inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 (kpred, genome = 3.168 cm2 mJ-1) and a UV dose of 3 mJ cm-2 seemed to be able to achieve a 2-log removal by conservative calculation using 1/2kpred, genome value. This prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation for emerging/unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment.","Cheng, Shuangshuang; Ge, Yuexian; Lee, Yunho; Yang, Xin",Water Res,65,21

Imaging is indicated for the small percentage of cases that do not respond to conservative management and when the diagnosis is no doubt. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a bilateral synovial articulation between the mandible and skull base. It has an intra-articular disc dividing the joint into superior and inferior compartments and the articular surfaces are lined with fibrocartilage. The normal imaging anatomy of the TMJ is described and illustrated. Different movements occur in each joint compartments: a hinge movement in the inferior joint space and translation or gliding in the superior joint space. Internal derangement is the commonest disorder affecting the TMJ and is most commonly due to disc displacement, followed by osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritides. The imaging findings, primarily on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), of internal derangement and less common disorders of the joint, are reviewed and illustrated. Optimal imaging protocols are discussed with detailed reporting guidelines.","Whyte, A; Boeddinghaus, R; Bartley, A; Vijeyaendra, R",Clin. radiol,65,16

In anticipation of an acute strain on established medical facilities in Dallas, Texas, federal officials worked in conjunction with local medical personnel to convert a convention center into a Federal Medical Station capable of caring for patients affected by COVID-19. A 200,000 square foot event space was designated as a direct patient care area, with surrounding spaces repurposed to house ancillary services. Given the highly transmissible nature of the novel coronavirus, the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) was of particular importance for personnel staffing the facility. Furthermore, nationwide shortages in the availability of PPE necessitated the reuse of certain protective materials.

We aimed to assess the relationship between timing of initial corticosteroid treatment and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this observational study through medical record analysis, we quantified the mortality benefit of corticosteroids in two equally matched groups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We subsequently evaluated the timing of initiating corticosteroids and its effect on mortality in all patients receiving corticosteroids. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected and employed for multivariable regression analyses. 1461 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Of these, 760 were also matched into two equal groups based on having received corticosteroid therapy. Patients receiving corticosteroids had a lower risk of death than those who did not (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.67-0.90; p = 0.01). Timing of corticosteroids was assessed for all 615 patients receiving corticosteroids during admission. Patients receiving first dose of corticosteroids > 72 h into hospitalization had a lower risk of death compared to patients with first dose at earlier time intervals (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.82; p = 0.003). There was a mortality benefit in patients with > 7 days of symptom onset to initiation of corticosteroids (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.95; p = 0.03). In patients receiving oxygen therapy, corticosteroids reduced risk of death in mechanically ventilated patients (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24-0.60; p < 0.001) but not in patients on high-flow or other oxygen therapy (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.07; p = 0.07) and (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35-2.00; p = 0.69), respectively. Timing of corticosteroids initiation was related to in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. Time from symptom onset > 7 days should trigger initiation of corticosteroids. In the absence of invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids should be initiated if the patient remains hospitalized at 72 h. Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy should not be a trigger for initiation of corticosteroids unless the timing is appropriate.","Bahl, Amit; Johnson, Steven; Chen, Nai-Wei",Intern. emerg. med,65,24

The development of a murine model of C. difficile infection has led to fundamental discoveries in disease pathogenesis and the host immune response to infection. Recently, C. difficile endogenously present in the microbiota of mice has been reported and was found to complicate interpretation of mouse studies. Here, we report a novel C. difficile strain, named NTCD-035, isolated from the microbiota of our mouse colony. The presence of NTCD-035 in mice prior to challenge with a highly pathogenic C. difficile strain (VPI10463) led to significantly reduced disease severity. Phylogenetic characterization derived from whole genome sequencing and PCR ribotyping identified the isolate as a novel clade 1, ribotype 035 strain that lacks the pathogenicity locus required to produce toxins. Deficiency in toxin production along with sporulation capacity and secondary bile acid sensitivity was confirmed using in vitro assays. Inoculation of germ-free mice with NTCD-035 did not cause morbidity despite the strain readily colonizing the large intestine. Implementation of a culture-based screening procedure enabled the identification of mice harboring C. difficile in their microbiota, the establishment of a C. difficile-free mouse colony, and a monitoring system to prevent future contamination. Taken together, these data provide a framework for screening mice for endogenously harbored C. difficile and support clinical findings that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of non-toxigenic strains in preventing C. difficile associated disease.

Isoprostanes were quantified in the range of 31.1-1270 ng/L in raw wastewater samples in two communities in western Kentucky and Tennessee during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent detection of PGE2 and 5-iPF2&#945;-VI in wastewater suggested that PGE2 and 5-iPF2&#945;-VI can be a reliable biomarker of community oxidative anxiety. The higher 4-month average mass load of isoprostanes [(ranged from 22.9 mg/d/1000 people to 807 mg/d/1000 people] may be attributed to the elevated community level oxidative anxiety owing COVID-19 uncertainties. The average mass loads of PGE2 and 5-iPF2&#945;-VI in a community were significantly increased (two-tailed p < 0.001) from the first month of COVID-19 pandemic to the second month; however, significantly decreased (two-tailed p < 0.001) in the third month. Wastewater-based-epidemiological determination of isoprostanes can be a near-real-time and cost-effective approach of a trend in community depression. This is the first report of the quantification of PGE2 and 5-iPF2&#945;-VI in wastewater and estimation of the community level oxidative anxiety.","Bowers, Isaac; Subedi, Bikram",Chemosphere,65,4

Acute Kidney Injury was reported in a considerable amount of patients suffering from COVID-19, especially in those admitted in the ICU setting. This study was undertaken to study the clinical profile, incidence, severity, requirement of renal replacement therapy, and the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with Acute Kidney Injury admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital recognized as Dedicated COVID Hospital during the period of May 2020 to September 2020. 218 patients hospitalised in the Intensive Care Unit during this period were monitored for the development of Acute Kidney Injury. The clinical profile, laboratory findings, requirement of invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy, and outcomes of such patients were recorded. Data was analysed using the SPSS software. RESULTS: Among all the patients enrolled in the Intensive Care Unit during the study period, 27.06% developed Acute Kidney Injury. 67.79% of these patients developed AKI during the first five days of hospitalisation. 76.27% of the patients with AKI required invasive mechanical ventilation, while 28.81% required renal replacement therapy. There was a significant association between the development of Acute Kidney Injury and the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0000015). 44.68% of the deaths among the 218 patients were associated with COVID-19 related AKI (p = 0.0000003). CONCLUSION: Acute Kidney Injury was found to be common among the hospitalised COVID-19 patients in our Intensive Care Unit. AKI occurs early, often in a temporal association with respiratory failure, and portends a dire prognosis. © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.","Wajekar, S. D.; Bhat, S.

It is rationally designed and manufactured by facile electrospinning. PDCJF is firstly constructed using 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone (DBF) with photoconductive and luminescent properties. Janus nanofibers are respectively used as the building units to construct the top layer (T-PDCJF) and the bottom layer (B-PDCJF) of PDCJF. The two layers are tightly bonded to form PDCJF. Under light irradiation, there is photosensitive dual-anisotropic conduction in PDCJF, but there is no anisotropic conduction without light. Thus, the transition of PDCJF from mono-functional magnetism to tri-functionalities is realized under light and without light. The luminescence color of PDCJF is tunable and it emits white-light. This is made possible by modulating the amounts of luminescent substances and excitation wavelength. The microscopic Janus nanofibers used as building units and macroscopic Janus film structure ensure high photosensitive dual-anisotropic conduction and excellent fluorescence in PDCJF. The two-dimensional (2D) PDCJF is rolled to obtain three-dimensional (3D) Janus-type tubes and 2D plus 3D complete flag-like structures with exceptional multi-functionalities. The new findings can strongly guide in developing advanced multi-functional nanostructures.","Tang, Xuehua; Qi, Haina; Yang, Liu; Xie, Yunrui; Ma, Qianli; Yu, Wensheng; Dong, Xiangting; Li, Dan; Liu, Guixia; Wang, Jinxian",J Colloid Interface Sci,65,20

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension and hospitalized due to COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [interquartile range, 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [interquartile range 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to 9 hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19-0.92]; P=0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15-0.89]; P=0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.70]; P=0.01) in patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB nonusers. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.","Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Lihua; Cai, Jingjing; Lei, Fang; Qin, Juan-Juan; Xie, Jing; Liu, Ye-Mao; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Huang, Xuewei; Lin, Lijin; Xia, Meng; Chen, Ming-Ming; Cheng, Xu; Zhang, Xiao; Guo, Deliang; Peng, Yuanyuan; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Chen, Jing; She, Zhi-Gang; Wang, Yibin; Xu, Qingbo; Tan, Renfu; Wang, Haitao; Lin, Jun; Luo, Pengcheng; Fu, Shouzhi; Cai, Hongbin; Ye, Ping; Xiao, Bing; Mao, Weiming; Liu, Liming; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Mingyu; Chen, Manhua; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Touyz, Rhian M; Xia, Jiahong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Huang, Xiaodong; Yuan, Yufeng; Loomba, Rohit; Liu, Peter P; Li, Hongliang",Circ Res,65,16

Severe COVID-19 is marked by aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses with an abnormal cytokine profile and a prolonged illness course with multisystem organ dysfunction. Antiviral treatments have yet to show benefit later in critical illness. Taken together, this raises the concern that a purely antiviral treatment approach may be insufficient. A number of immunomodulatory strategies are being tested, including corticosteroids, cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, small molecule inhibitors, and cellular therapeutics. The only drug to date to show a mortality benefit for COVID-19 in a randomized control trial is dexamethasone, but there remains uncertainty about which patients may benefit most and longer-term complications including secondary infections. Here we review the immune dysregulation of severe COVID-19, the existing data behind various immunomodulatory strategies, and consider future directions of study.","Meyerowitz, Eric A; Sen, Pritha; Schoenfeld, Sara R; Neilan, Tomas G; Frigault, Matthew J; Stone, John H; Kim, Arthur Y; Mansour, Michael K",Clin Infect Dis,65,24

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China in April 2020. METHODS: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian. The participants completed the questionnaire with six scales: Social Distancing Scale; Personal Hygiene Scale; Empathic Responding Scale; Wishful Thinking Scale; Perceived Stress Scale and Perceived Threat Scale. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the preventive measures outcomes. p value < .05 was considered as statistical significance. RESULTS: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing (SoD) and personal hygiene measures (PHM). Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance with SoD and PHM. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance with the COVID-19 preventive measures. IMPACT: The predictive model constructed is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance with infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. As the infection control behaviours of healthcare students, whom are still under training and are the high-risk group of being infected and infecting others in the community, are rarely reported in literature, this study has provided empirical evidence to nurses and other healthcare professionals to identify students susceptible to poor compliance and provide early monitoring and education to suppress the COVID-19 transmission.","Tang, Anson Chui Yan; Kwong, Enid Wai-Yung; Chen, Liangying; Cheng, Winnie Lai Sheung",J. adv. nurs,65,8

Initial advice for parents stressed topics such as how to talk about the pandemic with children or cope with illness-related distress. They now focus on youth adjustment to a heavily disrupted school year and on strategies for building long-term resilience. Although these conversations often center on youth adjustment, they have-at last-started to consider the well-being of parents (and other caregivers) as well. This shift in focus is crucial given the enormous challenges that parents face right now and the direct links between their well-being and that of their children. What continues to lag, even well into the pandemic, however, is the provision of workable solutions for addressing parents' mental health. While we applaud the renewed focus on parenting stress and well-being, we remain deeply concerned by the absence of a plan for intervening.","Peris, Tara S; Ehrenreich-May, Jill",J. Am. Acad.

Although, useful for benchmarks and new idea comparison, the algorithmic dynamics does not always transfer to complex real-life problems, where additional meta-data is required during solution construction. This paper looks at real-life outbound supply chain problem using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its scaling dynamics with two parallel ACO architectures - Independent Ant Colonies (IAC) and Parallel Ants (PA). Results showed that PA was able to reach a higher solution quality in fewer iterations as the number of parallel instances increased. Furthermore, speed performance was measured across three different hardware solutions - 16 core CPU, 68 core Xeon Phi and up to 4 Geforce GPUs. State of the art, ACO vectorization techniques such as SS-Roulette were implemented using C++ and CUDA. Although excellent for TSP, it was concluded that for the given supply chain problem GPUs are not suitable due to meta-data access footprint required. Furthermore, compared to their sequential counterpart, vectorized CPU AVX2 implementation achieved 25.4x speedup on CPU while Xeon Phi with its AVX512 instruction set reached 148x on PA with Vectorized (PAwV). PAwV is therefore able to scale at least up to 1024 parallel instances on the supply chain network problem solved.","Dzalbs, Ivars; Kalganova, Tatiana",,65,21

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 910 trials retrieved on August 7, 2020. Results: A total of 910 registered clinical trials with at least one drug intervention were evaluated. The number of registrations (32.4%, 295) from the United States accounted for nearly one-third of the total and far exceeded that of other countries individually. Furthermore, the peak number of trials were registered in April (34.3%, 312). Over half of the trials (51.2%, 466) are in the recruitment phase, and only 4.2% (38) of the trials have been completed. The median (interquartile range) estimated enrollment is 127 (59, 365). In 39% (355) of trials, the estimated enrollment is less than 100 participants. A total of 94.5% (790) of the trials use randomization in the allocation, 82.7% (753) use a parallel intervention mode, and 52.2% (475) use masking. A total of 287 drug names have been standardized and mapped. ""Hydroxychloroquine"" is the leading drug among the registered trials (7.47%, 68). Among the main countries contributing to investigations on ""hydroxychloroquine"", the United States ranks first with 36.76% (25) of the trials. Conclusion: The designs of COVID-19 clinical drug trials have greatly improved in terms of the implementation of randomization and, particularly, blinding methods. In terms of drug reuse, the number of drug types has greatly increased, and hundreds of drugs have been used for efficacy screening. The emergence of large-sample registration trials is expected to address the uncertainty regarding the current clinical efficacy of some drugs.","Wang, Bin; Lai, Junkai; Yan, Xiaoyan; Jin, Feifei; Yi, Bin; An, Caixia; Li, Yuanxiao; Yao, Chen",Drug Des Devel Ther,65,0

Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is well suited to answer questions at bedside. METHODS: A multidisciplinary (intensive care, critical care cardiology, and emergency medicine) group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE from the United States and Canada convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aiming to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering focused point-of-care TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Although transthoracic echocardiography can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. TEE provides acute care clinicians with a goal-directed framework to guide clinical care and represents an ideal modality to evaluate hemodynamic instability during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs, support cardiac arrest resuscitation, and guide veno-venous ECMO cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe a set of principles and practical aspects for performing examinations with a focus on the logistics, personnel, and equipment required before, during, and after an examination. CONCLUSIONS: In the right clinical scenario, TEE is a tool that can provide the information needed to deliver the best and safest possible care for the critically ill patients.","Teran, Felipe; Burns, Katharine M; Narasimhan, Mangala; Goffi, Alberto; Mohabir, Paul; Horowitz, James M; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Nagdev, Arun; Panebianco, Nova; Chin, Eric J; Gottlieb, Michael; Koenig, Seth; Arntfield, Robert",J Am Soc Echocardiogr,65,1

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19. METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). FINDINGS: 96â032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14â888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81â144 patients were in the control group. 10â698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223-1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368-1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218-1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273-1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935-2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106-5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760-4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344-4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

Our study aims to examine the incidence and risk factors of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study of adult COVID-19 patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia admitted to a regional tertiary care hospital. SPI was defined as microorganisms identified on the respiratory tract with or without concurrent positive blood culture results for the same microorganism obtained at least 48 hours after admission. RESULTS: Thirteen out of 244 (5%) had developed SPI during hospitalization. The median of the nadir lymphocyte count during hospitalization was significantly lower in patients with SPI as compared to those without SPI [0.4 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.5) versus 0.6 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.9)]. Patients with lower nadir lymphocyte had an increased risk of developing SPI with odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.47, p=0.04) per 0.1 K/uL decrement in nadir lymphocyte. The baseline median inflammatory markers of CRP [166.4 mg/L vs. 100.0 mg/L, p=0.01] and D-dimer (18.5 mg/L vs. 1.4 mg/L, p<0.01), and peak procalcitonin (1.4 ng/mL vs. 0.3 ng/mL, p<0.01) and CRP (273.5 mg/L vs. 153.7 mg/L, p<0.01) during hospitalization were significantly higher in SPI group.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 10 4 TCID 50 or 10 5 TCID 50 , the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 10 5 TCID 50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development. Authors Summary: The disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","Yinda, Claude Kwe; Port, Julia R; Bushmaker, Trenton; Owusu, Irene Offei; Avanzato, Victoria A; Fischer, Robert J; Schulz, Jonathan E; Holbrook, Myndi G; Hebner, Madison J; Rosenke, Rebecca; Thomas, Tina; Marzi, Andrea; Best, Sonja M; de Wit, Emmie; Shaia, Carl; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Munster, Vincent J",,65,22

This paper uses a unique survey data collected early on in the pandemic to measure economic deprivation among individuals. The Federal Reserve Board fielded a Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED) in April 2020. This survey is used to compile data on four indicators of economic deprivation, namely: i) Overall financial condition, ii) Loss of employment, iii) Reduction in income and iv) Inability to pay bills in full. Data on these indicators is compiled for each individual and is used in a novel way to construct a set of multidimensional deprivation indices. These indices measure the overlap of deprivations experienced by an individual. Results show that almost 25 percent of the respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators. More than 13 percent of adults reported their inability to pay monthly bills and struggled to make ends meet financially. One in four respondents had lower income compared to income from previous month. The economic shock affected Hispanics in a more profound way. More than 37 percent Hispanics reported hardship in two or more indicators and 8 percent reported hardship in all four indicators. Higher proportion of young adults and those without a college degree suffered multiple hardships. The paper highlights the plight of Americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic and sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial/ethnic lines.","Dhongde, Shatakshee",PLoS One,65,13

There is evidence that, in addition to person to person contact, the disease transmission occurs through airborne droplets/aerosols generated by breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. For that reason, building heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems can play an important role, as they may both contribute as well as reduce the transmission risk. However, there is insufficient understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings. This article introduces a method of bottom-up emergent modelling of the movement of infectious aerosols in internal space using a physics engine, and reports on simple simulation experiments. The results show that the smallest droplets that are large enough to contain the virus can be suspended in the air for an extended period of time; that turbulent air flow can contribute to the infectious aerosols remaining in the room; and that unidirectional air flow can contribute to purging the room of the infectious aerosols. The model introduced in this article is a starting point for further development and for increasing our understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings, and thus for increased sustainability of building design.","Jankovic, Ljubomir",Sustainability,65,17

Previous work has shown that the optical and X-ray were characterised by regular outbursts at the proposed binary period of 119 d. However around February 2008 the optical behaviour changed substantially, with the previously regular optical outbursts ending. Reported here are new optical (OGLE) and X-ray (Swift) observations covering the period after 2008 which suggest an almost total circumstellar disc loss followed by a gradual recovery. This indicates the probable transition of a Be star to a B star, and back again. However, at the time of the most recent OGLE data (March 2020) the characteristic periodic outbursts had yet to return to their early state, indicating that the disk still had some re-building yet to complete.","Coe, M.

None of the lung abnormalities detected by CT was different between discharged and deceased patients. No differences were observed in the features and extent of pulmonary involvement according to age and gender. Logistic regression analysis with age and gender as covariates demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile were associated with the involvement of all 5 pulmonary lobes (OR = 14.5, 95% CI 2.3-90.9, p = 0.004), the presence of septal thickening (OR = 8.2, 95% CI 1.6-40.9, p = 0.011) and the presence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (OR = 12.0, 95% CI 1.1-127.5, p = 0.039) independently of age and gender. We demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile are associated with a more severe pulmonary involvement, independently of age and gender and not associated with disease outcomes.

Additionally, being ED a clinical marker and predictor of non-communicable chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular, subjects with ED could potentially have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of ED among subjects with a reported diagnosis of COVID-19 and to measure the association of COVID-19 and ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Sex@COVID online survey (performed between April 7 and May 4, 2020, in Italy) to retrieve a sample of Italian male sexually active subjects with reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. A matching sample of COVID-19-negative male sexually active subjects was also retrieved using propensity score matching in a 3:1 ratio. The survey used different standardized psychometric tools to measure effects of lockdown and social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health of Italian subjects. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were included in the analysis (25 COVID-positive; 75 COVID-negative). The prevalence of ED, measured with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, was significantly higher in the COVID+ group (28% vs. 9.33%; p = 0.027). Logistic regression models confirmed a significant effect of COVID-19 on the development of ED, independently of other variables affecting erectile function, such as psychological status, age, and BMI [OR 5.66, 95% CI: 1.50-24.01]. Likewise, subjects with ED were more likely to have COVID-19, once corrected for age and BMI [OR 5.27, 95% CI: 1.49-20.09]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: On top of well-described pathophysiological mechanisms, there is preliminary evidence in a real-life population of ED as a risk factor of developing COVID-19 and possibly occurring as a consequence of COVID-19. Universal vaccination against the COVID-19 and the personal protective equipment could possibly have the added benefit of preventing sexual dysfunctions.","Sansone, Andrea; Mollaioli, Daniele; Ciocca, Giacomo; Colonnello, Elena; Limoncin, Erika; Balercia, Giancarlo; Jannini, Emmanuele A",Androl.

METHODS: Two online Action Planning Forums (APFs) were organized by the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery (GICS) with a geographically diverse panel representing four children's surgical, anesthesia, and nursing subspecialties. Qualitative analysis was performed to identify codes, themes, and subthemes. RESULTS: The most frequently reported challenges were delayed access to care for children; fear among the public and patients; unavailability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE); diversion of resources toward COVID-19 care; and interruption in student and trainee hands-on education. To address these challenges, panelists recommended human resource and funding support to minimize backlog; setting up international, multi-center studies for systematic data collection specifically for children; providing online educational opportunities for trainees and students in the form of large and small group discussions; developing best practice guidelines; and, most importantly, adapting solutions to local needs. CONCLUSION: Identification of key challenges and interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global children's surgery via an objective, targeted needs assessment serves as an essential first step.

METHODS: The study is a randomized controlled trial. It complies with the guidelines prescribed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. It was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. We recruited nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 and randomly allocated them into an intervention group (n = 35) and a no-treatment control group (n = 37). The intervention group received one guided online group EFT session. RESULTS: Reductions in stress (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), and burnout (p < .001) reached high levels of statistical significance for the intervention group.

METHODS: We used a text search tool to conduct a thematic analysis of documentation pertaining to hospice in the electronic medical record system of the Department of Veterans Affairs, for a national sample of 1000 patients with advanced kidney disease between 2004 and 2014 who were followed until October 8, 2019. RESULTS: Three dominant themes emerged from our qualitative analysis of the electronic medical records of 340 cohort members with notes containing hospice mentions: (1) hospice and usual care as antithetical care models: clinicians appeared to perceive a sharp demarcation between services that could be provided under hospice versus usual care and were often uncertain about hospice eligibility criteria. This could shape decision-making about hospice and dialysis and made it hard to individualize care; (2) hospice as a last resort: patients often were referred to hospice late in the course of illness and did not so much choose hospice as accept these services after all treatment options had been exhausted; and (3) care complexity: patients' complex care needs at the time of hospice referral could complicate transitions to hospice, stretch the limits of home hospice, and promote continued reliance on the acute care system. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the need to improve transitions to hospice for patients with advanced kidney disease as they approach the end of life.","O039,; Hare, Ann M; Butler, Catherine R; Taylor, Janelle S; Wong, Susan P Y; Vig, Elizabeth K; Laundry, Ryan S; Wachterman, Melissa W; Hebert, Paul L; Liu, Chuan-Fen; Rios-Burrows, Nilka; Richards, Claire A",J.

Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","Chen, Jiajia; Hu, Chenxia; Chen, Lijun; Tang, Lingling; Zhu, Yixin; Xu, Xiaowei; Chen, Lu; Gao, Hainv; Lu, Xiaoqing; Yu, Liang; Dai, Xiahong; Xiang, Charlie; Li, Lanjuan",,65,16

Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average $R_0$ and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$ when predicting epidemic size.","H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Allard, Antoine",,65,16

Spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is pivotal in understanding the virus anatomy, since it initiates the first contact with the ACE2 receptor in the human cell. We report results of ab initio computation of the spike protein, the largest ab initio quantum chemical computation to date on any bio-molecular system, using a divide and conquer strategy by focusing on individual structural domains. In this approach we divided the S-protein into seven structural domains: N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), subdomain 1 (SD1), subdomain 2 (SD2), fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 with central helix (HR1-CH) and connector domain (CD). The entire Chain A has 14,488 atoms including the hydrogen atoms but excluding the amino acids with missing coordinates based on the PDB data (ID: 6VSB). The results include structural refinement, ab initio calculation of intra-molecular bonding mechanism, 3- dimensional non-local inter-amino acid interaction with implications for the inter-domain interaction. Details of the electronic structure, interatomic bonding, partial charge distribution and the role played by hydrogen bond network are discussed. In the interaction among structural domains, we present new insights for crucial hinge-like movement and fusion process. Extension of such calculation to the interface between the S-protein binding domain and ACE2 receptor can provide a pathway for computational understanding of mutations and the design of therapeutic drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ching, Wai-Yim; Adhikari, Puja; Jawad, Bahaa; Podgornik, Rudolf",,65,1

Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. Methods: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. Results: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO2/FiO2&gt; 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO2/FiO2≤ 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1–2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25–29) vs. 23 (22–25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO2/FiO2significantly improved after 1–2 h of NIV [median 172 (150–208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79–130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). Conclusions: Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO2/FiO2were more likely to experience HFNC failure.","Wang, Ke; Zhao, Wei; Li, Ji; Shu, Weiwei; Duan, Jun",Ann. Intensive Care,65,24

Physiotherapy triage clinics are being utilised to improve access for patients with non-urgent or routine musculoskeletal disorders, to be seen in a timely manner in specialised out-patient clinics. Using these clinics, the aim is to ultimately stratify patients into appropriate management pathways. The aim of our study is to review the effectiveness of a physiotherapy triage clinic run by advanced practitioner physiotherapists (APP), who specialise in the review of upper limb referrals from primary care physicians. METHODS: For this study, a prospective, observational design was used. Patients were referred to the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Upper Limb Service at a national elective Orthopaedic Unit. The patients’ referrals were reviewed and allocated to a physiotherapy triage pathway if deemed routine, non-urgent cases. After assessment in the APP clinic, the physiotherapist made recommendations and highlighted patients who required review or case discussion with an orthopaedic surgeon. The discharge rate and outcome of patients referred on for further interventions or operative procedures was followed over a 3-year period. The outcomes for the patients were reviewed, including whether patients who met an orthopaedic surgeon went on to have surgical intervention. RESULTS: During the study, 646 patients were reviewed in an upper limb APP physiotherapy triage clinic. Of those reviewed, only 201 patients required review by an orthopaedic surgeon. Of those, 56 patients were scheduled for an operative procedure. Within the 3-year period, 50 patients of those scheduled underwent the procedure. The most commonly performed procedure being an arthroscopic subacromial decompression with or without acromioplasty or rotator cuff repair. A total of 145 patients referred by the physiotherapist had a shoulder injection including subacromial and glenohumeral intra-articular injection. The initial discharge rate was 68%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high initial discharge rate after initial assessment by APP triage clinics for upper limb musculoskeletal pathology. This is beneficial in alleviating waiting list pressures allowing only those patients in need of intervention to be placed on the ever expanding waiting lists to see orthopaedic surgeons. This study shows a high proportion of patients being offered surgical intervention after being referred by the APP. We conclude from this that the agreement between the physiotherapist’s initial diagnosis and that of the consultant surgeon being similar in identifying patients who would benefit from operative intervention.","Lyons, Rebecca F.; Cassells, Mary; Hynes, Darragh; Mullett, Hannan; Groarke, Patrick J.",Ir J Med Sci,65,1

All patients had received corticosteroids and broad‐spectrum antibiotics while most (n = 37, 78.7%) received at least one anti‐viral medication. Mean time elapsed from COVID‐19 diagnosis to mucormycosis was 12.1 ± 4.6days. Eleven (23.4%) subjects succumbed to their disease, mostly (n = 8, 72.7%) within 7 days of diagnosis. Among the patients who died, 10 (90.9%) had pre‐existing diabetes mellitus, only 2 (18.2%) had received just one vaccine dose and all developed moderate‐to‐severe pneumonia, requiring oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Mucormycosis can occur among COVID‐19 patients, especially with poor glycaemic control, widespread and injudicious use of corticosteroids and broad‐spectrum antibiotics, and invasive ventilation. Owing to the high mortality, high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment in high‐risk populations.","Selarka, Lav; Sharma, Suktara; Saini, Dinesh; Sharma, Sanjay; Batra, Amit; Waghmare, Vishal T.; Dileep, Pratibha; Patel, Sanket; Shah, Monarch; Parikh, Tejas; Darji, Prakash; Patel, Amit; Goswami, Gaurav; Shah, Anand; Shah, Sandeep; Lathiya, Harsh; Shah, Moksha; Sharma, Pranita; Chopra, Surabhi; Gupta, Ankur; Jain, Neha; Khan, Erum; Sharma, Vijay K.; Sharma, Arvind K.; Chan, Amanda C.

Based on the cross-classified results of RT-PCR and LFIA, we used Bayesian latent class models (BLCMs), which do not require a gold standard for the evaluation of diagnostics. Data were extracted from studies that evaluated LFIA (IgG and/or IgM) assays using RT-PCR as the reference method. [Formula: see text] was 0.68 (95% probability intervals: 0.63; 0.73). [Formula: see text] was 0.32 (0.23; 0.41) for the first week and increased steadily. It was 0.75 (0.67; 0.83) and 0.93 (0.88; 0.97) for the second and third week post symptom onset, respectively.

METHODS: We use a random-effects panel data model and a Difference-in-Differences in Reverse (DDR) model to examine how air and rail transport links with Wuhan as well as the suspension of these transport links influenced the development of the epidemic in China. RESULTS: We find high-speed rail (HSR) and air connectivity with Wuhan resulted in 25.4% and 21.2% increases in the average number of daily new confirmed cases, respectively, while their suspension led to 18.6% and 13.3% decreases in that number. We also find that the suspension effect was dynamic, growing stronger over time and peaking 20–23 days after the Wuhan lockdown, then gradually wearing off. It took approximately four weeks for this effect to fully materialize, roughly twice the maximum incubation period, and similar dynamic patterns were seen in both HSR and air models. Overall, HSR had a greater impact on COVID-19 development than air transport. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides important evidence for implementing transportation-related policies in controlling future infectious diseases.","Zhu, Pengyu; Guo, Yuqing",Travel Med Infect Dis,65,15

Le but fut d’évaluer la résultante de cela sur la qualité de vie (QV) perçue par les PS hospitaliers. Matériels et méthodes Étude « hors Loi Jardé », prospective, non interventionnelle, sous forme d’un auto-questionnaire anonyme proposé en mai 2020 à tous les PS d’un CHU d’une région alors de moyenne endémie SARS-CoV-2 ayant ouvert 200 lits dédiés et mobilisé 1000 PS en renfort sur 4 mois. Elaboration du questionnaire par le team d’infectiologie, validation par les instances, généralisation en ligne (Lime Survey) via Intranet et Facebook. En environ 10minutes 71 items dont 27 échelles visuelles (0 à 10) et 5 cadres libres comparant la QV personnelle et professionnelle à celle des mois antérieurs. Cotations 6 à 10 considérées comme positives. Résultats Sur 794 réponses (11 % des PS du CHU) 259 par IDE, 228 d’autres soignants, 179 de médecins et 55 de cadres de santé, dont 311 (39 %) en unités dédiées COVID (155 permanents et 156 renforts). Cohorte surtout jeune (moyenne: 41 ans), féminine (80 %), en couple (90 %), chargée d’enfant (73 %), en maison (72 %) au CHU depuis >5 ans (79 %). Retentissement sur la vie personnelle du confinement jugé acceptable sur le plan matériel et relationnel respectivement par 76 % et 56 %. QV professionnelle s’abaissant moins sur le plan matériel (58 % vs 62 avant) que relationnel (70% vs 81). Globalement engagement dans la lutte contre l’épidémie évalué important par 72%, 50% se sentant valorisé, 82 % davantage fatigué, 69% vivant la période comme plus difficile professionnellement et 68% personnellement. Chez ceux confrontés aux cas (en unité dédié ou sous forme sporadique ailleurs) 72 % se disant à l’aise dans la pratique et 71 % bien protégés. Relation patient (COVID ou non) vécue différente par 47 %. Encouragements en tant que PS exprimés à 63% surtout par la famille; stigmatisation de 19 % surtout par des quidams. Réponses libres par 147 (18 %) des répondants, riches, pointant les failles mais aussi la solidarité. Conclusion Ce questionnaire sur la QV des PS a intéressé pas seulement ceux impliqués dans la gestion d’unités COVID, soulignant que beaucoup souhaitaient témoigner sur ce temps particulier à un moment où la fin de crise pouvait être espérée prochaine. Malgré « les protocoles changeant », « le manque de matériel », « le bouleversement des habitudes et repères » mais grâce au « soutien entre équipes » « à la période riche avec les patients et entre soignants » le bilan global s’avère contrasté avec une QV finalement pas plus altérée professionnellement que personnellement. L’analyse se poursuit par une comparaison selon le métier, le lieu d’affectation (unité COVID ou non) et les modalités d’exercice (habituel ou renfort).","Grelier, A.; Guérin, O.; Caillot, F.; Levavasseur, F.; Bénichou, J.; Caron, F.",Infectious Diseases Now,65,5

Several tools and pipelines have been developed, to date, for the identification and assembly of viral genomes. Assembly pipelines often result in viral genomes contaminated with host genetic material, some of which are currently deposited into public databases. In the current report, we present a group of deposited sequences that encompass ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contamination. We highlight the detrimental role of chimeric next generation sequencing reads, between host rRNA sequences and viral sequences, in virus genome assembly and we present the hindrances these reads may pose to current methodologies. We have further developed a refining pipeline, the Zero Waste Algorithm (ZWA) that assists in the assembly of low abundance viral genomes. ZWA performs context-depended trimming of chimeric reads, precisely removing their rRNA moiety. These, otherwise discarded, reads were fed to the assembly pipeline and assisted in the construction of larger and cleaner contigs making a substantial impact on current assembly methodologies. ZWA pipeline may significantly enhance virus genome assembly from low abundance samples and virus metagenomics approaches in which a small number of reads determine genome quality and integrity.","Dovrolis, Nikolas; Kassela, Katerina; Konstantinidis, Konstantinos; Kouvela, Adamantia; Veletza, Stavroula; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis",PLoS Comput Biol,65,26

METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of cohort studies on COVID-19 in patients with MS published until July 31, 2021. We calculated the pooled crude death rate (CDR) and estimated the indirectly-adjusted age-standardized lethality ratio (SLR) to assess the risk of death from COVID-19 in patients with MS as compared to general population. RESULTS: Out of 520 articles, 18 fulfilled criteria for pooled analysis, with a total of 5634 patients (28.6% males, mean age 41.8 years). Of them, 111 died, yielding a CDR of 1.97% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.61–2.33). The estimated SLR was 1.24 (95% CIs 1.01–1.48) after indirect age-standardization using case-fatality rates obtained from the detailed surveillance data available at the World Health Organization (WHO) website. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and the analysis of temporal trends of SLR from March 2020 to July 2021 provided consistent findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled analysis suggests a 24%-increased risk of death from COVID-19 in patients with MS. These findings must be interpreted with caution, mainly because of the difficulties in COVID-19 case detection (especially in the first pandemic wave) and heterogeneity of the analyzed cohorts. Confirmation in larger population-based studies is warranted.","Prosperini, Luca; Tortorella, Carla; Haggiag, Shalom; Ruggieri, Serena; Galgani, Simonetta; Gasperini, Claudio",J Neurol,65,6

Ongoing military conflict has resulted in many displaced persons and veterans and their families with high burdens of mental health problems. Lack of community-based services and poor uptake of existing psychiatric services led to the current trial to determine the effectiveness of the common elements treatment approach (CETA) on anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) among conflict affected adults in Ukraine. METHODS: We conducted a three-armed randomized-controlled trial of CETA delivered in its standard form (8–12 sessions), a brief form (five-sessions), and a wait-control condition. Eligible participants were displaced adults, army veterans and their adult family members with elevated depression and/or PTS and impaired functioning. Treatment was delivered by community-based providers trained in both standard and brief CETA. Outcome data were collected monthly. RESULTS: There were 302 trial participants (n = 117 brief CETA, n = 129 standard CETA, n = 56 wait-controls). Compared with wait-controls, participants in standard and brief CETA experienced clinically and statistically significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and PTS and dysfunction (effect sizes d = 0.46–1.0–6). Comparing those who received standard CETA with brief CETA, the former reported fewer symptoms and less dysfunction with small-to-medium effect sized (d = 0.20–0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Standard CETA is more effective than brief CETA, but brief CETA also had significant effects compared with wait-controls. Given demonstrated effectiveness, CETA could be scaled up as an effective community-based approach.","Bogdanov, Sergiy; Augustinavicius, Jura; Bass, Judith K.; Metz, Kristie; Skavenski, Stephanie; Singh, Namrita S.; Moore, Quincy; Haroz, Emily E.; Kane, Jeremy; Doty, Ben; Murray, Laura; Bolton, Paul",Glob Ment Health (Camb),65,16

Effective public health system with a workforce to investigate outbreaks can reduce disease impact on livelihoods and economic development. Building effective public health partnerships is critical for sustainability of such a system. Uganda has made significant progress in responding to emergencies during the past quarter century, but its public health workforce is still inadequate in number and competency. Objectives: To reinforce implementation of priority public health programs in Uganda and cultivate core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations. Methods: To develop a competent workforce to manage epidemics and improve disease surveillance, Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) established an advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program, called Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP); closely modelled after the US CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service. PHFP is a 2-year, full-time, non-degree granting program targeting mid-career public health professionals. Fellows spend 85% of their field time in MoH placements learning through service delivery and gaining competencies in major domains. Results: During 2015–2018, PHFP enrolled 41 fellows, and graduated 30. Fellows were placed in 19 priority areas at MoH and completed 235 projects (91 outbreaks, 12 refugee assessments, 50 surveillance, and 60 epidemiologic studies, 3 cost analysis and 18 quality improvement); made 194 conference presentations; prepared 63 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications (27 published as of December 2018); produced MoH bulletins, and developed three case studies. Projects have resulted in public health interventions with improvements in surveillance systems and disease control. Conclusion: During the 4 years of existence, PHFP has contributed greatly to improving real-time disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities. Enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and integration of PHFP within MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda.","Ario, Alex Riolexus; Bulage, Lilian; Kadobera, Daniel; Kwesiga, Benon; Kabwama, Steven N.; Tusiime, Patrick; Wanyenze, Rhoda K.",Glob Health Action,65,1

An anonymised and validated e-survey featuring 30 questions was circulated among rheumatologists and other specialists over social media to understand preferences while choosing target journals, publishing standards, commercial editing services, preprint archiving, social media and alternative publication activities. Of 108 respondents, a significant proportion were clinicians (68%), researchers (60%) and educators (47%), with median 23 publications and 15 peer-review accomplishments. The respondents were mainly rheumatologists from India, Ukraine and Turkey. While choosing target journals, relevance to their field (69%), PubMed Central archiving (61%) and free publishing (59%) were the major factors. Thirty-nine surveyees (36%) claimed that they often targeted local journals for publishing their research. However, only 18 (17%) perceived their local society journals as trustworthy. Occasional publication in the so-called predatory journals (5, 5%) was reported and obtaining support from commercial editing agencies to improve English and data presentation was not uncommon (23, 21%).

Reaching the exponential peak of cases, flattening the curve, and treating all of the active cases are the keys to success in reducing outbreak transmission. The objective of this study was to determine the most effective model for predicting the peak of COVID-19 in Indonesia, using a deterministic model. METHODS: The SEI2RS model considers five strategies for control, namely: large-scale social restriction (u(1)), contact tracing (u(2)), mass testing (u(3)), case detection and treatment (u(4)), and the wearing of face masks (u(5)). Three scenarios were developed, each differentiated by the controls. The model used April 10, 2020, and December 31, 2020, as the initial and final times. RESULTS: The simulation results indicated that the peak of COVID-19 cases for scenarios 1, 2, and 3 occur on the 59th day with 33,151 cases, on the 38th day with 37,908 cases, and on the 40th day with 39,305 cases. For all of the scenarios, the decline phase shows a slow downward slope and about 8000 cases of COVID-19 still active by the end of 2020. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that scenario 2, which consists of large-scale social restriction (u(1)), contact tracing (u(2)), case detection and treatment (u(4)), and the wearing of face masks (u(5)), is the most rational scenario to control COVID-19 spreading in Indonesia.","Sasmita, Novi Reandy; Ikhwan, Muhammad; Suyanto, Suyanto; Chongsuvivatwong, Virasakdi",Glob Health Res Policy,65,1

Though COVID-19’s effects on many specific cancers has previously been described, there has been little reported on its effects on pts with MDS. Methods: We prospectively reviewed the records of all pts seen in the MDS clinic of a large New York City tertiary academic medical center between March 12 and May 07 2020. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive (+) result on a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab, or detectable COVID-19 antibodies. COVID-19 antibodies were determined via an IgG assay developed at Mount Sinai with the ability to detect antibody titers to a dilution of 1:2880. Initially, only symptomatic pts were screened due to limited testing availability. However, after April 7, all clinic pts were screened by PCR. Results: Among 85 pts seen in the clinic, 23 were found to have COVID-19 (27.1%). The median age of all pts was 72 years (range 20-90); racial breakdown included 58.8% Caucasian, 12.9% Hispanic, 10.6% African-American, 7.1% Asian, and 10.6% other. Of note, 65.2% of COVID-19+ pts were Caucasian, 13.0% Hispanic, and 17.4% other. The most common diagnoses were MDS (n=61), AML (n=10), multiple myeloma (MM) (n=9), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL) (n=6), ALL (n=6), MPN (n=4), NHL (n=3), and CML (n=2). Forty-two of the MDS patients had no other malignancies; co-diagnoses among the remaining MDS patients included MM (n=8), LGL (n=6), & T-cell dyscrasias (n=5). Of the 23 COVID-19+ pts, 11 (47.8%) were hospitalized and 4 (17.4%) were asymptomatic. Common symptoms were URI symptoms (15) and fever (14). ARDS and pneumonia occurred in 4 pts. The most common treatments were hydroxychloroquine (n=4), steroids (n=3), and azithromycin (n=2). Eighteen of the 23 + pts (78.3%) had MDS; the others included pts with MPN, APL, ALL, AML, or NHL. Among the COVID-19+ MDS pts, IPSS-R was very low (n=5), low (n=3), intermediate (n=1), high (n=2), and very high risk (n=5) in evaluable patients. MDS directed treatment included azacitidine (8) (2 with venetoclax), erythropoietin stimulating agents (3), best-supportive care (4), intravenous immunoglobulin (3), and lenalidomide (1). Disease status at diagnosis was stable disease (SD; n=9), hematologic improvement (HI; n=6), progressive disease (PD; n=1), and complete response (CR; n=1). The median number of co-morbidities per pt was 2. Major co-morbidities included cardiac disease (n=5), hypertension (n=5), diabetes (n=5), and dementia (n=2). COVID-19+ pts remained PCR+ for a range of 14-42 days in those with available serial testing (n=8). Of the PCR+ pts, 14 were tested for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies; 12 were +, with a range of titers from <1:80 to 1:2880. Three patients were PCR negative at least once but tested antibody positive. Nine of 23 (39%) COVID-19+ pts died; mortality among MDS patients included 6/18 (33%) COVID-19+ and 6/61 (9.8%) from the overall cohort. Among the 9 who died, the median number of co-morbidities was 3 and the median age was 75 years-old. Disease status in these patients was SD (2), CR (1), HI (1), and PD (1). IPSS-R was very high (n=4), high (n=1), and intermediate (n=1) in the MDS pts who died. Conclusions: This represents the first reported large case series regarding the risks of developing COVID-19 and its effects at an MDS clinic in the initial US epicenter of the pandemic. Overall, 27.1% of the pt population was diagnosed with COVID-19; 39.1% of these pts died, or 10.6% of the overall cohort. A retrospective study across the US reported a 16% mortality rate of COVID-19 in cancer pts (Dr Rivera et al, 2020). The mortality rate reported here is higher, but with a smaller sample size. The clinical significance of persistently + PCR tests up to 6 weeks is unclear. COVID-19 antibodies were found in 85.7% of COVID-19 PCR+ pts tested, showing MDS pts can mount a humoral response. Likely factors contributing to the high mortality of MDS pts were co-morbidities and age. The majority of pts recovered and have resumed MDS directed therapy. Protecting MDS pts from COVID-19 infection must be a primary overall therapeutic approach until there are more effective COVID-19 treatment strategies.

Additionally, recent studies reported improved respiratory activity after intravenous administration of MSCs into patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggesting their role as anti-viral therapy. Severe COVID-19 patients usually progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct, coagulation dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and even death in a short period after onset. Currently, there is still a lack of clinically effective drugs for such patients. The high secretory activity, the immune-modulatory effect, and the homing ability make MSCs and in particular AD-MSCs both a potential tool for the anti-viral drug-delivery in the virus microenvironment and potential cellular therapy. AD-MSCs as the most important exponent of MSCs are expected to reduce the risk of complications and death of patients due to their strong anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory capabilities, which can improve microenvironment, promote neovascularization and enhance tissue repair capabilities. In this literature review, the role of regenerative strategies through MSCs, AD-MSCs, and adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNAs (A-SE-miRs) as a potential antiviral therapy was reported, comparing the results found with current research progress on drugs and vaccines in COVID-19 disease.","Gentile, Pietro; Sterodimas, Aris; Pizzicannella, Jacopo; Calabrese, Claudio; Garcovich, Simone",Aging Dis,65,16

Despite rapid ongoing progress in vaccinology, there remain many obstacles to the development and deployment of novel or improved vaccines; these include the underlying science of how to induce and sustain appropriate protective immune responses as well as bureaucratic, logistic and socio‐political hurdles. The failure to distribute and administer existing vaccines to at‐risk communities continues to account for a large proportion of infant mortality worldwide: almost 20 million children do not have access to basic vaccines and several million still die each year as a result. While emerging epidemic or pandemic diseases pose a significant threat to global health and prosperity, there are many infectious diseases which provide a continuous or cyclical burden on healthcare systems which also need to be addressed. Gaps in knowledge of the human immune system stand in the way of developing technologies to overcome individual and pathogenic variation. The challenges in tackling infectious disease and directions that the field of preventive medicine may take to improve the current picture of global health are the focus of this review.","Sheerin, Dylan; Openshaw, Peter JM; Pollard, Andrew J",Eur J Immunol,65,29

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the public in Kuwait, to understand their attitudes towards vaccines in general, and to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 4147 adults aged ≥ 18 years. The snowball sampling strategy was used for data collection through social media and e-mails. A total of 3061 (73.8%) respondents indicated that they were vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 infection, while 1086 (26.2%) expressed their vaccine hesitancy. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the concerns about the vaccine’s possible side effects, its rushed development, and its efficacy in preventing the infection. Over half (57.2%) of respondents expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitude towards vaccines in general. On the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the findings revealed that vaccine hesitancy was significantly more prevalent among respondents aged 30–64 years; females; married or divorced; residents of Hawalli, Al-Farwaniyah, Al-Jahra, and Mubarak Al-Kabeer; had intermediate monthly average income; non-smokers; not feeling worried about catching the infection; do not know whether any of their family members have been infected or died because of COVID-19 infection; do not have a large extent of confidence in the Kuwait health system’s ability to handle the pandemic; did not receive influenza vaccine during the last year; refused or elected to forego a doctor-recommended vaccine; did not receive adequate information from the public health authorities/healthcare providers about the COVID-19 vaccines; none of their first-degree family members received or were intending to receive the vaccine; and expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitudes towards vaccines in general. The present findings provide a steer as to the groups that most need to be reached to increase the rates of vaccine uptake.","Alibrahim, Jumana; Awad, Abdelmoneim",Int J Environ Res Public Health,65,21

It has infected more than 3.7 million people with a mortality rate of around 7%. Although the causative virus, the SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory pathogen, recent observational studies have documented a high rate of neurological complications associated with COVID-19. We searched PubMed databases from December 01, 2019 to June 9, 2020 for articles published on “COVID 19” OR “coronavirus” with targeted search words. We also search preprint servers for neurological complications of COVID-19. Neurological manifestations are seen in around 36%–45% of patients with COVID-19 and can involve almost every part of the central nervous system (CNS) from the hemispheres, cranial or peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and muscle. The mechanisms vary from direct viral invasion of the CNS, to a dysregulated host immune response to molecular mimicry to multiorgan dysfunction. In many patients, neurological manifestations preceded other systemic features or the diagnosis of COVID-19. Sick patients with COVID-19 will require ICU care and many patients may present first to the neurocritical care ICU and receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 later. Hence, it is important for all healthcare personnel to be aware of the myriad neurological manifestations of this infection, so as to initiate appropriate infection control practices and refine investigation and treatment protocols.","Maramattom, Boby Varkey; Bhattacharjee, Siddharth",Ann Indian Acad Neurol,65,30

Telemedicine has emerged as an important tool to deliver care during these situations. Patients receiving Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) require structured monitoring which has posed a challenge during this pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of Virtual anticoagulation clinic (VAC), a Telehealth model on the quality of anticoagulation, adverse events, and patient satisfaction vis-a-vis standard Anticoagulation clinic (ACC) care. Materials and methods: A bidirectional cohort study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, JSS Hospital, Mysore. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients in the VAC and 274 patients in the ACC fulfilling inclusion criteria were the subjects of the study. Telehealth tools like WhatsApp and telephone were used. Time in therapeutic range (TTR), Percentage of International normalized ratio in range (PINRR), and adverse events were analyzed and compared between the VAC group and the ACC group, between pre-COVID and COVID ACC groups, and between the VAC group and the same pre-COVID cohort. Patient satisfaction was assessed by a questionnaire at the end of 8 months. Descriptive statistics were used for the patient characteristics and inferential statistics for the comparisons between pre-VAC and VAC care. Results: The mean TTR was 75.4 ± 8.9% and 71.2 ± 13.4% in the VAC group and ACC group, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean PINRR was 66.7 ± 9.4% and 62.4 ± 10.9% in the VAC group and ACC group respectively, (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in TTR between the VAC group and the same pre-COVID cohort. The TTR differential between the pre-COVID and COVID ACC groups was significant. In either group, no major adverse events were seen. The most common tools used for data exchange were WhatsApp (83%) and SMS (17%). Seventy-four percent of patients were extremely satisfied with the overall VAC care. Conclusions: Virtual anticoagulation clinic, a telehealth model can be used as an alternative option to deliver uninterrupted anticoagulation care during pandemic times.","Shambu, Sunil Kumar; B, Shyam Prasad Shetty; Gona, Oliver Joel; Desai, Nagaraj; B, Madhu; Madhan, Ramesh; V, Revanth",Front Cardiovasc Med,65,17

We investigated the effects of school reopening and easing of social distancing restrictions on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Israel, between March-July 2020. METHODS: We examined the nationwide agewise weekly incidence, prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, their positivity, COVID-19 hospitalizations and associated mortality. Temporal differences in these parameters following school reopening, school ending, and following easing of restrictions such as permission of large scale gatherings, were examined. RESULTS: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections gradually increased following school reopening in all age groups, with a significantly higher increase in adults compared to children. Higher relative ratios (RRs) of sample positivity rates 21-27 days following school reopening relative to positivity rates prior to openings were found for the age groups 40-59 (RR: 4.72, 95% CI: 3.26 - 6.83) and 20-39 years (RR: 3.37 [2.51 - 4.53]), but not for children aged 0-9 (RR: 1.46 [0.85 - 2.51]) and 10-19 years (RR: 0.93 [0.65 - 1.34]). No increase was observed in COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths following school reopening. In contrast, permission of large-scale gatherings was accompanied by increases in incidence and positivity rates of samples for all age groups, and increased hospitalizations and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support a major role of school reopening in the resurgence of the COVID-19 curve in Israel. Easing restrictions on large scale gatherings was the major influence on this resurgence.","Somekh, Ido; Shohat, Tamy; Boker, Lital Keinan; Simões, Eric A F; Somekh, Eli",Clin Infect Dis,65,24

Host immune response is a key factor determining disease severity of influenza infection, presenting an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for treatments. Among the multiple signal transduction pathways regulating the host immune activation and function in response to IAV infections, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are important signalling axes, downstream of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), activated by IAVs that regulate various cellular processes in immune cells of both innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, aberrant MAPK activation underpins overexuberant production of inflammatory mediators, promoting the development of the “cytokine storm”, a characteristic of severe respiratory viral diseases. Therefore, elucidation of the regulatory roles of MAPK in immune responses against IAVs is not only essential for understanding the pathogenesis of severe influenza, but also critical for developing MAPK-dependent therapies for treatment of respiratory viral diseases. In this review, we will summarise the current understanding of MAPK functions in both innate and adaptive immune response against IAVs and discuss their contributions towards the cytokine storm caused by highly pathogenic influenza viruses.","Yu, Jiabo; Sun, Xiang; Goie, Jian Yi Gerald; Zhang, Yongliang",Microorganisms,65,14

In KTRs, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) of different causes is known to be associated with a decreased graft survival: direct viral infection and local inflammation may potentially lead to a premature loss of graft function and to an increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients. To evaluate prevalence, stage, causes of AKI and mortality in KTRs with a positive pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in our transplant center located in a 500-bed University Hospital. METHOD: In March-June 2020, we evaluated in 25 COVID-19 KTRs demographic and transplant characteristics, comorbidities, immunosuppressive therapies (IT). Patients were screened for type of symptoms, management of IT, complications and outcome. AKI was graded according to 2012 KDIGO guidelines and causes were investigated basing on both clinical and laboratory variables. AKI prevalence in KTRs was compared to that observed in the whole hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: During the first wave of pandemic, a total of 945 patients were admitted to our hospital with a reported AKI prevalence of 37%. AKI classified using 2012 KDIGO guidelines associated with an increased mortality risk in the whole population. In this setting, we observed that 25 KTRs followed-up in our University Hospital had a positive molecular diagnosis for COVID-19: median age was 58 years and 80% were males. Considering the most frequent comorbidities, 100% of KTRs had hypertension and 7/25 (29%) had diabetes. Clinical symptoms at enrollment were fever (95%), cough (47%), dyspnea (30%). Regarding IT, 100% of patients were taking CNI, 64% antimetabolite agents and 76% steroids. Of note, 19/25 patients (76%) were hospitalized and 6/19 (31.5%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Mean length of hospital stay was 23 days. At admission, all KTRs stopped MMF and increased steroid doses, concomitantly decreasing CNI levels. AKI occurred in 60% of KTRs (12/25), AKI KDIGO grading as follow: stage 1 4/12 (33.3%), stage 2 3/12 (25%), stage 3 5/12 (41.7%); development favored by low eGFR/increased serum creatinine (mean serum creatinine 2.06 mg/dl): 4/25 (16%) required hemodialysis and the most frequent cause of AKI was sepsis or septic shock. Overall mortality in KTRs was 37,5% (9/25): of note, 88% (8/9) of patients with a worse outcome had developed AKI. CONCLUSION: AKI prevalence was significantly higher in KTRs than in non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. AKI development was associated with an increased risk of mortality: of note, mortality rate in KTRs was significantly higher than that observed in the non-transplanted patients. COVID-19 lead to a difficult management of IT, in particular for elevated tacrolimus levels due to associated antiviral and antibiotic therapies. COVID-19-associated AKI in KTRs may lead to an increased risk of rejection and premature loss of graft function with the need of skilled nephrological follow-up.","Rosso, Greta; Guglielmetti, Gabriele; Morosini, Umberto; Quaglia, Marco; Merlotti, Guido; Colombatto, Andrea; Cantaluppi, Vincenzo",Nephrol Dial Transplant,65,29

Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem service into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases, and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both; (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the ‘biodiversity crisis’. This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations.","Everard, Mark; Johnston, Paul; Santillo, David; Staddon, Chad",Environ Sci Policy,65,24

Although an oxidative stress imbalance occurs in COVID-19 patients, the contributions of thiol/disulphide homeostasis and nitric oxide (NO) generation to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have been poorly identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of antiviral drug therapy on the serum dynamics of thiol/disulphide homeostasis and NO levels in COVID-19 patients. A total of 50 adult patients with COVID-19 and 43 sex-matched healthy control subjects were enrolled in this prospective study. Venous blood samples were collected immediately on admission to the hospital within 24 h after the diagnosis (pre-treatment) and at the 15th day of drug therapy (post-treatment). Serum native thiol and total thiol levels were measured, and the amounts of dynamic disulphide bonds and related ratios were calculated. The average pre-treatment total and native thiol levels were significantly lower than the post-treatment values (P < 0.001 for all). We observed no significant changes in disulphide levels or disulphide/total thiol, disulphide/native thiol, or native thiol/total thiol ratios between pre- and post-treatments. There was also a significant increase in serum NO levels in the pre-treatment values when compared to control (P < 0.001) and post-treatment measurements (P < 0.01). Our results strongly suggest that thiol/disulphide homeostasis and nitrosative stress can contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. This study was the first to show that antiviral drug therapy can prevent the depletion in serum thiol levels and decrease serum NO levels in COVID-19 patients.","Mete, Ayşe Özlem; Koçak, Kübra; Saracaloglu, Ahmet; Demiryürek, Seniz; Altınbaş, Özgür; Demiryürek, Abdullah T.",Eur J Pharmacol,65,1

Design, setting, participants: Deidentified obstetric and neonatal data were extracted from the Mater Mothers electronic healthcare records database. This is a supra-regional tertiary perinatal centre. Main outcome measures: Logistic regressions were used to examine preterm birth rates during the beginning of COVID-19 restrictions (16 March-17 April; early; 6,955 births) and during the strictest part of COVID-19 restrictions (30 March-1 May; late; 6,953 births), according to gestational age subgroups and birth onset (planned or spontaneous). We adjusted for multiple covariates, including maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, parity, socioeconomic status, maternal asthma, diabetes mellitus and/or hypertensive disorder. Stillbirth rates were also examined (16 March-1 May). Results: A reduction in planned moderate/late preterm births was observed primarily during the early restriction period compared with the same calendar weeks in the previous seven years (29 versus an average of 64 per 1,000 births; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.71). There was no effect on extremely or very preterm infants, spontaneous preterm births, or stillbirth rates. Rolling averages from January to June revealed a two-week non-significant spike in spontaneous preterm births from late-April to early-May, 2020. Conclusions: Planned births for moderate/late preterm infants more than halved during early COVID-19 mitigation measures.

Here, we investigate the efficacy of imported case detection considering quarantine length and different testing measures for travellers on arrival. METHODS: We examine eight broad border control strategies from utilizing quarantine alone, pre-testing, entry and exit testing, and testing during quarantine. In comparing the efficacy of these strategies, we calculate the probability of detecting travellers who have been infected up to 2 weeks pre-departure according to their estimated incubation and infectious period. We estimate the number of undetected infected travellers permitted entry for these strategies across a prevalence range of 0.1–2% per million travellers. RESULTS: At 14-day quarantine, on average 2.2% (range: 0.5–8.2%) of imported infections are missed across the strategies, leading to 22 (5–82) imported cases at 0.1% prevalence per million travellers, increasing up to 430 (106–1641) at 2%. The strategy utilizing exit testing results in 3.9% (3.1–4.9%) of imported cases being missed at 7-day quarantine, down to 0.4% (0.3–0.7%) at 21-day quarantine, and the introduction of daily testing, as the most risk averse strategy, reduces the proportion further to 2.5–4.2% at day 7 and 0.1–0.2% at day 21 dependent on the tests used. Rapid antigen testing every 3 days in quarantine leads to 3% being missed at 7 days and 0.7% at 14 days, which is comparable to PCR testing with a 24-hour turnaround. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory testing, at a minimal of pre-testing and on arrival, is strongly recommended where the length of quarantining should then be determined by the destination country’s level of risk averseness, pandemic preparedness and origin of travellers. Repeated testing during quarantining should also be utilized to mitigate case importation risk and reduce the quarantining duration required.","Dickens, Borame L; Koo, Joel R; Lim, Jue Tao; Park, Minah; Sun, Haoyang; Sun, Yinxiaohe; Zeng, Zitong; Quaye, Sharon Esi Duoduwa; Clapham, Hannah E; Wee, Hwee Lin; Cook, Alex R",J Travel Med,65,28

A semi-structured, pretested, and self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Multivariable logistic-regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and its p-value of ≤0.05 was used to declare significant association. RESULTS: The proportion of the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was 69.3% (95% CI: 65, 74). Being knowledgeable (AOR: 2.43, CI: 1.57, 3.77), being a health science student (AOR: 2.25, CI: 1.43, 3.54), and being in a family practicing COVID-19 prevention (AOR: 1.73, CI: 1.06, 2.81) were found to be factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION: Though, this study found a 69.3% acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable perceived barriers and related factors in vaccine acceptance hesitancy. Thus, health education and communication regarding the vaccine are very crucial to alleviate the identified barriers.","Taye, Birhan Tsegaw; Amogne, Fetene Kasahun; Demisse, Tesfanesh Lemma; Zerihun, Mulualem Silesh; Kitaw, Tebabere Moltot; Tiguh, Agumas Eskezia; Mihret, Muhabaw Shumye; Kebede, Azmeraw Ambachew",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,65,1

Based on the potent immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a growing number of trials are ongoing. This prompted us to carry out a thorough immunological study in a patient treated with umbilical cord-derived MSCs and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for COVID-19-related pneumonia. The exploratory analyses were assessed on both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluid lavage samples at baseline and after cellular infusion by means of single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, ELISA, and functional assays. Remarkably, a normalization of circulating T lymphocytes count paralleled by a reduction of inflammatory myeloid cells, and a decrease in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mostly of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, were observed. In addition, a drop of plasma levels of those chemokines essential for neutrophil recruitment became evident that paralleled the decrease of lung-infiltrating inflammatory neutrophils. Finally, circulating monocytes and low-density gradient neutrophils acquired immunosuppressive function. This scenario was accompanied by an amelioration of respiratory, renal, inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic indexes. Our results provide the first immunological data possibly related to the use of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in severe COVID-19 context.

Working from home (WFH) has emerged as a growing trend in the post-pandemic era. The research question was: Are our homes ready for teleworking? To respond, a national prospective mixed approach was launched for Spanish households during the spring 2020 lockdown, using two online questionnaires, one quantitative and the other qualitative. Through a survey, photographs, and narratives, the study evaluates the perceived adequacy of telework spaces and their specific characteristics, the availability of digital resources and the internet. A total of 1800 surveys and over 200 images and texts related to telework environments were obtained. The results suggest that the adequacy of these spaces was insufficient for more than a quarter of the homes. Also, strong relations between the perceived workspace adequacy and a social status or stability of homes were shown and validated, despite other sociodemographic features, the home composition or habitat were not related. Some other variables statistically significant were occupation regime, type and surface of dwellings; their indoor environmental quality; the availability of exclusive spaces for teleworking; quality of digital resources; and the specific space features. The analysis was completed with qualitative insights through photos and texts.

Lung ultrasound imaging, chest X-ray, and CT scan showed left pleural effusion and atelectasis of the neighboring lung parenchyma. RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pleural fluid and cytology showed mesothelial cells with large and multiple nuclei, consistent with a cytopathic effect of the virus. This is one of few reports describing detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the pleural fluid and to the best of our knowledge, is the first to document the simultaneous presence of a direct cytopathic effect of the virus on mesothelial cells in a kidney transplant patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. The pleura proved to be a site of viral replication where signs of a direct pathological effect of the virus on cells can be observed, as we report here.

However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560–0.056 TCID(50)/ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2–37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560–5.6 TCID(50)/ml (Ct 24.2–31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56–0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct values 35.3 –>45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.","Thomas, Joseph T.; Chen, Qi; Gauger, Phillip C.; Giménez-Lirola, Luis G.; Sinha, Avanti; Harmon, Karen M.; Madson, Darin M.; Burrough, Eric R.; Magstadt, Drew R.; Salzbrenner, Holly M.; Welch, Michael W.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J.; Zhang, Jianqiang",PLoS One,65,33

The Assioma platform was created for tablets, smartphones and PCs, to support data collection and clinical workflow, to promote constant communication between patients, caregivers and clinicians, and to promote active family involvement in day hospital (DH) procedures. Through the Assioma application for tablets, caregivers filled out an anamnestic questionnaire and explored contents on the DH procedures and neurodevelopmental conditions. The application for smartphones included an agenda function for the DH pathways. Through the application for desktops, clinicians could export anamnestic information in text and Excel formats, send real-time notifications, and push relative contents to families’ account. We tested the usability and satisfaction of the Assioma platform in a group of children, caregivers (N = 24) and clinicians (N = 6). Both families and clinicians gave high scores to almost all usability items. The overall satisfaction reached the highest levels at 50% satisfied for families and at 33% for clinicians. Our results indicate that the Assioma platform has the potential to optimize clinical pathways, increasing compliance and clinical efficiency, and to reduce in-person contacts supporting social distancing for clinical pathways, a crucial need during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fucà, Elisa; Costanzo, Floriana; Bonutto, Dimitri; Moretti, Annarita; Fini, Andrea; Ferraiuolo, Alberto; Vicari, Stefano; Tozzi, Alberto Eugenio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,65,24

CDC used data from IQVIA's Ambulatory Electronic Medical Records database to compare longitudinal trends in body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) among a cohort of 432,302 persons aged 2-19 years before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 1, 2018-February 29, 2020 and March 1, 2020-November 30, 2020, respectively). Between the prepandemic and pandemic periods, the rate of BMI increase approximately doubled, from 0.052 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.051-0.052 to 0.100 (95% CI = 0.098-0.101) kg/m2/month (ratio = 1.93 [95% CI = 1.90-1.96]). Persons aged 2-19 years with overweight or obesity during the prepandemic period experienced significantly higher rates of BMI increase during the pandemic period than did those with healthy weight. These findings underscore the importance of efforts to prevent excess weight gain during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during future public health emergencies, including increased access to efforts that promote healthy behaviors. These efforts could include screening by health care providers for BMI, food security, and social determinants of health, increased access to evidence-based pediatric weight management programs and food assistance resources, and state, community, and school resources to facilitate healthy eating, physical activity, and chronic disease prevention.","Lange, Samantha J.; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Freedman, David S.; Kraus, Emily M.; Porter, Renee; Blanck, Heidi M.; Goodman, Alyson B.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,65,24

Materials & Methods: We performed a retrospective single-centre cohort study of patients undergoing robotic surgery in the initial 2-months period of COVID-19 focusing on safety. Patients’ COVID-19 infection status was assessed by telephone follow-up at a minimum of 14 days (median: 48) after robotic surgery.

After this potentially contagious robotic surgery, 8 healthcare workers with direct patient contact had no COVID-19 infection after 2 weeks and follow-up with each 3 nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: Early clinical experience of robotic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic on 61 patients shows that robotic surgery can be safely performed for both patients and healthcare workers.

During January-April, COVID-19 incidence was substantially higher among most racial and ethnic minority groups compared with that among non-Hispanic White (White) persons (rate ratio [RR] range = 1.09-4.62). During May-August, the RR increased from 2.49 to 4.57 among non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NH/PI) persons but decreased among other racial and ethnic minority groups (RR range = 0.52-2.82). Decreases in disparities were observed during September-December (RR range = 0.37-1.69); these decreases were largely because of a greater increase in incidence among White persons, rather than a decline in incidence among racial and ethnic minority groups. NH/PI, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons experienced the largest persistent disparities over the entire period. Ensuring equitable and timely access to preventive measures, including testing, safe work and education settings, and vaccination when eligible is important to address racial/ethnic disparities.","Van Dyke, Miriam E.; Mendoza, Maria C.B.; Li, Wen; Parker, Erin M.; Belay, Brook; Davis, Elizabeth M.; Quint, Joshua J.; Penman-Aguilar, Ana; Clarke, Kristie E.N.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,65,20

Despite of this, no vaccine or approved drug is available to eradicate the virus. In this manuscript, we present an alternative study area that may contribute to development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. We analyzed sixty SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify regions that could work as virus-encoded miRNA seed sponges and potentially bind to human miRNA seed sites and prevent interaction with their native targets thereby relieving native miRNA suppression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by disrupting translation. MiRNAs are key players in variety of biological processes that regulate differentiation, development and activation of immune cells in both innate and adaptive immunity. We find 34 miRNAs for positive-sense viral RNA and 45 miRNAs for negative-sense that can strongly bind to certain key SARS-CoV-2 genes. The disruption and dysfunction of miRNAs may perturb the immune response and stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines altering the cellular response to viral infection. Previous studies demonstrate that miRNAs have the potential to be used as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Therefore, its discovery and validation are essential for improving the diagnosis of infection and clinical monitoring in COVID-19.","Guterres, Alexandro; de Azeredo Lima, Carlos Henrique; Miranda, Renan Lyra; Gadelha, Mônica Roberto",Infect Genet Evol,65,17

The aim of our study was to explore the health, social and psychological impact on healthcare workers (HCWs) who have recovered from active COVID-19 illness and highlight their needs post-recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a web-based survey study. A total of 163 eligible consenting HCWs participated in this survey. The Institutional Ethical Committee approval was obtained before study recruitment and the study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India. Each participant responded to 25 questions. RESULTS: Among those participated, 51% were doctors, 32% were nurses and others were allied health professionals and students. About 82% had mild COVID-19 illness and 40% required hospitalisation for COVID-19 treatment. In the post-recovery period, 66% experienced health issues and fatigue on mild exertion was the most common symptom (42.94%). It was followed by anosmia and ageusia (21.47%), headache and myalgia (15.34%) and breathlessness (8.59%). About 82% HCW felt the need for a post-COVID-19 recovery health care unit. Potential risk of infecting family members was the most common concern (53.46%) followed by the fear of contracting the virus again (46.54%). About 35% of HCW experienced the fear of developing post-COVID-19 complications. About 78% of HCW did not report any psychological concerns, but one-third were stressed due to the financial impact. CONCLUSION: Post-COVID-19 syndrome impacts all domains of quality of life. Fatigue, loss of taste and smell, headache, myalgia and breathlessness continue to persist beyond recovery of active illness. Most of the HCWs emphasised the need to set up post-COVID-19 care units. The fear of contracting the virus again and financial drain due to hospital expenses continued to distress HCWs.","Rao, Shwethapriya; Amara, Vedaghosh; Chaudhuri, Souvik; Rao, Bhamini Krishna; Todur, Pratibha",Indian J Palliat Care,65,1

While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women. Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020). Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. Conclusion: Pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ayed, A.; Embaireeg, A.; Benawadth, A.; Al-Fouzan, W.; Hammoud, M.; Alhathal, M.; Alzaydai, A.; Ayed, M.",,65,24

Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.","Payne, H.

This study reveals that S100A9-deficient neutrophils produce higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide in response to Staphylococcus aureus and, as a result, form neutrophil extracellular traps (suicidal NETosis). Increased suicidal NETosis does not improve neutrophil killing of S. aureus in isolation but augments macrophage killing. NET formation enhances antibacterial activity by increasing phagocytosis by macrophages and by transferring neutrophil-specific antimicrobial peptides to them. Similar results were observed in response to other phylogenetically distinct bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, implicating this as an immune defense mechanism that broadly enhances antibacterial activity. These results demonstrate that achieving maximal bactericidal activity through NET formation requires macrophages and that accelerated and more robust suicidal NETosis makes neutrophils adept at increasing antibacterial activity, especially when A9 deficient.","Monteith, Andrew J.; Miller, Jeanette M.; Maxwell, C.

Here we describe the pathologic features of early lung involvement by Covid-19 in a surgical sample resected for carcinoma from a patient who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after surgery. The main histologic findings observed were pneumocyte damage, alveolar hemorrhages with clustering of macrophages, prominent and diffuse neutrophilic margination within septal vessels, and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, mainly represented by CD8+ T lymphocytes. These features are similar to those previously described in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subtle histologic changes suggestive pulmonary involvement by Covid-19 may be accidentally encountered in routine pathology practice, especially when extensive sampling is performed for histology. These findings should be carefully interpreted in light of the clinical context of the patient and could prompt a pharyngeal swab PCR test to rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients.","Pernazza, Angelina; Mancini, Massimiliano; Rullo, Emma; Bassi, Massimiliano; De Giacomo, Tiziano; Rocca, Carlo Della; d’Amati, Giulia",Virchows Arch,65,1

The most promising strategy to control the pandemic was to develop a vaccine. However, vaccination hesitancy is a major threat to world public health. Understanding the reasons behind this hesitancy might help in developing encouragement strategies. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. A total of 1599 responses were received; the overall vaccine acceptancy was 79.2%. Age, sex, and nationality of participants significantly predicted the vaccination status. A significantly higher proportion of participants, who reported being vaccinated, or intended to receive the vaccine, stated that the COVID-19 infection is dangerous, or varies from person to person; the vaccine is safe, and think there is a definite need for the vaccine (p < 0.001). The major encouragement factors to receive the vaccine were either confidence in the government decisions (54.8%), or the feeling of responsibility to stop the pandemic (48.7%), whereas the main discouraging factors were concerns about the insufficient clinical trials (11.4%), or the undiscovered side effects (11%).

People with knee OA who are inactive often believe that physical activity is dangerous, fearing that it will further damage their joint(s). Such unhelpful beliefs can negatively influence physical activity levels. We aim to evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of integrating physiotherapist-delivered pain science education (PSE), an evidence-based conceptual change intervention targeting unhelpful pain beliefs by increasing pain knowledge, with an individualised walking, strengthening, and general education program. METHODS: Two-arm, parallel-design, multicentre randomised controlled trial involving 198 people aged ≥50 years with painful knee OA who do not meet physical activity guideline recommendations or walk regularly for exercise. Both groups receive an individualised physiotherapist-led walking, strengthening, and OA/activity education program via 4x weekly in-person treatment sessions, followed by 4 weeks of at-home activities (weekly check-in via telehealth), with follow-up sessions at 3 months (telehealth) and 5 and 9 months (in-person). The EPIPHA-KNEE group also receives contemporary PSE about OA/pain and activity, embedded into all aspects of the intervention. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are physical activity level (step count; wrist-based accelerometry) and self-reported knee symptoms (WOMAC Total score) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, pain intensity, global rating of change, self-efficacy, pain catastrophising, depression, anxiety, stress, fear of movement, knee awareness, OA/activity conceptualisation, and self-regulated learning ability. Additional measures include adherence, adverse events, blinding success, COVID-19 impact on activity, intention to exercise, treatment expectancy/perceived credibility, implicit movement/environmental bias, implicit motor imagery, two-point discrimination, and pain sensitivity to activity. Cost-utility analysis of the EPIPHA-KNEE intervention will be undertaken, in addition to evaluation of cost-effectiveness in the context of primary trial outcomes. DISCUSSION: We will determine whether the integration of PSE into an individualised OA education, walking, and strengthening program is more effective than receiving the individualised program alone. Findings will inform the development and implementation of future delivery of PSE as part of best practice for people with knee OA.

This variant virus H7A6-2 was selected with a neutralizing mAb recognizing the capsid protein VP-1 of Theiler's virus. Here we characterize the variant virus by ELISA and neutralization assays and by sequencing selected regions of the viral RNA genome and relate the alteration to disease. The variant virus contains one single point mutation within a neutralizing epitope of VP- 1. This nucleotide change lead to an amino acid replacement at amino acid 101 of VP-1, a threonine (wild type) to an isoleucine (variant). Model building based on sequence alignments and the known structure of the related Mengo virus indicates that the altered amino acid is located in an exposed loop on the surface of the virus at the periphery of a site that has been proposed to be the receptor binding site.

METHODS: An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in 5-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15–49 years) and peri-/post-menopausal (> 50 years). RESULTS: The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is higher in women than men (by about + 15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about + 50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are linked to age: pre-adolescent girls and boys had the same risk of infection and fatality rate, while adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same 5-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in peri- and postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years, there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17ß-estradiol influences expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, propensity score matching was performed for the women’s sub-cohort, comparing users vs. non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women > 50 years receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.62] and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15–49 years), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS: As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.

Healthcare workers are one of the risk groups that need to be well protected, due to their strategic role in patient management, presently and in prevention of healthcare needs for future outbreaks. Here, we present the results of the first SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain. METHODS: IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed in serum samples from 7563 healthcare workers of the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. Samples were collected after the first pandemic wave (from May 4th to May 22nd, 2020) and were analyzed by automated chemiluminescence assays. All samples were tested for IgG anti-S1/S2. Participant samples with negative or equivocal results but with analytical signals above the limit of detection and/or previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were also tested for IgG anti-Nucleocapsid. RESULTS: A total of 779 of 7563 (10.3%) healthcare workers were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specific for either S1/S2 or N antigens). No significant differences were observed between those working at primary care or at the reference hospital. Interestingly, among 341 participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 36 (10.55%) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (both S1/S2 and recombinant N antigen). CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the healthcare workers of the North Metropolitan Area of Barcelona was higher than in the general population in the same geographical area.

Several mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have already been detected, and their effect in immune system evasion and enhanced transmission as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality are being investigated. From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa (29.065%) had the highest percentage of unique S proteins. Notably, only North America had 87% (14046) of the total (16143) specific S proteins available in the NCBI database(across all continents). Based on the amino acid frequency distributions in the S protein variants from all the continents, the phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America were significantly different from those of the other five continents. Overtime, the unique variants originating from North America are most likely to spread to the other geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. Hence it is suggested that restriction of international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. It is also further suggested that the efficacy of existing vaccines and future vaccine development must be reviewed with careful scrutiny, and if needed, further re-engineered based on requirements dictated by new emerging S protein variants.","Hassan, Sk.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Household-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: 3063 individuals who participated in the 2017 South African Social Attitudes survey, a nationally representative, in-person survey of the non-institutionalised civilian adult population aged ≥16 years EXPOSURE: ‘In the past 12 months, have you seen advertisements or promotions for e-cigarettes (including e-shisha, e-pipe) on any of the following media: newspapers/magazines, billboards, in the malls or any other source?’ MAIN OUTCOMES: Beliefs and attitudes regarding e-cigarettes. FINDINGS: Participants’ mean age was 37.7 years. Overall, 20.1% reported exposure to e-cigarette advertisements. By age, exposure was most prevalent among those aged 16–19 years (24.6%). Top sources of exposure among those exposed were stores, 40.7%; malls, 30.9%; and television, 32.5%. Of those aware of e-cigarettes, 61.2% believed ‘e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes’; 62.7% believed that ‘e-cigarette advertisements and promotions may make ex-smokers think of starting smoking cigarettes again’; and 59.5% supported the statement that ‘e-cigarette smoking should be banned indoors just as traditional cigarette smoking’. Notably, teens aged 16–19 reported the lowest prevalence (49.0%) of those believing that ‘e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes’, whereas this percentage was highest among those aged 55–64 years (73.2%).

However, the link between serum micronutrient concentrations and HE4 has not yet been clarified. METHODS: A total of 2464 eligible female participants and serum concentrations of nutritional biomarkers were chosen from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2001–2002. For statistical analysis, we used the χ(2) test, multivariable linear regression, and analysis of variance. Adjusted models were used, and the concentrations of serum nutritional biomarkers were divided into quartiles. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 48.07 years. Among twelve micronutrients, five were negatively associated with HE4 in models 1, 2 and 3. Only α-carotene, trans-β-carotene, cis-β-carotene, trans-lycopene and retinol were associated with HE4, with beta coefficients of −0.102, −0.027, −0.506, −0.131 and −0.054, respectively. After performing quartile-based analysis, statistical significance was only found for serum α-carotene, trans-lycopene, and retinol in the three models. In model 3, the beta coefficients [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of the fourth quartiles compared to the first quartiles for α-carotene, trans-lycopene, and retinol were −3.390 (−5.053, −1.727), −4.036 (−5.722, −2.351) and −4.146 (−5.899, −2.393), respectively. Serum concentrations of these three nutritional biomarkers were inversely related to serum HE4 concentration (p trend <0.001). CONCLUSION: HE4 is a useful and novel biomarker that can be used with many diseases, especially ovarian cancer. Three of our selected micronutrients were inversely associated with HE4 concentration. Supplement of micronutrients may reduce the levels of HE4 and the subsequent of ovarian cancer’s risk. Therefore, a formula that correlates HE4 with nutritional biomarkers needs to be established before use in clinical applications.","Lim, Zhu Wei; Chen, Wei Liang",J Inflamm Res,65,28

We summarize the current literature surrounding the virology of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology of COVID-19 in transplant recipients, review the clinical features and complications of COVID-19 in SOTR, and discuss the safety and efficacy of current therapies and candidate vaccines in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite initial suspensions in organ transplantation during early 2020, routine donor testing and de-crowding of hospitals have allowed transplant activity to resume at pre-pandemic rates. COVID-19-associated mortality in SOTR is similar to that of the general population, and lower than that of patients with end-organ disease awaiting transplant. The optimal approach to immunosuppression in SOTR with COVID-19 is unknown and disease severity may influence management decisions. Many vaccines in development are likely to be safe for immunocompromised hosts, though post-marketing investigations will be required to determine the efficacy in the SOTR. SUMMARY: Though there are multiple unique considerations in the care of SOTR with COVID-19, immunosuppression does not appear to have a detrimental impact on overall outcome. Organ transplantation remains a lifesaving intervention and can be safely performed despite a global pandemic.","Heldman, Madeleine R.; Kates, Olivia S.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,65,13

The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in the physiopathology of bowel damage is poorly known. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a useful tool that provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2 invasiveness, replication and dissemination in body cells but information outside the respiratory tract is very limited. We report two cases of severe intestinal complications (intestinal lymphoma and ischaemic colitis) in which the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal tissue was confirmed by TEM. These are the first two cases reported in the literature of persistence of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated by TEM in intestinal tissue after COVID 19 recovery and SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal clearance. CASE PRESENTATION: During the first pandemic peak (1st March–30th April 2020) 932 patients were admitted in Hospital Universitari Mútua Terrassa due to COVID-19, 41 (4.4%) required cross-sectional imaging techniques to assess severe abdominal pain and six of them (0.64%) required surgical resection. SARS-CoV-2 in bowel tissue was demonstrated by TEM in two of these patients. The first case presented as an ileocaecal inflammatory mass which turned to be a B-cell lymphoma. Viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of damaged mucosa. In situ hybridization was negative in tumour cells, thus ruling out an oncogenic role for the virus. SARS-CoV-2 remained in intestinal tissue 6 months after nasopharyngeal clearance, suggesting latent infection. The second patient had a severe ischaemic colitis with perforation and SARS-CoV-2 was also identified in endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Severe intestinal complications associated with COVID-19 are uncommon. SARS-CoV-2 was identified by TEM in two cases, suggesting a causal role in bowel damage.","Martin-Cardona, Albert; Lloreta Trull, Josep; Albero-González, Raquel; Paraira Beser, Marta; Andújar, Xavier; Ruiz-Ramirez, Pablo; Tur-Martínez, Jaume; Ferrer, Carme; De Marcos Izquierdo, José Angel; Pérez-Madrigal, Anna; Goiburú González, Laura; Espinós Perez, Jorge; Esteve, Maria",BMC Gastroenterol,65,20

METHODS: We used PubMed and Scopus to search international medical databases. The key words were as follows: Hajj, Haj, vaccine, vaccination, and immunization. The time interval of the search was from the beginning of 2010 to May 23, 2016. One hundred and thirty papers were extracted, and their contents were subsequently reviewed after title and abstract screenings. The original articles were included in the study and non-English articles were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Considering the extracted papers, almost all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal diseases. Using of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine rates were different among the pilgrims. The other vaccines have been taking according to specific conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings regarding influenza vaccine effectiveness are contradictory. A few studies confirmed the flu vaccine effectiveness while some others rejected its usefulness. Meningococcal immunization is an effective preventive tool with high compliance for Hajj pilgrims.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies(4). Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant(5)), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, are likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526. Although SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 initially outpaced B.1.1.7 in the region, its growth subsequently slowed concurrently with the rise of B.1.1.7 and ensuing variants.","Annavajhala, Medini K.; Mohri, Hiroshi; Wang, Pengfei; Nair, Manoj; Zucker, Jason E.; Sheng, Zizhang; Gomez-Simmonds, Angela; Kelley, Anne L.; Tagliavia, Maya; Huang, Yaoxing; Bedford, Trevor; Ho, David D.; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin",Nature,65,4

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Rates of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. RESULTS: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Patients with systemic autoimmune or immune-mediated disease (AI/IMID) showed a significant increase, whereas patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. Patients with IA on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but not those on conventional-synthetic DMARDs, had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. CONCLUSION: Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of ageing, therapies and disease-specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyse the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.","Pablos, Jose L; Abasolo, Lydia; Alvaro-Gracia, Jose M; Blanco, Francisco J; Blanco, Ricardo; Castrejón, Isabel; Fernandez-Fernandez, David; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Benjamín; Galindo-Izquierdo, María; Gonzalez-Gay, Miguel A; Manrique-Arija, Sara; Mena Vázquez, Natalia; Mera Varela, Antonio; Retuerto, Miriam; Seijas-Lopez, Alvaro",Ann Rheum Dis,65,24

FI is associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. We selected these four chronic diseases given their global prevalence and comorbid associations with each other. We evaluated the most recent literature published over the past 5 years and offer strategies for the screening of FI. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses report an association between FI and obesity in adult women as well as adult men and women living in low- and middle-income countries. Gender differences also were observed between FI and type 2 diabetes, such that adult women showed an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. This association was influenced by social determinants of health. Very low food security (i.e., high FI) was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and a higher risk for cardiovascular disease mortality. Finally, several studies showed an association between FI and adverse mental health outcomes, including increased risk for stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation. SUMMARY: FI and its negative association with body weight, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health provide a compelling rationale for identification of FI in clinical settings. Brief, well-validated screening measures are available in multiple languages. Despite the need for FI screening, many guidelines do not address its implementation. For this reason, more research and targeted interventions are needed to increase FI screening rates and close the loop in the coordination of resources.","Thomas, Melissa K.; Lammert, Lori J.; Beverly, Elizabeth A.",Curr Cardiovasc Risk Rep,65,21

In the last two decades the world has withstood many contagious disease crashes. SARS-CoV-2 has put the world and the mankind in danger. It is spreading unstoppably all over the world. The virus is evolving and thus the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 strains has been different and making it difficult to develop a broad-spectrum anti-viral molecule that would be effective against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants. This imperative situation demands development of molecules for effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2. The phytomolecules or the bioactive molecules of plants could be a great alternative to combat SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive molecules with their antiviral properties and the secondary metabolites may effectively deactivate the functioning of viral proteins. The structural configuration of 2019-nCoV proteins and genomic information are available, thus contributing immensely for fast molecular docking studies and hence, enables screening of numerous accessible phytomolecules. In the current study, we have essentially highlighted common phytomolecules against the known viral proteins and described the mode of action of few plant-derived molecules which have the potential to suppress the activity of the viral proteins.

Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =.88), while the original cut score of ≥ 9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We also propose that an “Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine” containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses.","Ong, Edison; Wong, Mei U; Huffman, Anthony; He, Yongqun",Front Immunol,65,4

Internet of Health Things (IoHT) networks that are used within a healthcare setting have unique challenges and security requirements (integrity, authentication, privacy, and availability) that must also be balanced with the need to maintain efficiency in order to conserve battery power, which can be a significant limitation in IoHT devices and networks. Data are usually transferred without undergoing filtering or optimization, and this traffic can overload sensors and cause rapid battery consumption when interacting with IoHT networks. This poses certain restrictions on the practical implementation of these devices. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving two-tier data inference framework solution that conserves battery consumption by inferring the sensed data and reducing data size for transmission, while also protecting sensitive data from leakage to adversaries. The results from experimental evaluations on efficiency and privacy show the validity of the proposed scheme, as well as significant data savings without compromising data transmission accuracy, which contributes to energy efficiency of IoHT sensor devices.","Kang, James Jin; Dibaei, Mahdi; Luo, Gang; Yang, Wencheng; Haskell-Dowland, Paul; Zheng, Xi",Sensors (Basel),65,1

Proventriculitis was also associated with some new IBV strains. Aim of this study was to investigate by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the tissue tropism of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 in experimentally infected chicken embryos. RESULTS: To this end chicken embryos were inoculated in the allantoic sac with 10(3 )EID(50 )of IBV M41 at 10 days of age. At 48, 72, and 120 h postinoculation (PI), embryos and chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) were sampled, fixed, and paraffin-wax embedded. Allantoic fluid was also collected and titrated in chicken embryo kidney cells (CEK). The sensitivity of IHC in detecting IBV antigens in the CAM of inoculated eggs matched the virus reisolation and detection in CEK. Using IHC, antigens of IBV were detected in nasal epithelium, trachea, lung, spleen, myocardial vasculature, liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, sclera of the eye, spinal cord, as well as in brain neurons of the inoculated embryos. These results were consistent with virus isolation and denote the wide tissue tropism of IBV M41 in the chicken embryo. Most importantly, we found infection of vasculature and smooth muscle of the proventriculus which has not seen before with IBV strain M41. CONCLUSION: IHC can be an additional useful tool for diagnosis of IBV infection in chickens and allows further studies to foster a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of infections with IBV strains of different virulence. Moreover, these results underline that embryonic tissues in addition to CAM could be also used as possible source to generate IBV antigens for diagnostic purposes.","Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S; Zlotowski, Priscila; Veits, Jutta; Keil, Günther M; Teifke, Jens P",Virol J,65,16

However, many data sets that could inform science and policy during an emerging event do not exist or are only released months or years later. Here, we synthesize multiple data sources from across the seafood supply chain, including unconventional real‐time data sets, to show the relative initial responses and indicators of recovery during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We synthesized news articles from January to September 2020 that reported effects of COVID‐19 on the US seafood sector, including processor closures, shortened fishing seasons and loss of revenue. Concerning production and distribution, we assessed past and present landings and trade data and found substantial declines in fresh seafood catches (−40%), imports (−37%) and exports (−43%) relative to the previous year, while frozen seafood products were generally less affected. Google search trends and seafood market foot traffic data suggest consumer demand for seafood from restaurants dropped by upwards of 70% during lockdowns, with recovery varying by state. However, these declines were partially offset by an increase (270%) in delivery and takeout service searches. Our synthesis of open‐access data sets and media reports shows widespread, but heterogeneous, ramifications of COVID‐19 across the seafood sector, implying that policymakers should focus support on states and sub‐sectors most affected by the pandemic: fishery‐dependent communities, processors, and fisheries and aquaculture that focus on fresh products.","White, Easton R.; Froehlich, Halley E.; Gephart, Jessica A.; Cottrell, Richard S.; Branch, Trevor A.; Agrawal Bejarano, Rahul; Baum, Julia K.",Fish Fish (Oxf),65,24

However, this new “state capitalist normal” is also portrayed as carrying risks. There is anxiety regarding the direction the political form of global capital accumulation is heading: with the unchecked proliferation of state capitalism possibly blunting competition, politicising economic relations, and intensifying geoeconomic tensions. This anxiety underwrites the current re‐articulation of Development, one which embraces the state as promoter, supervisor, and owner of capital; even as it critiques China’s use of similar instruments.","Alami, Ilias; Dixon, Adam D.; Mawdsley, Emma",Antipode,65,1

In the UK, the COVID19-Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC) launched to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the general population and its implications. The project was then extended to Italy and several other countries. This article provides an overview of the Italian C19PRC study and its replication of two specific findings from the UK C19PRC. In the first part, the relationship between anxiety and somatic symptomatology is examined. In the second part, we analyze the association between several factors and psychological health outcomes: depression/anxiety, traumatic stress, COVID-19 anxiety. In line with the study conducted in the UK, an online survey was administered to the adult Italian general population. The sample included 1038 respondents (age, mean = 49.94, SD = 16.14, 51.15% females) taken from four regions: Lombardia, Veneto, Lazio, and Campania. The relationship between predictors and outcomes was evaluated by means of logistic regression models. Somatic indices showed a positive association with anxiety, worse somatic symptoms were associated with mourning a loss of a beloved one due to COVID-19 and with precarious health conditions. Females showed a higher incidence of psychological issues. No differences in anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress were found across regions but the Campania region showed the most severe somatic symptomatology. In the second analysis, the factors associated with more severe psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety and/or depression, traumatic stress, and COVID-19 related anxiety) were younger age, the presence of minors in the household, traumatic stressors, and precarious health conditions. No differences across regions emerged. The Italian results correspond to the UK findings for anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress. Both in the UK and Italy, the factors associated with worse psychological health were gender (female), younger age, having children, pre-existing health issues (both for oneself or someone close), and the moderate/high perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 within one month. In Italy, unlike the UK, lower household income and having (had) COVID-19 were not associated with poorer mental health. The psychological impact of COVID-19 can last for months; future research should explore all aspects of the psychological burden of COVID-19 in order to implement psychological interventions and promote psychological health.","Bruno, Giovanni; Panzeri, Anna; Granziol, Umberto; Alivernini, Fabio; Chirico, Andrea; Galli, Federica; Lucidi, Fabio; Spoto, Andrea; Vidotto, Giulio; Bertamini, Marco",J Clin Med,65,20

In this research, 128 criteria for team formation are proposed for building teams for self-managing software engineering capstone projects. A comparison is also conducted to ascertain the level of cohesion among those teams that were formed using the proposed criteria and those that were not formed using the proposed criteria. The criteria were identified through a combination of qualitative questionnaire survey targeted at the graduated students of the past batches of Computer Science degree program and through synthesizing the literature on engineering capstone project teams identified under the guidance of KSAO framework for software engineering students. To check the effectiveness of the criteria, 100 students were asked to form the teams using the proposed criteria and other 100 students formed the teams without the proposed criteria. Those students that had used the proposed criteria for building teams and those that had formed teams without using the proposed criteria were asked to fill the modified Group Environment Questionnaire to ascertain the level of cohesion among the team members. The results were analyzed qualitatively and through descriptive quantification. The results show that the level of cohesion in teams that were formed using the proposed team building criteria was higher. There was a need for team building criteria in the literature on software engineering capstone project teams that conforms to a conceptual, theoretical framework; this gap is now filled through this research. This paper may also serve as a literature review paper for some readers.","Shaikh, Muhammad Khalid",Heliyon,65,1

Governments and key institutions have had to implement decisive responses to the danger posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Imposed change will increase the likelihood that alternative explanations take hold. In a proportion of the general population there may be strong scepticism, fear of being misled, and false conspiracy theories. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of conspiracy thinking about the pandemic and test associations with reduced adherence to government guidelines. METHODS: A non-probability online survey with 2501 adults in England, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, income, and region. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of this population showed little evidence of conspiracy thinking, 25% showed a degree of endorsement, 15% showed a consistent pattern of endorsement, and 10% had very high levels of endorsement. Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all government guidelines and less willingness to take diagnostic or antibody tests or to be vaccinated. Such ideas were also associated with paranoia, general vaccination conspiracy beliefs, climate change conspiracy belief, a conspiracy mentality, and distrust in institutions and professions. Holding coronavirus conspiracy beliefs was also associated with being more likely to share opinions. CONCLUSIONS: In England there is appreciable endorsement of conspiracy beliefs about coronavirus. Such ideas do not appear confined to the fringes. The conspiracy beliefs connect to other forms of mistrust and are associated with less compliance with government guidelines and greater unwillingness to take up future tests and treatment.","Freeman, Daniel; Waite, Felicity; Rosebrock, Laina; Petit, Ariane; Causier, Chiara; East, Anna; Jenner, Lucy; Teale, Ashley-Louise; Carr, Lydia; Mulhall, Sophie; Bold, Emily; Lambe, Sinéad",Psychological medicine,65,20

After remaining persistently febrile, a peripheral blood smear was ordered and revealed parasites consistent with Ehrlichia spp. Doxycycline monotherapy led to symptomatic improvement and resolution of her pancytopenia. During her hospital stay, a computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed pulmonary emboli, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy uncovered arteriovenous malformations. After appropriate treatment, she was discharged on hospital day 7 and has since done well. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our case offers a dramatic, unexpected presentation of ehrlichiosis in a nonagenarian.

Encouraging smokers with low socioeconomic position (SEP) to choose their smoking aid tool based on their preferences, and giving that tool free of charge, might increase the odds of smoking cessation. This trial examines the effectiveness of the ‘STOP’ (Sevrage Tabagique à l’aide d’Outils dédiés selon la Préférence: Smoking cessation using preference-based tools), a preference-based smoking cessation intervention for smokers with low SEP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The STOP study is a randomised, multicentre, controlled trial (RCT). Smokers with low SEP and wishing to quit will be randomised to either the intervention or the control group (standard care). Participants in the intervention group will be asked to choose between different types of nicotine substitutes (patches, inhalers, gum, tablets, etc) and/or an electronic cigarette which will be delivered free of charge to aid their smoking cessation attempt. The primary outcome will be smoking abstinence at 6 months after inclusion, defined as self-reported 7-day point prevalence of tobacco abstinence. Secondary outcomes include the total number of days of abstinence at 6 months after inclusion, 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 1 and 3 months after inclusion and number of relapses. The study will also include an economic evaluation, and a process evaluation using a mixed methods approach.

Their importance in crisis is not in doubt. However, they experienced considerable physical distress and psychological stressors, even leading to psychological illness and infection in this environment. There is an urgent need to accurately, comprehensively and objectively understand their experiences, perceptions and current situation of burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection. Therefore, this protocol is to conduct a mixed-methods systematic review to summarise the evidence on the experiences of healthcare providers and impacts of the coronavirus on their psychological status and infection during the pandemics. METHODS: Published studies on experience, perspective, impact, burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and infection of healthcare providers with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, and written in English and Chinese will be accepted. Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PubMed, Psychology Information, WanFang and SinoMed) from inception until 30 July 2020 will be searched. Two reviewers will select, screen, extract data and assess the risk of bias independently. Risk of bias of results will be using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Using a convergent integrated approach on qualitative/quantitative studies, we will synthesise qualitative and quantitative data separately. The incidence and number of cases about burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection among medical staff will be extracted. Then we will transform quantitative data to synthesise narrative findings. This protocol will be reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines.

Decline of antibodies response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was reported exclusively in the early month increases the risk of reinfection for convalescent individuals. There is a current need to follow the maintenance of special antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we reported changes of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent patients over 8 months. Antibodies of all 20 participants targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding-domain (RBD) had decreased from a mean OD450 value 1.78 to 0.38 over 8 months. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers decreased from the mean ID50 value 836 to 170. The NAb titers were significantly correlated with IgG level during 8 months (P<0.001). Furthermore, while RBD-specific IgG existence of 25% (5/20) convalescent plasma was undetectable, the NAb titers of 15% (3/20) convalescent plasma decreased below the threshold. In addition, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (S-D614), lower titers of neutralizing antibodies against its G614 variant were shown at 8 months after symptom onset. This study has important implications when considering antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Peng, P.; Hu, J.; Deng, H.-j.; Liu, B.-z.; Wang, K.; Tang, N.; Huang, A.-L.",,65,22

Non-HIV antiviral agents,11.8545065,6.743333,2003-12-31,"Large-scale conformational transitions in the spike protein S2 domain are required during host cell infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although conventional molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2, it is still challenging to gain molecular insight into the key conformational changes due to the size of the spike protein and the long timescale required to capture these transitions. In this work, we have developed an efficient simulation protocol that leverages many short simulations, a novel selection algorithm, and Markov state models to interrogate the dynamics of the S2 domain. We discovered that the conformational flexibility of the dynamic region upstream of the fusion peptide in S2 is coupled to the proteolytic cleavage state of the spike protein. These results suggest that opening of the fusion peptide likely occurs on a sub-microsecond timescale following cleavage at the S2’ site. Building on the structural and dynamical information gained to date about S2 domain dynamics, we provide proof-of-principle that a small molecule bound to a seam neighboring the fusion peptide can slow the opening of the fusion peptide, leading to a new inhibition strategy for experiments to confirm. In aggregate, these results will aid the development of drug cocktails to inhibit infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","Remington, Jacob M.; McKay, Kyle T.; Ferrell, Jonathon B.; Schneebeli, Severin T.; Li, Jianing",Biophys J,65,15

METHODS: A total of 2,597 community residents who lived in Jindo, where the Sewol ferry disaster occurred, participated in a survey at baseline (1.5 months); 1,228 (47%) of these respondents were followed-up 15 months later. The variables included demographic characteristics, witnessing the rescue scene, being a community volunteer, and lifetime traumatic experiences. PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively. An assessment of property loss due to the Sewol ferry disaster was also included in the follow-up evaluation. RESULTS: The proportion of PTSD cases among community residents at baseline and follow-up were 16.1% and 15.6% (delayed PTSD, 10.1; chronic PTSD, 5.5%), respectively. Depression and anxiety symptoms at each time point were consistently associated with acute, delayed, and chronic PTSD. Logistic regression analyses showed that anxiety symptoms at baseline predicted the delayed and chronic PTSD. Chronic PTSD was independently predicted by the witness rescue and loss of property immediately after the disaster. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide important evidence supporting the need for comprehensive assessment and management of mental health problems in community residents exposed to a disaster. Financial losses experienced by community residents after a trauma must also be addressed, and psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety should be identified and treated.","Lee, Ju-Yeon; Kim, Seon-Young; Kim, Jae-Min; Shin, Il-Seon; Kim, Sung-Wan",J Affect Disord,65,26

We aimed to assess the prevalence, spectrum, severity, and significance of digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Findings A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death.

To avoid excessive and harmful immune effects caused by over-activation of these signaling pathways, host cells adopt a number of strategies to regulate them. In addition, invading viruses also employ a variety of mechanisms to inhibit the production of type I IFNs, thereby evading the supervision and clearance by the host.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feedback, satisfaction, experience, and perceptions of Text4Hope subscribers and to examine any differences based on gender after subscribers received 6 weeks of daily supportive text messages. Additionally, this study examined subscribers’ anticipated receptivity to technology-based medical services that could be offered during major crises, emergencies, or pandemics. METHODS: Individuals self-subscribed to Text4Hope to receive daily supportive text messages for 3 months. Subscribers were invited to complete a web-based survey at 6 weeks postintervention to provide service satisfaction–related information. Overall satisfaction was assessed on a scale of 0-10, and satisfaction scores were analyzed using a related-measures t test. Likert scale satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the Text4Hope program. Gender differences were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2032 subscribers completed the baseline and 6-week surveys; 1788 (88%) were female, 219 (10.8%) were male, and 25 (1.2%) were other gender. The mean age of study participants was 44.58 years (SD 13.45 years). The mean overall satisfaction score was 8.55 (SD 1.78), suggesting high overall satisfaction with Text4Hope. The ANOVA analysis, which was conducted using the Welch test (n=1716), demonstrated that females had significantly higher mean satisfaction scores than males (8.65 vs 8.11, respectively; mean difference=0.546; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.91; P<.001) and nonsignificantly lower satisfaction scores than other gender respondents (mean difference=−0.938; 95% CI −0.37 to 2.25; P=.15). More than 70% of subscribers agreed that Text4Hope helped them cope with stress (1334/1731, 77.1%) and anxiety (1309/1728, 75.8%), feel connected to a support system (1400/1729, 81%), manage COVID-19–related issues (1279/1728, 74%), and improve mental well-being (1308/1731, 75.6%). Similarly, subscribers agreed that messages were positive, affirmative, and succinct. Messages were always or often read by 97.9% (1681/1716) of respondents, and more than 20% (401/1716, 23.4%) always or often returned to messages. The majority of subscribers (1471/1666, 88.3%) read the messages and either reflected upon them or took a positive action. Subscribers welcomed almost all technology-based services as part of their health care during crisis or emergency situations. Text4Hope was perceived to be effective by many female subscribers, who reported higher satisfaction and improved coping after receiving text messages for 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents affirmed the high quality of the text messages with their positive feedback. Technology-based services can provide remotely accessible and population-level interventions that align with the recommended physical distancing practices for pandemics. Text4Hope subscriber feedback revealed high satisfaction and acceptance at 6 weeks postintervention.

IBV GVI-1 strains were found to be closely genetically related to each other, irrespective of where the viruses were isolated, and differed from other known IBV genotypes and lineages; thus, it was confirmed that GVI represents a novel genotype. However, the GVI-1 viruses exhibited variable antigenicity when compared to each other. Further analysis found that strains CO8089L and CO8091L, which were isolated in Colombia in 2003, were closely related to GVI-1 viruses, suggesting that GVI-1 viruses likely originated from Colombia and are prevalent in at least five countries (Colombia, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). Analysis of the complete GVI-1 virus genomes suggested that the GVI-1 strains in China may be independently derived from recombination events that occurred between GI-19 strains and CO8089L/CO8091L-like viruses following the introduction of the viruses from Colombia. Similar to the viruses isolated in the Republic of Korea, GVI-1 viruses isolated in China also showed an affinity for the respiratory tract of chickens, which differed from one of the deduced parental viruses, the GI-19 strain. This difference may be due to recombination events that occurred in the genomes of the GVI-1 viruses, resulting in the replacement of the spike gene sequences in an YX10-like strain of GI-19 lineage.","Ren, Mengting; Sheng, Jie; Ma, Tianxin; Xu, Liwen; Han, Zongxi; Li, Huixin; Zhao, Yan; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang",Infect Genet Evol,65,28

This essay builds on critical data studies to warn against the universalization of problems, narratives, and responses to the virus. To this end, it explores two types of data gaps and the corresponding “data poor.” The first gap concerns the data poverty perduring in low-income countries and jeopardizing their ability to adequately respond to the pandemic. The second affects vulnerable populations within a variety of geopolitical and socio-political contexts, whereby data poverty constitutes a dangerous form of invisibility which perpetuates various forms of inequality.

The effective solution for this pandemic is to recognize the nature and spread of the disease so that appropriate policies can be framed. Mathematical modelling is always at the forefront to understand and provide an adequate description of the transmission of any disease. In this research work, we have formulated a deterministic compartmental model (SEAMHCRD) including various stages of infection, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical to study the spreading of COVID-19 and estimated the model parameters by fitting the model with the reported data of ongoing pandemic in Oman. The steady-state, stability and final pandemic size of the model has been proved mathematically. The various transmission as well as transition parameters are estimated during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020. Based on the currently estimated parameters, the pandemic size is also predicted for another 100 days. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key model parameters, and the parameter gamma due to contact with the symptomatic moderately infected is found to be more significant in spreading the disease. Accordingly, the corresponding basic reproduction number has also been computed using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. As the value of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is 0.9761 during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020, the disease-free equilibrium is stable. Isolation and tracing the contact of infected individuals are recommended to control the spread of disease.","Varghese, Abraham; Kolamban, Shajidmon; Sherimon, Vinu; Lacap, Eduardo M.; Ahmed, Saad Salman; Sreedhar, Jagath Prasad; Al Harthi, Hasina; Al Shuaily, Huda Salim",Sci Rep,65,20

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the depression, anxiety and stress levels, and the fear of COVID-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate CSU and to determine their impact on urticaria activity during the pandemic. Methods: A total of 509 patients with mild-to-moderate CSU were prospectively evaluated with validated scales, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) during the lockdown period (LP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). CSU activity was determined with the urticaria activity score summed over 7 days (UAS7) and medication scores (MS). UAS7 and MS before the pandemic were retrospectively collected from medical records. Results: The median UAS7 and MS were both significantly higher in the LP than in the median of related scores during the prepandemic period (p < 0.0001) and the RTNP (p < 0.0001). The mean FCV-19S and DASS-21 scores were both significantly higher in the LP than in the RTNP (p < 0.0001). The FCV-19S and the DASS-21 anxiety and stress subscales were significantly higher in women. The UAS7s were positively correlated with the FCV-19S and depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores. Conclusion: Fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when strict isolation measures are taken, have a significant impact on mental health and urticaria activity in patients with mild-to-moderate CSU, even though they are not infected. Psychological support for patients with CSU seems to be important to control disease activity during the pandemic.","Beyaz, Sengul; Demir, Semra; Oztop, Nida; Karadag, Pelin; Coskun, Raif; Colakoglu, Bahauddin; Buyukozturk, Suna; Gelincik, Asli",Allergy Asthma Proc,65,16

In this context, many medicaments, including different Ebola or HIV antivirals, are used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Authorized medicaments manipulation is sometimes necessary because they are not always formulated to be administered to non-cooperative patients or they are in shortage.

This inflammatory response results from assembly/activation of a cell-intrinsic defense platform known as the inflammasome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 viroporin encoded by ORF3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, the most promiscuous of known inflammasomes. ORF3a triggers IL-1β expression via NFκB, thus priming the inflammasome while also activating it via ASC-dependent and -independent modes. ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation requires efflux of potassium ions and oligomerization between NEK7 and NLRP3. With the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 able to block ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation and key ORF3a residues needed for virus release and inflammasome activation conserved in SARS-CoV-2 isolates across continents, ORF3a and NLRP3 present prime targets for intervention. Summary Development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies is aimed predominantly at blocking infection or halting virus replication. Yet, the inflammatory response is a significant contributor towards disease, especially in those severely affected. In a pared-down system, we investigate the influence of ORF3a, an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, on the inflammatory machinery and find that it activates NLRP3, the most prominent inflammasome by causing potassium loss across the cell membrane. We also define key amino acid residues on ORF3a needed to activate the inflammatory response, and likely to facilitate virus release, and find that they are conserved in virus isolates across continents. These findings reveal ORF3a and NLRP3 to be attractive targets for therapy.","Xu, Huanzhou; Chitre, Siddhi A.; Akinyemi, Ibukun A.; Loeb, Julia C.; Lednicky, John A.; McIntosh, Michael T.; Bhaduri-McIntosh, Sumita",bioRxiv,65,0

About 98% of all PV patients harbor the JAK2 mutation. Ruxolitinib (RUX), a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, received approval as a second-line indication in PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to standard therapy hydroxyurea in both the United States (2014) and Europe (2015). In the studies relevant to approval, RUX achieved excellent PV control. Due to its mechanism of action, RUX also has immunosuppressive effects. As expected, an increased rate of infection was observed in clinical studies and in practical application. In this overview, we have compiled all previous literature references on RUX and infections in PV. However, apart from a few individual cases with special infections and an increased rate of zoster infections, there are no exceptional high infection problems. Recommendations are given on how infections in RUX treated PV patients can be avoided. ABSTRACT: Ruxolitinib (RUX), a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is approved for second-line therapy in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. Due to the immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effect of RUX, there is an increased susceptibility to infections. However, an increased risk of infection is inherent to even untreated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). To obtain more information on the clinical significance of RUX-associated infections in PV, we reviewed the available literature. There is no evidence-based approach to managing infection risks. Most data on RUX-associated infections are available for MF. In all studies, the infection rates in the RUX and control groups were fairly similar, with the exception of infections with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). However, individual cases of bilateral toxoplasmosis retinitis, disseminated molluscum contagiosum, or a mycobacterium tuberculosis infection or a hepatitis B reactivation are reported. A careful assessment of the risk of infection for PV patients is required at the initial presentation and before the start of RUX. Screening for hepatitis B is recommended in all patients. The risk of RUX-associated infections is lower with PV than with MF, but compared to a normal population there is an increased risk of VZV infection. However, primary VZV prophylaxis for PV patients is not recommended, while secondary prophylaxis can be considered individually. As early treatment is most effective for VZV, patients should be properly informed and trained to seek medical advice immediately if cutaneous signs of VZV develop. Vaccination against influenza, herpes zoster, and pneumococci should be considered in all PV patients at risk of infection, especially if RUX treatment is planned. Current recommendations do not support adjusting or discontinuing JAK inhibition in MPN patients to reduce the risk of COVID-19.","Sadjadian, Parvis; Wille, Kai; Griesshammer, Martin",Cancers (Basel),65,20

The combination of viral infection and chronic inflammation in advanced chronological age might cause multiple detrimental unforeseen consequences for the predisposition and severity of neurodegenerative diseases and needs to be considered so that we can be prepared to deal with future outcomes of the ongoing pandemic.","Domingues, Renato; Lippi, Alice; Setz, Cristian; Outeiro, Tiago F.; Krisko, Anita",Aging (Albany NY),65,1

METHODS: We utilized a large-scale database involving 14 high-volume centers in Japan to investigate changes in the numbers of HRM and POEM procedures performed and outcomes of POEM between 2019 and 2020. A questionnaire survey was also conducted to analyze pandemic-associated changes in the HRM and POEM protocols. RESULTS: Compared to that in 2019, the number of HRM and POEM procedures decreased by 17.2% (1587-1314) and 20.9% (630-498), respectively. These declines were prominent during the state of emergency from April to May 2020, particularly in pandemic areas. HRM and POEM in nonpandemic areas were relatively unaffected. From 2019 to 2020, there was a 0.4% (254-248) decrease in POEM cases within the prefecture, but the number outside the prefecture decreased by 33.6% (372-247). During the pandemic, the safety and efficacy of POEM were maintained. The implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) measures varied among facilities, and PPE for POEM was relatively insufficient compared to that for HRM. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic influenced HRM and POEM practices in Japan. It is necessary to establish a sufficient system for HRM and POEM in each hospital as well as countrywide to overcome the effects of the pandemic.","Ominami, Masaki; Sato, Hiroki; Fujiyoshi, Yusuke; Abe, Hirofumi; Shiwaku, Hironari; Shiota, Junya; Sato, Chiaki; Sakae, Hiroyuki; Hata, Yoshitaka; Fukuda, Hisashi; Ogawa, Ryo; Nakamura, Jun; Tatsuta, Tetsuya; Ikebuchi, Yuichiro; Yokomichi, Hiroshi; Fujiwara, Yasuhiro; Inoue, Haruhiro",Dig. endosc,65,20

To ensure the success of any telemedicine program, there is a need to understand the patients’ satisfaction and their preferences. This review aims to collate and provide evidence related to practices that may influence the performance of telemedicine for patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases for studies examining patients’ satisfaction and preferences for using telemedicine in type 2 diabetes. An evaluation matrix was developed to collect the data from the included articles. A total of 20 articles were identified and data on the key outcomes identified were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: Patients were generally satisfied with the use of telemedicine for management of type 2 diabetes. Users reported that telemedicine was beneficial as it provided constant monitoring, improved access to healthcare providers, and reduced waiting time. When adopting a telemedicine platform, most patients expressed preference for mobile health (mHealth) as the telemedicine modality, especially if it has been endorsed by their physician. To improve usability and sustainability, patients suggested that modules related to diabetes education be enhanced, together with sufficient technical and physician support when adopting telemedicine. Patients also expressed the importance of having a sufficiently flexible platform that could be adapted to their needs. CONCLUSION: Personalized telemedicine strategies coupled with appropriate physician endorsement greatly influences a patient’s decision to undertake telemedicine. Future work should focus on improving telemedicine infrastructure and increasing physician’s involvement, especially during the implementation phase.","Sim, Ruth; Lee, Shaun Wen Huey",Patient Prefer Adherence,65,1

We assembled a transdisciplinary team of knowledgeable and dedicated physicians, scientists, technologists and administrators, who rapidly built a multi-platform, PCR- and serology- based detection program, established drive-thru facilities and drafted and implemented guidelines that enabled efficient testing of our patients and employees. This process was extremely complex, due to the limited availability of needed reagents, but outreach to our research scientists and to multiple diagnostic laboratory companies and government officials enabled us to implement both FDA authorized and laboratory developed testing (LDT)-based testing protocols. We analyzed our workforce needs and created teams of appropriately skilled and certified workers, to safely process patient samples and conduct SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing. We initiated smart test ordering, interfaced all testing platforms with our electronic medical record, and went from zero testing capacity, to testing hundreds of healthcare workers and patients daily, within three weeks.

Many of these nsps have essential roles in viral replication, but several have no assigned function and possess amino acid sequences that are unique to the CoV family. One such protein is SARS-CoV nsp1, which is processed from the N-terminus of both pp1a and pp1ab. The mature SARS-CoV protein is present in cells several hours post-infection and co-localizes to the viral replication complex, but its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown. Furthermore, nsp1 sequences are highly divergent across the CoV family, and it has been suggested that this is due to nsp1 possessing a function specific to viral interactions with its host cell or acting as a host specific virulence factor. In order to initiate structural and biophysical studies of SARS-CoV nsp1, a recombinant expression system and a purification protocol have been developed, yielding milligram quantities of highly purified SARS-CoV nsp1. The purified protein was characterized using circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography, and multi-angle light scattering.","Brucz, Kimberly; Miknis, Zachary J.; Schultz, L.

Our active sampling method works in conjunction with vaccination and quarantine policies and is adaptive to changes in real-time data. Using a data-driven agent-based model simulating New York City we show that the algorithm samples individuals to test in a manner that rapidly traces infected individuals. The results show that smart-testing is effective in significantly reducing infection and death rates as compared to current policies, with or without vaccination.","Wang, Y.; Yahav, I.; Padmanabhan, B.",,65,1

DESIGN AND SETTING: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using Google Forms to collect parents’ and caregivers’ responses after they consented to participation. RESULTS: A total of 374 parents/caregivers were contacted and 297 (79%) responded. The majority of the children were male (188 or 63%) and 49.8% were aged 7–12 years. More than half of the participants (194 or 65%) reported improved compliance with medications and spacer use. There was a significant reduction in the number of presentations to the ED from 137 to 80 and admissions to hospital from 56 to 24 during the 10-week lockdown period compared with the same time period in the previous year (p≤0.0001). Around 25% of the participants used telemedicine by phone and social media applications for communication with their treating physician and 59 (80%) described it as easy and smooth.

Carnitine, an essential nutrient, and its derivative acetyl-carnitine can downregulate proinflammatory cytokines and has been suggested as a potential treatment for the disease. Methods: We carried out Mendelian randomization analyses using publicly available data from a large genome wide association study (GWAS) of metabolites and a collaborative genome wide study of Covid19 to investigate the nature of the relationship between carnitine and acetyl-carnitine and Covid19 infection, hospitalisation with Covid19 and very severe Covid19. We used the same methodology to determine whether carnitine was associated with co-morbidities commonly found among those with severe Covid19. Results: We found evidence of a protective effect against very severe Covid19 for both carnitine and acetyl-carnitine, with around a 40% reduction in risk associated with a doubling of carnitine or acetyl-carnitine (carnitine odds ratio (OR) = 0.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.33 to 0.95, p=0.03 and acetyl-carnitine OR=0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.02, p=0.06), and evidence of protective effects on hopitalisation with Covid19. For acetyl-carnitine the largest protective effect was seen in the comparison between those hospitalised with Covid19 and those infected but not hospitalised (OR=0.34, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.62, p=0.0005). Conclusion: Carnitine and acetyl-carnitine merit further investigation in respect to the prevention of severe Covid19.","Kazmi, N.; Davey Smith, G.; Lewis, S. J.",,65,10

These deaths are widely attributed directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. This surge in death necessitates a matched health system response to relieve serious health related suffering at the end of life (EoL) and achieve a dignified death, through timely and appropriate expertise, medication and equipment. Identifying the human and material resource needed relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Methods A Discrete Event Simulation model designed in collaboration with health service funders, health providers, clinicians and modellers in the South West of England was created to estimate the resources required during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for deaths from COVID-19 in the community for a geographical area of nearly 1 million people. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. Results The model predicts that a mean of 11.97 hours (0.18 hours Standard Error (SE), up to a max of 28 hours) of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time (mean 9.17 hours, 0.23 hours SE), and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night-sits (mean of 5.74 hours per day, 0.22 hours SE) will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day (mean of 9.32 hours per day, 0.12 hours SE). An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles or ""just in case"" prescriptions per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles (0.06 SE) of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps (0.11 SE) could be needed to be in use per day (between 1 and 20 syringe pumps). Conclusion Modelling provides essential data to prepare, plan and deliver a palliative care pandemic response tailored to local work patterns and resource. The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","Chalk, D.; Robbins, S.; Kandasamy, R.; Rush, K.; Aggarwal, A.; Sullivan, R.; Chamberlain, C.",,65,28

In this paper, we use machine learning algorithms to build intuitive country-level COVID-19 motion models described by death toll velocity and acceleration. Model explainability techniques provide insightful data-driven narratives about COVID-19 death toll motion models $-$ while velocity is explained by factors that are increasing/reducing death toll pace now, acceleration anticipates the effects of public health measures on slowing the death toll pace. This allows policymakers and epidemiologists to understand factors driving the outbreak and to evaluate the impacts of different public health measures. Finally, our models also predict counterfactuals in order to face the challenge of estimating what is likely to happen as a result of an action.","Veloso, A.; Ziviani, N.",,65,16

Primary prophylaxis to reduce the risk of variceal hemorrhage is recommended if high-risk varices (HRV) are detected. We performed this study to compare the accuracy, patients’ satisfaction and safety of detection of HRV by detachable string magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (DS-MCCE) with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) as the reference. METHODS: We prospectively recruited participants with cACLD from 12 university hospitals (11 in China and one in the United Kingdom) between November 2018 and December 2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03749954). All participants underwent DS-MCCE, followed by EGD within a week in a blinded fashion. Following endoscopy, and on the same day, participants were asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire regarding their experience. FINDINGS: A total of 105 eligible participants were enrolled. With EGD as the reference standard, the concordance index, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of DS-MCCE in diagnosis of HRV were 0•90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0•83–0•95), 92% (95% CI: 78–98%), 88% (95% CI: 78–95%), 80% (95% CI: 70–92%), 95% (95% CI: 90–100%), 7•91 (95% CI: 4•10–15•30), and 0•09 (95% CI: 0•03–0•30), respectively. The kappa score of 0•78 (95% CI: 0•65–0•90) suggested substantial agreement between DS-MCCE and EGD. Moreover, in participants undergoing EGD without sedation, the satisfaction of DS-MCCE was significantly better than that of EGD (p < 0•0001, d = 1•15 [95%CI: 0•88–1•42]). All participants confirmed the excretion of the capsule, and no adverse events occurred. INTERPRETATION: DS-MCCE is an accurate alternative to EGD for detecting HRV in cACLD, which is safe and associated with better satisfaction.

The Israeli government took a determined step of quarantine to suppress and control the spread. This study evaluates the effect of the COVID -19 quarantine on gynecology emergency department (ED) visits compared to the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted during the first half-year of the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on the quarantine during April. In order to identify differences in the population's epidemiology and changes in the amount and type of emergency gynecological visits and surgeries, we compared patients during April 2020 (COVID-19 quarantine) to those who visited the gynecology ED during April 2019. RESULTS: During January-June 2020 period, there was an overall 3,707 patient visits in the gynecology ED, which represents a 22.8% decrease in patient visits compared to the previous year (2019, 4,803 patients). There was a 36% decrease in the gynecology ED visits during the quarantine period. Patient demographics were similar between groups. Visits of nulliparous women were more common in the study group (p=.0001) and self-referral (p=.017). More post-operative complications and fewer patients with abdominal pain were admitted to the study group (p=.034 and p=.054, respectively). During the study, the hospitalization rate did not change 18.2% vs. 17.5% (p=0.768). Hospitalization duration was significantly longer in the COVID-19 quarantine (2.8 ±1.3 vs. 3.1 ±1.5, p<0.001). There was no significant difference among surgical procedure incidents. CONCLUSION: Visits in the gynecology ED service decreased during the COVID-19 quarantine without compromising the treatment of gynecology emergencies. Many gynecologic complaints can be managed in community care settings without referral to an ED.","Daykan, Yair; Tamir Yaniv, Rina; Yagur, Yael; Pomerantz, Meir; Arbib, Nissim; Klein, Zvi; Schonman, Ron",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,65,5

PURPOSE: To prospectively assess pulmonary sequelae and explore the risk factors for lung fibrotic-like changes on six-month follow-up chest CT of survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 114 patients (80[70%] men; mean age, 54±12 years) were studied prospectively. Initial and follow-up CT scans were obtained on 17±11 days and 175±20 days respectively after symptom onset. Lung changes (opacification, consolidation, reticulation, and fibrotic-like changes) and CT extent scores (score per lobe, 0-5; maximum score, 25) were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups: group#1 presence and group#2 absence of CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and/or honeycombing) based on their six-month follow-up CT. Between-group differences were assessed by Fisher’s exact test, two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like changes. RESULTS: On follow-up CT, evidence of fibrotic-like changes was observed in 40/114 (35%) of patients (group#1), while the remaining 74/114 (65%) patients (group#2) showed either complete radiological resolution (43/114, 38%) or residual ground-glass opacification or interstitial thickening (31/114, 27%). Multivariable analysis identified age >50 years (odds ratio [OR]:8.5, 95%CI:1.9-38, p=.01), heart rate >100bpm at admission (OR:5.6, 95%CI:1.1-29, p=.04), duration of in-hospital stay ≥17 days (OR:5.5, 95%CI:1.5-21, p=.01), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR:13, 95%CI:3.3-55, p<.001), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR:6.3, 95%CI:1.3-30, p=.02) and total CT score ≥18 (OR:4.2, 95%CI:1.2-14, p=.02) on initial CT as independent predictors for lung fibrotic-like changes at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Six-month follow-up CT showed lung fibrotic-like changes in more than one-third of patients who survived severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Along with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new and old cardiovascular injuries are important causes of significant morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Exploring new approaches managing cardiovascular complications is essential in controlling the disease progression and preventing long-term complications. Oxytocin (OXT), an immune-regulating neuropeptide, has recently emerged as a strong candidate for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pandemic. OXT carries special functions in immunologic defense, homeostasis and surveillance. It suppresses neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release, activates T-lymphocytes, and antagonizes negative effects of angiotensin II and other key pathological events of COVID-19. Additionally, OXT can promote γ-interferon expression, which inhibits cathepsin L and raises superoxide dismutase expression, to reduce heparin and heparan sulphate fragmentation. Through these mechanisms, OXT can block viral invasion, suppress cytokine storm, reverse lymphocytopenia, and prevent progression to ARDS and multiple organ failures. Importantly, besides prevention of metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, OXT can protect the heart and vasculature through suppressing hypertension, brain-heart syndrome, and social stress, and promoting regeneration of injured cardiomyocytes. Unlike other therapeutic agents, exogenous OXT can be used safely without the side-effects seen in remdesivir and corticosteroid. Importantly, OXT can be mobilized endogenously to prevent pathogenesis of COVID-19. This article summarizes our current understandings of cardiovascular pathogenesis caused by COVID-19, explores the protective potentials of OXT against COVID-19-associated cardiovascular diseases, and discusses challenges in applying OXT in treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

HBV has been found in ~85% of HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinomas (HCC), and it can integrate the whole or part of its genome into the host genomic DNA. The molecular mechanisms involved in the HBV DNA integration is not yet clear; thus, multiple models have been described with respect to either the relaxed-circular DNA (rcDNA) or the double-stranded linear DNA (dslDNA) of HBV. Various genes have been found to be affected by HBV DNA integration, including cell-proliferation-related genes, oncogenes and long non-coding RNA genes (lincRNAs).

While some educational programs include a one-time sleep didactic, prone to being overlooked, there is need for an educational resource which can be accessible to the learners throughout their training span. The trainees’ needs and readiness to learn may vary from time to time, therefore, continued access to educational resources can be very beneficial. METHODS: An electronic tool was created on Coggle, comprising of educational resources and content on the basic tenets of sleep quality, regulation, effects of deprivation and strategies to mitigate these effects. Links to free resources made available by AASM, such as “Choose Sleep,” were also included. The sleep resources were then incorporated in the overall continuum of Graduate Medical Education (GME) resources available to trainees, and was advertised in newsletters, incorporated in orientations (n=324) and wellness sessions (n=254). The GME Institutional Quality of Life data was obtained in 2018–2019 and in 2020 to ascertain baseline and post-intervention measures of wellness, workload and burn-out in trainees. RESULTS: Data collected in 2020, after introduction of Coggle, demonstrated: 1) A 4% increase of residents (n=1041) would rate their workload as “just right.” 2) A 9% increase of residents (n=1040) said their personal health and wellbeing was “very good” and “good.” 3) A 12% decrease of residents (n=1040) said they felt burned out at work. 4) A 5% decrease of residents (n=1037) said they felt they had become more calloused towards people since they first started training. CONCLUSION: The analysis of learners’ feedback demonstrated that access to sleep training resources on a continuous, on-demand basis improved trainees’ personal health and wellbeing. The positive impact was sustained despite unprecedented stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future steps include: 1) Moving the electronic tool to a more advanced platform with analytical capabilities. 2) Obtaining longitudinal data to assess the impact of the electronic tool on medical trainees’ sleep parameters. 3) Sharing the electronic tool with other organizations to improve wellbeing of all medical trainees and health professionals.

In this study, we explore the dynamic alternation in the levels of SDC-1 in cases with COVID-19. A total of 120 cases definitely diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted to the Firoozgar Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from December 1, 2020, to January 29, 2021, and included in our study. Also, 58 healthy subjects (HS) were chosen as the control group. Patients were classified into two groups: 1) ICU patients and (63 cases) 2) non-ICU patients (57 cases). The dynamic changes of serum SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and Vit D levels a well as the disease activity were investigated in three-time points (T1-T3). Our results indicated that the COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels than in HS, while the Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than HS. Further analysis demonstrated that the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in non-ICU patients. Tracking dynamic changes in the above markers indicated that on the day of admission, the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels were gradually increased on day 5 (T2) and then gradually decreased on day 10 (T3). ROC curve analysis suggests that markers mentioned above, SDC-1, IL-6, and IL-18 are valuable indicators in evaluating the activity of COVID-19. All in all, it seems that the serum SDC-1 levels alone or combined with other markers might be a good candidate for disease activity monitoring.","Karampoor, Sajad; Zahednasab, Hamid; Farahmand, Mohammad; Mirzaei, Rasoul; Zamani, Farhad; Tabibzadeh, Alireza; Bouzari, Behnaz; Ajdarkosh, Hossein; Nikkhah, Mehdi; Razavi Hashemi, Melika; Laali, Azadeh; Keyvani, Hossein",Int Immunopharmacol,65,6

While the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears to be higher in patients requiring intensive care unit support compared to those admitted to general wards, recent autopsy findings and data on the timing of VTE diagnosis relative to hospitalization clearly suggest that thromboembolic events also contribute to morbidity and mortality in the ambulatory setting.

Different cardiac abnormalities have been reported during the acute COVID‐19 phase, ranging from infra‐clinic elevations of myocardial necrosis biomarkers to acute cardiac dysfunction and myocarditis. There is limited information on late cardiac sequelae in patients who have recovered from acute COVID‐19 illness. We aimed to document the presence and quantify the extent of myocardial functional alterations in patients hospitalized 6 months earlier for COVID‐19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective echocardiographic evaluation of 48 patients (mean age 58 ± 13 years, 69% male) hospitalized 6 ± 1 month earlier for a laboratory‐confirmed and symptomatic COVID‐19. Thirty‐two (66.6%) had pre‐existing cardiovascular risks factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia), and three patients (6.2%) had a known prior myocardial infarction. Sixteen patients (33.3%) experienced myocardial injury during the index COVID‐19 hospitalization as identified by a rise in cardiac troponin levels. Six months later, 60.4% of patients still reported clinical symptoms including exercise dyspnoea for 56%. Echocardiographic measurements under resting conditions were not different between patients with versus without myocardial injury during the acute COVID‐19 phase. In contrast, low‐level exercise (25W for 3 min) induced a significant increase in the average E/e′ ratio (10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 7.3 ± 11.5, P = 0.01) and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (33.4 ± 7.8 vs. 25.6 ± 5.3 mmHg, P = 0.02) in patients with myocardial injury during the acute COVID‐19 phase. Sensitivity analyses showed that these alterations of left ventricular diastolic markers were observed regardless of whether of cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiac diseases indicating SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as a primary cause. CONCLUSIONS: Six months after the acute COVID‐19 phase, significant cardiac diastolic abnormalities are observed in patients who experienced myocardial injury but not in patients without cardiac involvement.","Fayol, Antoine; Livrozet, Marine; Boutouyrie, Pierre; Khettab, Hakim; Betton, Maureen; Tea, Victoria; Blanchard, Anne; Bruno, Rosa‐Maria; Hulot, Jean‐Sébastien",ESC Heart Fail,65,20

He recognized, however, that widespread anti-essentialism presented a significant barrier to such an approach. The aim of this article is to introduce a theory that challenges these anti-essentialist objections. The notion of natural kinds presents a modest form of essentialism that can serve as the basis for a foundationalist philosophy of medicine. The notion of a natural kind is neither static nor reductionistic. Disease can be understood as making necessary reference to living natural kinds without invoking the claim that diseases themselves are natural kinds. The idea that natural kinds have a natural disposition to flourish as the kinds of things that they are provides a telos to which to tether the notion of disease – an objective telos that is broader than mere survival and narrower than subjective choice. It is argued that while nosology is descriptive and may have therapeutic implications, disease classification is fundamentally explanatory. Sickness and illness, while referring to the same state of affairs, can be distinguished from disease phenomenologically. Scientific and diagnostic fallibility in making judgments about diseases do not diminish the objectivity of this notion of disease. Diseases are things, not kinds. Injury is a concept parallel to disease that also makes necessary reference to living natural kinds. These ideas provide a new possibility for the development of a philosophy of medicine with implications for medical ethics.","Sulmasy, Daniel P.",Theor Med Bioeth,65,32

DESIGN: We modelled the reduction in CRC survival and life years lost resultant from per-patient delays of 2–6 months in the 2WW pathway. We stratified by age group, individual-level benefit in CRC survival versus age-specific nosocomial COVID-19–related fatality per referred patient undergoing colonoscopy. We modelled mitigation strategies using thresholds of FIT triage of 2, 10 and 150 µg Hb/g to prioritise 2WW referrals for colonoscopy. To construct the underlying models, we employed 10-year net CRC survival for England 2008–2017, 2WW pathway CRC case and referral volumes and per-day-delay HRs generated from observational studies of diagnosis-to-treatment interval. RESULTS: Delay of 2/4/6 months across all 11 266 patients with CRC diagnosed per typical year via the 2WW pathway were estimated to result in 653/1419/2250 attributable deaths and loss of 9214/20 315/32 799 life years. Risk–benefit from urgent investigatory referral is particularly sensitive to nosocomial COVID-19 rates for patients aged >60. Prioritisation out of delay for the 18% of symptomatic referrals with FIT >10 µg Hb/g would avoid 89% of these deaths attributable to presentational/diagnostic delay while reducing immediate requirement for colonoscopy by >80%. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in the pathway to CRC diagnosis and treatment have potential to cause significant mortality and loss of life years. FIT triage of symptomatic patients in primary care could streamline access to colonoscopy, reduce delays for true-positive CRC cases and reduce nosocomial COVID-19 mortality in older true-negative 2WW referrals. However, this strategy offers benefit only in short-term rationalisation of limited endoscopy services: the appreciable false-negative rate of FIT in symptomatic patients means most colonoscopies will still be required.","Loveday, Chey; Sud, Amit; Jones, Michael E; Broggio, John; Scott, Stephen; Gronthound, Firza; Torr, Beth; Garrett, Alice; Nicol, David L; Jhanji, Shaman; Boyce, Stephen A; Williams, Matthew; Barry, Claire; Riboli, Elio; Kipps, Emma; McFerran, Ethna; Muller, David C; Lyratzopoulos, Georgios; Lawler, Mark; Abulafi, Muti; Houlston, Richard S; Turnbull, Clare",Gut,65,2

A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-β production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce the susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment. Investigation of different interferon-stimulated genes and their role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may direct novel antiviral strategies.","Chen, Xi; Saccon, Elisa; Appelberg, K.

It describes, step by step, how replication unfolds, starting with the initial interaction between the virus and a host cell and finishing with the release of infectious virus particles which can go on and infect new cells. Since these processes are essential in the replication cycle, understanding how they can be blocked specifically without damaging the host cell is the key to understanding how antiviral drugs work.","Cann, Alan J.",Principles of Molecular Virology,65,16

Our aim was to compare the lung involvement of the HT patients hospitalized for COVID-19 using ACEIs/ARBs with the patients taking other anti-HT medications. METHODS: : Patients who have a diagnosis of HT among the patients treated for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 31 March 2020 and 28 May 2020 were included in the study. One hundred and twenty-four patients were divided into two as ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 75) and non-ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 49) according to the anti-HT drug used. The chest CT involvement areas of these two groups were evaluated quantitatively by two observers including all lobes, and total severity score (TSS) was calculated. These TSS values were compared between drug groups and clinical groups RESULTS: In clinical classification; there were 4 (%3.2) asymptomatic, 5 (4.0%) mild type, 92 (74.1%) common type, 14 (11.3%) severe type, 9 (7.3%) critical type patients. ACEI/ARB group’s TSS (mean±SD, 7.74 ± 3.54) was statistically higher than other anti-HT medication group (mean±SD, 4.40 ± 1.89) (p < .001). Likewise, severe-critical clinical type’s TSS (mean±SD, 9.17 ± 3.44) was statistically higher than common type (mean±SD, 5.76 ± 3.07) (p < .001). Excellent agreement was established between the two blinded observers in the TSS measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative evaluation of CT and TSS score can give an idea about the clinical classification of the patient. TSS is higher in ACEI/ARB group than non-ACEIs/ARBs group.","Samanci, Cesur; Saylan, Bengu; Gulsen, Gokce; Akkaya, Yuksel; Yesildal, Melike; Akkaya Isik, Sinem; Ustabasioglu, Fethi Emre",Clinical and experimental hypertension,65,5

In turn, COVID‐19 sequelae may perpetuate existing health disparities. The co‐occurrence of afflictions may also result in compromised safety performance. To curb the likelihood of a COVID‐19 based truck driver syndemic, several action stepsare needed. First, key COVID‐19 metrics need to be established for this population.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome has shown vividly the importance of sensitive worldwide surveillance. The Agency for Cooperation in International Health, a Japanese non-governmental organisation, has developed on a voluntary basis a sentinel surveillance system for selected target infectious diseases, covering South America, Africa, and Asia. The system has uncovered unreported infectious diseases of international importance including cholera, plague, and influenza; current trends of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance in polio eradication; and prevalence of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C in individual areas covered by the sentinels. Despite a limited geographical coverage, the system seems to supplement disease information being obtained by global surveillance. Further development of this sentinel surveillance system would be desirable to contribute to current global surveillance efforts, for which, needless to say, national surveillance and alert system takes principal responsibility.","Arita, Isao; Nakane, Miyuki; Kojima, Kazunobu; Yoshihara, Namiko; Nakano, Takashi; El-Gohary, Ahmed",Lancet Infect Dis,65,5

COVID-19 is an entirely new disease with disparate clinical manifestations that are difficult to reconcile with a single pathogenic principle. Here, we explain how the flexible paradigm of the “damage-response framework” (DRF) of microbial pathogenesis can organize the varied manifestations of COVID-19 into a synthesis that accounts for differences in susceptibility of vulnerable populations as well as for differing manifestations of COVID-19 disease. By focusing on mechanisms of host damage, particularly immune-mediated damage, the DRF provides a lens to understand COVID-19 pathogenesis and to consider how potential therapies could alter the outcome of this disease.","Pirofski, Liise-anne; Casadevall, Arturo",mBio,65,4

However, the chemical properties of RNA pose a challenge in utilizing mRNA as a vaccine candidate. For instance, the molecules are prone to degradation, which has a negative impact on the distribution of mRNA among patients. In addition, little is known of the degradation properties of individual RNA bases in a molecule. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether a hybrid deep learning can predict RNA degradation from RNA sequences. Two deep hybrid neural network models were proposed, namely GCN_GRU and GCN_CNN. The first model is based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The second model is based on GCN and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Both models were computed over the structural graph of the mRNA molecule. The experimental results showed that GCN_GRU hybrid model outperform GCN_CNN model by a large margin during the test time. Validation of proposed hybrid models is performed by well-known evaluation measures. Among different deep neural networks, GCN_GRU based model achieved best scores on both public and private MCRMSE test scores with 0.22614 and 0.34152, respectively. Finally, GCN_GRU pre-trained model has achieved the highest AuC score of 0.938. Such proven outperformance of GCNs indicates that modeling RNA molecules using graphs is critical in understanding molecule degradation mechanisms, which helps in minimizing the aforementioned issues. To show the importance of the proposed GCN_GRU hybrid model, in silico experiments has been contacted. The in-silico results showed that our model pays local attention when predicting a given position’s reactivity and exhibits interesting behavior on neighboring bases in the sequence.","Muneer, Amgad; Mohamed Fati, Suliman; Arifin Akbar, Nur; Agustriawan, David; Tri Wahyudi, Setyanto",,65,16

Wild rodents and ectoparasites were collected from 2014 to 2018 in Nan province, Thailand where scrub typhus is highly endemic. Samples from undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) patients were obtained from a local hospital. A total of 200 UFI patient samples were obtained and 309 rodents and 420 pools of ectoparasites were collected from rodents (n = 285) and domestic animals (n = 135). The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced with the Illumina. Real-time PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the next-generation sequencing (NGS) results and to characterize pathogen species. Several pathogens were detected by NGS in all populations studied and the most common pathogens identified included Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., Leptospira spp., and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Interestingly, Anaplasma spp. was detected in patient, rodent and tick populations, although they were not previously known to cause human disease from this region. Candidatus Neoehrlichia, Neorickettsia spp., Borrelia spp., and Ehrlichia spp. were detected in rodents and their associated ectoparasites. The same O. tsutsugamushi genotypes were shared among UFI patients, rodents, and chiggers in a single district indicating that the chiggers found on rodents were also likely responsible for transmitting to people. Serological testing using immunofluorescence assays in UFI samples showed high prevalence (IgM/IgG) of Rickettsia and Orientia pathogens, most notably among samples collected during September–November. Additionally, a higher number of seropositive samples belonged to patients in the working age population (20–60 years old). The results presented in this study demonstrate that the increased risk of human infection or exposure to chiggers and their associated pathogen (O. tsutsugamushi) resulted in part from two important factors; working age group and seasons for rice cultivation and harvesting. Evidence of pathogen exposure was shown to occur as there was seropositivity (IgG) in UFI patients for bartonellosis as well as for anaplasmosis. Using a metagenomic approach, this study demonstrated the circulation and transmission of several pathogens in the environment, some of which are known causative agents of illness in human populations.","Takhampunya, Ratree; Korkusol, Achareeya; Pongpichit, Chalermpol; Yodin, Komsan; Rungrojn, Artharee; Chanarat, Nitima; Promsathaporn, Sommai; Monkanna, Taweesak; Thaloengsok, Sasikanya; Tippayachai, Bousaraporn; Kumfao, Naruemon; Richards, Allen L.; Davidson, Silas A.",Front Microbiol,65,16

However, it is at present largely unclear to what extent these proteases are expressed in viral target cells in human tissues. Here, we show that both HAT and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed with 2,6-linked sialic acids, the major receptor determinant of human influenza viruses, throughout the human respiratory tract. Similarly, coexpression of ACE2, the SARS-coronavirus receptor, and TMPRSS2 was frequently found in the upper and lower aerodigestive tract, with the exception of the vocal folds, epiglottis and trachea. Finally, activation of influenza virus was conserved between human, avian and porcine TMPRSS2, suggesting that this protease might activate influenza virus in reservoir-, intermediate- and human hosts. In sum, our results show that TMPRSS2 and HAT are expressed by important influenza and SARS-coronavirus target cells and could thus support viral spread in the human host.","Bertram, Stephanie; Heurich, Adeline; Lavender, Hayley; Gierer, Stefanie; Danisch, Simon; Perin, Paula; Lucas, Jared M.; Nelson, Peter S.; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Soilleux, Elizabeth J.",PLoS One,65,32

Innate immune response also mounts a defense response against various allergens and pollutants including particulate matter present in the atmosphere. Air pollution has been included as the top threat to global health declared by WHO which aims to cover more than three billion people against health emergencies from 2019 to 2023. Particulate matter (PM), one of the major components of air pollution, is a significant risk factor for many human diseases and its adverse effects include morbidity and premature deaths throughout the world. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a key link between the PM existence and the prevalence of respiratory and inflammatory disorders. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of air pollutant, PM(10) (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm) during RNA virus infections using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) – H5N1 virus. We thus characterized the transcriptomic profile of lung epithelial cell line, A549 treated with PM(10) prior to H5N1infection, which is known to cause severe lung damage and respiratory disease. We found that PM(10) enhances vulnerability (by cellular damage) and regulates virus infectivity to enhance overall pathogenic burden in the lung cells. Additionally, the transcriptomic profile highlights the connection of host factors related to various metabolic pathways and immune responses which were dysregulated during virus infection. Collectively, our findings suggest a strong link between the prevalence of respiratory illness and its association with the air quality.","Mishra, Richa; Pandikannan, K.; Gangamma, S.; Raut, Ashwin Ashok; Kumar, Himanshu",Environ Pollut,65,28

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and mortal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other related coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected. Objectives To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease. Study design We describe here a multi-institution adjudicated case series from Iran which includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease during their latter 2nd or 3rd trimester. All 9 pregnant women were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR nucleic acid testing (NAT). Outcomes of these women were compared to their familial/household members with exposure to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease. Results Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator-dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance the maternal outcomes were more severe when compared to other high and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison). Conclusion We report herein maternal deaths due to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerges, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 disease in their latter trimester(s).","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A.; Aleyasin, Ashraf; Seferovic, Maxim D.; Aski, Soudabeh Kazemi; Arian, Sara E.; Pooransari, Parichehr; Ghotbizadeh, Fahimeh; Aalipour, Soroush; Soleimani, Zahra; Naemi, Mahsa; Molaei, Behnaz; Ahangari, Roghaye; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Oskoei, Atousa Dabiri; Pirozan, Parisa; Darkhaneh, Roya Faraji; Laki, Mahboobeh Gharib; Farani, Ali Karimi; Atrak, Shahla; Miri, Mir Mohammad; Kouchek, Mehran; Shojaei, Seyedpouzhia; Hadavand, Fahimeh; Keikha, Fatemeh; Hosseini, Maryam Sadat; Borna, Sedigheh; Ariana, Shideh; Shariat, Mamak; Fatemi, Alireza; Nouri, Behnaz; Nekooghadam, Seyed Mojtaba; Aagaard, Kjersti",Am J Obstet Gynecol,65,13

The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.","Verbeek, Arnold; Tijssen, Peter",Journal of Virological Methods,65,1

This disease's symptoms range from a mild flu-like form to a severe life-threatening respiratory disease and respiratory failure. Several patients, however, remain paucisymptomatic. Among the symptoms that seem relevant are the changes in taste and smell, regardless of the disease's severity. METHODS: Data from patients affected by COVID-19 infection, hospitalized from 15 to 29 April, 2020, were analyzed. Questionnaires about smell, taste, and nasal function were administered to all, and a proportion also received the Quick olfactory Sniffin’ Sticks Test (q-Sticks) to objectivate the presence of anosmia or hyposmia. The results of instruments and Q-Sticks were then compared. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (20 males, 54.1%), with a mean age 0f 69.19 years (SD = 17.96; median 76, IQR: 63–82) were evaluated. Among the patients, 8 (22%) were asymptomatic. Out of the remaining 29 patients, 28 (97%) had fever, 19 (66%) asthenia, 11 (38%) dry cough, 10 (34%) dyspnea, and 6 (21%) gastroenteric symptoms. The q-Sticks test was performed on 27 patients and showed that 6 with anosmia, and 16 patients had hyposmia, where only 5 (14%) patients complained of loss of smell by conducting the questionnaires. CONCLUSION: Although olfactory disturbances may be secondary to other factors, a sudden onset of anosmia or hyposmia should be assessed as a possible symptom of COVID-19 infection. The use of questionnaires or anamnestic collection is sometimes not enough, while adding to them a simple test such as the q-Sticks test can provide more accurate and reliable data. A simple, easy-to-perform, and reliable tool (q-Sticks) for olfactory disorders assessment can be administered to identify the real size of anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection and detect the early stage of infection or paucisymptomatic patients, therefore becoming important to reduce the spreading of the pandemic.","Bagnasco, Diego; Passalacqua, Giovanni; Braido, Fulvio; Tagliabue, Elena; Cosini, Filippo; Filauro, Marta; Ioppi, Alessandro; Carobbio, Andrea; Mocellin, Davide; Riccio, Anna Maria; Canevari, Frank Rikki",World Allergy Organ J,65,24

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to understand the specific disability-related support needs of families with children with IDD in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We answered the following questions: (1) How do family members of children with IDD in the Mekaneyesus Centre in Addis Ababa currently meet their disability-related support needs?; (2) what are these family members’ most pressing unmet disability-related needs? and (3) how do family members perceive their capacity to meet their support needs? METHOD: This study drew from an exploratory qualitative descriptive approach with 16 family members of children with IDD, recruited from a centre for children with IDD. We conducted semi-structured interviews in Amharic. We transcribed and translated interviews into English and guided by a conceptual framework for family support from Kyzar et al.

RESULTS: Participants identified instrumental and emotional needs to be most prominent, with additional discussion around various physical and informational needs. Participants identified childcare as the most significant unmet need, which resulted in the loss of various important life roles. The participants discussed major sources of support coming from spirituality, family members and community. Stigma emerged as a critical family support theme external to the Kyzar et al.

To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples(1–3) while simultaneously testing for many pathogens(4–6). Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents(7) self-organize in a microwell array(8) to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN–Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA–target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN–Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN–Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold.

A urinary catheter and an epidural catheter were inserted without any difficulty. Abdominal-pelvic MRI revealed a retrovesical mass suspected of liposarcoma with clear borders from surrounding organs. Following two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, we proceeded with surgery. Histopathology was dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Postoperatively, the patient suffered reactivation of COVID-19, and he was eventually discharged after two consecutive negative results on the PCR test on Post Operative Day (POD)-10. Retrovesical dedifferentiated liposarcoma is rare and considered as high-grade liposarcoma. Although surgery may exacerbate COVID-19 infection, surgical resection of symptomatic high-grade sarcoma is prioritised and performed as soon as no infection detected.","Jamtani, Indah; Nugroho, Adianto; Rahadiani, Nur; Manangka, R Semuel W",BMJ Case Rep,65,16

The combined direct health impact and the current macro-fiscal picture present real and present risks to health financing that facilitate progress toward universal health coverage (UHC). This paper lays out the health financing mechanisms through which the UHC objectives of service coverage and financial protection may be impacted. Macroeconomic, fiscal capacity, and poverty indicators and trends are analyzed in conjunction with health financing indicators to present spending scenarios. The analysis shows that falling or reduced economic growth, combined with rising poverty, is likely to lead to a fall in service use and coverage, while any observed reductions in out-of-pocket spending have to be analyzed carefully to make sure they reflect improved financial protection and not just decreased utilization of services. Potential decreases in out-of-pocket spending will likely be drive by households' financial constraints that lead to less service use. In this way, it is critical to measure and monitor both the service coverage and financial protection indicators of UHC to have a complete picture of downstream effects. The analysis of historical data, including available evidence since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, lay the foundation for health financing-related policy options that can effectively safeguard UHC progress particularly for the poor and most vulnerable. These targeted policy options are based on documented evidence of effective country responses to previous crises as well as the overall evidence base around health financing for UHC.","Sparkes, Susan P; Eozenou, Patrick Hoang-Vu; Evans, David; Kurowski, Christoph; Kutzin, Joseph; Tandon, Ajay",Health Syst Reform,65,20

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid implementation of telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: We present outcomes of a complete and rapid transition to telehealth visits at an outpatient integrative medicine center in the Southeastern United States. METHOD: Patients and administrative staff took surveys comparing telehealth to in-person visits within four weeks of our clinic's transition to telehealth and three months later. Beginning four weeks after the clinic’s telehealth conversion in March 2020, patients who had a telehealth visit at the center completed a survey about their telehealth experience and another survey three months later. RESULTS: Patient quality judgements significantly favored telehealth at baseline, B = .77 [0.29 – 1.25], SE = .25, t(712) = 3.15, p = .002, and increased at three months, B = .27 [–0.03 – 0.57], SE = .15, t(712) = 1.76, p = .079. Telehealth technology usability and distance from the center predicted patient ratings of telehealth favorability. Providers favored in-person visits more than patients, B = –1.00 [–1.56 – –0.44], SE = .29, t(799) = –3.48, p < .001, though did not favor either in-person or telehealth more than the other. Patient discrete choice between telehealth and in-person visits was split at baseline (in-person: n = 86 [54%]; telehealth: n = 73 [46%]), but favored telehealth at three months (in-person: n = 17 [40%]; telehealth: n = 26 [60%]). Overall, discrete choice favored telehealth at follow-up across providers and patients, OR = 2.69 [.1.18 – 6.14], z = 2.36, p = .018. Major qualitative themes highlight telehealth as acceptable and convenient, with some challenges including technological issues. Some felt a loss of interpersonal connection during telehealth visits, while others felt the opposite. CONCLUSION: We report converging mixed-method data on the successful and sustained implementation of telehealth with associated policy and clinical implications during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Finn, Michael T.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%). Conclusions: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","Malosh, Ryan E; Petrie, Joshua G; Callear, Amy P; Monto, Arnold S; Martin, Emily Toth",,65,1

The aim of our study was to evaluate the severity of anxiety and depression in pregnant women during the coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic, in addition to investigating the demographic and economic aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores, 6 months after the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Our study was a cross‐sectional descriptive study. Pregnant women who had presented to the Akdeniz University, Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, Pregnancy Outpatient Clinic, and Kepez State Hospital, Pregnancy Outpatient Clinic between September 2020 and October 2020 were included in the study. The Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate the state of anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) was used to assess the state of depression. Patients who had encountered any obstetric and/or fetal abnormality that could cause anxiety and depression during pregnancy follow‐up and pregnant women previously diagnosed with a psychiatric disease were not included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 322 pregnant women who agreed to participate in the study and fulfilled the study criteria within the afore‐mentioned timeframe were included in the study and the relevant forms were filled out. The mean age of the pregnant women was found to be 29 ± 5.64 years, the mean number of gravida was 1.84 ± 0.86, and the mean gestational age was 29.06 ± 9.80 weeks. The mean score of the state anxiety scale was 41.7 ± 5.56 and the mean trait anxiety score was 47.68 ± 5.85. The mean state–trait anxiety score was determined as 42.5 in primigravid women and as 41.1 in multigravid women. The State–trait anxiety score was statistically significantly higher in primigravid women compared to multigravid women (p = 0.027). The mean state–trait anxiety score did not demonstrate a significant difference according to the occupational status, having a chronic disease, educational level, and the income level. The mean trait anxiety score did not differ statistically and significantly according to the occupational status, having a chronic disease, being primigravid, educational status, and the income level. According to BDI‐II, 69.3% of pregnant women were evaluated to have minimal depression, 12.4% as mild depression, 12.4% as moderate depression, and 5.9% as severe depression. CONCLUSION: Although more than 6 months have passed since the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, pregnant women still have increased anxiety and depression scores. In addition, it should be kept in mind that pregnant women are at risk in terms of post‐traumatic stress disorder during the antenatal and the postnatal periods, and it should be considered that psychological and social support should be provided.","Geren, Ayşe; Birge, Özer; Bakır, Mehmet Sait; Sakıncı, Mehmet; Sanhal, Cem Yaşar",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,65,5

Methods: Cross-sectional study, based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations that occurred in SUS, between the last days of February and June. Patients aged 18 years or older, with primary or secondary diagnoses indicative of COVID-19 were included. Bivariate analyses were performed and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were estimated with random effects intercept. The modeling followed three steps, including: attributes of the patients; elements of the care process; and characteristics of the hospital and place of hospitalization. Results: 89,405 hospitalizations were observed, of which 24.4% resulted in death. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in SUS were predominantly male (56.5%), with a mean age of 58.9 years. The length of stay ranged from less than 24 hours to 114 days, with a mean of 6.9 (STD=6.5) days. Of the total number of hospitalizations, 22.6% reported ICU use. The chances of hospital death among men were 16.8% higher than among women and increased with age. Black individuals had a higher chance of death. The behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of a higher risk of death among patients with comorbidities, and obesity had an independent effect on increasing this risk. Some states had a higher risk of hospital death from COVID-19, such as Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro. The chances of hospital death were 72.1% higher in municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants and being hospitalized in the municipality of residence was a protective factor. Conclusion: There was wide variation in hospital COVID-19 mortality in the SUS, associated with demographic and clinical factors, social inequality and differences in the structure of services and quality of health care.","de Andrade, C.

This study aims at analysing clinical presentation on admission and the determinants associated with admission in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective hospital-based study, socio-demographic, clinical and biological characteristics, on admission, of adult COVID-19 hospitalized patients presenting from the community for their first admission were prospectively collected and analysed. Characteristics of patients hospitalized in medical ward to those admitted in ICU were compared using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square or Fisher exact test when appropriate. Univariate logistic regression was first used to identify variables on admission that were associated with the outcome i.e. admission to an ICU versus total hospital stay in a medical ward. Forward selection was then applied beginning with sex, age and temperature in the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 412 patients included, 325 were discharged and 87 died in hospital. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of ICU hospitalization with temperature (OR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.06–2.28] per degree Celsius increase), oxygen saturation <90% (OR, 12.45 [95% CI, 5.27–29.4]), abnormal lung auscultation on admission (OR, 3.58 [95% CI, 1.58–8.11]), elevated level of CRP (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.29–5.66for CRP>100mg/L vs CRP<10mg/L). and monocytopenia (OR, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.4–7.68]) were also associated with increasing odds of ICU hospitalization. Older patients were less likely to be hospitalized in ICU (OR, 0.17 [95%CI, 0.05–0.51]. CONCLUSIONS: Age and delay between onset of symptoms and hospital admission were associated with the risk of hospitalisation in ICU. Age being a fixed variable, interventions that shorten this delay would improve the prognosis of Covid-19 patients.","Vanhems, Philippe; Gustin, Marie-Paule; Elias, Christelle; Henaff, Laetitia; Dananché, Cédric; Grisi, Béatrice; Marion, Elodie; Khanafer, Nagham; Hilliquin, Delphine; Gardes, Sophie; Gerbier-Colomban, Solweig; Amour, Selilah; Kuczewski, Elisabetta; Escuret, Vanessa; Lina, Bruno; Saadatian-Elahi, Mitra",PLoS One,65,1

The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R(0)) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus’ transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking, may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19’s vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The “open orientation” of Clade G spike protein’s three peptides as opposed to the “closed orientation” of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike protein’s hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.","Baron, Yves Muscat",Med Hypotheses,65,1

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study assessing the attitude of EMS providers to work during disease outbreaks. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were performed to assess attitudes toward reporting for duty and factors that influence providers’ decisions. RESULTS: Of the 500 surveys distributed, 466 (93.2%) were complete and included for analysis. The majority of participants (70.2%) are male with a mean age of 27 (SD 4.3) years. The study found that the majority (71.1%) of participants are willing to come to work during disease outbreaks. The study found 7 predictors of reporting for duty. Confidence that employer will provide adequate protective gear was the most significant predictor (odds ratio [OR], 3.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.31-5.42). Concern for family safety was the most important barrier against coming to work (OR, 0.40; 95% CI = 0.21-0.73).

However, there is a dearth of information on the etiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Africa, including Niger. METHODS: We implemented a retrospective study as part of national influenza sentinel surveillance in Niger. We randomly selected a sample of nasopharyngeal specimens collected from children <5 years of age hospitalized with SARI from January 2010 through December 2012 in Niger. The samples were selected from individuals that tested negative by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza A and B virus. The samples were analyzed using the Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21plus Kit (BioMérieux, Luxemburg), which detects 23 respiratory pathogens including 18 viral and 5 bacterial agents. RESULTS: Among the 160 samples tested, 138 (86 %) tested positive for at least one viral or bacterial pathogen; in 22 (16 %) sample, only one pathogen was detected. We detected at least one respiratory virus in 126 (78 %) samples and at least one bacterium in 102 (64 %) samples. Respiratory syncytial virus (56/160; 35 %), rhinovirus (47/160; 29 %) and parainfluenza virus (39/160; 24 %) were the most common viral pathogens detected. Among bacterial pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae (90/160; 56 %) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (20/160; 12 %) predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of certain viral and bacterial pathogens among children <5 years of age with SARI highlights the need for continued and expanded surveillance in Niger.","Lagare, Adamou; Maïnassara, Halima Boubacar; Issaka, Bassira; Sidiki, Ali; Tempia, Stefano",BMC Infect Dis,65,24

Besides respiratory complications in patients with COVID-19, clinical characterization of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure, and septic shock. To better understand the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19, we interrogated the virus's presence in the peripheral blood cells, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By analyzing >2 billion sequence reads of high-throughput transcriptome sequence data from 180 samples of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection or healthy controls collected from 6 studies, we found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two samples from two independent studies. In contrast, the viral RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a “viral spike-to-actin” RNA normalization as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in total human RNA abundance.

This review summarizes recent literature on fomite contamination and microbial survival in the built environment, transmission between fomites and humans, and implications for human health. RECENT FINDINGS: Applications of molecular sequencing techniques to analyze microbial samples have increased our understanding of the microbial diversity that exists in the built environment. This growing body of research has established that microbial communities on surfaces include substantial diversity, with considerable dynamics. While many microbial taxa likely die or lay dormant, some organisms survive, including those that are potentially beneficial, benign, or pathogenic. Surface characteristics also influence microbial survival and rates of transfer to and from humans. Recent research has combined experimental data, mechanistic modeling, and epidemiological approaches to shed light on the likely contributors to microbial exchange between fomites and humans and their contributions to adverse (and even potentially beneficial) human health outcomes. SUMMARY: In addition to concerns for fomite transmission of potential pathogens, new analytical tools have uncovered other microbial matters that can be transmitted indirectly via fomites, including entire microbial communities and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Mathematical models and epidemiological approaches can provide insight on human health implications. However, both are subject to limitations associated with study design, and there is a need to better understand appropriate input model parameters. Fomites remain an important mechanism of transmission of many microbes, along with direct contact and short- and long-range aerosols.","Stephens, Brent; Azimi, Parham; Thoemmes, Megan S.; Heidarinejad, Mohammad; Allen, Joseph G.; Gilbert, Jack A.",Current pollution reports,65,30

Materials and Methods: A radiomics model was developed on the basis of 56 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 90 patients with influenza virus pneumonia in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted from CT images. The radiomics features were reduced by the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The radiomics model was built using the multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression. A nomogram of the radiomics model was established, and the decision curve showed the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram. Results: The radiomics features, consisting of nine selected features, were significantly different between COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza virus pneumonia in both training and validation data sets. The receiver operator characteristic curve of the radiomics model showed good discrimination in the training sample [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.909; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.859–0.958] and in the validation sample (AUC, 0.911; 95% CI, 0.753–1.000).

Les patientes étaient divisées en deux groupes selon la date de leur première consultation : G1 (avant la 2e vague de la COVID-19) et G2 (durant la 2e vague). Résultats L’étude a inclus 117 patientes. L’âge gestationnel à la première visite diabétologique était de 26,1±7,2 semaines d’aménorrhée. La magnésémie moyenne était de 0,68±0,1mg/L [0,33 ;0,98]. À peu près la moitié (49,6 %) avait une hypomagnésémie. Une femme sur 13 (7,7 %) avait une hypomagnésémie sévère. La prévalence de l’hypomagnésémie était de 45,5 % chez les primipares, 51,3 % chez les femmes en surpoids et de 66,7 % si antécédents d’hypertension artérielle ou de pré-eclampsie. Il n’y avait pas de corrélation significative entre la magnésémie et l’équilibre glycémique. Environ 69 % du G1 avaient une hypomagnésémie contre 19 % parmi celles du G2 (p <10−3). Conclusion La diminution de la prévalence de l’hypomagnésémie durant la deuxième vague de la COVID-19 pourrait être expliquée par l’automédication et l’augmentation de l’utilisation des compléments alimentaires. La recherche de l’automédication parmi ces patientes serait intéressante.","El Amri, A.; Sebai, I.; Abadlia, S.; Abdesslam, H.; Raddadi, S.; Bendag, N.; Yahyaoui, R.; Ben Brahim, A.; Ounaissa, K.; Amrouche, C.",Annales d'Endocrinologie,65,10

Design Narrative review Setting and Participants: Long-term care services and supports for older adults post-incarceration Methods Literature review and policy analysis Results Skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, adult foster homes, and informal care from family and friends compose LTSS for older adults, but their utilization suffers from access and payment complexities, especially for older adults post-incarceration. A combination of public-private partnerships, utilization of health professional trainees, and unique approaches to informal caregiver support, including direct compensation to caregivers, could help older adults reentering our communities following prison. Conclusions and Implications Long-standing gaps in US LTSS are revealed by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Older adults entering our communities from prison are particularly vulnerable and need unique solutions to aging care as they face stigma and access challenges not typically encountered by the general population. Our review and discussion offer guidance to systems, practitioners, and policy makers on how to improve the care of older adults post-incarceration.","Boucher, Nathan A.; Van Houtven, Courtney H.; Dawson, Walter D.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,65,26

Rapid antigen tests have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in symptomatic persons (2), but data are lacking on test performance in asymptomatic persons to inform expanded screening testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons (3). To evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, it was used along with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to analyze 3,419 paired specimens collected from persons aged ≥10 years at two community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona, during November 3-17, 2020. Viral culture was performed on 274 of 303 residual real-time RT-PCR specimens with positive results by either test (29 were not available for culture). Compared with real-time RT-PCR testing, the BinaxNOW antigen test had a sensitivity of 64.2% for specimens from symptomatic persons and 35.8% for specimens from asymptomatic persons, with near 100% specificity in specimens from both groups. Virus was cultured from 96 of 274 (35.0%) specimens, including 85 (57.8%) of 147 with concordant antigen and real-time RT-PCR positive results, 11 (8.9%) of 124 with false-negative antigen test results, and none of three with false-positive antigen test results. Among specimens positive for viral culture, sensitivity was 92.6% for symptomatic and 78.6% for asymptomatic individuals. When the pretest probability for receiving positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 is elevated (e.g., in symptomatic persons or in persons with a known COVID-19 exposure), a negative antigen test result should be confirmed by NAAT (1). Despite a lower sensitivity to detect infection, rapid antigen tests can be an important tool for screening because of their quick turnaround time, lower costs and resource needs, high specificity, and high positive predictive value (PPV) in settings of high pretest probability. The faster turnaround time of the antigen test can help limit transmission by more rapidly identifying infectious persons for isolation, particularly when used as a component of serial testing strategies.","Prince-Guerra, Jessica L.; Almendares, Olivia; Nolen, Leisha D.; Gunn, Jayleen K.

This study aims at comparing the ILI incidence of 2019-2020 influenza season with the incidence of COVID-19 cases in order to better understand the current epidemic and to evaluate whether the implementation of ILI surveillance system could succeed in early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 diffusion. METHODS: The distribution of ILI cases in the seasons 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 was taken in consideration and the curve trends were compared and analyzed according to geographical areas, age groups and time differences. RESULTS: The curve trends presented a similar pattern up to the 9(th) week; in fact, a reduction in the ILI incidence rate was observed in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 season but in the 2019-2020 an increase in the reported ILI emerged. The relation between the numbers reported by 2019-2020 ILI surveillance and those reported for COVID-19 is supported by the curve trends, the correspondence between age groups, the correspondence by geographical location, and also by the results of the nasopharyngeal swab tests performed. DISCUSSION: The influenza surveillance system is an effective tool for early detection of COVID-19. It may provide timely and high-quality data evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 burden among population with ILI. Implementation of the system has to be prioritized in order to identify any future novel respiratory pathogen with pandemic potential.","Grosso, Francesca; Castrofino, Ambra; Del Castillo, Gabriele; Galli, Cristina; Binda, Sandro; Pellegrinelli, Laura; Cereda, Danilo; Tirani, Marcello; Gramegna, Maria; Castaldi, Silvana; Pariani, Elena",J Infect Public Health,65,2

Patients were managed in a Specialist Respiratory High Dependency Unit. We present our experience on the usage of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and possible indicators of its success in this patient group. Methods: Data from patients (n=89) requiring mechanical ventilation during the months of March to April 2020, were retrospectively collected and analysed. 37 patients received IMV (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) without a CPAP trial beforehand. 52 patients underwent a CPAP trial, of which 21 patients successfully avoided intubation and ITU admission. Results: The 52 patients, prior to receiving CPAP had significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a low PaO2: FiO2 (PFR) (mean +/- SD 123 +/- 60 mmHg) and mean SpO2:FiO2 (SFR) (mean +/- SD: 140+/- 50). The main indicators of CPAP success were: higher SFR before and after CPAP, lower respiratory rate (RR) , lower Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and higher PFR prior to CPAP. Discussion: CPAP proved successful in 40% of COVID-19 patients presenting with AHRF. SFR, PFR, RR and NLR are predictors of such success. SFR can be used for effective real time monitoring of patients before and after CPAP to identify likelihood of success. Based on our results, we have suggested a modified CPAP management protocol in COVID-19. These findings can guide future studies and will allow improved triage of patients to either CPAP or IMV, in the event of a future COVID peak.","Ahmed, Y.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who developed chronic respiratory disease (CRD) following ECMO therapy, and investigate the association between newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRDs and 5-year all-cause mortality among ECMO survivors. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. All adult patients who underwent ECMO therapy in the intensive care unit between 2006 and 2014 were included. ECMO survivors were defined as those who survived for 365 days after ECMO therapy. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, lung disease due to external agents, obstructive sleep apnea, and lung tuberculosis were considered as CRDs. RESULTS: A total of 3055 ECMO survivors were included, and 345 (11.3%) were newly diagnosed with CRDs 365 days after ECMO therapy. The prevalence of asthma was the highest at 6.1% (185). In the multivariate logistic regression, ECMO survivors who underwent ECMO therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure had a 2.00-fold increase in post-ECMO CRD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39 to 2.89; P < 0.001). In the multivariate Cox regression, newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRD was associated with a 1.47-fold (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.86; P = 0.001) higher 5-year all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months after ECMO therapy, 11.3% of ECMO survivors were newly diagnosed with CRDs. Patients who underwent ECMO therapy for ARDS or respiratory failure were associated with a higher incidence of newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRD compared to those who underwent ECMO for other causes. Additionally, post-ECMO CRDs were associated with a higher 5-year all-cause mortality. Our results suggest that ECMO survivors with newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRD might be a high-risk group requiring dedicated interventions.

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very specific target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection. Moreover, many neutralizing antibodies are mapped to this domain, linking antibody response to RBD with neutralizing potential. Detection of IgG antibodies, rather than IgM or total antibodies, against RBD is likely to play a larger role in understanding antibody-mediated protection and vaccine response. Here we describe a rapid and stable RBD-based IgG ELISA test obtained through extensive optimization of the assay components and conditions. The test showed a specificity of 99.79% (95% CI: 98.82–99.99%) in a panel of pre-pandemic samples (n = 470) from different groups, i.e., pregnancy, fever, HCV, HBV, and autoantibodies positive. Test sensitivity was evaluated using sera from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals (n = 312) and found to be 53.33% (95% CI: 37.87–68.34%), 80.47% (95% CI: 72.53–86.94%), and 88.24% (95% CI: 82.05–92.88%) in panel 1 (days 0–13), panel 2 (days 14–20) and panel 3 (days 21–27), respectively. Higher sensitivity was achieved in symptomatic individuals and reached 92.14% (95% CI: 86.38–96.01%) for panel 3. Our test, with a shorter runtime, showed higher sensitivity than parallelly tested commercial ELISAs for SARS-CoV-2-IgG, i.e., Euroimmun and Zydus, even when equivocal results in the commercial ELISAs were considered positive. None of the tests, which are using different antigens, could detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in 10.5% RT-PCR positive individuals by the fourth week, suggesting the lack of IgG response.","Mehdi, Farha; Chattopadhyay, Souvick; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Yadav, Sarla; Kumar, Manjit; Sinha, Sangita Kumari; Goswami, Sandeep; Kshetrapal, Pallavi; Wadhwa, Nitya; Chandramouli Natchu, Uma; Sopory, Shailaja; Koundinya Desiraju, Bapu; Pandey, Anil K.; Das, Asim; Verma, Nikhil; Sharma, Nandini; Sharma, Pragya; Bhartia, Vandita; Gosain, Mudita; Lodha, Rakesh; Lamminmäki, Urpo; Shrivastava, Tripti; Bhatnagar, Shinjini; Batra, Gaurav",Front Microbiol,65,20

The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Methods The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. Results Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range 8–40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62 ± 4.44. The term ‘health risk stress’ refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all 7 questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions, but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. Conclusions In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease in order to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.","Luo, Yetao; Yao, Lili; Zhou, Li; Yuan, Feng; Zhong, Xiaoni",Public Health,65,24

We hypothesized that patients with dilated pancreatic ducts have improved postoperative outcomes with MIPD compared to OPD. METHODS: All patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy were prospectively followed over a time period of 47 months, and perioperative and pathologic covariates and outcomes were compared. Ideal outcome after PD was defined as follows: (1) no complications, (2) postoperative length of stay < 7 days, and (3) negative (R0) margins on pathology. Patients with dilated pancreatic ducts (≥ 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes compared. Likewise, patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts (< 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with non-dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: 371 patients underwent PD—74 (19.9%) MIPD and 297 (80.1%) underwent OPD. Overall, patients who underwent MIPD had significantly less intraoperative blood loss. After 1:3 propensity score matching, patients with dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 45) had significantly lower overall complication and 90-day readmission rates compared to matched OPD patients (n = 135) with dilated ducts. Patients with dilated duct who underwent MIPD were more likely to have an ideal outcome than patients with OPD (29 vs 15%, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in postoperative outcomes among propensity score-matched patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 29) compared to matched patients undergoing OPD (n = 87) with non-dilated ducts. CONCLUSIONS: MIPD is safe with comparable perioperative outcomes to OPD. Patients with pancreatic ducts ≥ 3 mm appear to derive the most benefit from MIPD in terms of fewer complications, lower readmission rates, and higher likelihood of ideal outcome.

This article reviews current and new trends in NORA, trends in anesthesia management in nonoperating room settings, and the evolving debates surrounding these trends. RECENT FINDINGS: National data suggests that NORA cases will continue to rise relative to operating room (OR) anesthesia and there will continue to be a shift towards performing more interventional procedures outside of the OR. These trends have important implications for the safety of interventional procedures as they become increasingly more complex and patients continue to be older and more frail. In order for anesthesia providers and proceduralists to be prepared for this future, rigorous standards must be set for safe anesthetic care outside of the OR.Although the overall association between NORA and patient morbidity and mortality remains unclear, focused studies point toward trends specific to each non-OR procedure type. Given increasing patient and procedure complexity, anesthesiology teams may see a larger role in the interventional suite. However, the ideal setting and placement of anesthesia staff for interventional procedures remain controversial. Also, the impact of COVID-19 on the growth and utilization of non-OR anesthesia remains unclear, and it remains to be seen how the pandemic will influence the delivery of NORA procedures in postpandemic settings. SUMMARY: NORA is a rapidly growing field of anesthesia. Continuing discussions of complication rates and mortality in different subspecialty areas will determine the need for anesthesia care and quality improvement efforts in each setting. As new noninvasive procedures are developed, new data will continue to shape debates surrounding anesthesia care outside of the operating room.","Du, Austin L; Robbins, Kimberly; Waterman, Ruth S; Urman, Richard D; Gabriel, Rodney A",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,65,20

The incidence of KD increased in Taiwan over the past few decades. Taiwanese government executed domains of early screening, effective methods for isolation or quarantine, and digital technologies for identifying potential cases for the early elimination strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and public health interventions for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an effective reduction of the risk of airway infections in children. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether those public health interventions reduce the incidence of KD in 2020. Methods: Patients with KD who visited Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) between 1 January, 2018, and 31 December, 2020 were included for trend analysis. This is a retrospective case series study conducted at the CGMH, which consists of a network of seven hospital branches equipped with more than 10,000 beds in different areas of Taiwan. Results: Compared with the 2018 and 2019 databases, the incidence of KD decreased significantly by 30% and 31%, respectively (p < 0.05) in 2020, when public health interventions were comprehensively implemented in Taiwan. This result shows that the incidence of KD decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan without change of the presentation KD (typical or incomplete) and percentage of IVIG resistance in 2020. Conclusion: As public health interventions were carried out for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the incidence of KD was significantly reduced in Taiwan.

Along with the rapid rise of novel forms of intensive aquaculture, increased global aquatic animal movement and various anthropogenic stress to aquatic ecosystems during the past century, freshwater fish farming industry encounter the emergence and breakout of many diseases, especially viral diseases. Because of the ability to safely and effectively prevent aquaculture diseases, vaccines have become the mainstream technology for prevention and control of aquatic diseases in the world. In this review, authors summarized six major cyprinid viral diseases, including koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD), spring viraemia of carp (SVC), grass carp hemorrhagic disease (GCHD), koi sleepy disease (KSD), carp pox disease (CPD) and herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis (HPHN). The present review described the characteristics of these diseases from epidemiology, pathology, etiology and diagnostics. Furthermore, the development of specific vaccines respective to these diseases is stated according to preparation methods and immunization approaches. It is hoped that the review could contribute to aquaculture in prevention and controlling of cyprinid viral diseases, and serve the healthy and sustainable development of aquaculture industry.","Su, Hang; Su, Jianguo",Fish Shellfish Immunol,65,20

The cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are likely largely independent of their glycaemic effects, and this understanding is central to the use of these agents in the high-risk population of people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. There are a number of potential safety issues associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. These include the rare but serious risks of diabetic ketoacidosis and necrotising fasciitis of the perineum. The data regarding a possibly increased risk of lower limb amputation and fracture with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy are conflicting. This article aims to explore the potential safety issues associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a particular focus on the safety of these drugs in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. We discuss strategies that clinicians can implement to minimise the risk of adverse effects including diabetic ketoacidosis and volume depletion.

The primary aim of this study was to measure whether electrochemical skin conductance, as a measure of peripheral sympathetic autonomic function, is altered by SCS. A second aim was to compare skin conductance levels of patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Twenty-three patients with FBSS treated with SCS participated in this study. Sudomotor function was measured with the Sudoscan(TM) instrument on the hands and feet during SCS on and off states. Difference scores in skin conductance between patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls were calculated. Normal sudomotor function at the painful lower limb was revealed for 61% of the patients when SCS was activated. Skin conductance levels were not altered between on and off states of SCS. Differences in scores between patients and healthy controls were significantly different from zero. This study showed that SCS does not influencing the sympathetic nervous system in patients with FBSS, as measured by skin conductance levels. Moreover, it suggested that there is no normalization of the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system, despite the effectiveness of SCS to reduce pain intensity.","Goudman, Lisa; Vets, Nieke; Jansen, Julie; De Smedt, Ann; Billot, Maxime; Rigoard, Philippe; Cordenier, Ann; Engelborghs, Sebastiaan; Scafoglieri, Aldo; Moens, Maarten",J Clin Med,65,28

The present study design determines the diagnostic value of LUSS in the semi‐quantitative assessment of pneumonia in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) neonates. METHODS: Eleven COVID‐19 neonates born to mothers with COVID‐19 infection and 11 age‐ and gender‐matched controls were retrospectively studied. LUSS was acquired by assessing the lesions and aeration loss in 12 lung regions per subject. RESULTS: Most of the COVID‐19 newborns presented with mild and atypical symptoms, mainly involving respiratory and digestive systems. In the COVID‐19 group, a total of 132 regions of the lung were examined, 83 regions (62.8%) of which were detected abnormalities by LUS. Compared with controls, COVID‐19 neonates showed sparse or confluent B‐lines (83 regions), disappearing A‐lines (83 regions), abnormal pleural lines (29 regions), and subpleural consolidations (2 regions). The LUSS was significantly higher in the COVID‐19 group. In total, 49 regions (37%) were normal, 73 regions (55%) scored 1, and 10 regions (8%) scored 2 by LUSS. All the lesions were bilateral, with multiple regions involved. The majority of the lesions were located in the bilateral inferior and posterior regions. LUS detected abnormalities in three COVID‐19 neonates with normal radiological performance. The intra‐observer and inter‐observer reproducibility of LUSS was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a noninvasive, convenient, and sensitive method to assess neonatal COVID‐19 pneumonia, and can be used as an alternative to the use of diagnostic radiography. LUSS provides valuable semi‐quantitative information on the lesion distribution and severity.","Li, Wei; Fu, Manli; Qian, Chao; Liu, Xin; Zeng, Lingkong; Peng, Xuehua; Hong, Yue; Zhou, Huan; Yuan, Li",Pediatr Pulmonol,65,3

In three experiments, participants read short stories, like “Alex went running with Liz. They fell down.” Answers to “Who fell down” indicated whether participants interpreted they as Alex or Alex-and-Liz. We found more singular responses in discourse contexts that make Alex more available: when Alex was either the only person in the context or mentioned first. Critically, the singular interpretation was stronger when participants heard explicit instructions that Alex uses they/them pronouns, even though participants in all conditions had ample opportunity to learn this fact through observation.

Among other things, this will entail devoting more attention to the evaluation of upstream intervention strategies. However, merely increasing the supply of such studies is not enough. The pivotal link between research and policy or practice should be the cumulation of insight from multiple studies. If conventional evidence synthesis can be thought of as analogous to building a wall, then we can increase the supply of bricks (the number of studies), their similarity (statistical commensurability) or the strength of the mortar (the statistical methods for holding them together). However, many contemporary public health challenges seem akin to herding sheep in mountainous terrain, where ordinary walls are of limited use and a more flexible way of combining dissimilar stones (pieces of evidence) may be required. This would entail shifting towards generalising the functions of interventions, rather than their effects; towards inference to the best explanation, rather than relying on binary hypothesis-testing; and towards embracing divergent findings, to be resolved by testing theories across a cumulated body of work. In this way we might channel a spirit of pragmatic pluralism into making sense of complex sets of evidence, robust enough to support more plausible causal inference to guide action, while accepting and adapting to the reality of the public health landscape rather than wishing it were otherwise. The traditional art of dry stone walling can serve as a metaphor for the more ‘holistic sense-making’ we propose.","Ogilvie, David; Bauman, Adrian; Foley, Louise; Guell, Cornelia; Humphreys, David; Panter, Jenna",BMJ Glob Health,65,3

OBJECTIVE: To understand the effects of the pandemic and response on anxiety and health utility in a nationally representative sample of US adults. DESIGN: A de-identified, cross-sectional survey was administered at the end of April 2020. Probability weights were assigned using estimates from the 2018 American Community Survey and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Estimates. PARTICIPANTS: US adults 18–85 years of age with landline, texting-enabled cellphone, or internet access. INTERVENTION: Seven split-half survey blocks of 30 questions, assessing demographics, COVID-19-related health attitudes, and standardized measures of generalized self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, personality, and generic health utility. MAIN MEASURES: State/Trait anxiety scores, EQ-5D-3L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and demographic predictors of these scores. KEY RESULTS: Among 4855 respondents, 56.7% checked COVID-19-related news several times daily, and 84.4% at least once daily. Only 65.7% desired SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for themselves, and 70.1% for their child. Mean state anxiety (S-anxiety) score was significantly higher than mean trait anxiety (T-anxiety) score (44.9, 95%CI 43.5–46.3 vs. 41.6, 95%CI 38.7–44.5; p = 0.03), with both scores significantly higher than previously published norms. In an adjusted regression model, less frequent news viewing was associated with significantly lower S-anxiety score. Mean EQ-5D-3L VAS score for the population was significantly lower vs. established US normative data (71.4 CI 67.4–75.5, std. error 2 vs. societal mean 80, std. error 0.1; p < 0.001). EQ-5D-3L VAS score was bimodal (highest with hourly and no viewing) and significantly reduced with less media viewership in an adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Among a nationally representative sample, there were higher S-anxiety and lower EQ-5D-3L VAS scores compared to non-pandemic normative data, indicative of a potential detrimental acute effect of the pandemic. More frequent daily media viewership was significantly associated with higher S-anxiety but also predictive of higher health utility, as measured by EQ-5D-3L VAS scores.

The classical RAS as it looked in the middle 1970s consisted of circulating renin, acting on angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which in turn was converted into angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II, still considered the main effector of RAS was believed to act only as a circulating hormone via angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. Since then, an expanded view of RAS has gradually emerged. Local tissue RAS systems have been identified in most organs. Recently, evidence for an intracellular RAS has been reported. The new expanded view of RAS therefore covers both endocrine, paracrine and intracrine functions. Other peptides of RAS have been shown to have biological actions; angiotensin 2–8 heptapeptide (Ang III) has actions similar to those of Ang II. Further, the angiotensin 3–8 hexapeptide (Ang IV) exerts its actions via insulin‐regulated amino peptidase receptors. Finally, angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7) acts via mas receptors. The discovery of another ACE2 was an important complement to this picture. The recent discovery of renin receptors has made our view of RAS unexpectedly complex and multilayered. The importance of RAS in cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated by the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers. Great expectations are now generated by the introduction of renin inhibitors. Indeed, RAS regulates much more and diverse physiological functions than previously believed.","Fyhrquist, F.; Saijonmaa, O.",J Intern Med,65,1

Infection by EboV involves fusion between the virus and host cell membranes mediated by the envelope glycoprotein GP2 of the virus. Similar to the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the central feature of the GP2 ectodomain postfusion structure is a six-helix bundle formed by the protein's N- and C-heptad repeat regions (NHR and CHR, respectively). Folding of this six-helix bundle provides the energetic driving force for membrane fusion; in other viruses, designed agents that disrupt formation of the six-helix bundle act as potent fusion inhibitors. To interrogate determinants of EboV GP2-mediated membrane fusion, we designed model proteins that consist of the NHR and CHR segments linked by short protein linkers. Circular dichroism and gel filtration studies indicate that these proteins adopt stable α-helical folds consistent with design. Thermal denaturation indicated that the GP2 six-helix bundle is highly stable at pH 5.3 (melting temperature, T(m), of 86.8 ± 2.0°C and van't Hoff enthalpy, ΔH(vH), of −28.2 ± 1.0 kcal/mol) and comparable in stability to other viral membrane fusion six-helix bundles. We found that the stability of our designed α-helical bundle proteins was dependent on buffering conditions with increasing stability at lower pH. Small pH differences (5.3–6.1) had dramatic effects (ΔT(m) = 37°C) suggesting a mechanism for conformational control that is dependent on environmental pH. These results suggest a role for low pH in stabilizing six-helix bundle formation during the process of GP2-mediated viral membrane fusion.","Harrison, Joseph S; Higgins, Chelsea D; Chandran, Kartik; Lai, Jonathan R",Protein Science,65,24

Recently, low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with higher risks for contracting COVID-19. South Asians in the UK have higher risk for low vitamin D levels. In this study, we assessed vitamin D status of British-Bangladeshi migrants compared to white British residents and Bangladeshis still living in Bangladesh (‘sedentees’). METHODOLOGY: The cross-sectional study compared serum vitamin D levels among 149 women aged 35-59, comprising British-Bangladeshi migrants (n = 50), white UK neighbors (n = 54) and Bangladeshi sedentees (n = 45). Analyses comprised multivariate models to assess serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and associations with anthropometric, lifestyle, health and migration factors. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants were very low: mean 25(OH)D = 32.2 nmol/L ± 13.0, with 29% of migrants classified as deficient (<25nmol/L) and 94% deficient or insufficient (≤50nmol/L). Mean levels of vitamin D were significantly lower among British-Bangladeshis compared to Bangladeshi sedentees (50.9 nmol/L ± 13.3, (p < 0.001), and were also lower than in white British women (55.3 nmol/L ± 20.9). Lower levels of vitamin D were associated with increased body mass index and low iron status. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that lower exposure to sunlight in the UK reduces Vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants. Recommending supplements could prevent potentially adverse health outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency. LAY SUMMARY: Vitamin D deficiency is one example of mismatch between an evolved trait and novel environments. Here we compare vitamin D status of dark-skinned British-Bangladeshi migrants in the UK to Bangladeshis in Bangladesh and white British individuals.

Previous studies of BRD focused on ante‐mortem samples from the upper respiratory tract and identified several unconventional viruses. The lung, however, is the primary location where significant BRD lesions are usually found and is a common post‐mortem diagnostic specimen. In this study, results of high‐throughput virome sequencing, bacterial culture, targeted real‐time PCR and histological examination of 130 bovine pneumonic lungs from western Canadian cattle were combined to explore associations of microorganisms with different types of pneumonia. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia (FBP) was the predominant type of pneumonia (46.2%, 60/130) and was associated with the detection of Mannheimia haemolytica. Detection of Histophilus somni and Pasteurella multocida was associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP) and concurrent bronchopneumonia and bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BP&BIP), respectively. Sixteen viruses were identified, of which bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) was the most prevalent (11.5%, 15/130) followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1, 8.5%, 11/130) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV, 8.5%, 11/130). None of these viruses, however, were significantly associated with a particular type of pneumonia. Unconventional viruses such as influenza D virus (IDV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were detected, although sparsely, consistent with our previous findings in upper respiratory tract samples. Taken together, our results show that while virus detection in post‐mortem lung samples is of relatively little diagnostic value, the strong associations of H. somni and M. haemolytica with SBP and FBP, respectively, indicate that histopathology can be useful in differentiating bacterial aetiologies.","Zhang, Maodong; Hill, Janet E.; Godson, Dale L.; Ngeleka, Musangu; Fernando, Champika; Huang, Yanyun",Transbound Emerg Dis,65,18

We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. METHODS: We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. RESULTS: Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of −5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to −0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are −0.25, −0.20 and −3.51 years, respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. CONCLUSION: Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years, there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to ‘build back better’.","McCartney, Gerry; Leyland, Alastair; Walsh, David; Ruth, Dundas",J Epidemiol Community Health,65,10

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective social skills interventions that can be delivered directly via telehealth. The Cool Versus Not Cool procedure has continually been documented as effective within the literature. However, its reported use has been limited to in-person delivery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure conducted via telehealth to teach three children diagnosed with ASD to change the conversation when someone is bored. The results of a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline across-participants design demonstrated that all three participants reached the mastery criterion in four to eight sessions. Responding generalized to another adult for two of the three participants, and all three participants maintained correct responding. Social validity measures indicated the skill was important to teach, the intervention was acceptable and effective, and the telehealth format was an acceptable replacement for in-person intervention for these three participants.","Cihon, Joseph H.; Ferguson, Julia L.; Lee, Matthew; Leaf, Justin B.; Leaf, Ron; McEachin, John",Behav Anal Pract,65,1

Healthcare in humanitarian and fragile settings is challenging and complex to provide, particularly for children. Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of medical literature from humanitarian settings to guide best practice in such specific and resource-limited contexts. In light of these challenges, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international medical humanitarian organisation, created the MSF Paediatric Days with the aim of uniting field staff, policymakers and academia to exchange ideas, align efforts, inspire and share frontline research and experiences to advance humanitarian paediatric and neonatal care. This 2-day event takes place regularly since 2016. The fourth edition of the MSF Paediatric Days in April 2021 covered five main topics: essential newborn care, community-based models of care, paediatric tuberculosis, antimicrobial resistance in neonatal and paediatric care and the collateral damage of COVID-19 on child health. In addition, eight virtual stands from internal MSF initiatives and external MSF collaborating partners were available, and 49 poster communications and five inspiring short talks referred to as ‘PAEDTalks’ were presented. In conclusion, the MSF Paediatric Days serves as a unique forum to advance knowledge on humanitarian paediatrics and creates opportunities for individual and collective learning, as well as networking spaces for interaction and exchange of ideas.","Janet, Sophie; Russell, Neal; Morton, Nikola; Martinez, Daniel; Tamannai, Mona; Lafferty, Nadia; Roggeveen, Harriet; Ogundipe, Oluwakemi F.; Carreras, Inmaculada; Gao, Anja; Didier, Elise; Petrucci, Roberta",BMJ Paediatr Open,65,3

This article reviews the neuroimaging manifestations of COVID-19 on CT and MRI, presenting cases from the New York City metropolitan region encountered by the authors during the first surge of the pandemic. The most common neuroimaging manifestations are acute infarcts with large clot burden and intracranial hemorrhage, including microhemorrhages. However, a wide range of additional imaging patterns occur, including leukoencephalopathy, global hypoxic injury, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum, olfactory bulb involvement, cranial nerve enhancement, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The described CNS abnormalities largely represent secondary involvement from immune activation that leads to a prothrombotic state and cytokine storm; evidence for direct neuroinvasion is scant. Comorbidities such as hypertension, complications of prolonged illness and hospitalization, and associated supportive treatments also contribute to the CNS involvement in COVID-19. Routine long-term neurologic follow-up may be warranted, given emerging evidence of long-term microstructural and functional changes on brain imaging after COVID-19 recovery.","Moonis, Gul; Filippi, Christopher G; Kirsch, Claudia F E; Mohan, Suyash; Stein, Evan G; Hirsch, Joshua A; Mahajan, Amit",AJR Am J Roentgenol,65,16

In the last two decades, mortality rates for Indonesian pilgrims ranged between 200–380 deaths per 100,000 pilgrims over the 10-week Hajj period. Reasons for high mortality are not well understood. In 2008, verbal autopsy was introduced to complement routine death certificates to explore cause of death diagnoses. This study presents the patterns and causes of death for Indonesian pilgrims, and compares routine death certificates to verbal autopsy findings. METHODS: Public health surveillance was conducted by Indonesian public health authorities accompanying pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, with daily reporting of hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance data from 2008 were analyzed for timing, geographic location and site of death. Percentages for each cause of death category from death certificates were compared to that from verbal autopsy. RESULTS: In 2008, 206,831 Indonesian undertook the Hajj. There were 446 deaths, equivalent to 1,968 deaths per 100,000 pilgrim years. Most pilgrims died in Mecca (68%) and Medinah (24%). There was no statistically discernible difference in the total mortality risk for the two pilgrimage routes (Mecca or Medinah first), but the number of deaths peaked earlier for those traveling to Mecca first (p=0.002). Most deaths were due to cardiovascular (66%) and respiratory (28%) diseases. A greater proportion of deaths were attributed to cardiovascular disease by death certificate compared to the verbal autopsy method (p<0.001). Significantly more deaths had ill-defined cause based on verbal autopsy method (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite pre-departure health screening and other medical services, Indonesian pilgrim mortality rates were very high. Correct classification of cause of death is critical for the development of risk mitigation strategies. Since verbal autopsy classified causes of death differently to death certificates, further studies are needed to assess the method’s utility in this setting.","Pane, Masdalina; Imari, Sholah; Alwi, Qomariah; Nyoman Kandun, I; Cook, Alex R.; Samaan, Gina",PLoS One,65,26

It often impacts negatively on the self and others across cultures. During the Covid-19 crises, shame has become an important emotion with a powerful effect, depending on how it is experienced within the socio-cultural context. This article explores shame in international perspectives in the context of Covid-19 and addresses the question how shame is transformed from an existential positive psychology (PP2.0) perspective. The study uses a qualitative research paradigm and explores shame and its transformation during Covid-19. Purposeful and snowball sampling was used. The sample consisted of 24 individuals (16 female, 8 male), of 13 different nationalities. Data were collected from written interviews and analyzed through thematic analysis. Ethical considerations were followed; ethical approval was given by a university. Findings show that participants become very worried, anxious, scared, sad, and shocked when they or individuals in their close relationships contracted Covid-19. Shame plays an important role during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the meaning and experience of shame during Covid-19 is strongly dependent on the socio-cultural background of the individual who is experiencing the disease. Individuals use different strategies and mechanisms to deal with and transform shame in the context of Covid-19.","Mayer, Claude-Hélène; Vanderheiden, Elisabeth",Front Psychol,65,22

Angiotensin II is the central effector molecule of the activated renin–angiotensin system and is degraded by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to angiotensin (1–7). The novel coronavirus infection (classified as COVID-19) is caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to severe manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death in a proportion of patients, mostly elderly patients with preexisting comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to enter the target cells, resulting in activation of the renin–angiotensin system. After downregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II is increasingly produced and its counterregulating molecules angiotensin (1–7) reduced. Angiotensin II increases thrombin formation and impairs fibrinolysis. Elevated levels were strongly associated with viral load and lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the complex clinical picture of patients with severe complications of COVID-19 is triggered by the various effects of highly expressed angiotensin II on vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Future treatment options should focus on blocking the thrombogenic and inflammatory properties of angiotensin II in COVID-19 patients.","Miesbach, Wolfgang",TH Open,65,1

In brief, Western medicine is primarily an evidence (laboratory)-based science, whereas TCM is more of a healing art based on the theory of Yin and Yang and the five elements in the human body. Therefore, whether TCM and Western medicine could use similar philosophical approaches to treat disease remains unclear. It is well-known that vitamin D enhances immune function and reduces the spread of some viruses. Indeed, recent evidence shows that the blood calcium level is strongly associated with COVID-19 severity, and vitamin D supplementation has shown favorable effects in viral infections. According to TCM theory, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is closely associated with cold-dampness, an etiological factor in TCM. Cold-dampness could be attenuated by sun exposure and Wenyang herbs, both of which can restore the vitamin D level in the blood in Western medicine. Therefore, TCM and Western medicine could share similar philosophical methods to fight COVID-19 and understanding their philosophical theories could achieve the maximum benefits for treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Zhao, Fangfang; Yang, Zhenhong; Wang, Ningqun; Jin, Kunlin; Luo, Yumin",Aging Dis,65,30

Methods: We analyzed 255 serum specimens from 130 COVID-19 patients and examined clinical records and laboratory data. Presence of total (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and specific IgG antibody for the spike 1 antigen of SARS-CoV2 was determined using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. Findings: Overall, 98 (75.4%) and 32 (24.6%) patients had mild and severe COVID-19, respectively. On admission, 76 (58.5%) and 45 (34.6%) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody assays. Among 91 patients at discharge, 90 (98.9%) and 81 (89.0%) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody, respectively.

UPR activates three distinct signalling pathways. Additionally, UPR induces autophagy (UPR-autophagy pathways). On the other hand, it has become clear that some positive-single-strand RNA viruses utilize autophagy. Some groups have used the siRNA silencing approach to show that autophagy is required for HCV RNA replication. However, the mechanism of induction of the UPR-autophagy pathways remain unclear in the cells with HCV. Method and results: we used a genome-length HCV RNA (strain O of genotype 1b) replication system (OR6) in hepatoma cells (HuH-7-derived OR6 cells). As control, we used OR6c cells from which the HCV genome had been removed by treatment with interferon-α. The UPR-autophagy pathways were activated to a greater degree in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Rapamycin, mTOR-independent autophagy inducer, activated HCV replication in the OR6 cells. On the other hand, HCV replication in the cells was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. Salubrinal (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2(eIF2)-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-ethoxy-5, 6-dibromosalicylaldehyde (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor) inhibited HCV replication and autophagy. Additionally, HCV replication and autophagy were inhibited more strongly by combination of these inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that UPR-autophagy pathways exert an influence on HCV replication. Therefore, control these pathways may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against replication of HCV.","Shinohara, Yoshiyasu; Imajo, Kento; Yoneda, Masato; Tomeno, Wataru; Ogawa, Yuji; Kirikoshi, Hiroyuki; Funakoshi, Kengo; Ikeda, Masanori; Kato, Nobuyuki; Nakajima, Atsushi; Saito, Satoru",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,65,16

Such discontinuous transcription is unique yet poorly understood for arterivirus. The utilization of transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) remains a puzzle, as many TRS-like sequences exist in viral genome, yet only six or seven sg mRNAs were transcribed in arterivirus infected cells. To investigate the transcriptional control of the porcine arterivirus, a recombinant PRRSV infectious cDNA clone pCPV expressing the capsid gene of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) between PRRSV ORF1b and ORF2a was developed. The rescued recombinant viruses contained a range of disparate deletions of the inserted PCV2 sequence, yet two stable recombinant viruses containing 41 and 275 nt of foreign sequences were generated upon plaque purification and serial passages. Further analysis of the sg RNA2 profile revealed that an array of novel sg RNA species was generated in cells infected with the recombinant virus. One group was formed by utilizing the inserted PCV2 sequence as TRS; another group was generated from cryptic TRS-like PRRSV sequences located 19, 37 and 97 nt immediately downstream of the PRRSV ORF2 AUG. These results demonstrated that (1) the recombinant virus from direct insertion of foreign sequences was genetically unstable, while two recombinant PRRSVs containing foreign sequence of 41 or 275 nt in length, respectively, became stable upon plaque purification and further serial passages; (2) PRRSV can utilize foreign TRS-like sequence as transcriptional promoter; (3) the insertion of foreign sequence provoked the generation of novel subgenomic RNAs utilizing cryptic TRS-like sequences that remain non-functional in native PRRSV.","Zheng, Haihong; Sun, Zhi; Zhu, Xing-Quan; Long, Jinxue; Lu, Jiaqi; Lv, Jian; Yuan, Shishan",Virus Res,65,20

Previous studies have suggested a role for both N and hnRNP-A1 proteins in MHV RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether the two proteins can interact with each other. Here we employed a series of methods to determine their interactions both in vitro and in vivo. Both N and hnRNP-A1 genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and their interactions were determined with a GST-binding assay. Results showed that N protein directly and specifically interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vitro. To dissect the protein-binding domain on the N protein, 15 deletion constructs were made by PCR and expressed as GST fusion proteins. Two hnRNP-A1-binding sites were identified on N protein: site A is located at amino acids 1 to 292 and site B at amino acids 392 to 455. In addition, we found that N protein interacted with itself and that the self-interacting domain coincided with site A but not with site B. Using a fluorescence double-staining technique, we showed that N protein colocalized with hnRNP-A1 in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region, of MHV-infected cells, where viral RNA replication/transcription occurs. The N protein and hnRNP-A1 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of MHV-infected cells either by an N- or by an hnRNP-A1-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating a physical interaction between N and hnRNP-A1 proteins. Furthermore, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that N protein interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vivo. These results thus establish that MHV N protein interacts with hnRNP-A1 both in vitro and in vivo.","Wang, Yicheng; Zhang, Xuming",Virology,65,20

The testis and prostate produce semen. At present, there are contradictory reports about whether SARS-CoV-2 can exist in the semen of infected men. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive overview of the topic of whether COVID-19 can impact on male reproductive system. METHODS: We reviewed the relevant publications on the possible impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on male reproductive system and summarized the latest and most important research results so far. Literature published in English from December 2019 to January 31, 2021 regarding the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, testis, and prostatic fluid and the effects of COVID-19 on male reproductive were included. RESULTS: We identified 28 related studies, only one of which reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The study found that the semen quality of patients with moderate infection was lower than that of patients with mild infection and healthy controls. The impaired semen quality may be related to fever and inflammation. Pathological analysis of the testis/epididymis showed that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were positive in 10 testicular samples, and the spermatogenic function of the testis was impaired. All 94 expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSION: The likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of COVID-19 patients is very small, and semen should rarely be regarded as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. However, COVID-19 may cause testicular spermatogenic dysfunction via immune or inflammatory reactions. Long-term follow-up is needed for COVID-19 male patients and fetuses conceived during the father’s infection period.","He, Yanfei; Wang, Jie; Ren, Junlin; Zhao, Yubo; Chen, Jing; Chen, Xuejiao",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),65,20

World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this COVID-19 as a pandemic due to its rapid spread across different countries within a few days. Several research works are being performed to understand the various influential factors responsible for spreading COVID. However, limited studies have been performed on how climatic and sociodemographic conditions may impact the spread of the virus. In this work, we aim to find the relationship of socio-demographic conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and population density of the regions, with the spread of COVID-19. The COVID data for different countries along with the social data are collected. For the experimental purpose, Fuzzy association rule mining is employed to infer the various relationships from the data. Moreover, to examine the seasonal effect, a streaming setting is also considered. The experimental results demonstrate various interesting insights to understand the impact of different factors on spreading COVID-19.","Chatterjee, Sujoy; Chakrabarty, Deepmala; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban",Methods,65,22

The identification of synergistic drug combinations, however, is challenging. Detailed understanding of antibiotic mechanisms can address this issue by facilitating the rational design of improved combination therapies. Here, using diverse biochemical and genetic assays, we examine the molecular mechanisms of niclosamide, a clinically approved salicylanilide compound, and demonstrate its potential for Gram-negative combination therapies. We discovered that Gram-negative bacteria possess two innate resistance mechanisms that reduce their niclosamide susceptibility: a primary mechanism mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and a secondary mechanism of nitroreduction. When efflux was compromised, niclosamide became a potent antibiotic, dissipating the proton motive force (PMF), increasing oxidative stress, and reducing ATP production to cause cell death. These insights guided the identification of diverse compounds that synergized with salicylanilides when coadministered (efflux inhibitors, membrane permeabilizers, and antibiotics that are expelled by PMF-dependent efflux), thus suggesting that salicylanilide compounds may have broad utility in combination therapies. We validate these findings in vivo using a murine abscess model, where we show that niclosamide synergizes with the membrane permeabilizing antibiotic colistin against high-density infections of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates. We further demonstrate that enhanced nitroreductase activity is a potential route to adaptive niclosamide resistance but show that this causes collateral susceptibility to clinical nitro-prodrug antibiotics. Thus, we highlight how mechanistic understanding of mode of action, innate/adaptive resistance, and synergy can rationally guide the discovery, development, and stewardship of novel combination therapies.","Copp, Janine N.; Pletzer, Daniel; Brown, Alistair S.; Van der Heijden, Joris; Miton, Charlotte M.; Edgar, Rebecca J.; Rich, Michelle H.; Little, Rory F.; Williams, Elsie M.; Hancock, Robert E.

BACKGROUND: Professional identity of nurses is not static and easily affected by many factors. The COVID‐19 epidemic brings the tremendous physical and psychological challenges for rescue nurses. At present, there is limited data on the influence of rescue experiences on the nurses’ professional identity. METHODS: This study used a face‐to‐face interview with semis‐structured questions to learn about the influence of rescue experiences on the professional identity of nurses. Purposeful sampling was used to collect participants (n=14) and interview data were analyzed following the Colaizzi's phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The ‘impression of exhaustion and fear’, ‘feeling the unfairness’, ‘perceiving incompetence in rescue task’ and ‘unexpected professional benefits’ were the main factors affecting the professional identity of rescue nurses. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that special attention and targeted support measures should be provided to improve the professional identity of rescue nurses k.

Methods We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal relationship between 25OHD concentration and COVID-19, using summary data from the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and using 25OHD concentration-related SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs). Results MR analysis did not show any evidence of a causal association of 25OHD concentration with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity (OR=1.168, 95% CI 0.956-1.427; OR=0.889, 95% CI 0.549-1.439). Sensitivity analyses using different instruments and statistical models yielded similar findings, suggesting the robustness of the causal association. No obvious pleiotropy bias and heterogeneity were observed. Conclusion The MR analysis showed that there might be no linear causal relationship of 25OHD concentration with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","Liu, D.; Tian, Q.; Zhang, J.; Hou, H.; Wang, W.; Meng, Q.; Wang, Y.",,65,6

To minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, understanding the mechanisms of infection from all possible routes of entry is essential. While aerosol transmission is thought to be the primary route of spread, viral particles have been detected in ocular fluid, suggesting that the eye may be a vulnerable point of viral entry. To this end, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 entry factor and antigen expression in post-mortem COVID-19 patient ocular surface tissue and observed productive viral replication in cadaver samples and eye organoid cultures, most notably in limbal regions. Transcriptional analysis of ex vivo infected ocular surface cells and hESC-derived eye cultures revealed robust induction of NF-κB in infected cells as well as diminished type I/III interferon signaling. Together these data suggest that the eye can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and implicate limbus as a portal for viral entry.","Eriksen, Anne Z.; Møller, Rasmus; Makovoz, Bar; Uhl, Skyler A.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Blenkinsop, Timothy A.",Cell Stem Cell,65,1

There has been paucity of data for hospitalized African patients suffering from COVID-19. This study aimed to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients suffering from COVID-19 in Tanzania. METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective, observational cohort study in adult patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographics, clinical pattern, laboratory and radiological investigations associated with increased odds of mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 157 patients, 107 (68.1%) patients survived and 50 (31.8%) died. Mortality was highest in patients suffering with severe (26%) and critical (68%) forms of the disease. The median age of the cohort was 52 years (IQR 42–61), majority of patients were male (86%) and of African origin (46%), who presented with fever (69%), cough (62%) and difficulty in breathing (43%). Factors that were associated with mortality among our cohort were advanced age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.11), being overweight and obese (OR 9.44, 95% CI 2.71–41.0), suffering with severe form of the disease (OR 4.77, 95% CI 1.18–25.0) and being admitted to the HDU and ICU (OR 6.68, 95% CI 2.06–24.6).

This has had reverberating effects on Singapore’s health care system, and has, consequently, also affected medical education all the way from the undergraduate to the postgraduate level. While efforts are underway to contain disease spread and transmission, the authors believe that this is an opportune time to examine and reflect on the impact that medical crises like COVID-19 can have on medical training and education and to evaluate “business continuity plans” to ensure quality medical education even in the face of constant disruptions from pandemic outbreaks. Medical training is as important a mandate as patient care and service.

However, the prevalence and impact of psychological comorbidities were not sufficiently evaluated. The present study examined the prevalence of depression and its associated factors in patients with bronchiectasis. METHODS: This study involved a multicenter cohort of bronchiectasis patients recruited from 33 pulmonary specialist hospitals. The baseline characteristics and bronchiectasis-related factors at enrollment were analyzed. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Of the 810 patients enrolled in the study, 168 (20.7%) patients had relevant depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10), and only 20 (11.9%) patients had a diagnosis of depression. Significant differences were noted in the depressive symptoms with disease severity, which was assessed using the Bronchiectasis Severity Index and E-FACED (all p < 0.001). Depressive symptoms inversely correlated with quality-of-life (r = − 0.704, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with fatigue severity score (r = 0.712, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that depression was significantly associated with the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale ≥ 2 (OR 2.960, 95% CI 1.907–4.588, p = < 0.001) and high number of exacerbations (≥ 3) in the previous year (OR 1.596, 95% CI 1.012–2.482, p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Depression is common, but its association with bronchiectasis was underrecognized. It negatively affected quality-of-life and presented with fatigue symptoms. Among the bronchiectasis-related factors, dyspnea and exacerbation were closely associated with depression. Therefore, active screening for depression is necessary to optimize the treatment of bronchiectasis.

Background : Maharashtra is one of the worst affected states in this pandemic.2 As of 30th September, Maharashtra has in total 1.4 million cases with 38,000 deaths. Objective was to study associations of severity of disease and need for ICU treatment in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective study of clinical course in 800 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and a predictive model of need for ICU treatment. Eight hundred consecutive patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Results: Average age was 41 years, 16% were <20 years of age, 55% were male, 50% were asymptomatic and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Using MoHFW India severity guidelines, 73% patients had mild, 6% moderate and 20% severe disease. Severity was associated with higher age, symptomatic presentation, elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts and elevated inflammatory markers. Seventy-seven patients needed ICU treatment: they were older (56 years), more symptomatic and had lower SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray and deranged hematology and biochemistry at admission. A model trained on the first 500 patients, using above variables predicted need for ICU treatment with sensitivity 80%, specificity 88% in subsequent 300 patients; exclusion of expensive laboratory tests did not affect accuracy. Conclusion: In the early phase of COVID- 19 epidemic, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients were young and asymptomatic. Need for ICU treatment was predicted by simple measures including higher age, symptomatic onset, low SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray.

Most aged individuals develop chronic low-grade inflammation, which is an important risk factor for morbidity, physical and cognitive impairment, frailty, and death. At any age, chronic inflammatory diseases are major causes of morbimortality, affecting up to 5–8% of the population of industrialized countries. Several environmental factors can play an important role for modifying the inflammatory state. Genetics accounts for only a small fraction of chronic-inflammatory diseases, whereas environmental factors appear to participate, either with a causative or a promotional role in 50% to 75% of patients. Several of those changes depend on epigenetic changes that will further modify the individual response to additional stimuli. The interaction between inflammation and the environment offers important insights on aging and health. These conditions, often depending on the individual’s sex, appear to lead to decreased longevity and physical and cognitive decline. In addition to biological factors, the environment is also involved in the generation of psychological and social context leading to stress. Poor psychological environments and other sources of stress also result in increased inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of environmental and psychosocial factors and nutrition on the regulation of inflammation, and how the response elicited for those factors interact among them, are poorly understood. Whereas certain deleterious environmental factors result in the generation of oxidative stress driven by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation, other factors, including nutrition (polyunsaturated fatty acids) and behavioral factors (exercise) confer protection against inflammation, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and thus ameliorate their deleterious effect. Here, we discuss processes and mechanisms of inflammation associated with environmental factors and behavior, their links to sex and gender, and their overall impact on aging.","Bachmann, María Consuelo; Bellalta, Sofía; Basoalto, Roque; Gómez-Valenzuela, Fernán; Jalil, Yorschua; Lépez, Macarena; Matamoros, Anibal; von Bernhardi, Rommy",Front Immunol,65,20
